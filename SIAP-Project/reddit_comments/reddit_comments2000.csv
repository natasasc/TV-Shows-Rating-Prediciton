WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"I dislike what they did to Eric - they made him into a complete idiot. 

I also dislike they wrote Angelia out the episode before series finale. 

Those are two things that tarnish the show for me."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Fun story, the first episode I ever saw was actually the final 10 minutes of the finale. About 10 years ago, I was just flipping through channels and came across it. It seemed interesting, and luckily for me, the very next episode the channel aired was the first episode. 

Ended up watching it all over the course of the next few months, and I loved seeing the journey. It felt like a very true-to-real albeit goofy coming of age show."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"I wasn't a big fan with what they did with the finale personally. I didn't like that Angela got written off an episode prior but at least she got an entire new episode as a goodbye. The actual finale was at least half a clip show with the one nice moment at the end.

And while that moment was nice, there were plenty of similarly nice moments with the kids and Feeny in the rest of the series. There was the scene where Shawn sticks up for Feeny in their junior years when kids trash his house and nearly drive him to retirement. There was the time when Eric got into college (when he was still an actual character)."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"One of my favorite shows of all time.

I'm loving reliving it through the new podcast with Danielle, Rider and Will."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,The final scene for sure cant be beat.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,Grew up on the show and it is one of my favorites. I still do a rewatch every few years. Ending was a nice wrap up.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Pod Meets World started a few months back, cant recommend it enough if you want to hear old stories on the show. Lots of old TV Casts are doing these ""lets rewatch our old show and recap"" podcasts, but i really think PMW is the best one yet."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"For those that haven't watched it:

While it's aimed at a younger demographic and rife with fan service, Girl Meets World brings back a LOT of characters from Boy Meets World. There is a lot of closure provided too, among several of those characters. The finale wasn't as good as BMW's, but I still felt like it stuck the landing."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,Cory was an unlikable whiny little worm of a character.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,Yeh this is one of those shows that I’ll show to my kids and hope they’ll like it.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,Wasn't the finale a clip show? That's a very lazy way to end a series. The final scene is iconic of course.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"OP never saw ""Six Feet Under"", and it shows.
:)"
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"I watched it so many years ago that I barely remember the finale, maybe am due a rewatch

But I remember the finale of Girl Meets World, I liked it."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Not my era but José did a great retrospective 

https://youtu.be/PX_fkmJAG7E"
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Both The Wonder Years and BMW are like the Catcher in the Rye of TV. 

The continuity was almost non-existent in Boy. It fixed problems in 22 minutes. The college years were bad.  

It is what it is."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Mr. Turner just disappearing off the face of the earth also is a pretty low point for me. 

I don't know if there were behind the scenes reasons for the departure, but it is such a whiplash to see his accident and how emotional Shawn is over it to just never be shown again.

They do make a joke about it when Minkus shows up and says that he and Mr. Turner are just on the other side of the school and points off set.

I felt those middle seasons where the peak. The kids were old enough to have some real drama and they didn't get go overboard on some of the characters like Eric yet."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"What really gets me is the way they retcon Corey & Topanga's relationship like the were in love since kindergarten.  She starts off as a ""freak"" that he wants nothing to do with.  I'm pretty sure he ends up cheating on her even when they do get together.  Boy Meets World last couple seasons is the epitome of unearned ""tell, don't show"" storytelling.  Bummer too because that first season is full of heart.  Watching Eric's stupidity as a kid was great, watching him morph in to that as an adult was tragic."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Idiotic and mildly psychotic too, haha. It was kinda strange, but at the same time, Cory wasn't a huge source of humor, nor was Shawn. So, I can see why the writers thought it was a viable direction for Eric. Eric was pretty one-dimensional and boring early on."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Reminds me of Stargate SG-1. I had been watching loose episodes here and there since 1997 but I never sat down to watch a full episode until like 2011. The episode was really good and it went above and beyond to make me want to watch more, so I could see what happens next.

Turns out, it was the last Episode of Season 10, which was created in such a way that was meant to continue in Season 11... but then they cancelled the show.

I had binged the first 8 and half seasons before I had figured that one out."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,This is why I love reddit. I didn't even know they had a podcast. I'm subscribing right now lol.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,Yeah same with Ross and ted mosby
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,It's had a few very brief flashbacks but isn't really a clip show.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,">  I'm pretty sure he ends up cheating on her even when they do get together.

Yeah, he spends all night talking to a girl at the ski lodge (Lauren?) and then kisses her.  He and Topanga fight about it, and then she says that he should date her.  So he does, he hates it, and tries to go back to Topanga.  Then she breaks up with him (rightfully so), because she didn't need to date someone else to remember that she loved him.

They spend, what feels like, an entire season getting back together.

I'll be honest, it's a great couple of episodes, but it's way out of character for Corey.  He's just not the cheating type.  The whole thing just felt super forced."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"I kinda disagree that they retconned the cory/topanga relationship. To me a retcon would mean they pretend all that stuff never happened, and moved on. Boy meets world didnt do that. Yes, in 6th grade, he thought she was weird. But they do explain why he thought that way (cause Eric called girls icky and embarrassed cory. If cory has a defining character trait, its that he hates the idea that he could be average or even dorky. So Shawn and Eric making fun of topanga is more than enough to sway Cory at that age) and that he didnt think that both before and after that period. And honestly, in 6th grade he was clearly fronting a bit. In topanga's first episode, she kissed him and he gave her his hat. Later in the season he would go on a date with her. They also call back to her weirdness on multiple occasions through boy and girl"
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,I agree and they sprinkled in some episodes where Eric was not a total dumbass here and there. Im glad they made his character not a total joke in girl meets world.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,The retcon confuses me especially since I started watching HS episodes first
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Have you read the theory about why Eric turned into an idiot?

WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Haha, awesome!

Pod Meets World"
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Having recently watched the series again, it’s more than just brief flashbacks. There are montages of moments between every set of characters with major relationships."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"I just went back to Disney Plus and skimmed through the two-part finale. The first part is almost all clip show, and the second is about 50% clip show. So it's definitely more than very brief."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"In the first season however Topanga didn't know who Eric was. She got a crush on him when he spoke to their class and was surprised he was Cory's brother.

If Cory and Topanga were that close as childhood friends, she would know who his brother is. And same on Cory's side. He didn't know she had an older sister."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,I haven't seen it in years. I guess I misremembered. I thought most of th esecond half was new footage. Oh well.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"I got the impression what they were doing was more of the subtle way one re-writes their own memories, something everyone apparently does without realising, in subtle ways every time one recalls something."
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"ehh, minor details. I'm not saying the plan from her first appearance was this story. You don't have to know where youre going in a show from the word go. I'm saying they wove together what happened in 6th grade and what happened moving forward in a way that worked.

Nebula is kinda my point. If you retcon something, to me it means you pretend it never happened. they never talk about nebula again, she doesnt come to visit ever, not in girl meets world, she's just gone like she never existed. that's a retcon.

But other than minor details, they never had to pretend what happened in 6th grade never happened. They call back to those times any time they need to explain the story, or when topanga needs to find a way of thinking she fell away from. Those times existed, they didnt just disappear"
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"It was less of a clip show than I remembered and more of a clip show than you remembered, so we were both mistaken! Cheers!"

WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"The Good Place. I told my wife the other day that it's not only my favorite show currently on TV, but it's quickly entering the pantheon of my favorite TV shows ever."

WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Rick and Morty will be remembered with the likes of Futurama and The Simpsons (well that one will never be over).

Otherwise I agree with many on the thread already : The Expanse for SF, Barry, Mr Robot (probably the best of all but it won't be as popular as Breaking Bad, I imagine it will be a The Wire, The Shield situation), maybe Westworld (have to see it how it continues)"
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Better Call Saul is definitely up there. It's probably an unpopular opinion, but I think it's on the way to be better than Breaking Bad."

WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,The last kingdom. Outside of the first couple of episodes of s1 has been fantastic. Still alot more  material to adapt from the books but each seasons quality has improved  from the last. Its my favourite show not yet finished.
WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Mr. Robot, once it’s available on Netflix. Stunning how few people watch a critically acclaimed show. It’s a masterpiece, and I look forward to the day that that more people catch on and get to enjoy the wild ride. 

Bojack, Watchmen on the list too."

WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,If Westworld somehow matched the brilliance of the first season for season 3 and beyond I could definitely see it being one of the best.

For shows of the decade, the aforementioned Fargo, This Is Us.

WorldEnd: What are you doing at the end of the world? Are you busy? Will you save us?,"Absent some abrupt changes in technological trends, I don't think current or future TV shows will become part of some classic canon. Audiences have become so small that no show will be familiar to everyone, and it will be hard to deliver a sense of what's classic to everyone.  I think the closest analogue to today's TV is probably book series of the past.  Some have ups and downs, especially if a movie version comes out, but they're usually most popular when they first come out.  As small as audiences are today, after a couple generations the shows will be known only by tiny niche audiences."

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,“24 with Jack Bauer” should be the name of the show
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Does reality TV count? The Salt Lake City variant of the Real Housewives franchise has some flashes of Jon Waters level camp brilliance. These ladies are batshit and also federal criminals.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,How to Get Away with Murder is one of the best for this. Not many shows get close to this. Pure soap opera
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Suits. Watched it until season 3 in highscool. Just picked it back up and I'm into season 6, such tasty tasty garbage."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Eastenders, Coronation Street. Basically the uk soaps are top drawer in a terrible sort of way"
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Law and Order: SVU. It's an alternate reality fantasy show set in a world where cops are competent and compassionate and the bad guys almost always get caught and sent to jail. Plus, Ice T is in it."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Oh man, I loved watching 24 just to see what crazy stuff the writers would come up with to try and top themselves.  Any other show I would have stopped watching, but for some reason with 24 I just said ""Come at me, show!  You can't go dumb enough to make me quit!"", and it was a riot.

The show ran 8 seasons (Edit: actually 8.5 seasons) and had 9 presidents.  That alone is freaking bananas.

Also, they needed a spin-off show that was just Chloe tasing people who annoyed her."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"I've watched Hallmark movies because I know it'll be good and wholesome. Nothing bad will happen and everyone gets a happy ending. Even the ""bad guy"". Pure veg out and relax stuff."

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"It’s Chuck for me

Every episode is more or less the same. Bad guys in Burbank, Chuck flashes, Morgan does something dumb and/or creepy, Casey and Sarah go on a mission to stop the bad guy, mission goes sideways and Chuck lucks his way into saving the day.

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Some of Jacks days were better than others. But you got to admit that show had every major actor of the early 2000s. It’s still watchable. If for nothing but Kim Bauer
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,9:11 Lone Star. Cheesy acting and plotlines and dialogue with no subtlety but I love seeing what kind of accidents or natural disasters they’ll come up with and how its filmed/produced.

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Married With Children.

It's so sexist, stereotypical, but how they as a family are total losers somehow makes it all alright.

I like how surreal it is and that's very rare in live action sitcoms that survive.  That only usually works on shows like the simpsons 

And in the end, I still don't know why, I end up empathizing with every main character on the show."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Manifest 

pretty sure it was written to capture the Qanon audience but goddamn if Ben Stone is not one of the most amazingly ridiculous and over the top characters in TV, follow your callings people"
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Season 5 was peak 24, and honestly was a good season of television. 

That said, [Scalia did use the show as defense for using torture](https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2007/06/scalia-and-torture/227548/)"
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Criminal Minds. It gets dumber and dumber. They catch 100 serial killers a year in the act and the assistant directors all still want to shut the program down. Rossi got back together with all of his ex-wives throughout the series.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"I don't think 24 as a whole deserves the label ""so bad it's good"". I'll admit for some of the later seasons, the writing isn't as strong and does get insane to the point where it becomes a little silly. But for the most part, the show is so intense and serious that I'm gripped by what's happening without feeling like it's campy.

Jack Bauer isn't some quippy action hero who's always doing the right thing and gets a happy ending, he's a no-nonsense tragic figure who's forced to do terrible things which causes him to suffer more loss than any character on TV. 

And while supporting characters definitely don't get the same treatment as Jack in terms of character building, there are some with pretty engaging storylines. Namely Tony, Chloe, Renee, Bill, etc"

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Yellowstone.  It started off great but with the ridiculous plot armor that all of the main characters have being able to survive everything from being exploded to shot 100 times, the cheesy one liners, the cowboy montages set to up-beat country music, and the writing make this show a train wreck my wife and I can’t turn away from."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"24 may be the greatest binge watch series yet. Watched the first couple during the lockdown and it easily killed time. The opening couple of hours where he killed the suspect and cut his head off, all in the offices of The Company were such an attention grabber you couldn't help but be invested."

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"24 was my first real TV love. Then Lost came along and changed everything, but 24 is epic entertainment. Season 5 is it's grand magnum opus. In no way would I ever call 24 ""so bad it's good"". Bad take. ""DAMMIT!"""
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Van Helsing was fun up until the last season where the rubbish teeny actresses couldn’t carry the show but up until then it was very enjoyable.  I’m trying to watch s3 of Jack Ryan and it made me realise how crazy it was that 24 could remain entertaining for 24 whole episodes while I’m struggling with Jack Ryan after 3 episodes.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Most episodes cause my brain to shut down within minutes and just go with the flow. It's so bad that it is meditative.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"I'm rewatching Elementary with my partner right now. Almost always the same show with a slight twist. We like it though.

The other one we enjoyed for the same reasons was Scorpion....always the same drawn out storylines with multiple obstacles to battle along the way with huge sakes and they never fail."

Wow, it was awful, with dodgy scenery wobbling, questionable acting and complete with a really cheesy theme tune. And yet it was immensely watchable, gained a cult following and was required after-pub viewing."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Scorpion is absolutely dumb as hell & every episode follows the exact same formula. 45 minutes to shut my brain down plus the “comfort” of knowing more or less what’s going to happen, but still with enough excitement to maintain interest, makes it peak background noise or a go-to easy watch."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Most people around aren't old enough, or have forgotten ""24"" made binge watching a thing. People rented past season DVD's and watched the whole season 3-4 episodes at a time to get the most out of this show. It was kind of groundbreaking."

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,The Chicago franchise. Typical Dick Wolf level acting and melodrama but it got mad addictive
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Burn Notice.  When I initially watched I was excited to see how the Michael plot would eventually play out but it's like that gif of the truck about to crash that never does; you just never get to the end of his story.  So with that out of the way it becomes another TV show about vigilantes that's pretty repetitive but still has some surprises.  The overall plot is just so stupid but once you get past thats it's just a good action show.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Burn Notice. It’s just so unbelievably bad, but I love me some Bruce Campbell!"
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Chicago Fire
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"24 was that show for a while. After there was another mole on CTU, I tapped out. They were out of ideas. Arrow, The flash were both until they became unwatchable."

Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"Burn Notice. Horribly written plot, trope-filled video Valium. Great characters with good interaction and fun dialog. I've watched the entire series afew times."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,Burn Notice. So cheesy but so much fun. Bonus points if the episode teaches you how to make c4 out of toothpaste and cat litter or whatever.
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"""So bad its good""

its not a bad show, i dont get reddits obsession with saying ""its so bad its good"" on everything that isnt some emmy winning masterpiece (24 won best drama in season 5 by the way). 

yall have never seen real bad movies or shows have you."
Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?,"I scrolled a good ways without seeing it, but I'm gonna add Vampire Diaries.

Every episode is the same and House never grows he's always the devil with a heart of gold. Selfish, arrogant, brilliant, and despite his worst efforts always takes the right hand path at the end of an episode.

Fate/Apocrypha,After seeing how Netflix treated Little Witch Academia... not enthusiastic about any of their future anime endeavors.
Fate/Apocrypha,"I haven't seen this yet, but I'm hoping this is good. *Fate/Zero* is the only great anime adaptation of the *Fate* franchise."
Fate/Apocrypha,"Looks like a generic anime all right. Fate/Zero is the only good anime from this franchise, F/SN was already a big disappointment"
Fate/Apocrypha,Is it unlimited budget this time? I saw UBW but this trailer tells me nothing about the show and it looks... shit.
Fate/Apocrypha,"I don´t know why Fate/ fans complain and hate the that Netflix picked up this show, when most of them qualify the series as bad or mediocre. It makes sense if the series doesn´t receive more popularity then. I´ll probably be downvoted for this."
Fate/Apocrypha,That sure is anime..
Fate/Apocrypha,"It's too much work to watch anime with subtitles. I just want to sit back and enjoy the artwork, not worry about genuine voice work. I would watch this, and other anime Netflix has, if they all had English dubs instead of subtitles, which seems to happen more often nowadays."
Fate/Apocrypha,"Don't be enthusiastic, their doing the same thing they did to LWA and putting it up in two cours.

Also Kakegurui isn't getting on till 2018.

It's like NEtflix just ignored all the complaints about how shows aren't being similcasted and people don't want to wait almost a year for a show like they did in the early 2000's.

It shocks me that Netflix of all streaming sites would be tonedeaf to the standard of the industry they seem so keen on entering, Simulcasting of anime has been a staple for basically the last decade yet they refuse to do it."
Fate/Apocrypha,Castlevania was great...just pointlessly short
Fate/Apocrypha,"Castlevania was great...just pointlessly short

The plot is about to start aaannddd season's over"
Fate/Apocrypha,"I didn't realize that F/SN UBW was received negatively before reading this comment thread, I quite enjoyed it in it's entirety ( although less than I did Zero ). To each their own"
Fate/Apocrypha,"Imo, it's not good. I've seen 3 episodes, and the fights are badly animated and the story is confusing and boring. I'm not even a fan of the series (Fate/Zero is great) but I've seen fans say that Apocrypha is the worst one.

If anyone reading this is unaware of the Fate series, go watch Fate/Zero and then decide if you want to get more into the other stuff."
Fate/Apocrypha,Fate/Stay was my favorite and Fate/Zero took some time for me to get into. I watched like 5 episodes before I got into it. Wouldn't be shocked if this newer one is the same.
Fate/Apocrypha,"I like it a lot so far, I've seen the first 3 episodes. The art is very baeautiful but so far fate zero has better animation and calegraphy during fights. It seems this fate series is more into shooting laser beams. The characters are much more anime and cute. That might be good or bad depending on your taste. "
Fate/Apocrypha,"Visuals are by A1 pictures so it's going to look like any average anime. Audio for things such as weapon clashes, explosions, etc are ripped straight from UBW. The characters are bland and the story is mediocre at best. It's your call though."
Fate/Apocrypha,"They're massively delaying the release of all their anime so they can get around to dubbing it first, so you should be fine."
Fate/Apocrypha,"I never understood this position. Then again, reading subtitles is almost second nature to me after watching anime and foreign films for years now. 

Besides, I think it's more about which language fits a show better, and for anime that's usually Japanese (although there are some anime like *Cowboy Bebop* and *Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood* that I prefer watching the English dub)."
Fate/Apocrypha,They will.
Fate/Apocrypha,"It's so much more than that. Yeah, fucking up the simulcasting is absolutely retarded, but the shit tier quality of their subs, some of the worst dub actors in the industry and the horrible file quality of their uploads is ridiculous. Under no circumstance should fansubs have better file quality *and* better subs. It is the only area of Netflix's business where they are just fundamentally incompetent."
Fate/Apocrypha,Castlevania isn't an anime.
Fate/Apocrypha,"On its own its an enjoyable but medicore anime with flashy fight scenes, compared to F/Z its pretty disappointing. Expected a lot more."
Fate/Apocrypha,"*Fate/Zero* is easily the best of the *Fate* anime and the only one worth watching in full. 

*Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works* is little more than average - I'd recommend just watching some of the coolest fight scenes from the show on YouTube rather than watching the series in its entirety."
Fate/Apocrypha,"first 3 episodes of fate/zero hardly has fights , i suggest you to watch the complete series"
Fate/Apocrypha,I feel like it's just coming into it's own. to be honest anime (just about any anime) doesn't really become what it's supposed to until after episode 10
Fate/Apocrypha,"There's essentially twice as many characters to keep track of than in Zero/Stay Night, so it makes sense that the first couple episodes are heavy on exposition, and thus boring and confusing.

Though as someone who didn't read the manga, I do hear from /r/anime that the new MC/Ruler are essentially just gonna become Shirou/Saber 2.0, who both were essentially the worst aspects of Stay Night, which makes me skeptical of the story going forward.

And there haven't been any major fight scences in the sub yet, so I'm willing to withhold judgment on the animation until then."
Fate/Apocrypha,Ah okay. So it's shit. Gotcha. UBW wasn't even that good. Just stayed for the amazing animation.
Fate/Apocrypha,"It's just entertainment to me and I want to sit back, relax, and not have to work. I also like to be able to go to the kitchen and still be able to follow the story without having to stare at the screen. Finally, it wears my eyes out, trying to read the text and see the artwork at the same time. Switching focus is tiring.

I don't think anything of it when people want to watch it with subtitles, it's no skin off my back, I would just like the option of being able to use dubs as well."
Fate/Apocrypha,"I love dubbing, I love to learn about the industry.

But LA dubbing is so bad compared to Texas dubbing in my opinion. The Funimation casts from Texas are so much more into their job, not hampered by union bullshit and simuldubs keep them constantly working.

LA has a serious issue with a small talent pool, uninspired casting and acting and just...not being as quality as what Funimation is doing. LA actors somehow always sound better in Funimation dubs too.

With Sony Pictures buying Funi I'm seriously concerned that dubbing may take a serious hit soon."
Fate/Apocrypha,This sums up how I feel about *Unlimited Blade Works* perfectly.
Fate/Apocrypha,"Eh it's fine. It's a bit more trope-y than zero, and is also at least partially a romance, so that can turn you off if conventional anime romances aren't your thing (and for a lot of people, they aren't)"
Fate/Apocrypha,"F/SN UBW seemed like a generic battle shounen with an annoying protagonist and tropey anime characters. The only good part were the fight scenes.

Seemed like it just dumped all the depth of F/Z"
Fate/Apocrypha,"I think you misread what I wrote, I said I liked Fate/Zero, and that Fate/Apocrapha had badly animated fights.

What I noticed was that the characters moved really fast on screen with a lot of cuts, giving a sense of action happening, but so you can't really follow whats going on.

Granted no major fights has really happened, but it gives me a bad impression of A1 Pictures, who is kinda known for doing stuff like this."
Fate/Apocrypha,"If I remember correctly, Fate/Zero first episode was like an hour long and was filled with exposition, however I was completely invested in the story.

I think the difference is that the exposition in Zero was there to explain how the world works and how this war is gonna go down, while also introducing us to a group of interesting characters and their motives. This was interesting to me. 

In Apocraphya, I already know how the world works, and sure the cast is twice as large, but the characters are half as interesting. I think the only one that grabs my attention is the Homunculus guy in episode 2."
Fate/Apocrypha,"I guess I'm so used to subtitles that I never have to consciously 'switch focus', as you put it; I see what's happening on screen as well as the subtitles almost simultaneously. Maybe reading speed has something to do with it as well, because I can read pretty fast."
Fate/Apocrypha,"F/Z was actually great so just an average/""fine"" anime as sequel (I know F/Z is the prequel but for anime fans this is the sequel) is really not enough.

If UBW didnt have a big budget it would have been long forgotten, thats the only appeal. Apart from that its a generic shounen with an annoying naive protagonist, ""waifu"" type characters, bs power ups etc."
Fate/Apocrypha,To be fair the way the grail war functions is much different this time. I honestly find the red vs black side to be an intriguing part of the story. The black faction team honestly seems like the team with more moral individuals despite the fact that they are vaporizing homunculus and have Vlad the impale as the leader. 
Fate/Apocrypha,"Yeah I understand that. Literally half the fanbase exists solely because Tohsaka Rin was ""best girl"". Like I said, a much more trope-y anime."
Fate/Apocrypha,[deleted]
Fate/Apocrypha,"Never read the Visual Novel so I can only comment on the anime. And I dont think it should be necessary to read the source material to ""get"" it.

Fate/Apocrypha,No.
Fate/Apocrypha,The New Legends of Monkey (Netflix)
Fate/Apocrypha,"I get Penny Dreadful vibes from this, with the mishmash of mythology/literature and stuff. A lighter, comedic version, anyway. You haven’t given much else to go on here, but I don’t know. I’ll try anything once."
Grimoire of Zero,Sounds good! Not a huge fan of tennis but I love a good sports doc
Grimoire of Zero,Just cancel it now.
Grimoire of Zero,"Being that this is reddit,  it'll prolly get renewed."
Grimoire of Zero,They both need to be expensive to work.
Grimoire of Zero,"These need to be treated as super high budget flagship shows for them to work. 

I really hope Sony let the studios keep some creative control the same way The last of us is being handled. 


Also curious if they just follow the games or do something else in the universe. Casting Aloy and Kratos is going to be fun"
Grimoire of Zero,"I find it interesting that Sony is spreading their IP everywhere instead of doing one mega deal. Probably a very smart move


HBO got last of us
Netflix gets horizon 
Amazon gets God of war

I wonder if grand tourismo will go to someone else as well"
Grimoire of Zero,"I wonder if God of War will be Greek, Norse or do something new."
Grimoire of Zero,Not so bold prediction: the actress playing Aloy will have one of the worst wigs you’ve ever seen.
Grimoire of Zero,"HBO is really smart. They always pick the good shows to adapt. 

I think TLOU will be expensive as fuck to make, but at least it has a kick-ass banger story full of emotional beats that can almost make a person go crazy. Plus AMC managed to make 10+ seasons out of a watered-down story in a similar genre.

GOW is full-on fantasy. There's barely any regular humans in it. Unless they are going to take a massive creative license with it, it's probably going to fall flat, whilst being fucking expensive still.

HZD, while a human story, is way out there. Futuristic machines and AI and shit. It would take ungodly levels of screenwriting, producing, and directing to make up for all the short-comings the story will have because the budget for such a show will never be big enough to make it as interesting as the game.

Guys, there's a reason these stories are made into games. Its because that is the perfect medium for them. Not everything can be/should be adapted for TV."
Grimoire of Zero,"for the love of god, stop it. I like Netflix, I want it to survive. Stop making these things.

1. Horizon is mostly about isolation and heavily centered around a protagonist alone in the wilderness. There is no room for a big cast of characters or a lot of dialogue.
 
2. The setting is robot dinosaurs and sweeping outdoor locations. That is prohibitively expensive. You will either have a massive budget or you will have to cut corners. or a worse option, change the premise so it's mostly people hanging around the town talking. 
3. We already know the plot, so unless you make major changes (like Halo) it's not going to be surprising. 

So either Netflix makes an extremely expensive TV show with mediocre payoff (which they need to stop doing) or they water down the premise to the point of being a different thing. 

I would bet on an ensemble cast of characters in Aloy's hometown, a lot of discussions about survival and politics, and a robot once per episode at most. Maybe at the end of the first season, she ventures out into the wilderness."
Grimoire of Zero,"I love HZD and at its core there's a cool sci-fi story there but I don't know how much I'll enjoy the robot dinosaurs aspect in live action. 

God of War could be amazing but that's a big, expensive project. Especially for TV. 

I love making stuff live-action (when it works) but 'Arcane' really proved to me 98% of the time the best possible results come from the team who made the game(s) helping make the show and the show being animated. Too often the transition to live action results in the hiring of your typical Hollywood writers, showrunners and directors who have their own ""take"" which result in projects like 'Halo' and 'The Witcher'. Deformed and soulless versions of the source material that barely even attempt to stick to it or at least the heart and soul of it. It's depressing.

If GoW was announced as an animated series following the path 'Arcane' laid out and is being developed by the team who made God of War 4 (lead by Cory Barlog) then I'd be ecstatic. Yes maybe they mess it up with their lack of experience in the medium but I'd rather have people taking their lumps making the project who actually know it inside and out than a team whose production runs smoothly but the result is ... well, 'Halo' or 'The Witcher'. This applies to live-action as well. If 'Arcane' is how you do it animated, than the path has been laid by 'The Expanse' as to how you adapt from one source material to TV in live action. Get the team who wrote, world built and make decisions for the games and team them up with talented and qualified TV writers room and showrunner."
Grimoire of Zero,I suspect I know who'll get the role of Silens
Grimoire of Zero,"How many times does this keep getting posted and deleted?

Why is it getting deleted?"
Grimoire of Zero,"The problem with any show in Horizon's world is that the machines aren't supposed to be a rare or special encounter, they've completely spread out over the world. So to accurately represent how common they are would probably be ridiculously expensive to make it not look like shit."
Grimoire of Zero,I sure hope they get writers who have only done boomer procedurals. Scifi/fantasy experience not required
Grimoire of Zero,And both of them will be pure garbage
Grimoire of Zero,"I mean as much as I want to see an horizon zero dawn show netflix doing it doesn't fill me with confidence. 

Although who thinks the ginger chick from game of thrones would pull off an awesome aloy."
Grimoire of Zero,Ugh Netflix is terrible at shows like this.  I hate what they did with the Witcher
Grimoire of Zero,They’re going to fuck it up. I guarantee it.
Grimoire of Zero,Let's see how much they'll suck...especially the God of War one.
Grimoire of Zero,Thank god Amazon didn’t get HZD too
Grimoire of Zero,"Finally Netflix is going to make a series where inclusivity is in by design rather than shoe horned in. That's the one thing I loved about the HZD series.

It 100% makes sense to have literally all the ethnic variations in a single place because they're Alll ((SPOILER)) clones descended from varied gene pools. It's genius.

Not like cough cough wheel of time where a single town has all the varied ethnic origins for people and no mixing, in a small village nobody ever travels away from lol."
Grimoire of Zero,"Just remember: Don't get too hooked on the Horizon show, because apparently if it doesn't get GoT numbers, Netflix will cancel it after one season..."
Grimoire of Zero,"What is with this obsession with video game IPs.

It's not that it can't be done, but the bar and expectations are so high that it has to be damn near a master piece for people to respect it.

Halo is a good example. Perfectly watchable, but the gaming community doesn't want any piece of it because expectations are too damn high.

Also, when you strip out the gameplay, how really good are the stories in these games? Most game stories are very forgettable."
Grimoire of Zero,Maybe just maybe they actually play and base the show around the game this time…. Looking at you halo!
Grimoire of Zero,Red headed lead?  Prepare for the inevitable casting of Beyonce as Aloy.
Grimoire of Zero,"Sony's Jim Ryan confirmed both shows, along with a Grand Turismo series (no distributer yet)."
Grimoire of Zero,"I know the horizon games are big hits (more 20m units sold by game 1) but I don't see the games having seeped into pop culture as much as gow or tlou have. I bet if they make a show, horizon just won't catch enough eyeballs."
Grimoire of Zero,Rose Leslie as Aloy
Grimoire of Zero,"thank god Netflix didn’t get their hands on GOW, but that's to be expected since it has a white male as a protag lol"
Grimoire of Zero,[deleted]
Grimoire of Zero,"After Paramount Halo, I don’t want to see any game adaptations for a long time."
Grimoire of Zero,"Calling it now, Aloy will be race-swapped."
Grimoire of Zero,Halo-level story/character loyalty inbound
Grimoire of Zero,Horizon sucks
Grimoire of Zero,I'm very disappointed in this thread. I came in expecting to check 'No one asked for this' off my bingo card and but there wasn't any comment like that.
Grimoire of Zero,"The problem with Netflix is if it is meh they will cancel it and if it is good they will cancel it.

The problem with Amazon is that they can create a fantastic series e.g. The Tick and then cancel it for the next year's hot project *cough cough the boys*

The problem with hbo is they would probably destroy the original story with inserted sex scenes. e.g Genlock

Get me Bryce Dallas Howard, Laeta Kalogridis, John Faverau, the people who did the costumes for Apple TVs See and the film Oblivion."
Grimoire of Zero,"as always, all I can say is ... pls don't suck"
Grimoire of Zero,"They both translate really well to the medium IMO. HZD is beautiful but would benefit from the tightening up TV would require, and God of War is essentially already a complete storyboard."
Grimoire of Zero,"Oh god, not Netflix for HZD."
Grimoire of Zero,*obligatory joke about this getting canceled after 1 season.*
Grimoire of Zero,"I'm tired of stories that work best in one medium being forcibly adapted to other mediums.

It's also likely that the people making these shows have no respect for the actual game. See Halo."
Grimoire of Zero,"I have more faith in God Of War because Amazon’s stuff is more consistently good. 

The Boys, Reacher, Invincible, God Of War, Blade Runner

Amazon’s slate of shows is looking extremely good."
Grimoire of Zero,Both series are fuckin fantastic games and I cannot wait for both studios to completely fuck up
Grimoire of Zero,"Don't worry Netflix will do one season, leave it on a cliff hanger and then cancel it"
Grimoire of Zero,"I want a person of color cast as Aloy. If they cast a white girl, I’m not interested."
Grimoire of Zero,"So … is Aloy going to fuck one of the robot dinosaurs?

That seems to be the “in thing” among video game adapatations these days."
Grimoire of Zero,"I once jokingly said Nintendo should start its own streaming service and pair it with Switch Online (while presumably offering it as a standalone as well for people who'd want to watch a live-action Zelda or a Xenoblade anime who DON'T already have Switch Online). The more that TV series of video games get made or announced (Halo, Last of Us, these Sony things, Fallout, reports that Netflix will do a Pokemon live-action show thanks to it being 2nd Party, etc.), the more I wonder if maybe one day it won't be a joke."
Grimoire of Zero,"Oh boy, even ingame, the armor designs for characters are pretty goofy... I can't imagine it translating well to live action at all."
Grimoire of Zero,HIRE CHRISTOPHER JUDGE! I DONT CARE ABOUT VISUAL ACCURACY!
Grimoire of Zero,"I fear disappointment, tho I am excited to know this is happening"
Grimoire of Zero,Yeah I’m not getting my hopes up.
Grimoire of Zero,am i the only one who thinks cinematic games being turned into cinema is pointless?
Grimoire of Zero,"Wild casting guesses - one of the main OBX gals as Aloy feels like what the algorithm will decide, Reddick back, Gerald Butler about to do his first premium tv show as Krat300s"
Grimoire of Zero,"Cool, but also this is going to be at least 5 years way I assume so I'm not going to hype myself up yet"
Grimoire of Zero,Well bummer
Grimoire of Zero,"bro the games story is good enough, they really dont need to make a horizon game, the game itself is so fucking cinematically good.

&#x200B;

They could not POSSIBLY make anything that is as good."
Grimoire of Zero,They're gonna be shit
Grimoire of Zero,A Gran Turismo show is the funniest. Quick someone snap up the Microsoft Flight Simulator IP next!
Grimoire of Zero,No.
Grimoire of Zero,Wait...are they going to use Christopher Judge? That would be awesome.
Grimoire of Zero,I don't think you can do Horizon justice on a Netflix budget. You'll need the machines to look great and there need to be a lot of them.
Grimoire of Zero,Can they stop making giant flops out of videogame adaptions please?  I have no faith in this.
Grimoire of Zero,I hate this.  Please stop trying to make video games into tv series.  They almost all tend to be as bad movie tie-in games.
Grimoire of Zero,"I really want God of War to be like the original games. 

One god per episode, each a dogged pursuit, no long interweaving plots, very little dialogue, mostly silent Kratos. Just death and wild destruction and revenge, one Olympian at a time.

If it has a bunch of dialogue and side characters and plotlines, it will suck.  And old Kratos can only be a narrator at most. Bring back the purity of mad violence that lit the mountain of the gods aflame.

Vengeance is the plot, the Blades of Chaos the stars, and Kratos the furiously beating heart of the story that drives them."
Grimoire of Zero,Netflix and Horizon. So cardi B as Aloy?
Grimoire of Zero,"Pretty much, especially Horizon is as fantastical as Avatar.

Therefore, my expectations are about as high as they would be for an Avatar tv show (that is not helmed by anyone like James Cameron)."
Grimoire of Zero,"I think Horizon could be doable on a reasonable budget if you cut between Elisabet and Aloy and told their stories in parallel, with the former being more of a character drama."
Grimoire of Zero,"Don't worry, I'm sure they'll have overinflated budgets yet inexplicably will be handed to some writers/showrunners with almost no notable credits to adapt into whatever they want it to be, which will only have a vague resemblance to the source material.

It's very trendy lately."
Grimoire of Zero,And Lance Reddick needs to reprise his game role from Horizon too!
Grimoire of Zero,"The advancements in LED panels will make a lot of these shows a lot more manageable, but yeah."
Grimoire of Zero,"Ideally, I'd like to see it done in an anime-esque style similar to Castlevania."
Grimoire of Zero,"I flat out don't see how either of these could stack up to the games tbh. At all. If it's not 1:1 then it's gonna be heavily criticized. Kratos is a very specific character to play as and anything outside of his expected tone is gonna be highlighted immediately as ""wtf Kratos would never do that"". Look at the Halo show. 

And if it is a 1:1 then it'll simply never hit the mark in every aspect unless you spent an ungodly amount of time and money. The enemies in both series alone are gonna be stupid difficult to make without lookin like a CW show. And at that point you'd be better off just watching the game on a YouTube video edited for just the story. 

This stuff never works cause the medium in which they come from is almost impossible to recreate in another medium. Like anime. There's a reason it's animated. Cause good luck doin anything even remotely similar with live action."
Grimoire of Zero,Or animated
Grimoire of Zero,They both would be better off as a movie.
Grimoire of Zero,Halo was expensive and we all saw how that turned out.
Grimoire of Zero,"Both will get cancelled after a first season. Both require a TON of GOOD SFX and acting. I don't think Amazon or Netflix (specially) has the money or budget to pull them off. 

Of they just fuck them both up and turn them into the Halo TV series."
Grimoire of Zero,Maybe next year?
Grimoire of Zero,"At least if it's live action, yes."
Grimoire of Zero,Wheel of Time was expensive and it did not look like money well spent. Hopefully they're working hard on that stuff.
Grimoire of Zero,"Yep, expect lots of shots of machines in the first episode follow by 5 episodes of human drama. Total shots of machine would be like 30 mins max

Or they will do shit CG and more shots, either way it’s bad. I just don’t trust Netflix with adaptations that require a lot of budget"
Grimoire of Zero,"WoT was expensive and very subpar for all the potential it had and of course we will see how the LotR series works out.

Like with The Last of Us, these are all actually really good premises for a series that takes the material seriously."
Grimoire of Zero,">Also curious if they just follow the games or do something else in the universe. Casting Aloy and Kratos is going to be fun

If they aren't going to follow the games' story, I would be down to watch a Sylens-focused prequel series. Lance Reddick is a well established actor so you wouldn't need to recast him and I don't think he's such a massive star that he'd be crazy expensive to hire."
Grimoire of Zero,They'll be made by Sony's Playstation Productions.
Grimoire of Zero,"> These need to be treated as super high budget flagship shows for them to work.

They should sacrifice all other shows to do justice to these iconic properties these services aren't even worthy of.

/s"
Grimoire of Zero,"Good luck finding someone 6’10 with the body of a lineman whos also an incredible actor for Kratos lmao

Aloy could definitely be rose leslie but thats almost stereotypical"
Grimoire of Zero,*Paramount+*
Grimoire of Zero,"> Probably a very smart move

Gets the PlayStation brand fucking everywhere so that's probably partially why. 

Uncharted covers cinema as well. Wouldn't surprise me if Gran Turismo tries being some classy car drama on Apple TV."
Grimoire of Zero,"It is smart because they're getting all the streamers pay them for the content. Instead of say, $200 million from Netflix for exclusivity they're getting $100 million from them and Amazon. It's the same amount but there's room for more properties."
Grimoire of Zero,Twisted Metal will be released on Peacock.
Grimoire of Zero,"Probably cause a streamer or studio can only do so much. If they did a mega deal, most of their properties would go to waste and sit on the shelf for years."
Grimoire of Zero,I want my Killzone series.
Grimoire of Zero,And columbia pictures made uncharted
Grimoire of Zero,Yeah curious if they start with the Greek saga or just drop us in the Norse side.
Grimoire of Zero,Personally I'd like to see the show cover his trip to and through Egypt and then finally to Scandinavia. A possible second season could be about him settling in Midgard and meeting Faye.
Grimoire of Zero,African most likely
Grimoire of Zero,Egypt would be cool
Grimoire of Zero,Jamaican
Grimoire of Zero,"I'm expecting Archie from Riverdale levels of ""red hair"""
Grimoire of Zero,Hair with a mind of it’s own.
La casa de papel,"It's amazing to see something come to an end these days, and a good one at that!"
La casa de papel,Alvaro Morte has been really good so far as Logain in Wheel of Time.
La casa de papel,"Finish the show yesterday, and you’re right, it was a great and satisfying ending. The show has been a wild ride, all the characters are great, some are better like Berlin, Nairobi and few can be divisive like Tokyo due to her repulsive and reckless nature, but her character arc was improved significantly in s5 v1, even though they killed her off, or Palermo with his some of his actions. We feel and connected with all the characters. 

From start to finish, the show writing quality is what makes it so engaging, the writing are always top notch, manage to keep up with the audience interested and keep us on the edge of our toes. And finally, give us a complete, meaningful and satisfying ending, unlike some US shows where they either got worse as they go on or have some kind of controversial ending. I will miss La Casa De Papel 

Still, I have 1 question about the ending. In the bank, beside the main gang there are also 4 other small supporting characters who are task with extracting and melting the gold in the bank lowest vault. Besides Matías, we don’t see the rest them when the military attacks the bank and captured the main gang, and we don’t see where they ended up at the end. I wonder what happened to them? 😅"
La casa de papel,Wonder why you're being downvoted.
La casa de papel,"Love the show, we have 3 eps left."
La casa de papel,I knew that was El Profesor. But yeah I fell off the Casa de Papel train halfway in S2.
La casa de papel,Died to Ligma.
La casa de papel,Because Redditors can't digest the fact that it's more popular than their favourite shows that got cancelled
La casa de papel,"Because he forgot an /s.  Only the first season is watchable, with the show turning into complete garbage afterwards."
La casa de papel,"wait what? i thought the story is finished, and only berlin series is left."
La casa de papel,Whats Ligma
La casa de papel,The last half of season five just released and was actually well done...
La casa de papel,S1 just felt like a soap opera. I only watched three episodes.
La casa de papel,"speaking from someone who hasn't watched the series, the last season is my favorite of the series."
La casa de papel,"No, I'm saying that I personally still have 3 episodes to watch."
La casa de papel,oh no.
La casa de papel,"Oh my god, anyone that was on the Fence about this show is most definitely watching now. And he's playing Berlin too, I cant wait to see the rest of the cast"
La casa de papel,I understand having different adaptations for network tv but I don’t understand why they are doing this on Netflix which is a global platform?
La casa de papel,"I binged through all 13 episodes in one go and I have to say this show is quite exciting! I’ve been searching reddit the past day to see what people’s thoughts are with no avail, so I’m glad to see this being posted!

Now the question is, when does the second season get released? I’m dying to finish watching!"
La casa de papel,And it's probably the most elaborate heist I've seen on film
La casa de papel,"Yeah, the show is very good, but I haven't finished it yet. I actually want the robbers to succeed just because of the amount of effort that went into preparing for the heist. "
La casa de papel,"It's not a Netflix original though. It was made for Antena 3, a TV channel in Spain. Netflix has probably acquired streaming rights for an international audience."
La casa de papel,damn...thank you for this!  Love heist based stuff...and would never have known about this if it weren't for this post...will need to watch now..
La casa de papel,"It's the best heist related series or movie I have ever seen. Took me a couple episodes to realize the whole series would be around that one heist and I fucking love it. I just love the whole plan and the little twists every time you think now they are fucked. 

The ending left me really unsatisfied, because I knew it was a finished series before I started. So I expected I would get to see the full story. But nope :( Only been able to find season two in Spanish without English subs. I honestly hate waiting months or a year for another series especially when you know it's already out there. "
La casa de papel,"So from what I've been able to gather, here's what you should know about the show:

* There is one season to the show and they have both completely aired in Spain in two parts. Part 1 with 9 episodes that were 70+ minutes that aired from May-June 2017. Part 2 with 6 more episodes that aired from Oct-Nov 2017.^[1](https://www.episodate.com/tv-show/la-casa-de-papel?season=2), ^[2](https://next-episode.net/la-casa-de-papel/season-2), ^[3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6468322/episodes?ref_=tt_ov_epl)
* Netflix bought the rights to the show to be shown globally on December 25 but edited each episode from season 1 to increase the number from 9 to 13 and capping the episodes at 45-50 minutes in length (except the last episode). They also added official translated English subtitles.
* Netflix did not produce this show, it is only a Netflix Original because they have the rights to distribute it.
* The entire [DVD is available for purchase on Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/casa-papel-Serie-Completa-DVD/dp/B071ZS56Z4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1514963214&sr=8-2&keywords=la+casa+de+papel) but not the BluRay on Amazon.es. It is also streamable from the official website but no English subtitles exists.
* There are no English subtitles anywhere for the show, not for season 1 or 2
* Avoid the show's official website on antena3.com as it has immense spoilers for the show since it finished airing in Spain. The website offers the ending and detailed spoiler scenes, etc.
* This means that the show has concluded, there will be no more episodes.
* Wikipedia is unreliable. It states season 2 will air on May 2018 from a false source.

EDIT: I edited the Wikipedia page with this information"
La casa de papel,Season 2 is on Netflix Spain already. It's 6 episodes just over an hour long each. It closes the series.
La casa de papel,"Cool premise, well executed show, but most of the character’s poor decision-making nearly ruined it for me."
La casa de papel,"i just watched the first 4 episodes, i find it really dumb that they all lose sight of the objective and break the rules they made. And obviously for a stupid love story.It’s shown as if Berlin is so cruel but he is juste getting the job done! anyway haha my opinion, tell me they get more intelligent haha"
La casa de papel,"I was really excited when i saw a series about heisting being 13 episodes long, binged it in a day, holy sh*t its amazing, the characters how professor is two steps a head, character development, stockholm syndrome i was worried that they wouldn't be able to make a single heist intresting for 13 episodes but damn that did [spoiler](#s ""I wander if professor thought about the house, he look supprised but hes been two steps a head everytime"")"
La casa de papel,Is this any good? I saw it on Netflix but after that first episode of Las Chicas Del Cable I'm not sure I trust another Spanish Netflix production without good reviews.
La casa de papel,Anyone know what the deal is on Part II? 
La casa de papel,"wow just wow. thank you for letting us know this amazing series. i couldnt hear about it without this topic. im gonna start watching season finale now i was speechless at the end of 12. it is thrilling, suspenseful, great drama. i cant wait for season 2. please netflix air it soon, like in 2 hours."
La casa de papel,Doesn't seem to be licensed for the Japan market.
La casa de papel,Let's watch u/mnk411 
La casa de papel,It's not an original. It's a spanish TV show and it's already ended!
La casa de papel,The first episode of season 2 (original length  = over 1 hour) is so epic specially the music and the ending. the soundtrack borrows heavily from the movie Interstellar and it's fantastic
La casa de papel,"SPOILER AF

I just finished the whole show, dude am I shook. I held my breath during the last two episodes. I think the way Professor made some mistakes made the whole plan and the heist worth watching. As he says to Raquel, she was the mistake in the plan. It's a nice touch to the show even though I might've liked the show better without these romantic touchs. The ending is pretty neat, I loved how they all dress up and leave the hangar one by one. But Berlin, dude... I'm still crying over Berlin. He didn't have the best manners yes but we're talking about a bunch of thieves, so it shouldn't be a big thing. He raped Ariadna? I don't really know about that. But Berlin deserved some high quality time as well. But there's probably one thing I complain and it's that, Professor was extremely smart, too smart to even be a show. Other than that, I give it a solid 10/10 hell yeah fuck you if you say I have a terrible taste in shows I just loved it man."
La casa de papel,Season 2: April 6th!
La casa de papel,Part 2 is out on Netflix!
La casa de papel,"I enjoy the show (began watching s2 as of today).

Really good acting (although ny native language isnt Spanish and untill now I didnt really like the tone of the language in general (personal opinion, no offence ofc).

Awesome usage of soundtrack and very intriging plotline with great usage of flashbacks.

Plotline brings me to the point that is for me its biggest weakness. The unrealistic behavio(u)rs of the hostages (plain stupid - the only logical thinking guy (director of the bank) that isnt gonna play a silly money making business along with the armed (!) burglars that obviously NEED the aid of all hostages to succeed.

Furthermore
-  romantic relations between hostage-burglar 2×/ burglar-burglar  (not countig the forced one by Berlin)

7/10 
+ Concept / Plotline
+ Actors 
+ Spanish setting
+ Suspense

- Unrealistic relations / hostages 
(- Unrealistic police involvement)


"
La casa de papel,"This show is good! Just finished Season 2.
Normally don't watch non-English but this one is worth it.
The whole motivation from the hostages to cooperate is a bit weaker in Season 2, maybe Netflix cut some of the drama out, I don't know.
Of course you should just watch it to figure out how it ends. :)"
La casa de papel,"It's officially the most-watched Netflix show not in English!

La casa de papel,Really loved this show. Hope to see more of it!
La casa de papel,Can someone give a rundown on what happens in season 2? Spoiler tags of course.

La casa de papel,April 6th. Open the Netflix page for it to make sure it says the same for you
La casa de papel,Heads up my guy. It just got released.
La casa de papel,"Agreed, the amount of thought is pretty great and the characters aren't as bad as I thought they would be, definitely worth a watch "
La casa de papel,Yeah it's really good. Whatever twists appear don't feel as as plot armor but as a logical consequence of the planning that started before episode 1
La casa de papel,On episode 7. Dude the twists and turns are amazing. It reminds of me a more tightly scripted season of Prison Break
La casa de papel,This is me exactly like now
La casa de papel,They confuse the audience by putting the Original banner on things others have produced :(
La casa de papel,Looking good so far. I love that accent. I assume it's from Barcelona as that's where the actress is from.
La casa de papel,"If I take El Chapo as example, we won't have to wait for long, probably 3-4 months at most."
La casa de papel,"I watched it all.

[Speculation for season 2](#s ""After a while the red herring, and Rio's foreshadowing formula got a bit old. I can only assume Salva already thought ahead and all the clues are fake and misleading. Still very exciting. It's interesting Salva and psychopath (great acting there) refer to each other by first names. They knew each other."") 

Wait a minute.. I don't really see a season 2. Last episode listed is Bella Ciao, air date Nov 2017.

Checking official site now: http://www.antena3.com/series/casa-de-papel/noticias/los-secretos-que-no-conocias-de-la-casa-de-papel_201711285a1e8fd50cf2b410ea860b17.html

I am getting the feeling season 1+2 are just listed as season 1 in netflix.

La casa de papel,Is it actually? Are there english subs available on Netflix Spain? Will I be able to watch Netflix Spain with a VPN?
La casa de papel,How far have you gotten because I can assure you it does not happen often in this show. It is meticulous in every detail. 
La casa de papel,"[spoiler:](#s ""he didn't"") "
La casa de papel,"It's great if you like thrillers. It's not slow or a period drama like Chicas, but a high-speed series about a heist. With so many twists and surprises... 
I binged all 13 episodes and I put it in top 10 for 2017 (from Netflix, only Manhunt and Ozark come to mind as better)."
La casa de papel,"Las chicas del cable is very bad, I don't know why it's even being recommended. There's much better stuff in Netflix. 

I'd give a chance to the first episode. After that, you'll be hooked or not. If you're hooked, go on. If not, try until episode 7 of The 100."
La casa de papel,I search on google twice a day for an answer.
La casa de papel,I've found the second season or part 2 from Spain. It seems high quality but only in Spanish and no subs. Can't seem to find any subs either.

La casa de papel,Starting tonight! :D
La casa de papel,"It’s Spanish but there’s subtitles and dubs in multiple language. After watching it, I realised they have English dubs. Though I prefer listening in Spanish and reading off the English subtitles."

La casa de papel,you won't believe what happens with Tokyo.. twice :)
La casa de papel,Is there a DVD for purchase of season 2? Edit: The entire series is available on DVD for pre-purchase on Amazon 1/8/18 delivery
La casa de papel,hey could you PM me what happened in season 2? im rly curious
La casa de papel,Where did you find season 2?
La casa de papel,"Was really disappointed with the last episode. The professor is so smart, covered all his bases, but then you get to the last episode... WTF?"
La casa de papel,"Yep. Most of my friends here in France believe Outlander, Riverdale, the Good Place and other shows we get on Netflix ~7 hours after they’ve aired in the US are Netflix Originals. It does say so at the beginning of the episode and sometimes in the credits as well so... "
La casa de papel,Everything on Netflix is produced by someone else. Netflix just buys distribution rights in all or some countries. 
La casa de papel,[deleted]
La casa de papel,"The show takes place in Madrid, and where a majority of actors are from. "
La casa de papel,spain version has 9 plus 6 episodes in its one and only season. there was a break for summer. netflix took part 1 and shortened the episodes length to 13 episodes and aired it. so we re waiting for part 2 now as season 2
La casa de papel,"Vpn yes, it took me a few tries but it worked.

But i don't seem to remember subtitles. Sorry. "
La casa de papel,"Nope, only spanish subs."
La casa de papel,"I’m 7 episodes in... there’s been at least one lapse in judgement every episode so far, excuse my shorthand here (also spoilers): 

- during the first “planned” encounter with the police, Tokyo fires directly at them, hitting two (and lucking out with non-fatal injuries), when she was told to fire at the ground.

- Tokyo and hackerkids affair (again they were told not to fraternize) leading to Allison Parker finding an opportunity, during their lovers quarrel, to grab her phone and inadvertently reveal hackerkids identity.

- hackerkid being punished for his negligence and Tokyo with the bright idea to start shooting cameras in protest (cause jeopardizing the job for everyone including the one person you’re trying to protect makes sense) as if making the guy who is running the show (professors) job more difficult will solve anything. 

-  no one has an agreed upon contingency for hostages who try to be heroes (what?? How did you not see this coming and plan for it)... so berlin orders Monica “killed....” cmon 

- Moscow leaving Arturo and douchey kid alone at the jackhammer dig site long enough for them to discover conveniently placed bombs, ammo, gear, stowed a few feet away... under a blanket.

- Helsinki not disposing of the Ibiza (iirc) car properly for 1000 euros...

I’m sure I’m missing some too.

They have moments where they shine, a plan comes together beautifully (Arturo bullet surgery mask swap, glasses mic bug, was cool) or they improvise successfully but they can also be very sloppy. 

Are you saying this is all part of some master plan? (Please avoid spoilers as I’ve committed to finishing the season)"

La casa de papel,"My bet is the Professor will leave the area ASAP, after which he will enter the Royal Mint. Together with the others, he will continue the plan to escape safely. Meanwhile, Raquel Murillo gets a lot of criticism, when the media finds out she has slept with the Professor. 

At the end of S2, the criminals - including the Professor - escape and meet at a hangar, where the Professor will meet with Raquel and her daughter. Together they leave the country..."
La casa de papel,If they're not Netflix Originals then why does it say they are? They can't just lie about that that.
La casa de papel,"You know what we mean. Your argument is like saying Game of Thrones isn't from HBO and it is a Warner Brothers, Television 360 and Grok! Television production.

HBO pays for the production to happen. They obviously delegate because that is how every industry works. Your laptop manufacturer didn't build the chips inside of them."
Deep Water,"I’m in this if you want to ask questions about anything going on! Make sure you finish it on ITV Hub, ok?"
Deep Water,Wish pushing daises came back
Deep Water,"Really looking forward to this. I have no idea who this guy is honestly, but I like the trailer and I like A24."
Deep Water,">  Late in the first episode of Netflix’s Mo, the title character (played by Mo Amer, who also co-created the series with Ramy Youssef) gets shot while shopping for cat food. Well, grazed — he’ll be fine once he’s treated at the hospital, the paramedics reassure him. Mo panics, as freaked out by the prospect of running up a medical bill without health insurance as he is by the fact of what’s actually happened to him. Meanwhile, the jaded EMTs bicker over his gurney about whether the shooting counts as “mass” if only four people were hit, including the shooter.


> The scene feel darkly funny and a touch surreal, in the way the most harrowing moments of real life often do. It’s a distinctive example of what Mo does so well. Over eight half-hour episodes, the dramedy keeps itself afloat through a likable sense of humor and an eye for clever details, even as it frequently wades into deep, heavy waters."
Deep Water,"""I'm Sippin Cooooeeeedeeeiiinn"""
Deep Water,I met him at a casino in New Orleans one night a few years ago. He was super nice and we joked around and played blackjack for hours if the personal experience of someone on the internet factors into your calculus of liking an actor.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Deep Water,"I watched the entire show yesterday. It's fantastic. Funny and often heartfelt.

Mo Amer has been doing comedy for years and years now. ""Allah Made Me Funny"" was a tour he did with 2 other Muslims a while back (mid 2000s I think) and I'm pretty sure that's where he got his start in comedy, ever since he has been doing occasional tours and specials. He has a couple specials on Netflix."
Deep Water,"Just finished watching the show, he seems like one of the most likeable dudes out there. Really enjoyed it"
Deep Water,It is!
Deep Water,You soo lucky dude! His show is soo good.
Deep Water,Nice one thanks! I’m saving it for the weekend
Deep Water,"Yeah it was fantastic. I'm half Palestinian, and it was so awesome to see my culture represented on TV. Really hope it gets renewed, >!especially ending on a cliffhanger!<"
Deep Water,"If your focus is all on the mystery then you may be let down, the first story with Lula Landry probably has the best out and out mystery, but for me this show is a vehicle to tell a more human story of loss and friendship.

Personally, I love it, the relationship between Strike and Robin is what makes it very watchable for me, although I may have a slight bias as I was already a big fan of both Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger before I stared it. Sometimes half the battle with these shows is in finding two likable lead actors whose relationship you can believe in, and for me they nailed that aspect."
Deep Water,"Loved the books, but not a huge fan of the TV series. Usual reasons: unnecessary character and plot changes. I understand the necessity to cut out certain scenes, but frivolous character interpretations annoy the hell out of me. For example, in the books, Strike is military-style tidy, but BBC makes him piss in a jar cause he can't be bothered to go to the bathroom. WTF! I really don't understand why screenwriters have the urge to F-up original work. That said, loved the actress who plays Robin."
Deep Water,"The TV series is pretty tame in comparison with the books. Tom Burke is great as Strike but he acts differently in situations to the book Strike would, like the scene with Whitaker for example. And Charlotte Campbell is too posh and not as glamorous as Robin is.

In The Silkworm book Robin steers and dodges traffic on the motorway. But what we get on TV is her driving through a field of hills."
Deep Water,"I love it, but I love the Robert Galbraith (aka JK Rowling) books even more and occasionally hang out on r/cormoran_strike. For me, I think you'll do better with it if you like older-style literary-adaptation BBC detective shows (which were completely my jam through the '80s and '90s), not so much the colder/more violent Scandi-noir stuff, which looks like it's more in your wheelhouse. To me, *\[C.B.\] Strike* is very similar to *Case Histories* (which was based on Kate Atkinson's ""Jackson Brodie"" book series\]. I love both styles of crime drama (and can even do cozies), but a lot of folks prefer one or the other.

I enjoy *Unforgotten* and *Mare of Easttown,* but to me, they're not the best stuff ever. For me, that would be shows like Sally Wainwright's *Happy Valley* or Abi Morgan's *River,* or Hugo Blick's *Shadow Line* or *Black Earth Rising,* or the Williams brothers (*The Missing/Baptiste, Liar, Rellik, The Widow).*  Just different tastes."
Deep Water,I really liked the books but I couldn't really get into the show
Deep Water,"The two leads, Tom Burke and Holliday Grainger are great and make it worth watching. 

The mysteries are muddled as hell and over all are whatever. The second season's ""mystery"" was just garbage. 

> Currently drooling over how good ""Mare of Easttown"" is. True Detective Season One

If you are looking for something close to those two, C.B. Strike is not the show you want. 

C.B. Strike is passable at best. 

>  Hoping this meets my quality standards set by some of my favorites : The Break, Marcella, Shetland, Wallander, Bordertown, Bron, Deep Water, The Missing, Broadchurch, Der Pass, etc.

It is not on par with any of those."
Deep Water,"Strike was.... boring as fuck tbh. Like, if you take the word ""typical"" and made it into a TV series lol. I don't feel much doubt saying that either, I believed I watched a whole 2 seasons."
Deep Water,I’m a big crime fiction lover and have enjoyed many on your list I adored unforgotten. I’m a big fan of the strike books but the show was a let down still enjoyable but definitely not up to the standard if others on your list. You might want to add Canadian show Cardinal to your list it’s a good watch.
Deep Water,"I like both actors, but am I the only one who couldn't buy their romantic chemistry? I believed fully in their platonic relationship and was looking forward to it being explored further, but once the longing looks started up, it just felt ridiculous."
Deep Water,"I'm so glad I'm reading the books first. Burke & Grainger are excellent and I just hear them when reading but having watched Cuckoo's Calling and the first part of The Silkworm, I'm gutted by how they just suck out the meat of it.

What makes the first two books (currently on Career of Evil) so great is the detail, Strike and Robin, delving deep, the characterization, the thought process. None of that is in the series, it's so hopelessly rushed and simple, it's like a Cliffs Notes version of the books. The actors have so little to work with and the investigations so far are so simplistic and boring in the series, so easily solved. 

I'll keep watching and I hear it might get better with Lethal White where there's four episodes."
Deep Water,Haha I appreciate this review. I never got through episode one thanks to the heads up. On to Cacciatore the Hunter next. Cheers!
Deep Water,No I agree. It’s a lot of awkward glances and forced missed opportunities when in reality they’re quite different people and their unifying factor seems to be that they’re both damaged which doesn’t seem like a particularly strong basis for a relationship. Although they haven’t ended up together (yet) so maybe that’s the point.
Deep Water,I just started watching this show but find myself annoyed by the Robin character and how she treats her husband.  I've only seen season 1 and the beginning of season 2 so I don't know how it turns out but I may not watch the rest of it because I don't really like watching that part of the story.  I'm more interested in the crime mystery part of the show.  The first episodes of season 1 with the Lula Landry murder mystery was what got me to keep watching it.
Deep Water,[deleted]
Deep Water,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Deep Water,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Deep Water,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Deep Water,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Deep Water,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Deep Water,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Deep Water,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Deep Water,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Deep Water,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Deep Water,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Deep Water,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Deep Water,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Deep Water,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Deep Water,🙂💕
Deep Water,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Deep Water,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Deep Water,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Deep Water,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Deep Water,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Deep Water,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Deep Water,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Deep Water,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Deep Water,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Deep Water,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Deep Water,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Deep Water,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Deep Water,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Deep Water,It’s a show for teenage girls and I believe it was reviewed as such.
Deep Water,Maybe AegontheauntFooker is a disgruntled teen?
Deep Water,"I'd like to watch this show, to but I'm 100% convinced they'll follow the usual formula of teasing mysteries, resolving nothing, ending the season in a cliffhanger, and cancelling it.

Studios have got to break their addiction to the cliffhanger that nobody asked for."
Deep Water,"They're not lost, they've in the hole."
Deep Water,[deleted]
Deep Water,"I agree, all these shows are Lost ripoffs and I have to keep seeing this bullshit on tv. It doesn’t stop there Ordinary Joe is Quantum Leap and this is us had a bastard child.  All this means that we’ll
Be getting mid season replacements of American Ninja Warrior."
Deep Water,Some sentimental part of me is still rooting for broadcast networks to get it together… I’ll watch this despite its flaws.
Deep Water,"Did we all agree at some point that CGI had advanced to an acceptable enough level that it can be used generously throughout TV shows and wasn't still horrible and laughable?

The most realistic thing about this show is the government lying to everybody for their own good.  Other than that, the Center of the Earth premise isn't anything new.  The show does a decent job of quickly establishing each of the very shallow characters so we know ""take charge guy"", ""Selfish woman"", ""Immediately dead guy because he wasn't introduced as a main character"", etc..

Are we supposed to believe the mid 20s son that is being driven to (high??) school needs his mommy to fight his battles for him?

I'm glad they included the single dead guy about 10 minutes after anybody watching would have wondered where all the dead bodies were.  Of course, throwing one in there makes everybody who wasn't already wondering where all the dead bodies were suddenly start thinking about it. 

The levels of ridiculousness in the pilot go as far deep as the hole they supposedly fell down."
Deep Water,"I want to like this show so much, but it is just \*bad\*.  From the acting to the dialogue - I was laughing at some of the lines out there!  ""I need to talk to someone....   in CHARGE"" 

This show is not supposed to be a comedy, but I think that it will end up being one."
Deep Water,"NBC, still out there failing to replace Heroes…"
Deep Water,I'm gonna pass on this one.
Deep Water,"Dumb question, but if they all fell through some time warp hole in the sky at the la brea tar pits then why didn't any of them land in a tar pit?"
Deep Water,"Y'all hate but it could be a fun in a "" watch while in reddit groups making fun of it"" type of way, a la ""Under the Dome"" and the TV version of ""The Mist"".  


There's zero chance of a second season but the unintentional comedy of this one should be good enough"
Deep Water,"This show looks so incredibly dumb. Glad Natalie Zea is getting work, but this isn't it."
Deep Water,Craptastic! Hopefully it lasts a full season.
Deep Water,"I’m trying to be positive, but not sure if this show is better than Manifest which NBC finally dumped.  I will only mention my incredulity about the fact how everything fell neatly and pretty much separate from each other on land, with hardly the scale of destruction we saw from the other side.  Probably does not bode well for the rest of the season, lol."
Deep Water,How deep is the hole? Elbow deep or Armpit deep?
Deep Water,[deleted]
Deep Water,Sounds like a fun and interesting show. So of course if I like it they will cancel it after 1-2 season like they always do now.
Deep Water,this accounts done two posts about this show in the past day....
Deep Water,"Im so pissed to have been so right about this 

i laid it all out too 
https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/pr7afz/who_at_nbc_is_fascinated_with_trying_to_make_the/"
Deep Water,Lost sucked so this will suck worse.
Deep Water,This show is so entertaining. Not because its good but because it's bad. And now that NBC has gotten 600K people to watch it I will get three seasons of it until Netflix picks it up.
Deep Water,"I watched the whole first show and Im saying to myself this show is terrible.Bad special effects,bad acting and dumb storyline."
Deep Water,"I got to see the first episode early, that’s 100% what this series is going to be unfortunately."
Deep Water,"When I saw the trailer the first thing that went though my head was ""not again"". It ticked almost all of the the boxes of the type of show that's going to let me down."
Deep Water,"I dont like that it's a family split up because that means they're gonna potentially come back to earth and that's boring. I would rather the entire show is set in thst other world. 


The trailer gave me the 100 vibes but I have a feeling they might not be going that way, unfortunately


Edit:after reading the review im probably not gonna like this show, which sucks because it has a cool name"
Deep Water,"Ah yes, the ""Let's Keep Trying to Make *Lost* Even Though It Hasn't Been a Thing for Fifteen Years"" trend..."
Deep Water,Down in a hole and I don't know if they can be saved.
Deep Water,"As if they have 2 ideas; one for the pilot, another for the finale cliffhanger and just wing it in the middle."
Deep Water,"Well, it didn't go ""all out"" for the pilot, so that part of your wish has come true at least."
Deep Water,"This one looks like Land of the Lost from my childhood, lol"
Deep Water,The last broadcast show that impressed me was Hannibal. Still waiting for anything else to have that quality.
Deep Water,"Diversity?   Check.  Disabled supermodel hero with no life limitations?  Check.  Ambiguously troubled characters?  Check.  Romantic relationships gone bad, but not in any way that's irredeemable?  Check.  

Clues not hidden but overtly lined up on Ambulance doors, painted in dayglo red on rocks, or physically manifest as necklaces.  Evil military complex that comes crawling to the one-civilian-to-save-us-all.  The comic relief guy with a vulnerable heart.  ""If only we'd reconciled *before* the tragedy"" tropes."
Deep Water,"It's not supposed to be a Hollow Earth adventure, it's unintentional time travel."
Deep Water,"> Other than that, the Center of the Earth premise isn't anything new

It's actually time travel."
Deep Water,I noticed everybody is dressed the same. Like. Different outfits all from the same closet.
Deep Water,"The tar will come up later as, I dunno, the way some precociously smart person figures out how to recharge all their smart phones.  Gilligan will be very appreciative."
Deep Water,This is a comedy right!? I mean I was laughing at the silly from the start.
Deep Water,"> General sentiment around here was that manifest was a magnificent show.

That show is utter dogshit.."
Deep Water,">I dont quite get why everyone is so down on sequential mysteries.

I think it's just sequential mysteries on network TV."
Deep Water,"What got people hooked on Lost 20 years ago was that there were some payoffs along the way.  Early episodes had a concept and paid off, while keeping the sequential mystery thread going in the background.  When people saw things like ""Walkabout"", they were hooked.

This appears to not have that, it's just a 90 minute action movie premise being stretched out to dozens of hours."
Deep Water,"Look, the trailers had me hyped for this show ngl. Is the concept good? Yes. Is the execution good? Not at all!
Several plot holes
Shallow characters
God awful acting

Everything.

Not one single thing was done right."
Deep Water,Trust me; it's not.
Deep Water,Maybe they joined Reddit to talk about this show..?
La Doña,The first half of the season was enjoyable enough but the second half was like pulling teeth. I don't think I'll miss this show if it doesn't get renewed.
La Doña,Impressive. They’ve managed to release an entire season of a Walking Dead show without me having ever heard of it. Doesn’t bode well for its longevity.
La Doña,"This show was such a chore to get through. The episode with Alpha and Lydia who are already established characters was good, but everything else was boring."
La Doña,"Only seen the first episode. It was amusing, it wasn't bad...

... but it was The Walking Dead.

Okay, not quite. It was set in The Walking Dead universe, and I think I'm just bored of that now. I've kept up with TWD. I've kept up with Fear (which has had its good moments - none of which were in the latest season). I watched the first season of the turgid World Beyond.

And I just don't think I can deal with much more post-apocalyptic rural America with the odd zombie or two.

I'm glad TWD is ending. I want Fear to end (especially after whatever the fuck that last season was). I have mixed feelings about the multitude of spin-offs (Darryl has a show! Maggie and Negan have a show! Rick and Michonne have a show, or movies, or something). And I don't think I want another, especially since it doesn't contribute to any main storylines (whatever they are) anyway."
La Doña,"I cant wait to completely ignore this, oh wait."
La Doña,"Seriously, that was one of the worst episodes in the entire universe, wtf is wrong with you lol.  Out of all the shows.

Worse than the fucking haunting bullshit turned nutjobs."
La Doña,"Agree, the first episode with Terry Crews is so dumb I had to stop midway through"
La Doña,"I know he’s Reddit’s darling but he and Olivia Munn spent most of that episode battling for worst actor. 

Cool idea for a show but poor execution."
Breakout,"""Breakout""? He's been beloved by geek culture ever since playing Oberyn Martell"
Breakout,"Game of Thrones, The Mentalist, Narcos, Mandalorian..."
Breakout,[deleted]
Breakout,"Breakout star that had major roles in Game of Thrones, The Mandalorian and Narcos?"
Breakout,What a load of shite. He's been a star for years. Absolutely killed it on Narcos
Breakout,Pedro was already an A list actor prior to the last of us
Breakout,a lot more people might actually know his name now but that headline doesn't seem right
Breakout,"This is like when articles were calling Tatiana Maslany a breakout star because of She Hulk, despite her huge popularity from Orphan Black."
Breakout,"I didn't know much about him until I saw him hosting SNL. He just came across as not only a good actor and funny, but a genuinely decent person."
Breakout,I was just watching a bunch of 70s movies and realized hes like the new Burt Reynolds.
Breakout,If we ever get a reboot of Tremors I know why I want to play Earl
Breakout,"He was just on the Graham Norton Show last week & appeared to be fairly drunk, it was pretty cringey to watch unfortunately. Had been looking forward to seeing him on Graham, so it was kind of a let down. Maybe he was nervous to be on the show & needed liquid courage or something."
Breakout,"All these talk of his other big roles and everyone forgets to mention Wonder Woman '84 , can't imagine why."
Breakout,And it's not like he hasn't been the lead actor in one of the biggest shows out there since 2019.
Breakout,He's been beloved by smaller circles for a long time but he's turned into a huge star now. My mom knows who Pedro Pascal is now.
Breakout,One of these things is not like the others...
Breakout,"No one ever seems to mention Narcos, but it was huge when it first came out and that was really his first leading role in TV."
Breakout,"Seriously...does everyone just forget about how awesome he was?


I think half of this stuff is written by AI."
Breakout,akshooally it was narcos
Breakout,"Yeah ""breakout"" wasn't the best choice of word for the title (especially since most folks on this subreddit are just going to read the headline), but the article does talk about the other major roles he has been in, how successful those shows/his roles were, how it increased his fame, presently culminating with The Last Of Us and The Mandalorian.

I think what the author is trying to say by ""breakout"" is twofold. First, that Pedro Pascal is the first *standout* actor so far of *this year*, 2023. One could say Adam Scott was a ""breakout star"" of 2022 because of his incredible starring role in Severance (although that wasn't as widely watched). Or Jennifer Coolidge, bc of her role in The White Lotus and personality.

Second, Pascal is very much an actor/celebrity ""of the pop cultural moment,"" not only with starring roles in two major tv series connected to major franchises but also a huge, dedicated fan following that goes beyond his acting performances to his personality, a fanbase that only intensified with his role in The Mandalorian and now The Last Of Us. This certainly isn't the first time he has had a media/cultural moment - I know he did a lot of major interviews and such during Narcos and The Mandalorian. But Pascal is once again having a moment, and it feels especially zeitgeist-y and meme-y, as reflected and reinforced by his hosting SNL. And being a guest on Graham Norton.

Finally, as I said, the release of The Last Of Us and the third season of The Mandalorian at the same time feels like a culmination of success from an actor who has progressively acted in bigger and bigger roles since Game of Thrones. I mean, how many actors are starring in not one but TWO of the biggest, most popular series connected to two unrelated major franchises - Star Wars and The Last Of Us video game - which are being released *at the same time.*

Anyway, I thought the article was a surprisingly well-researched - yet brief - biographical profile of an actor...and without a mention of ""internet daddy"" lol"
Breakout,"And he had a big part in the Kingsman sequel. Not on the same scale as the others, but it was the 2nd thing I saw him in and loved it"
Breakout,"It’s because The Last of Us is in full circlejerk right now. It’s a fine show, but the internet is blowing it up acting like it’s some groundbreaking masterpiece with revolutionary performances, which it is not in my opinion."
Breakout,Orphan black wasn't a popular show though
Breakout,Nah. He'd make a better Burt.
Breakout,"Really? The few clips I saw on YouTube looked good, but it wasn't the whole show. The whole kiss ""swerve"" bit was a bit dicey when he and Helen Mirren actually tried it. idk how they felt about it, but I always feel weird when talk show guest get involved in any sort of touchy-feely or sexual shenanigans (bc it's hard to consent on live talk show), unless they are actually v close and touchy-feel-y irl. Other than that it looked good to me, maybe buzzed but he just struck me as his usual goofy, gregarious self. But sometimes I don't notice until it's pointed out to me."
Breakout,It's not The Mandalorian or Game of Thrones but it was big enough to win her an Emmy AND get a spinoff.
Breakout,"I could see him as Burt lol...Oh god they need to pick a Country Start to be his wife too, we need to keep the joke up.

Maybe Michael Gross could play his Grandpa in a cameo"
Breakout,"Idk, there were some ok moments, but overall it was just awkward. Thankfully it didn't get too off the rails, but it was teetering on the edge. To be fair, I haven't watched a ton of his interviews, so maybe this is how he always acts, it just stood out to me as a regular Graham Norton viewer. I agree, I get really uncomfortable when the guests get too touchy feely with people they've just met. Funnily enough, Evangeline Lilly recently did just that to Danny Dyer in a chat show, touching his ear. It's so not cool."
Breakout,"Haha well I'm still holding judgement until I watch the show (if I ever get the chance). I would watch other interviews and the SNL sketches - he comes off as very gregarious, happy, goofy/cheeky (not in a problematic way), open and charming in a way that I could imagine coming off as tipsy if you only watched his shows, in which he plays more serious/intense/stoic roles.

I love the [interview he did with longtime friend and fellow actor Oscar Isaac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stLw-2Ob8xQ) 3 years ago for a Wired Autocomplete Interview (which is not live). Actually they seem kind of wired in that interview, if you know what i mean lol. They are very touchy-feely but they are good friends. Oscar gives Pedro a wet willy, which to me would be a line too far but I guess they're cool lol. I mean the touchy stuff is also a power dynamic/age/gender thing."
Breakout,"Just started watching it and everything about it is great.  The cast, sure, but the pacing is good, the way its shot, the music... everything is nicely done."
Breakout,"Why am I enjoying being so stressed out? I watch tv to be lessed stressed, not more."
Breakout,>!I just got stabbed!<
Breakout,"The show made me so stressed out and frustrated, yet I couldn't stop watching. >!FFS MARCUS STOP FUCKIN AROUND WITH UR DONUTS N GET BACK TO WORK.!<"
Breakout,The whole cast top to bottom knocked it out of the park.
Breakout,Yes chef
Breakout,"So Chicago people, can you really just fire shots in the air like Richie did and nobody will call the police?"
Breakout,"We just binged it this weekend. Parts of it felt like the Bourdain written storyline on season 2 of Treme, which is a high compliment. I loved watching the pastry chef fall farther down the Noma Guide to Fermentation rabbit hole than I did, and the sous chef’s arc.  Lots of little details, like the chicago heavy soundtrack/score, little bits of foreshadowing like a cleverly placed pic of Bill Murray or cook book, really drove it home as well. 

I can’t for the life of me figure out the last 10 or so min (trying to avoid spoilers here) but the rest of the season was so good, I don’t really care. I can’t wait for the second season."
Breakout,"For those who want to know more of what the show is about, here's a taste:

Cousin!

COUSIN!

Cousin?

Cousiiiiiin!

Cousin!"
Breakout,[deleted]
Breakout,"Binged it all yesterday. Very good show, a bit like the movie whiplash except in the restaurant world instead of drumming."
Breakout,Oliver Platt getting typecast as guys who make chefs lives difficult.
Breakout,"The supporting cast of, “Lip goes to culinary school.” is awesome."
Breakout,"One thing I’ve noticed - which is particularly accurate to a kitchen environment - the sound design is such that noise is CONSTANT. Either someone is shouting, talking, the ticket dispenser is going off, a phone is ringing, utensils are clinking around. 

It’s a very cacophonous environment. I really hope the sound design on this show gets recognized."
Breakout,Thank you chef
Breakout,Ayo Edebiri is a national treasure.
Breakout,Joel McHale was fantastic
Breakout,"The entire cast, including its lead."
Breakout,Binged the shit out of this show. It's awesome
Breakout,One of my best friends is in this! He’s the dude that works in the kitchen w the long hair and a Sox hat/in that miñoso scene
Breakout,Episode 7 was the best. It was literally only screaming and yelling the whole episode
Breakout,"I’ve been following Ayo Edibiri since she played the medium for all of Emily Dickinson’a friends. She wrote for Dickinson, which is very fun and absurd. She also the (or one of) the credited writer for the season 3 premiere of What We Do In The Shadows tonight!!"
Breakout,Anywhere to watch it in the UK or do I need to hire a boat
Breakout,"So far its my favorite show of the year, still havent seen nathans the rehearsal yet tho"
Breakout,"JAW is already a superstar in my eyes based on his performance from Shameless. A young Marlon Brando type actor.

But we shall not sleep on the breakout performance of Ayo Edebiri. Holy shit. She's fucking amazing. I haven't seen such a natural actor since...Jeremy Allen White."
Breakout,Liked the show just fine. Just don't know why it's primarily labeled as a comedy. Like it has jokes but nothing that would make me think it is first and foremost a good place to go for a laugh...
Breakout,"I really enjoy this show , never work in a kitchen before but it felt accurate if that matters lol"
Breakout,I found out about this show from watching Matty Mathesons YouTube shows. Check it out if you haven't already. Just a Dash is absolutely fucking hilarious...and informative. I hope they make another season.
Breakout,"I think the show ended really well.

I'm skeptical s2 will be as good. They've mostly solved their problems and Carmen got closure with his brother. I'm predicting s2 will be more episodic like the later seasons of Shameless and I'm not really a fan of that."
Breakout,Carried by JAW
Breakout,"Looks like for us Australians , we have to wait until August 31st for all episodes to appear on Disney plus Star channel *sigh*"
Breakout,"Is it worth watching? Some people said there is not much in terms of plot, and just a lot of shouting."
Breakout,I miss italian beef sandwiches. staple of chicago.
Breakout,"I think this is a show you have to binge. I have just been watching 1 episode at a time and by episode 4 it feels like absolutely nothing has happened. I’m not compelled to keep watching. I don’t dislike anything about the show. I think it’s well acted in and shot really well, I just don’t really care about what’s happening"
Breakout,"Sure, yeah, I like the characters but the whole show felt like an improvised jazz song. Hoping season 2 gives more story."
Breakout,This was such a pleasant surprise everyone was great in it.
Breakout,"I'm sure it's really good, and I definitely want to watch it. As far as the breakout series of the summer goes, I have to give that to The Old Man. Totally different genre, I know, but it was just so damn good."
Breakout,[deleted]
Breakout,"Can’t watch it, too much anxiety 😟"
Breakout,"Thanks to the writing and editing I’d say, half of the cast is just okay 

I saw they had reviews calling it a comedy which is bizarre to me, like yeah there’s some funny moments but calling it a comedy is a stretch and imo gives people the wrong idea if they’re going to give it a shot"
Breakout,"I thought it was good, but not nearly as good as critics making it out to be. I’ll watch the second season but definitely not a 100/100 kind of show."
Breakout,This show was so impressive in ever aspect! Very excited for season 2!!!
Breakout,"Am I the only the one that thinks this show is overhyped as hell?

Yes episode 7 was great but the other 7 episodes were all pretty boring.  People saying ""Oh I was so stressed out by the show"" what exactly were you stressing over? Cicero's birthday party for his kid?  Fak and Richie fighting while the power goes out?

Overall meh show."
Breakout,Restaurants are a black hole when it comes to safe and wholesome work environments.   I’ve seen things that would never stand in just about any other line of work.  Most professional line cooks I’ve worked with are chewed up from the  years of emotional and physical abuse they endure.
Breakout,"The shots of the city too. El stations at night, walking under the tracks. They included external shots of Johnny’s, gene and Jude’s, AND Roeser’s bakery. Someone did their homework. The shot of Roeser’s was a master touch."
Breakout,"Just found this show and think it’s the best tv show I’ve ever seen. Hooked instantly, funny and serious, incredible writing, story and cast"
Breakout,"Stupidest fucking ending ever. Hidden money in cans that he still owes to somebody else and he decides to partner with a loose cannon who quit at the first sign of things going badly, a situation that she created…smfh…."
Breakout,Amazing cast.
Breakout,It’s scary accurate to life in a commercial kitchen.
Breakout,"I can't watch this show, it's just constant yelling."
Breakout,"The actual restaurant made no fucking sense. If you’re selling Italian Beef sandwiches, you’re not having dinner service with plates and silverware, and definitely not spaghetti."
Breakout,I started watching this yesterday I noticed the cast does an amazing job even cousin. I like Sydney.
Breakout,"Love this show, I hope season 2 is just as good."
Breakout,Started watching it yesterday and so far I'm enjoying it.
Breakout,I loved this show. such amazing acting. 👏
Breakout,I am so proud of Lionel man
Breakout,I just finished shameless last night and can't wait to start watching this when it becomes available in Australia
Breakout,"In Canada, where do I watch this?"
Breakout,Wife and I Binged it and thought it was great 👍🏻
Breakout,YES CHEF
Breakout,Cousin!
Breakout,Incredible show
Breakout,I have been a chef for thirty years and don’t get the whole “watching stressed me out” thing. Maybe I am just used to it but to me it seemed like a normal day.
Breakout,"By breakout, they mean the television company is still brave enough to pay for advertising to stay relevant… if you have seen this show your finger is far from the pulse"
Breakout,It sucks. Couldn’t get through the first episode. Go ahead and downvote me to hell.
Breakout,"It was okay, kinda mid."
Breakout,This show was fine. This show gets astroturfed to hell here though.
Breakout,overrated af.
Breakout,"The most overrated show I have seen in some time.

The acting was not good. The plot is ridiculous - all that yelling, shouting, preparation and we hardly ever see customers in the store. No one ever even tried the guys donuts and that was an entire plot!

The best episode was episode 7, and the one thing to really like in this show is the cinematography."
Breakout,The Bear… sucks ass
Breakout,I loved the acting and directing but was a little disappointed by the twist at the very end that made it all of a sudden a happy ending.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Hooch is crazy

Reggie Yates Extreme,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Reggie Yates Extreme,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Reggie Yates Extreme,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Reggie Yates Extreme,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Reggie Yates Extreme,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Reggie Yates Extreme,that's a lot of content
Reggie Yates Extreme,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Reggie Yates Extreme,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Reggie Yates Extreme,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Reggie Yates Extreme,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Reggie Yates Extreme,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Reggie Yates Extreme,[deleted]
Reggie Yates Extreme,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Reggie Yates Extreme,Any specific dates to go with this?
Reggie Yates Extreme,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Reggie Yates Extreme,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Reggie Yates Extreme,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Reggie Yates Extreme,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Reggie Yates Extreme,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Reggie Yates Extreme,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.

Reggie Yates Extreme,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Reggie Yates Extreme,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Reggie Yates Extreme,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Reggie Yates Extreme,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Reggie Yates Extreme,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Reggie Yates Extreme,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."

Reggie Yates Extreme,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Reggie Yates Extreme,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Reggie Yates Extreme,It’s pretty genius
Reggie Yates Extreme,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Reggie Yates Extreme,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Reggie Yates Extreme,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Reggie Yates Extreme,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Reggie Yates Extreme,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Reggie Yates Extreme,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Reggie Yates Extreme,That’s pathetic
Reggie Yates Extreme,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Reggie Yates Extreme,[deleted]
Reggie Yates Extreme,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Reggie Yates Extreme,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo.

Reggie Yates Extreme,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Reggie Yates Extreme,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Reggie Yates Extreme,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Reggie Yates Extreme,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Reggie Yates Extreme,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Reggie Yates Extreme,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Reggie Yates Extreme,Not necessarily a bad rep as much as not enough attention: Class of 3000- created by Andre 3000.  Only two seasons (and I’m pretty sure a shorted second season) before cancellation.
Reggie Yates Extreme,"I've seen Brickleberry get a lot of flak recently, and I've never thought it was deserved. I didnt know about it until I saw the cancelation headline, so I binged it, and I thought it was actually kinda fun. "
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Not sure if it quite qualifies, but Gary & Mike was a hilarious short lived claymation series, lasting only 3 months.  

Clerks is another show that deserved more time than it got. "

Reggie Yates Extreme,I’ve seen a lot of people crap on hey Arnold but that show is a masterpiece with a great soundtrack
Reggie Yates Extreme,Can you link the movie 
Reggie Yates Extreme,[deleted]
Reggie Yates Extreme,Kind of gave off a bit of a Hey Arnold/Proud Family vibe.  
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Yeah as far as cartoons focusing on celebrities go that was one of the better ones, shame it's so hard to find all the episodes online."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Yeah I forgot to mention that one, Paradise P.D. as well which was made by the game guys.

More shows that definitely should've lasted longer were Stroker and Hoop, Moonbeam City, Legends of Chamberlain Heights and Chozen."
Reggie Yates Extreme,"Definitely agreed on Clerks, UPN actually offered to air the show, but Smith took it to ABC instead because he ""didn't want to be a big fish in a small pond"" in hindsight he regretted that choice as UPN probably would've been more likely to give the show an actual chance."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The original Mole with Anderson Cooper (not the shitty celeb versions) was my favorite reality competition. I had no idea they were rebooting it, thank you!"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I watched The Mole for the first time when it came to Netflix, and I was instantly hooked; I binged through the 4 seasons they had, and I'm absolutely loving this new season.

The contestants are ALL playing the game, which keeps you constantly guessing. I also love the tweaks to the format, like the quiz questions not being read aloud, the new elimination method, and the new host - Alex Wagner just fits perfectly.

This is how revivals should be done: keeping what was great about the original while upping the production values and updating it for today's audience."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I’m a huge fan of the original seasons but this new version is garbage.

They dumbed it down way to much. They over explain every aspect of the show and peoples intentions. Also, everyone on the show has zero personality. The original had a wide range of people with different ages. Which provided some great TV.

This is *The Mole* and that show *To Hot to Handle* having some weird love child. 

0/10 less facial symmetry. Not wholesome. Not going back moleville."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"> Fortunately, this cast of The Mole isn't the ""Instagram influencer/model"" conglomerate that you usually see on some of Netflix's ""trashier"" reality TV shows; they all appear to have fairly distinct identities and personalities. The players don't feel like they're there to get Instagram followers or the likes, all the players here are focused on the game.

I've only seen 1 ep (well, and the first few minutes of ep 2, for obvious reasons) so I'm sure they all get better, but it really does look like everyone in this cast could be found chatting together in an upscale nightclub in Manhattan or something. I'm really missing a Charlie or a Bill or a Kate - or even a Dorothy. Hoping future seasons really diversify a little more."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Who here thinks it’s Joi?!
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Sorry, but TLDR... this show is not very good.  I am not convinced that EVERYONE isn't acting.  The dynamic is so weird and scripted."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I loved the Anderson Cooper seasons from way back then. I just started watching this reboot and I was so happy to see that they mostly kept the same format! It does feel like the new host is trying to act like Anderson, but I'm here for it. She's great! Starting episode 2 now and planning to finish the 5 eps tonight!"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Love this show! Definitely binge worthy; just watched five eps in a row. Nice to see the beautiful scenery of my home country of Australia. Already someone I thought was highly suspicious has been eliminated. It's so fun guessing. I'm even taking notes!
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I just watched the first episode of the new version on Netflix and damn I'm liking it so far. Of course, I have to push ""THAT"" question out of mind. The question ""is any of this real?"" But once I forget about that for a second I'm hooked. One minute I'm thinking ""You're the mole!"" Next minute its ""No! Youre the mole"". 

Now I have no experience with this show and I'm only 1 episode in on the new reboot but damn am I down. 

And ultimately, even if it is all scripted, then I think all of these guys are doing a good job and this is one of the few decent reality-esque shows I've seen. 

P.S. I'm not the mole."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I loved the original Mole and was surprised one day to see it when I was scrolling through Netflix upcoming series. Psyched to watch it, thanks for the reminder!"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,How do you apply to be on it?
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"As a member of the content viewing public I appreciate this natural and organic grass roots campaign to boost viewing figures and maximise audience retention.

I am engaged and enthusiastic about [insert show here]. 

It is well know that key viewing demographics, of which I am one, seek entertainment value in their coblntent offerings.

By being exposed to this kind of appealing and enticing information I am more likely to spend up to an hour or more of my free time viewing the content described here."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,I forgot it was coming out! Thanks for the reminder!
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Great post! I loved the first season of the original, just came across the reboot and this post convinced me to watch it. Just finished Episode 1 and I’m already loving it"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Its obvious Avery is the mole. She overacts and I would bet the farm on it
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I love all the curveball this series threw at us like every episode was so fun to watch. We had no idea who the real mole was, they really did a great job since every episode I was suspecting a different person. The contestants constantly sabotaging themselves was definitely the icing on the cake for me I love it"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Lmao this show is so badly scripted it's funny to watch
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"This is SO bad.  Very scripted and played out.  Running through a jungle in white tennis shoes, white pants and tops and not a speck of dirt on you.  These people don't even come across as authentic.  100% paid actors on a bad show."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,I've been hearing good stuff about The Mole for years. Will check it out for sure.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Thanks! I’ll check it out this weekend
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Totally disagree. Netflix does not get reality TV at all -- the weird cliffhangers for one. People want complete episodes of reality TV. They're showing repetitive confessionals, not enough personal stories of the contestants and their relationships, and the format choices are puzzling (potentially bringing someone back in the game? way too much focus on exemptions, challenges that are way too hard to the point that no one needs to sabotage)"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Naw, fuck this show. I can't finish it. I hate 80% of the contestants. They're mostly shitty people sabotaging each other. Need to be a pure masochist to watch this garbage."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,The problem I have with it is that I know who the mole his because I already knew the actor playing it lol
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"So I've never watched any of the original show. So I'm just curious how it ends, does the show do a run through where they show all the sabotages done by the mole? Or do they let is know before the end?"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Do you know how to apply to be on it if the show renews?
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Hey thank you for this! I just started watching the show and was a little confused, it’s fair to say you got me excited to continue watching.. but one question, How does the mole benefit by sabotaging challenges and lessening the pot for the end?"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"It was okay.  I think the game needs to be reworked a bit, in particular the mole’s role and their incentive to sabotage without getting caught."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Totally scripted.  Not a ""reality"" show by any stretch of the imagination."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Are you kidding me? Some of these people are actors. The old mole is waaaaay better.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Netflix needs to add all of the original seasons
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"AHAHAHA no, it was so badly acted and staged. Gielnor games is better than this trash."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,There was a version of this show with Anderson Cooper the news guy?
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The original Mole is the belgian version, which is still on the air."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,This show is scripted.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,I just started watching it and I'm a little confused.  What incentive does the mole have to stay hidden?  Say the mole messes up big time and now everyone thinks they are the mole.... What's the negative for them here?   It just seems like everyone is pretending to be the mole in order to confuse everyone else and that just makes it boring imo.  I feel like there needs to be an extra component to reward people for not being thought of as the mole and not getting votes.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The major complaint of version 1 was its one of the most complicated shows ever made, they really haven't got into the gameplay element of pretending to be the mole to get you to the next round.  The looser each round is either a) the person they think is the mole or b) strongest player that 4 or so of them made an alliances to take out. Or a possible c) the person the mole wanted out of the picture so the mole set them up.


The show is the best version, I like the host so far, I liked Anderson better.

My only issue is their in makeup and best version of wardrobe 24/7 other than that the original seemed more like real players were involved this like d list actors.

But after 4 episodes I'm hooked.  Best thing Netflix has put out in a while."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Thanks for saying this because it’s shit. The consumers of this genre have been corrupted by a great vacuousness surpassing the reality tv of the y2k era.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Most of them look and talk like Instagram influencers. The only one who didn't seem as fake was the fire fighter and the warehouse worker, but they still look like models."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I think the Mole is Avori. The one that we least expected. Here are my reasons. For the Tree challenge, she was the first to go up. And pretended like that there were so many knots. The 2nd person went up the tree and untangled all the knots so easily. Avori also tried to sabotage the prize pot twice. She looked inside the Dossier to reduce the pot by 10,000 and she was the first person to immediately walk out of the room for the code challenge to hit the red buzzer without even giving a minute to discuss with the rest when Greg said “Wait let’s talk about this first”, Avori just stormed out to the clue room. That cost another 10,000. For the money counting challenge, she kept blaming Jacob for not counting the money right and she said she will recount everything that the first 2 people counted because she didn’t trust them. How the heck did you get it wrong in a recount? Avori is blaming Jacob for counting it wrong and she rectified it and the count was still wrong? For the running challenge, she said that she’s a runner and she barely ran. She walked for most of the time. Why say that you are runner in the first place? Get on the train or car if you can’t run. The sea-plane challenge was so blatant. Also, I answered the QR code questions that came up at the end of the 5th episode. And it said that I’m on the right track."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Ski to three and you'll see how 'great' this show is
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,I think she's just dumb.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Joi is playing the game where you pretend to be the mole to get others to eliminate themselves. 

Osei would still be in the competition if it was Joi, he was convinced"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I think it's Joi, and I think she's an Australian actress they hired. A few times she's said something that isn't an American turn of phrase in her confessionals and it makes me wonder about her."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Its avery FACTS
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,I agree with this 100%. They all seem to be sabotaging each other for no apparent reason (I guess to lead the other people to believe they might be the mole and throw off every one else?) and there is no way to eliminate the mole to win the game which is bizarre to me. So basically the mole can literally sabotage without reprocussions and make it to the end? You give the villain plot armor in a reality show? I don't get it.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,They did like 2 seasons back to back and called it something different a year ago when they acquired the original seasons.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,I've been wondering this too 👀
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,😂
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Plus the math, on the episode bank heist. Two people thought it was a guy and one went home. It was evident"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,agree
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Well now we all know it’s a him. Prob should delete as a Spoiler
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"not sure how this version will handle things, but in the original seasons, eliminations happen until there are just three players left (one of whom is the Mole). After the winner is crowned and the Mole is revealed, they have a reunion show where they go over some of the key ways the Mole sabotaged various missions. They also go over some of the clues that were put into the show by the producers to hint at the identity of the Mole."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,https://old.reddit.com/r/themole/wiki/index
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Yeah, he was the original host in the early 2000s"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The mole isn't playing the game, don't think of them as a contestant with a special role. They're not playing for the money.

The mole's incentive is that Netflix hired them to be The Mole. They are the obstacle, the plot device, whatever you want to call them but they're not a contestant.

> It just seems like everyone is pretending to be the mole in order to confuse everyone else and that just makes it boring imo.


While most of the challenges are co-operative, only one contestant can win the money so  you *do* need the other contestants out of the game. You need other players to increase the pot *and* you need for them to lose. It's not guaranteed to work, but part of the strategy is to whittle down the playing field by getting them to vote incorrectly. 

Sowing confusion also defends *you* because if you're not correct about who the mole is, you need people to get more questions wrong than you. If they're answering questions about you and you're aiming at someone else, you're more likely to get a higher score on the quiz than they are even if you're both wrong. They'll lose while you proceed, and you continue to gather information and narrow the playing field. You exaggerated a bit with the ""everyone is pretending"" because it's not true. Some of the players are genuinely screwing up or making really poor plays and the editing room will highlight it and play it up because that's what reality tv shows do."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Everyone on TV is in makeup to look good on the cameras, and Netflix has contracts with designers to dress the people on their shows. They’re probably all wearing stuff from a small handful of designers."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"A bit late to the party here, but Greg confirmed in an interview after the season that he was the only person on the cast to apply, the rest of the cast is all influencers or friends of a friend in production.  Jacob, for example, is a actually an aspiring actor who just did the firefighting thing part time."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"It's her, from her introduction to her team mates on the first episode she avoided eye contact and seemed uninterested in who the other players were."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"THIS. If she isn't the mole, she's stupid omg. I can't rationalise her actions and how she manages to screw up every mission she's in."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The mole is getting help by the producers, their goal is only to keep prize pot lower.

The vote out is for most persons voted  the wrongest  for the questions who the  mole is.  SO the mole will be exempt, and everyone that votes all personal questions and the mole name also exempt...

To stay on show you may try to be incompetent and screw over other players, if they think your the mole and your not they will miss a higher percentage of questions.

Also if you could get 3 people together vote the same as you and you figure out who is mole that group could go to the end


This is why Anderson said in season 1 he had no clue what was going on."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"same thing you just did, by using that pronoun. Whoopsie baby"
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Shining I edited it mb
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor," I agree the original the players did not look like runway models at every moment in the game, they truly looked like normal people, in the way the people on the amazing race do look like normal people. 

I'm ok with it I'm just rolling with it being a scripted version of a reality show I liked, it has intrigued me, to run thru the 1st 6 episodes in 2 days and looking forward to the rest

This is on the same level of show as Cobra Kia in my mind."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"All of the cast being influences doesn't surprise me. But Jacob seemed the least fake because he had tons of nervous tics throughout the show. Greg seemed so incredibly over the top that I thought he was the mole for the longest time. And Joi just seemed like she was the mole intentionally sabotaging, but in the end she was just very very dumb."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,the eye contact thing is a myth. Liars are actually more likely to maintain eye contact in order to build trust
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I stated that was probably their plan to begin with but my point about not being able to eliminate the mole is ridiculous. And it's too easy to act as if your the mole when there is no reprocussions for doing so other than making the pot slightly smaller. It's a bad idea to not have a way to win from the get go, in my opinion. I understand the game; it just isn't for me. I am not saying you shouldn't enjoy it. Just pointing out my issue with the game as a whole."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,It’s no more or less scripted than any reality game show where the producers ask leading questions I interviews. The US has tons of laws on game shows to the point where you can be confident it’s not rigged and the winners/losers are not scripted.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"I mean I agree, but it has been this way since season 1, it's the ultimate mind trip game, this is the reason Anderson Cooper stated in season 1 he had no freaking clue what was going on.  He was just their for the ride.  It does amaze me that this season getting the card th stay in game longer has major screw the team elements and their seems to be little revolution for doing so.  In the original that element was their as well."

Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"> Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay.

I think this is more a judgment on certain members of the audience than it is the show. In Gilmore Girls, all of the various characters make errors but they still remain protagonists. Nor does the show flinch from showing the negative consequences of their actions.

So when you hear people who are re-evaluating the characters, they're not really making statements about the show so much as their own failure to understand it on first viewing. Even worse, they're re-evaluating on the naive and simplistic premise that good people can't also be flawed people."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Having messed up messages is more problematic when the subject matter at hand is  family/kids shows since kids will actually take the messages to heart many times. While messed up messages in adult programming is still bad because it's meant to be taken more seriously and should have more complex stories and messages, I don't think it's as much of an issue there because adults typically don't carry as many messages from shows as kids do, and they can usually use their own logic to identify when a message is bad and why it is bad. 

Many of these examples are from kids/family shows so I think they're reasonable arguments to be made."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,People constantly talked about how Lily is literally the worst and Marshall deserves better when it was airing.

Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Your list of 10 things are all numbered ""1"", instead of 10, 9, 8..., I assumed it was intentional and had a meaning I was missing, or it was an inside joke on the sub or something."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"From my end it looks like they are numbered 1, 2 ,3 ,4 in that order. 

I do not know why it isn't that way on your end."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Huh, that's weird af. Maybe it's because I'm on mobile. Idk."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"If you like that sort of series opening, you should check out at least the first episode of ID: Invaded.  The main character wakes up in a mysterious dimension with no more context than the viewer has.  Without spoiling too much of the mystery of the first episode, I think I can mention that it's a sci-fi crime series, sort of similar to Psycho-Pass."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Whose line, when Drew Carry says the opening thing."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Battlestar Galactica when the hybrid chick in the water tank said the words ""chosen one."" I knew it was all just slapped together mess from then on."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Supernatural after season 5 whenever a new big bad would show up. But the moment you realise it the most is when they do the story of the Leviathens as ancient creatures that were around before the angels. When it kind of contradicts previous things and makes you wonder why they were never brought up before.

Someone already said The Legend of Korra. Which is the case because the writers didn't know how many seasons/episodes they would get."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,New Girl and the Jess/Nick break up in S3. There was no foreshadowing and it just came out of nowhere.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,Recently with This is Us when they revealed a certain character never actually died.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The X-Files. Even as early as the original airing of the S2 premiere it seemed clear to me that the mythology was going nowhere in particular, just jerking viewers around with no real plan or goal in mind, and that a long series of “the rug gets pulled out from under Mulder and Scully again!” endings were in store in all the myth-arc episodes. Other people seemed certain it was all going somewhere but eventually most admitted the monster-of-the-week episodes were where it was at, and the mythology was tossed-off nonsense."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,the blacklist when Liz came from the fucking dead (turns out it was a trick all along) and at some point it was just treated as normal. there have been so many moments in this show like that but that was just the first for me.
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"American Horror Story, every season without fail is written as if they had a really good idea for a 5 episode season then where told they had to make it 10 episodes instead."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Lost, of course."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"The Man in The High Castle, 

The premise and setting kept it interesting for a while, but they clearly did not flesh out any sort of story outside of (maybe) the first season. It had some good points but most plot threads were left unanswered or veered of in a completely unsatisfying direction.

Could've been a much better series as it great costumes and props, but the story just meandered around for 40 episodes.

If you compare it to a good Philip K. Dick adaption like Blade Runner (yeah I know some people prefer the book) it takes the story and changes it substantially to reflect different themes and explore introspective ideas.

The Man in The High Castle could have explored how WWII changed the world by comparing it to a alternate reality, even the wolfenstein games kinda do that better than that tv show did.

Anyway I didn't hate The Man in the High Castle, but it just has some much lost potential."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Friends, with the Joey & Rachel romance arc. Made no sense and really shouldn’t of happened. Felt out of place."
Akashic Record of Bastard Magic Instructor,"Every multi-season show is being made up as it goes along, although some are more obvious about it than others.

One that I would say was very obvious is Orphan Black. Every season it seemed like they defeated the bad guys and solved the mystery, but then the next season it was revealed that actually there was this whole other thing going on in this other place that we had no idea about."
Jack Irish: The Series,"I cannot believe the first ever Peacock original TV show to chart was The Best Man: The Final Chapters! 

Also nice to see foreign language Alice in Borderland take 9th in the originals chart."
Jack Irish: The Series,"If you’re a double agent, and I’m a double agent, and HE’s a double agent… Then that means… wait. What was the plot again?"
Jack Irish: The Series,Not surprised. Jack Ryan is a decent show like most Tom Clancy stories are. Can’t go wrong with a good spy show in my opinion.
Jack Irish: The Series,"So of course, the next season of Jack Ryan is the last season"
Jack Irish: The Series,"Dad's and Dudes  unite!!!


Hollywood cant ignore us any longer"
Jack Irish: The Series,"I watched Season 3. I'm a cheap date with tv shows, but the flaws jumped out at me pretty obviously with this one. John Krasinski is likable, and I think he could honestly do a really good Jack Ryan if it was what Jack Ryan is actually supposed to be. But he can't pull off Jack Ryan, Action Hero.

I also felt like there were a few too many cases of, ""wait, would a spy actually be doing this in this circumstance?"" Like whether it's a phone call or talking to someone out in public or tailing someone way too obviously.

Finally, I don't know what the budget was for this show, but it was either too cheap, or got routed somewhere other than the screen, because they really cut corners visually.

Overall it just feels kind of lazy - lazy writing, lazy production values. And this season's plot was way too complicated for its execution level. Way too many Russian names, including a character that had a younger version of himself that went by a different name.

I wish I could tell you more about what I thought of Seasons 1 and 2. I know I watched them, but I can't remember a single thing about either of them."
Jack Irish: The Series,"really? this season was awful, worried about Russia trying to start a war? lol"
Jack Irish: The Series,"Pointless comparison,  the 2 segments of target audience for these 2 shows do not overlap."

Jack Irish: The Series,I watched both
Jack Irish: The Series,And like it’s also a new season? So new season v old season…
Jack Irish: The Series,These numbers are for the 19th-25th of December week.
Jack Irish: The Series,"- Jack Ryan (Prime Video), 1.9 billion
- Wednesday (Netflix), 1.8 billion

New Headline: Wednesday in its 5th week (and with lower runtime) nearly does as much a Jack Ryan’s opening week in the charts!"
Jack Irish: The Series,Maybe overall but not in the Nielsen charts. The Best Man: The Final Chapters released all 8 episodes to get these numbers in this particular week. Poker Face is releasing the first four episodes then going weekly for the next six episodes. That will hurt its chances in the Neilson charts.
Jack Irish: The Series,They did in Hunt for Red October. It was just an extension of that.
Jack Irish: The Series,I loved the first season but i could stand the premise of this one. I thought the season ended and then there was 2 more episodes. They didnt really understand what made the character interesting. Also the whole on the run from the CIA but i need to clear my name while saving the world bit is overdone at this point even for a generic show about the CIA.
Jack Irish: The Series,"bro same. i love pretty much every jack ryan thing ever made and i couldn't make it through season 1 of this show. it's pretty bad, like 3/10 at best."
Jack Irish: The Series,"It's not a good show.

The worst crime it commits is its boring. Which is shame as I can overlook everything else so long as it as engaging but, unfortunately it isn't."
Jack Irish: The Series,"I don’t see that personally, but that’s cool."
Jack Irish: The Series,Woosh
Jack Irish: The Series,Nintendo fans looking at Advanced Wars Reboot. You mean you don't have to shelve it?
Jack Irish: The Series,"should have dubbed over the russians in chinese and ignored everyone is russian, would be more plausible"
Jack Irish: The Series,"I enjoyed both, so clearly there is at least some overlap"
Jack Irish: The Series,Why jack Ryan is in its first week when it released almost a month ago?
Jack Irish: The Series,I believe in the Rian Johnson effect.. maybe.
Jack Irish: The Series,"They didn't, as evidenced by the fact that when the Americans board the boat, the Russians spoke in Russian.

The switch to English was just a very clever narrative device for the benefit of the audience to get rid of subtitles.

""*Armageddon*"""
Jack Irish: The Series,"Personally, I never mind that if it’s just well done like in Chernobyl. It’s actually a little distracting when they’re faking Russian accents since it always feels even more artificial than just leaning in and using their normal accents

I mean who does it really benefit since Russians would immediately notice and any American might not even really care if it sounds like they’re from some generic Eastern European country instead of authentically from Moscow"
Jack Irish: The Series,"Agreed, especially when you take into account that Ryan is supposed to be an analyst, not an operator. I know that in the show they make him go on the field, probably to make it more suspensful and have action scenes, but he does a LOT, i can't even tell where his job begins and where it ends."
Jack Irish: The Series,Now I know why they don't take people's opinions of stuff online.
Jack Irish: The Series,Bro what.
Jack Irish: The Series,"> Jack Ryan, whose third season premiered all at once Dec. 21, led all series for the Dec. 19-25 frame, with just under 1.9 billion minutes of viewing. That was good enough to edge out Wednesday (1.8 billion minutes), which had a four-week run as the top series title in Nielsen’s rankings."
Jack Irish: The Series,It’s definitely weird. I feel like in US movies they always make sure the Russians have UK accents. But in HFRO they did a nice transition from Russian to English to “explain” why. Connery does a few lines in Russian (i assume poorly) and mid sentence starts transitioning to English.
Jack Irish: The Series,Got it
Jack Irish: The Series,Let us know when David Hyde Pierce is back. See ya then! Ta ta’.
Jack Irish: The Series,Even though the last person to play Freddie is still acting?
Jack Irish: The Series,"So, for those who have read the article, it looks like Freddie is having troubles and will go live with his father. But he turned his back on the college education his father wanted him to have to become a fireman. So he is very intelligent but he chose a life of service, like his grand-father.

So it will be similar to the relationship between Martin and Frasier.

I wonder about the other characters, though."
Jack Irish: The Series,"Kelsey Grammer is a crack pot now.

He was good as Frasier but a lot of the charm came from Niles, Daphne, Roz and Martin.

I have a lot of doubts this show is going to be any good and nothing more then a cheap attempt for Kelsey to return to being relevant in Hollywood."
Jack Irish: The Series,">Years ago, Freddy rejected following in his father’s footsteps—dropping out of college to become a fireman

This is the kind of thing I was hoping for when I first heard them talking about a reboot - having Freddy go blue collar despite his parents constant efforts to model him after themselves."
Jack Irish: The Series,"To those of you on reddit who are writers I have a serious question and its not a slight to this show:

I know you are out there with original stories and characters waited to be brought to the screen. So are the studios simply just not willing to approve original content for the most part?

Or is it people creating reboots because they know/think it has better chance of being greenlit?"
Jack Irish: The Series,"going full English with this eh? good choice, Frasier always had a little bit of that vibe"
Jack Irish: The Series,"Okay, I'm more excited about this casting, although it's throwing me that he's playing Freddie. Love him (and his wife)!"
Jack Irish: The Series,I read elsewhere he is definitely not going to be in this.
Jack Irish: The Series,dang cause i think Trevor Einhorn is great tbh. it reminds me of mae whitman not being called back for independence day despite being great.
Jack Irish: The Series,"So they're rehashing the idea of the original Niles. He was originally going to be a blue collar working joe much like Martin.

Seems lazy, and it looks like no one else but Kelsey is back, probably gonna be a pass from me."
Jack Irish: The Series,">Kelsey Grammer is a crack pot now.

Source?"
Jack Irish: The Series,There are a lot of original shows being brought to television every year. How many of them though do you see getting high-level publicity for early casting announcements?
Jack Irish: The Series,">I know you are out there with original stories and characters waited to be brought to the screen. So are the studios simply just not willing to approve original content for the most part?

Original stories (calling it ""content"" is pretty devaluing in and of itself, really) are getting produced *all the time*.

The fact Frasier is getting a continuation doesn't mean nothing new (or rather, new AND GOOD - new and SHITTY doesn't do anybody any favors) is getting made. It's not an either/or sort of thing.

edit: Hell, this is on Paramount+, which is basically for a lot of people ""The Yellowstone App."""
Jack Irish: The Series,"Think of it this way: be it interested to watch or not, *we’re talking about Frasier*.


There’s no real…profit…from taking a risk on a new show. It’s all streaming, there’s no ads for the most part, so the only metric they can use to make profit is “what is gonna make people not cancel a subscription?”. Is it “therapist and sons” that might be awesome but has a high chance of not being discovered? Or is it a sort of empty-seeming frasier reboot? 


Frasier at least has the odds of making *a few people* go “huh, I’m probably gonna check that out”, and I think that’s enough. 


People hate ads in streaming, but I think once it becomes more commonplace, we’ll be able to afford some more risks again. Until they can afford some more stable revenue outside of “more subscribers all the time forever and ever”, we’re just gonna get remakes of shows lazily for audiences they can depend on. Which is nostalgic older people who don’t really care beyond “hey I liked that once”. 


I don’t feel jaded about it, it merely is what it is. All of our new systems and ways of doing things in the streaming era, which sort of upended a pretty stable market, are sort of in free fall. All these re-dos are sort of safe ways to keep it going while they all figure out how it actually needs to work."
Jack Irish: The Series,Maybe the new city is London? Freddie is an American character but if most of the rest of the cast is British then maybe they're shooting in the U.K. and so it's logistically easier than the American characters are British actors.
Jack Irish: The Series,Einhorn looks better for the part too. Producers clearly wanted to go down the good-looking heart-throb route.
Jack Irish: The Series,He's always been a weirdo conservative but also he manipulated his wife to join Real Housewives so he'd have time to cheat on her
Jack Irish: The Series,He's pro Trump.
Jack Irish: The Series,"He’s said that Vladimir Putin is his personal hero and the greatest living human, and that the Western press is brainwashing people against him."
Jack Irish: The Series,"Yeah there’s a new sitcom called Extraordinary starting in Hulu on the 25th with a cast of new faces.
It’s been reported in all the trades with casting.
But nobody cares like they do with Frasier."
Jack Irish: The Series,"But Paramount+ is also making a lot of original, non-franchise shows as well. They just usually don't get much attention unless they're tied to a pre-existing franchise.

Jack Irish: The Series,"At this point, triggered just means ""having any reaction whatsoever"""
Jack Irish: The Series,"The show's marketing made it look like knock-off Tom Clancy, so I imagine most of the audience are people who just like that kind of stuff."
Jack Irish: The Series,"The victim complex on some of these people is just absolutely mind blowing. If audiences like it and critics don’t who cares dude. Be happy it has a following, ignore the critics, and don’t go on the show of a bloated idiot trust fund baby to cry that it got bad ratings. Good lord it’s like everyone has to praise them or else it’s a crime against humanity."
Jack Irish: The Series,[removed]
Jack Irish: The Series,"I feel like part of the problem is that not every show or movie or whatever needs to be universally loved or hated.  I have zero desire to watch TERMINAL LIST just because it doesn’t look like something I would enjoy.  I don’t really care for military movies, but I’m also not going to get all huffy when someone else does. 

If you make a military-centered show, a lot of people aren’t going to like it, and that’s OKAY.  I don’t really like MS. MARVEL, but that show is clearly skewed towards a younger audience than me, and that’s also okay.  Not all media is designed for universal consumption."
Jack Irish: The Series,I just don’t think Chris Pratt was meant for “serious” roles. He’s at his best doing comedy which is why he’s so great as Star Lord. Fun action stuff on a solid foundation of lighthearted comedy.
Jack Irish: The Series,"Amazon sure has been leaning hard on the Military/CIA stuff as original series; maybe hitting a saturation point that is leaving people a bit tired of the genre.

I really enjoyed the Reacher series, but couldn’t get into this one at all - Pratt felt like a poor fit, and for whatever reason it just felt boring; just couldn’t draw me in."
Jack Irish: The Series,[deleted]
Jack Irish: The Series,"The funniest thing about all of this is everybody loved Reacher, which appeals to the exact same demographic. Maybe your show just sucks?"
Jack Irish: The Series,"I'm not interested in the accuracy of the 'battle' scenes or accuracy of the seal stuff etc but Terminal list was clearly dragged out to the 8 episode mark. Episode 6 was so bad it's like someone said ""Guys we've still got 2 more episodes to create. We need some padding"".

&#x200B;

Oh and another shout out for ""scenes so dark you could go make a coffee and not miss anything""."
Jack Irish: The Series,"I wasn’t “triggered” by Reacher. It was great. 

Maybe levity mixed with gunplay is needed sometimes?

Also, maybe people are burnt out on Rah Rah Soldier Boy content?"
Jack Irish: The Series,I’m listening to the book now on audible and this author has it OUT for democrats. Says in the beginning of the book “politics aside…” but continue to ONLY mention Dems. Seems political to me.
Jack Irish: The Series,Well of course he does
Jack Irish: The Series,"He's right though. My trigger list is ""dialogue that sounds like it was written by a 13 year old boy"" and every clip of this shitfest I've seen so far sends me off the chart."
Jack Irish: The Series,"Lmao imagine saying this sentence unironically and in public. He's gonna say critics are ""cancelling"" him next isn't he? Though I think Amazon should probably think about that."
Jack Irish: The Series,"I don’t care about Chris having a religion or anything, but the show was boring. The constant and repetitive scenes of him hallucinating just got annoying and I found myself skipping ahead constantly"
Jack Irish: The Series,"yeah, i admit it. mediocrity is a trigger for me."
Jack Irish: The Series,"I went into this completely blind as a chris Pratt fan, hated the first 2 episodes but was confused enough what was real that i kept it on in the background the rest of the day, final episode I just shut it off. The story is generic revenge b movie but with none of the fun of a generic B movie or anything Chris Pratt. His name alone will never get me to watch something again, such a bland show."
Jack Irish: The Series,"Oh good, I can skip this show. Him unironically using the word triggered told me everything I need to know about it 😂"
Jack Irish: The Series,"Stay off my list, and my lawn, and my motorcycle. And that’s all I need, maybe this remote control, but that’s all I need."
Jack Irish: The Series,"You want to talk real triggering, go look at some 1 star reviews of this season of the boys. Wah wah wah woke wah wah wah. I just saved you the trouble."
Jack Irish: The Series,"I HATE the fact that the phrase “Triggered” has been co-opted to mean almost anything which in turn means it means nothing. 

It used to be a term predominantly used for when someone with a mental health illness had and episodes caused by environmental factors. As someone who has PTSD (under control
Now) hearing every uneducated troll use this term and watering it down to what it is today just pisses me the hell off."
Jack Irish: The Series,"If “triggered” now means NOT having shit taste, then yeah I guess he’s right.

Also, Tucker Carlson? Really?"
Jack Irish: The Series,"I really enjoyed the books in spite of the thinly veiled political commentary (I’m both a veteran of the 82nd airborne and a left-leaning person) and thought the show was a crappy adaptation that magnified what I didn’t care for in the books. if you think the story seems interesting, save the time on the show and read or listen to the book- it’s a genuinely fun and suspenseful read- but jack carr should stick to writing and Chris pratt should stick to comedy, imho!"
Jack Irish: The Series,perhaps people are just tired of all the war porn lately?
Jack Irish: The Series,I liked it. Maybe went too long for what there was. Didn't like the ending.

46,I pray that one of the actors will win next year
46,BCS never winning any award is certified my opinion that I simply do not give a fuck about awards for reference to how good a show/movie is. What utter nonsense

46,And Game of Thrones Season 8 gets to have 12! What a sick joke!
46,"The BCS outrage over people thinking this was the final season of eligibility ironically makes me think of the pre-taped call-in show sketch from Mr. Show.

“How could you not award the final season?!”

“This Emmys isn’t FOR the final season! That’s going to be NEXT year when we do Part 2, which just aired. Tonight we’re talking about PART 1!”"

46,"I’m not being a dick but is it really necessary to take these award shows seriously anymore?

46,Always Sunny failed to win an Emmy too. So it's clear to me that the Emmys don't appreciate real art worth a shit.

But this immense amount of shows is clearly going to end."

46,Good. The Emmys don’t deserve Saul’s name attached to them. When will these award shows finally die? Who the hell is watching anyways?
46,Awards are rubbish.  BCS is incontrovertibly one of the best tv shows of the last 25 years.
46,"I really thought the upset with would be Jason Bateman for Ozark. But the reaction shows that even he was pretty shocked by the choice.

Seriously, who gives a fuck? Awards shows are completely meaningless."
46,Just really proves that the Emmys don't mean fuck all.
46,"Incorrect, Emmys failed to award BCS anything despite 46 nims in 6 seasons."
46,"Sunny hasn’t won anything ever and it’s been on since the Bush administration, awards don’t mean shit in the long run."
46,Will go down with The Leftovers as the biggest load of bullshit ever.
46,Perhaps it’s because I have no almost no way of watching it short of buying it from Amazon. Heck I even bought that garbage streaming service platform they have just to see they only had the end half of the season and didn’t have the first half at all anymore.
46,Severance deserved better too.
46,Maybe 20 years from now they will win the Susan Lucci lifetime achievement award
46,This show was kinda shit ngl
46,"I only made it to season 3, I thought the show was boring"
46,The Emmys are a joke and won’t exist in a decade. Viewership was down 25% from last year.
46,"I mean, maybe this is why rating for the Emmy’s are down?"
46,We all know why
46,"Fast fact: the Wire never won an Emmy. They got two nominations for writing, but zero wins, ever.

The Emmies are impossible to take seriously."
46,Succession was good but man do ppl like to suck it’s cock
46,"Which begs the question: what more do these people want from a TV show??
BCS is as close to flawless as a show can get IMO."
46,Guess AMC didnt care enough to buy one.  BCS is a hugely loved show without needing a worthless advertising tool attached to it
46,"Fucking bullshit dude, but tv is so stacked with quality shows right now.

*Oh nice it has a chance to win still!"
46,All went to Ted lasso? I smell corruption
46,The Emmy's are just a joke now as well
46,"The thing about the Emmys is that if they don't give you love early, they probably won't ever give you love. If they do, it will be in your last season where they try to make up for snubbing you for so long. 

It is what it is, Better Call Saul is far from the first or last example of the Emmys being bad judges of television."
46,"Maybe I'm missing something but I can't see how Whote Lotus was even *nominated* for anything (other than Jennifer Coolidge), yet alone basically sweeping.

That show just doesn't do anything for me :/"
46,The SNUB is real.
46,IASIP syndrome. Sad to see it with other good shows.
46,It makes zero sense. It's literally one of the best television shows ever made?
46,I guess that means it wasn't any good and you're dumb for liking it.
46,The Big Bang Theory winning industry awards in the comedy category is the truest indicator that awards are incredibly pointless.
46,Shoulda Called Saul
46,Bob won the Emmy in my heart
46,"Too many white actors. Basing awards and hiring people based on a percentage system based on skin color instead  of merit is a form of racial discrimination and not legal. At least, that used too be the case just a few years ago."
46,"Honestly the Emmys, and Oscars are such a joke. It's not about who deserves it anymore. It's all about politics."
46,I'm genuinely trying to figure out if the creators really pissed off the Academy somehow.
46,"Julia Garner is great on Ozark, but earning her third Emmy for her role with a mediocre final season is weak. Rhea got robbed. If she doesn't win next year (specifically for fun and games), we riot."
46,"I think people assign far too much value in the circle-jerk of Hollywood awards.

For example, Emmy voters only gave it a puny two nominations for writing across five seasons of The Wire, with no wins. Somehow, it is considered in the top five or top ten American television shows of all time."
46,I was really surprised how much I loved this show because I didn’t like breaking bad. Really one of the best shows I’ve seen this decade.
46,Fucking robbery. Best show on television this year by far.
46,"I am so disappointed. This year felt very rigged, especially with Rhea’s snub."
46,Emmys are a sham
46,I honestly don’t give a shit if something is award winning or not.  Still a great show.
46,Total bull shit
Gypsy,Deb's therapy sessions on *Dexter* since it pretty much pushed Deb into believing she was in love with her brother when she'd never shown any indication of that before.
Gypsy,"Maybe not a bad representation of a therapist, but a representation of a bad therapist: Melfi in The Sopranos.

Her relationship with Tony takes a number of turns. She starts drinking before sessions, expresses to her own therapist that she finds it therapeutic for *her*, backpedals on her suggestion that he should move on to CBT to appease him, not to mention it seems everyone in her life seems to know who the patient is at some point. At least she rebuffed his numerous sexual advances in some semblance of professional integrity.

Honorable mention for: ""Those were some tough Jews."""
Gypsy,That svenjolly in Seinfeld.  Elaine has a relationship with him that not only is abusive but probably highly ineffective therapy. Poor Kramer.
Gypsy,Lucifer and Linda
Gypsy,The therapy sessions in Gilmore girls are terrible
Gypsy,Any show that acts like group therapy is the only therapy a traumatized character will get.
Gypsy,"Betty Draper's therapist on Mad Men. Going behind her back and telling Don everthing so he could throw it back in her face. Awful. Probably accurate for the 50's though, since Don paid the bill and 'has a right to know'."
Gypsy,Falcon and the winter soldier.
Gypsy,Olivia Benson had a therapist played by Bill Irwin who was terrible with insights and boundaries and at point gifted Benson a necklace
Gypsy,Wednesday’s therapy sessions.
Gypsy,Dexter
Gypsy,Gypsy
Gypsy,Hannibal seems like a pretty shitty therapist.
Gypsy,"Not necessarily therapy, but Devil in Ohio revolves around a trauma specialist that was completely not based in reality at all…I am usually not bothered by things like that but I had to turn it off it was so unrealistic (I work in that field)"
Gypsy,Not TV but the therapist scene in [There's Something About Mary](https://youtu.be/TlsgKlLkrUg)
Gypsy,"Not TV, but Dr. Leo Marvin from “What About Bob,” seems like a good choice to me."
Gypsy,Have you watched Hannibal by any chance?
Gypsy,Silence of the Lambs
Gypsy,The finale of *The Patient*
Gypsy,Silver lining playbook and sopranos 😂
Gypsy,"In 9-1-1, the therapist sleeps with her patient on the first session. Can't even express how much of a no-no this is."
Gypsy,I just had to write a paper on this for a therapy and counseling class. 50/50 has one of the most inappropriate therapist/client relationships I can think of.
Gypsy,"The Girl on the Train. Therapist allowing his patient to embrace him while he stands there and holds her? It was a plot point too, which was a little weaksauce."
Gypsy,Probably Sopranos but the best was Atlanta
Gypsy,[deleted]
Gypsy,"The therapist from Lucifer who fucks her patient, and his brother."
Gypsy,I would have to say the episode on George Lopez where there's a school shooting in Max has to go see a counselor with his dad George and it turns around and Austin George is the one going to therapy with this therapist who at best this barely a mediocre actor. Just a horrible sad scene.
Gypsy,"The one in Donnie Darko and also The Departed (who was supposed to have been a psychiatrist so I don't know if that counts).  Just...bad.  I saw Donnie Darko so long ago that I can't remember the specifics of why it was bad, I just remembering revisiting that movie several years after it came out, and I was a little older, and thinking, ""this woman is not a good therapist."""
Gypsy,How I Met Your Mother - Robin's court-ordered therapy went a little sideways
Gypsy,Tina Fey in Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is drunk the whole time.
Gypsy,"Oh, man, it was Alan Arkin in *Eros*. He had Robert Downy, Jr. on the couch and was looking out a window with binoculars paying no attention at all. I mean, talk about lacking all professionalism and ethics. I would definitely fire that therapist."
Gypsy,Lucifer
Gypsy,The therapist on Ricky Gervais’ _After Life_ was not good
Gypsy,"Color of Night-group therapy scene.  Everyone has a completely different issue and they can all just talk or do whatever.  I cannot figure out how anything would get addressed.

https://youtu.be/3B4c0pv3TU0"
Gypsy,In Treatment.
Gypsy,"Iron Man 3. I'm not that kind of doctor, Tony."
Gypsy,"Afterlife is an obvious one, although I’m not sure realism was ever the goal with that character and the entire show is trash anyway, so we’ll let them off."
Gypsy,Ted and his therapist in Something About Mary.
Gypsy,All About Eve. They didn't know back then.
Gypsy,Based on what I've seen the Wednesday one is up there
Gypsy,Suits.
Gypsy,The therapist on Two and a Half Men was hilarious but awful.
Gypsy,Getting the sense that I’m the only one who watched *Surface*. But that’s my vote.
Gypsy, Big Little Lies me thinks
Gypsy,"Just dropping in to say that if a mob boss visited a head shrink ala The Sopranos and his guys found out about it, he'd wind up in the trunk of his car."
Gypsy,"Not on-screen, but special mention to the DC ""event"" Heroes in Crisis. 

Part of the ""therapy"" is using a virtual environment to relive your trauma over and ove."
Gypsy,The therapist in 50/50 is the worst therapist ever
Gypsy,The couples therapist in Ozark
Gypsy,"in southpark, where they have everyone, even the pizza guy and the denver broncos go into mr mackeys subconscious bc he wouldnt pick up his office bc he got raped by an owl mascot. 

never been to therapy but that didnt seem like the way to do it"
Gypsy,Baby-steps
Gypsy,13 reasons why
Gypsy,Pete Holmes' therapist sketches are pretty brutal. He's either a complete idiot or just intentionally malevolent.
Gypsy,Violet in Private Practice is a god awful therapist.
Gypsy,"It would be interesting to hear the best on screen examples of therapy, they’re hard to find!"
Gypsy,Ik op asked for the worst but the best therapy sessions had to be Two and a Half Men with Jane Lynch
Gypsy,"After Life ... dude was so hammy, unfunny, cartoonish and forced it made me dislike the series. He didn't appear in the last season so maybe I wasn't the only one."
Gypsy,"I recently finished up “Tell Me All Your Secrets” and the therapist marrying his client 🤢 that he met when he was 25 and she was 16, a foster child. Not sure why we needed that gross storyline"
Gypsy,"Lucifer.

So much is bad but sleeping with 2 of her clients and having a baby with one is not even the worst."
Gypsy,"We were watching The Blacklist last night, season 2, with the therapist who is trying to extract information from the FBI agent. She sat down with her afterwards to tell her that she thinks someone has gone into her brain to block a repressed memory and that the memory she had probably had the correct people but that they were mixed around. WTF?!  lol"
Gypsy,I forgot about that ridiculous storyline...what the hell was that?
Gypsy,Cunnilingus and psychiatry brought us to this.
Gypsy,"The Sopranos is full of terrible therapists, from Melfi to Elliot to the hippie that tells Meadow not to give up on traveling to Europe after Jackie died. The only good one we see is the one who tells Carmela to divorce Tony and acknowledge her complicity in his crimes."
Gypsy,"I think ""representation of a bad therapist"" is what a lot of these things break down to.

One, there are bad therapists in real life. I've encountered them. 

Two, a good therapist in a show is going to nullify much of the drama. Good therapy would ruin most plots and character arcs."
Gypsy,Alright but ya gotta get over it
Gypsy,I thought the representation was pretty bad in S01 where the therapist explains to Tony that his dreams about birds are proof that his mother is trying to kill him. LOL WTF.
Gypsy,I bet she pronounces Gif wrong as well.
Gypsy,Came here to say this. That was the point though.
Gypsy,"After the sleeping together parts…. Some of it was rather good. 

That being said….. much of it was completely rushed and not representative of how long it takes growth to happen. Hyper cliff noted version of healing and self realization."
Gypsy,The therapist just allows them to sit in silence for an hour and seems fine with it
Gypsy,Very effective for when the character needs to have a big dramatic scene where they blow up at the group and the therapist stares them down whole they continue to break down though
Gypsy,That’s probably very accurate of the time period.
Gypsy,"She isnt really a therapist, shes a government agent paid to monitor his mental state."
Gypsy,"So glad this is the top comment. That therapist is awful,  and she gets thanked in the end. It was ridiculous."
Gypsy,"Hell, the entire show is atrocious. That speech he gives at the end is so tone deaf."
Gypsy,They had therapy in that show?? I didn’t see it but it seems kinda off
Gypsy,I recently watched this show and was so trusted by her portrayal as a therapist. Crossing literally all ethical boundaries and lying about patient progress to her colleagues (and likely insurance). Just so inappropriate all around.
Gypsy,Or one could argue that he was too good
Gypsy,"More of the patient being the issue in the therapeutic relationship. We only saw one actual session with the patient. We don't know enough about Dr. Marvin's practice, despite being a bit full of himself. Bob, on the other hand, is the nightmare of any provider. It's a horror movie, not a comedy."
Gypsy,Yeah she never got billed for the session.
Gypsy,She did indulge Tony's sociopathy for like 8 years.
Gypsy,"Listen to him, he knows everything."
Gypsy,"It's even worse because he goes there to discuss that he thinks he might be a sex addict.  But in this case it wasn't like he tried coming onto her, it was started by her."
Gypsy,such an awful show
Gypsy,Anthony's got the A.D.D.!  He's got it BIG TIME
Gypsy,"I think Melfi was a bad therapist, but I think that was done on purpose. The portrayal by the writers and actors was well done imo."
Gypsy,That Atlanta episode is amazing
Gypsy,I’m struggling to remember therapy sessions in You’re The Worst.
Gypsy,"Also towards the end of the series where he takes Benny to therapy to help her quit smoking and the therapist blames George for how he speaks to her. She's been smoking since before he was born and abusive to George his whole life. She defined the relationship and led it down this path. But somehow if George didn't crack a few jokes about her, she'd stop smoking.

It's telling that despite Benny being emotionally stunted and without enough awareness to ever really realize she could be wrong, she was the one who saw what this supposedly experienced and well educated therapist couldn't, that they were both bad for each other, like a reverse codependent relationship, and the best solution for them both was to create distance so they wouldn't stress each other out."
Gypsy,"She hypnotizes him and after a little while he starts jerking off so she wakes him up. He notices his hand's down= his pants and he just looks at her like ""wtf?"""
Gypsy,Alan Arkin in Grosse Pointe Blank on the other hand...
Gypsy,Surprised a had to scroll this far for that asshat
Gypsy,I’d argue it kind of worked on the two people he worked with
Gypsy,"God, I *love* Color of Night, and the absurd group therapy scenes - where people just, like, scream ""FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE"" at each other and mock the kid with gender dysphoria and laugh at the guy with OCD and their therapist does absolutely *nothing* to put a stop to any of this - are part of it. It's the worst fucking group imaginable. No wonder the therapist ends up getting murdered."
Gypsy,"The old episodes kind of are since they are so sensationalized. 

The new ones are pretty good / ethical although she is going through a crisis herself."
Gypsy,That was perfect
Gypsy,"> Afterlife 
the rickey gervias show ?"
Gypsy,I can’t stand the scenes with him because it feels so unrealistic and doesn’t contribute any humor to the show
Gypsy,"Why? I would put her in a ""best"" category"
Gypsy,what about our friend who got court ordered after the thing with his wife?!  they’re very happy now.
Gypsy,I try to keep it out of my mind. Such an awful twist for her character
Oh My Ghost,"While it has all the fundamentals of Dark, i dont think this show quite captured the “spark” that Dark was so famous for. Too many one dimensional characters for my liking, so above average at best."
Oh My Ghost,"Dark just copied that Ethan Hawke movie ""Predestination"""
Oh My Ghost,"I’m a big fan of Dark, so I’ve started this but after watching 2 episodes I have to admit it hasn’t really grabbed me yet, I’ll give it one more episode, but tbh I’m just about ready to tap out."
Oh My Ghost,"Would be interesting to see how it performs for people who have NOT seen Dark think that is likely the most important thing.       

Lot of Dark fans will likely watch it even if they dont think its good"
Oh My Ghost,"This show has a much longer slow burn than Dark S1, because Dark’s premise started immediately (time travel). You don’t even get to anywhere near the premise until episode 5 or 6."
Oh My Ghost,"It feels like they spent more time setting up the mysteries than actually creating intriguing characters, everything feels very storyboarded and stiff. But I’m also only on episode two so will watch at least four before I make a judgement. I like all the actors enough and the setting is fantastic. I just wish they could draw me into the atmosphere more, it feels like everything is just place to place with nice outside shots and then people meeting and having mysterious conversations."
Oh My Ghost,"I didn't see Dark (though now I want to watch it). I LOVED the earlier 1899 eps, but the ending is falling flat for me (I'm in the middle of the final ep now... and as you can see I'm on Reddit on my second monitor). 

I really don't like the twists that came in the latter half (even though they're being explained in this final ep), I wish we knew a lot LOT LOT more about the characters, and the pacing just seems to be totally off. It feels almost as if the entire Lost, all the seasons, were packed into 8 eps."
Oh My Ghost,"Not sure if you would prefer, but the NFL app is also showing it for free. No subscription required."
Oh My Ghost,I find CBS looks really rough when coming through my Fios box but on Paramount Plus the game will look nice and sharp.
Oh My Ghost,"Fox will broadcast in 4k though, which only ABC will also do."
Oh My Ghost,"Ha, always look forward to FOX having it since they’re the only ones who bother to do it in 4K (upscale, but looks way better than broadcast 1080i).

Give it a shot - as long as you’ve got the Fox Sports app and a fast enough connection you’re good to go. No cable login needed."
Oh My Ghost,"I'm just glad it's not on NBC.  I'm a YouTube TV customer and in my area, every time SNF would have a replay where they were using the telestrator/video marker, the feed would drop for 1-5 seconds.  I opened a ticket with YouTube TV, but they couldn't resolve it.

With Fox, I have noticed that they seem to always have 1 or 2 cameras that are shooting SD quality.  Not sure if it's a camera issue, signal issue, or broadcasting/transmission issue."
Oh My Ghost,I think many people forget about antennas. OTA TV is broadcast in HD as far as I know. Whenever I watch local channels it's crystal clear.
Oh My Ghost,"What, you don’t like the big dancing battle robot?"
Oh My Ghost,Really? I hate CBS because their games have a weird grey tint and seem to go an hour longer than usual.
Oh My Ghost,Fox and NBC do the best coverage.
Oh My Ghost,20 years in broadcast distribution here. All these 4k comments are funny. Broadcast is not 4k.
Oh My Ghost,I just wish they'd kick-off a few hours earlier so we can watch it in the UK without having to stay up half the night zzz :)
Oh My Ghost,"It sounds like your local affiliate, not Fox themselves. My local ABC station is pretty low budget and still broadcast at 720p, and the difference between them and other stations, all doing 1080p in my market, is noticeable."
Oh My Ghost,"The audio on Fox sounds so different than any other network, it lacks … depth? Bass? The stadium is mic’ed in a manner so cheering sounds hollow and disembodied. The mix is off as well: announcer overlay volume sounds too loud,  game sounds too quiet, fans too quiet. Been watching football on Fox since Fox has had football and it has always been hard to watch a game on fox because it sounds so different. I really enjoy the sound of NBC Sunday night football the most (It was perfect until they replaced Al Michael’s big game voice with Mike Tirico’s ESPN higher pitch. Regardless of how they call the game, Michael’s has a fuller voice). As I’m typing this all out I slowly am realizing my thoughts on this are probably really weird!

Am I crazy? Do I have some weird Audio thing that I’ve completely made up in my head?"
Oh My Ghost,"YouTube tv has it in 4K hdr. Idk if it’s real, but damn it looks really good. Way better than the 1080i or 720p"
Oh My Ghost,Fox Sports app has removed restrictions for today only so ANYONE can watch the game for FREE as long as they have internet and a device that they can download the app to.
Oh My Ghost,There's always the puppy bowl.
Oh My Ghost,Fox has the best coverage on the Super Bowl. They have been for years.
Oh My Ghost,fox is the only network that has shown the superbowl in 4k.  This is the second time they will
Oh My Ghost,You could watch a British one with a VPN.
Oh My Ghost,What you talking about mate.. BBC showing it? Lol
Oh My Ghost,"I've been reading comments and with all the streaming apps that exist nowadays, TV shouldn't be the reason why some broadcasts look horrible. They need to do something to finally take this to the next level when you see European sports that are Broadcasted in 4k they look and sound so crisp its beautiful. The fifa WC feed for example looked so good and makes you wonder why sports that costs billions like NFL or NBA can't make the final step to finally improve. Some feeds aren't even in 1080p and that's pathetic."
Oh My Ghost,Thats why my family just gathers around the AM radio for the super bowl
Oh My Ghost,"I agree 100%. Fox compression is terrible, and most games on it look terrible."
Oh My Ghost,Denver is the same. Fox looks like they’re using technology that’s a decade older than everyone else around here. It’s awful. Even the colors are off.
Oh My Ghost,Announcers are terrible on fox too
Oh My Ghost,I like how over the air Fox in the Atlanta area worked perfectly fine all day long UNTIL the Super Bowl came on and then it looks as fuzzy as late night 90’s Cinemax. They have to lower the broadcast range for the game because the commercials are clear as can be.
Oh My Ghost,It's means no Bob's Burgers.
Oh My Ghost,I tried but their stream is ass.
Oh My Ghost,They also talked about how rupert murdoch and elon musk are tech geniuses leading to the future or some fucking shit live during the game. Fucking scum
Oh My Ghost,They are the only network doing 4K broadcasts which are noticeably higher quality than the other networks 1080 broadcasts. Would recommend upgrading your equipment to take advantage of the 4K stream if you are having issues.
Oh My Ghost,Last year NBC had it and stuck it behind a paywall.
Oh My Ghost,"Disagree. Fox has the best graphics in my opinion. I can't STAND the CBS packages. NBC is just blah to me.

If the robot mascot doesn't make an appearance I will riot though."
Oh My Ghost,"Plus we have to see ads for the fucking bastards over at Fox News, along with the ones paid for by that Christian anti-LGBT/womens right hate group... ""He Gets Us"""
Oh My Ghost,Yeah I don't watch Fox on principal. They are the originators of modern reactionary media.
Oh My Ghost,Idc if they show “the big game” on Lifetime. As long as I don’t have to listen to Adam archuleta on color
Oh My Ghost,I solved the problem of having to watch the super bowl on Fox. I don't watch it at all.
Oh My Ghost,Watch on the Fox Sports app. It will be 1080p or 4K depending on your setup.
Oh My Ghost,Let’s just be thankful there is no Tony Romo today.
Oh My Ghost,My Fox comes in perfect! Maybe move
Oh My Ghost,Meh I can’t notice any difference
Oh My Ghost,"Dafuq.  Looks perfect to me. Upgrade your equipment and speed? I downloaded the FOX Now app right before the game. Will delete after though, lol."
Oh My Ghost,"Just think, not even 20 years ago the broadcast looked like it was 1980s quality. Now, if it isn’t looking like 5K HD Ooba Looba Ding Dong quality  and you can’t make out the start of whiskers on the players y’all whine the quality isn’t good enough. Good lord."
Oh My Ghost,"I just can’t stand Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, they’re so fucking boring."
Oh My Ghost,"FOX is owned and run by such garbage ruinous anti Democracy MAGAts, I hate watching anything on any of their branded networks.  The only thing I watch on any FOX network is football, since there is no other choice, but when I've got one, they don't get my eyeballs."
Oh My Ghost,Don’t blame the network for your shitty local station.
Oh My Ghost,1st world probs.
Oh My Ghost,"Where can I watch if, hypothetically, I don’t wanna pay?"
Oh My Ghost,"The worst part is we have to listen to Greg Olsen’s annoyingly smug voice.

I wish it was on CBS where we get to listen to Nantz and Romo"
Oh My Ghost,"I remember back when fox started carrying the Super Bowl, what seems like every other year, I would always ask a buddy who kept with it more than I did what network had the Super Bowl. If it happened to be on fox he’d just look at me and do some exaggerated fox sports sound effect with his mouth. Followed by me saying, that’s what makes my hangover worse the next day, drinking enough alcohol to get through the broadcast without losing it."
Oh My Ghost,I’ve been saying this for years lol. Almost all of my Vikings games are on fox and I’m like “dammit I wish it was on cbs” lol
Oh My Ghost,FOX sucks!!
Oh My Ghost,Watching the end of the game...it seems the audio drops and comes back over and over again. Is it my setup? Is anybody else hearing this? What's going on?
Oh My Ghost,NBC is the best. Crystal clear
Oh My Ghost,"I hate Fox mostly because their commentary fucking sucks, even now they've replaced Joe Fuck and Potato Head."
Oh My Ghost,It's all shit dude. Owned by the same 4 guys.
Oh My Ghost,"It's in 4K, so that's how I'm watching it. Thank you Fox!"
Oh My Ghost,I wish it was on Saturday and also at night time. Last year's halftime show was epic but it felt like I was watching a rehearsal with it being in daylight. Felt weird.
Oh My Ghost,God I love Fox.
Oh My Ghost,If it's on FOX why isn't it on MSNBC?
Oh My Ghost,"It should always be Buck and Aikman, regardless of what network or brand they are employed by. They’re the best broadcast duo in the NFL."
Oh My Ghost,"It’s a you problem, Fox looks the best and they do 4K."
Oh My Ghost,Although they are saying it’s 4K this year I believe it’s just upscale 1080P. Still will look better than most other things down the same pipe.
Oh My Ghost,"Happy for Burkhardt and Olsen, a fantastic team all year, but yeah, the Fox presentation is always in the uncanny valley to me. Overly sanitized and looks like if an AI art program was told to run an NFL broadcast. CBS is still the gold standard"
Oh My Ghost,"As long as it looks better than my illegal streams during the season to watch the Ravens, I'm fine with it. Can't be worse than having to refresh every 10-30 minutes and click out of 5 ads"
Oh My Ghost,NBC has an awful audio delay.
Oh My Ghost,"I prefer FOX over CBS. CBS always looks like the worst quality compared to FOX, NBC, Prime and ESPN. It seems that way to me anyway when I'm watching RedZone and they bounce between CBS and FOX for eight hours of commercial free football.

Honestly though I'm just happy I get to hear KB call the game. As a Mets fan I'm stoked for the guy."
Oh My Ghost,Fox is broadcasting in 4K
Oh My Ghost,"I have verizon fios, and fox has it on the fox 4k channel. I have watched other sports in 4k, and no idea if it true 4k, but it definitely looks much better than the regular chanel"
Oh My Ghost,Stream it with the Fox Sports App.  Much higher quality (4k if your TV does it).
Oh My Ghost,For those who want to know why they aren’t  more sports or networks that broadcast in 4K this video might be helpful https://youtu.be/UX75uEq9IdU
Oh My Ghost,Fox has the best sound mix as far as bringing in the crowd noise.
Oh My Ghost,"You can wish in one hand and crap in the other, see which gets filled first."
Oh My Ghost,Now that you mention it you are right lol how is that so?
Oh My Ghost,"I usually like Fox doing the Super Bowl, but no Troy Aikman and Joe Buck at Fox makes it less good."
Oh My Ghost,"I Wanted To See Someone Post The WHOLE ENITRE Super Bowl On Youtube, So That Way I Won't Have To Watch It On Fox. If So, Is There A Link On Youtube For The Super Bowl?"
Oh My Ghost,Here in Sioux Falls it’s our NBC affiliate that suffers from the problems you’ve described. Sunday Night Football is almost unwatchable. I’ve talked to people in the industry who say it’s due to the secondary channels that the affiliate also broadcasts that eats up the bandwidth.
Oh My Ghost,The picture quality isn’t the issue for me.  It’s the crappy Fox announcers (yes I think Joe Buck and Troy are  far superior to whoever these guys are)And we’ll also have to put up with the shots of various Fox tv series actors sitting in the stands pretending they are there because they care about the game.
Oh My Ghost,Use the fox sports app. It will look great
Oh My Ghost,Just watch via the fox sports app. It looks great.
Oh My Ghost,It used to be on BBC one In my country no ad breaks now it's on itv and for some reason sky at the same time
Oh My Ghost,I prefer fox broadcasts but i guess it's just what I'm used to
Oh My Ghost,Probably something on your end. This isn't true for everyone.
Oh My Ghost,Completely disagree. CBS looks like shit and fox is consistently the best.
Oh My Ghost,They gotta use all their high tech $ trying to make Sean Hannity look good.
Oh My Ghost,"I get the four major networks on my antenna. NBC, ABC, and CBS all broadcast at 1080, FOX is still at 720."
Oh My Ghost,"I think Fox looks the best 🤷‍♂️ 

NBC has the best overall presentation though. CBS looks outdated. ABC/ESPN is mid."
Oh My Ghost,I think the replays on SNF and TNF are the best
Oh My Ghost,FOX is the only network that broadcasts in 4K for the Superbowl.  So happy for that.
Oh My Ghost,"Fox on antenna works perfect *until* there is a big football (either type) or baseball game on here in the Tampa market. Garbage talk shows and infomercials come through crystal clear all day, but the moment that whistle blows it's pixelated or the signal drops completely. NFL, NCAA, World Cup, World Series- all of them. I watched the Univision coverage of the World Cup on Peacock.

Free Fubo trial for the Superbowl today, maybe another service trial in 4 years with a different email address, who knows. What's frustrating is almost all of the networks broadcast from the same antenna array here in the Tampa Bay area and my antenna is aimed in that direction. Every other channel works fine, it's just Fox and just during games."
Oh My Ghost,I am down with fox because they have Terry Bradshaw and I love that man
Oh My Ghost,"At this very moment, sound isn’t synced with mouth movements."
Oh My Ghost,Maybe your antenna has an obstruction.
Oh My Ghost,"Last year, the hotel offered to install an antenna in the rooms because the satellite was garbage. It was crystal clear 1080 with bunny ears."
GLOW,I will die mad that this show got cancelled with all those unresolved cliffhangers.
GLOW,"It bugs me that they actually did film an episode of season 4 before cancelling, ughhhhhh."
GLOW,I’m still not over it. Damn I loved that show.
GLOW,I need Alison Brie back on my tv again. She never misses on the small screen
GLOW,"Once again:

Who keeps linking Paste as if it's an actual outlet? It's a severely debased clickfarm wearing an old magazine's skin. Reddit is literally the only place I've ever seen anyone treat that place as somewhere worth paying attention to.

What's going on here?

Like, it seems to solely exist as a generator of links for nervous redditors to use as a means to hopefully generate karma, if not conversation (but primarily karma). There's never any useful information (or good writing) behind those links that I'm guessing basically never get clicked. 

In closing: GLOW was a great show, and I do hope Netflix eventually does a TV movie wrap up or something. or fuck it, just a full season 4 set 10 years in the future or something."
GLOW,"We just needed one more season!!!

I miss this show so much it was my favorite :("
GLOW,This and Bunheads are the two shows I just want more of so badly DX.
GLOW,"Netflix, we want Season 4! Give it to us!"
GLOW,"Well this is weird. I just finished the Christmas episode this morning. 

Is Reddit spying on me? Should I put pants on?"
GLOW,"Eh, it was going down in quality there towards the end. It would have been nice to see a conclusion, but not the end of the world imo."
GLOW,"Show had 3-4 seasons, max. The real story had an  end so should the show. They were stretching thin already"
GLOW,Do I think it had more than 1 good season left? Not sure. But man I’d watch more in a heartbeat.
GLOW,This show was great. Worth a watch even though it ends unresolved.
GLOW,"""is that the one with the anal birth?""

loved GLOW, the best Netflix show I've seen. An actual anomaly in a sea of garbage content. Funny, heartfelt, engaging, sincere. Empowering without being grossly unbalanced, subtle and not preachy, feminist but without feeling the need to destroy ""the white patriarchy"" at every turn. Just an all around amazing show"
GLOW,I’ll be forever mad about this and the Babysitters Club.
GLOW,"I really liked the first season and watched the second season, but if fell off."
GLOW,I really loved this show.
GLOW,It was one of the few shows me and my wife enjoyed watching together. Still very bummed about it being gone.
GLOW,Glow in the 80s got me out of bed on Saturday morning.
GLOW,GOD DAMN RIGHT IT DOES!
GLOW,"We are still bummed about this at our house, this show was so perfectly written and the Character dev was so promising in season 3, I wish someone would revive it."
GLOW,This was a wonderful show. Bring it back!
GLOW,This show was great and with some of the absolute garbage Netflix continues to produce I am left absolutely baffled as to how they could let this one go.
GLOW,"Glow, the society, teenage bounty hunter, the OA, the show about girl from it.

Impulse and wayne

Those are the heartbreaking cancelation i ever have for investing my time in tv series"
GLOW,Can Amazon swoop in and save the day here?
GLOW,What a great show and so much opportunity that’s just thrown away… so very disappointing
GLOW,It was such a fun show! I was really invested in the characters and their relationships
GLOW,Went on a two month email campaign to Netflix over this show. Heart broken they pulled it.
GLOW,Such a shame. They should at least make a movie length episode to finish it up
GLOW,That show was awesome
GLOW,It's disappointing because it was a show that didn't rely on plot to be successful. It had a really great cast of characters that still felt like they could be fleshed out more.
GLOW,I hope another network picks it up…it’s a shame who doesn’t like TnA and wrestling…wow haven’t said since WCW was a brand.
GLOW,It sucks that Netflix couldn't even give us a movie to wrap up the show.
GLOW,She was topless in the first episode. That was pretty cool
GLOW,"I really thought one season was just the right amount. Interesting premise, but it ran its course."
GLOW,"Actual clueless writer.

> There’s something to be said about the streaming service’s proclivity for creating imaginative and entertaining series and canceling them too early, all while lesser shows get renewed for seemingly endless seasons. Unfortunately, GLOW fell victim to Netflix’s pattern of cancellation;

Does she really think a streaming service would give ""lesser"" shows more seasons without a reason..

Also what were they supposed to do? they couldnt film because covid and to hold all the actors in a contract when it was unknown how long it would last makes no sense.

Probably wouldnt make sense to try get the actors back together later also, most will move on to new stuff and wouldnt be 
available at the same time."
GLOW,I so badly want them to bring this show back. It was DAMN good
GLOW,Sure it had unexplored potential - the premise and cast were great. The show just got boring.
GLOW,This is the major downside of streaming. All services are slaves to the almighty algorithm.
GLOW,"Sure it was pretty good, but not *that* good."
GLOW,So many boobs left unseen
GLOW,Ew no. It was going nowhere. Final season was awful.
GLOW,"People need to stop using the word “cliffhanger” all the time. GLOW did not end on a cliffhanger. 

Yes, there were more stories to be told. But unless the universe literally ends at the end of your show, that will always be the case. 

Would anyone say that Breaking Bad ended on a cliffhanger just because one character was shown driving away? I sure hope not. (Yes, they eventually made a movie to address just that, but it was hardly a narrative necessity.)

GLOW s3 actually wrapped up quite nicely, and would have worked totally fine as a series finale if no one knew s4 was in the works."
GLOW,"Show was so good. I understand with contacts and all that jazz they had to cancel instead of going on a long hiatus, but it still sucks."
GLOW,I enjoyed this show so much and was very disappointed when it was canceled. I love pretty much anything set in the 80’s so this was right up my alley. Netflix made a mistake by not completing this series.
GLOW,This show wasn’t great but it was fun to watch.  I feel like it ran its course even though we didn’t have a definitive ending.
GLOW,"Never saw it. Barely, vaguely sorta recall a show named that. Feels like it aired a really long time ago."
GLOW,[deleted]
GLOW,Netflix's reign of terror must end. Put them out of business.
GLOW,I haven’t touched Netflix since this happened.
GLOW,"Nah, it’s deserved it and it potential peaked and wasn’t good enough"
GLOW,One of their better originals. Another reason Netflix is going down the drain.
GLOW,First season was awesome.  Stopped watching half way through the second
GLOW,Ohhh do I hear an opportunity to start a list of shows that Netflix broke our hearts with cancelling early? I’ll start: Sense 8
GLOW,Good riddance!   Its sucked!
GLOW, A gaudy show about an unintelligent pastime was basically doomed from day one.
GLOW,"I’m going it be honest, I’m one of those people that just never got around to it. I’ve heard great things though, sorry that’s my bad"
GLOW,Honestly I’m glad it ended with me wanting more than continued until I hated it
GLOW,This is one of those rare cases it actually wasn’t netflix fault. They green lit the last season but covid fucked up the scheduling and the actors contracts expired.
GLOW,Betty Gilpin was a revelation on this show.
GLOW,im still holding on to the AO getting rebooted.
GLOW,"Me too. It's so frustrating after investing so much time and growing so fond of the characters.

Similar to when they cancelled Mindhunter"
GLOW,they literally approved that final season. they should have given it a treatment. like it was already ending.
GLOW,I mean sure it sucks. But covid. How do you do a wrestling show with Covid Protocols? You can't. Hence why netflix canceled the show and released the actors from their contracts. It was too expensive to keep the actors locked up for 1+ years(unsure how long covid protocols would be there)
GLOW,Netflix is the ultimate blue baller network. I'm still super pissed they never finished Marco Polo. In my opinion one of the greatest television series ever
GLOW,"I remember reading and it made some sense that Netflix tends to do this because as seasons go on they get more expensive.  Those shows with big names probably get there faster, so Netflix bags them to focus on the cheaper ones."
GLOW,"People need to stop using the word “cliffhanger” all the time. GLOW did not end on a cliffhanger.

Yes, there were more stories to be told. But unless the universe literally ends at the end of your show, that will always be the case.

Would anyone say that Breaking Bad ended on a cliffhanger just because one character was shown driving away? I sure hope not. (Yes, they eventually made a movie to address just that, but it was hardly a narrative necessity.)

GLOW s3 actually wrapped up quite nicely, and would have worked totally fine as a series finale if no one knew s4 was in the works."
GLOW,Add it to the pile with Santa Clarita Diet
GLOW,Can we at least view said episode? So disappointing.
GLOW,She's pretty good in movies too. I liked her in Spin Me Round.
GLOW,*Annie’s boobs
GLOW,People still post Forbes and Newsweek links on Reddit. It's utterly bizarre.
GLOW,"That's how reddit works. The literally only thing that matters is the headline. 99% of all upvotes are based on that. Source? Doesn't matter. Content? Doesn't matter.

Find yourself a catchy title on some random website and just post it on reddit, and you get all that sweet, sweet karma."
GLOW,"I don't care for Paste, but this seems to be a part of an original series of articles they're doing, and not just some regurgitated BS. Worth a share imo, and always good to remember how GLOW was"
GLOW,Or a movie.
GLOW,"Ugh yes! Justice for Bunheads! I feel like the show took a while to find its feet but once it did it became this wonderfully charming, weirdly bittersweet show that nailed Gilmore Girls’ eccentricities without its more grating quirks."
GLOW,3rd was a very good season regardless. My only complaints were a lack of wrestling and humour
GLOW,"I'm actually kinda sad I watched the last season. The first two seasons were perfect and I would've been happy if I stopped at season two in hindsight. I only wanted a fourth season so it would ""fix"" the downward trend from season three. Not sure why they leaned away from the ""fun"" atmosphere and themes of empowerment of the first two seasons."
GLOW,"Yeah, as soon as it started to meander I was out. Really enjoyed it at first but I don’t get the mourning on this one."
GLOW,Yes.  There is a 100% certainty that season 4 would also have cliffhangers with a hope Netflix would pay for a fifth season.  It's business
GLOW,"As a guy who started watching it for the wrestling, it's very much a chick show & I mean that in the best way.  Pro wrestling in the 1980's was dominated by toxic masculinity, a bunch of drugged out, juiced up, competitive ""alpha"" males in a secretive dog eat dog industry that operated outside of the law by it's own unwritten rules.  It's fascinating seeing outsiders, not just as women but actresses, tackle the same challenges in such a unique way.  It's a great juxtaposition & can be very eye opening at times."
GLOW,"Great performances all across the ensemble too, but especially the main cast"
GLOW,I actually think season 2 was even better. Season 3 drags a bit though
GLOW,"Season 2 was much better than season 1, which was already very good"
GLOW,"> Does she really think a streaming service would give ""lesser"" shows more seasons without a reason..

The reason is viewership. She's lamenting the popularity of mediocre formulaic fare. She's not wrong, it's just a trite observation."
GLOW,"I'm really not sure where in that quote or really the article in general you're getting the idea that the author doesn't know why shows get cancelled. We all know there are many reasons why. Doesn't mean those reasons are necessarily fair or that they're even justified for everyone. 

TV and film are at an intersection between art and commerce and it's up to these outlets to balance those two things. Netflix puts more weight on strict commerce while other outlets like HBO and Apple weigh art a little more heavily as the means to the profit end. Criticizing Netflix's reasoning for going the other direction (which quite frankly the article doesn't even really do, it just states it as a fact) is perfectly fair. At HBO it's much rarer to see an Emmy nominated/winning series get the axe because of production delays. What apparently doesn't make sense for you or Netflix would make a lot more sense to the head of HBO or Apple."
GLOW,"I mean, it was covid, no one was working and when actors did they all roughly started working again at the same time. Wouldn’t it make sense to have them on the ready?"
GLOW,"GLOW's cancellation had nothing to do with the algorithm, a 4th and final season had been commissioned. The problem was that as it was the final season all the cast and crew had dates their contracts would expire on (so that they could start booking work for the future). Covid hit just as filming started and as they couldn't get around Covid protocols there was no way of filming it before everyones' contracts expired."
GLOW,They just had to hit the right taste clusters
GLOW,Not a cliffhanger but there were surely a lot of open threads and unresolved character arcs at the end of season 3. A very far cry from a nice wrap up
GLOW,They had already renewed and had begun filming season four. The cancellation had nothing to do with the quality of the show and everything to do with COVID.
GLOW,Ooh unlike all the amazing MCU shows that are so awesome and keep getting seasons
GLOW,It's only superficially gaudy. The show had a lot of depth and subtlety
GLOW,Do you mean The OA?
GLOW,"Mindhunter hasn’t been cancelled, just in undetermined hiatus."
GLOW,Fincher chose to not do mindhunter S3 not netflix(tho it is expensive). Sucks but there is no Mindhunter without Fincher.
GLOW,"Mindhunter Season 3 is still on the back burner, don’t lose hope!"
GLOW,Mind hunter was not canceled by Netflix
GLOW,"I’m holding out hope that Netflix will eventually see that people loved Glow and they bring it back. 

Times running out though.  

They’ll probably be forced to do a time skip by the time they do though"
GLOW,And Santa Clarita diet 😭
The Slayers,"Gellar on Starring in a Buffy Reboot:

>""I am very proud of the show that we created and it doesn’t need to be done. We wrapped that up.”  

  
>“I am all for them continuing the story, because there’s the story of female empowerment. I love the way the show was left: ‘Every girl who has the power can have the power.’ It’s set up perfectly for someone else to have the power. But like I said, the metaphors of ‘Buffy’ were the horrors of adolescence. I think I look young, but I am not an adolescent.”"
The Slayers,"It would have issues because of the cast alone.

Spike and Angel's actors simply can't play immortal vampires anymore. Nicholas Brendan is probably completely unemployable until he gets some long overdue help. They already killed off Anya and Cordelia.

That's before you get into how like half the cast wants nothing to do with Whedon anymore and that Whedon himself is a major no go right now.

SMG, Hannigan and Trachtenberg are probably the only 3 you could realistically keep running with. Maybe Anthony Head. 

It might be interesting if you could get Noxon, Fury, and Espenson back in the writers room but that's probably the only chance it has."
The Slayers,"The buffyverse is an incredibly fleshed out and brilliant universe with a lot of potential 

Pick another slayer in another era and tell a different story completely unconnected from Buffy 

A period piece would be brilliant.

I’m surprised no one has done this yet"
The Slayers,Make a spinoff about the Hellmouth over Cleveland instead.
The Slayers,God I respect her so much for this. Not everything needs to be rebooted. Try and get some new ideas
The Slayers,"Agreed. It doesn't need to be done. 
This will unfortunately have absolutely zero bearing on whether it will in fact, be done."
The Slayers,and that's why we love her
The Slayers,"I mean she is 100% right.

Create a new show with a new slayer not named Buffy and not set in Sunnydale.

You get to have your own show and characters without pissing off the original fan base."
The Slayers,"Lets be honest, we all know it would have sucked.  Hollywood does not respect any IP or the fans."
The Slayers,"The finale screamed for a subsequent anthology series. AHS style, following a different slayer in a different city (world wide) with periodic overlaps for team ups to face specifically big bads."
The Slayers,SMG doesn’t need cash. That’s good.
The Slayers,"Half-joking with this but hear me out, instead of a Buffy reboot, we get a spin-off where Kendra gets brought back from the dead and the plot twist is that Bianca Lawson STILL plays her because she actually is a vampire IRL. She does not age."
The Slayers,"Give us the Giles ""Ripper"" prequel you cowards."
The Slayers,We'll always have the Musical.
The Slayers,"Buffy was a fun show and a vampire slayer mini-series could be good, too, if written well. You could have 10-episode seasons and focus on a different slayer. For example, I remember a scene that showed a kung-fu Chinese slayer from ages ago. It'd be a blast to watch her fight Chinese Ghost Story-type baddies."
The Slayers,"Even if it did need to be done, why would you recast the old Buffy to be in the New Buffy? That's stupid."
The Slayers,Gotta respect someone for not rebooting something that already had worked and run its course.
The Slayers,I loved Buffy. I don't want any sort of reboot. I would however like some sort of continuation of the story with an entirely new cast. It's very well set up for exactly that. They could potentially grab SMG (or another original cast member) for one special episode- i doubt she'd say no to that. Could also potentially be an anime- easier to showcase all the magic and powers of the slayer (and bad guys) without breading the budget of what would otherwise be a (potentially) expensive show given all the needed special effects.
The Slayers,We do need answers to some burning questions like: aren't Angel and Spike corpse-cold to the touch? Does Buffy not retch from the reek of dried blood breath? You think kissing a smoker is bad.
The Slayers,She literally said no to money out of principle. You don't see that every day. Good for her.
The Slayers,"For the best

Lets face it Whedon might be an asshole but history shows

If he isnt in charge, stuff based on his work usually sucks"
The Slayers,Respect
The Slayers,Augustus St. Cloud howling at this statement.
The Slayers,"Probably for the best. I love Buffy, but it ended almost 20 years ago and the story was pretty well wrapped up.

If anything it was Angel that had a cliffhanger ending, unless you read the follow up comics."
The Slayers,"The show WAS the reboot. 

It’s already been done, doesn’t need to be done again."
The Slayers,Wasn't her show a reboot of the movie?
The Slayers,"Another redditor once pitched the idea that Buffy is living a normal life and hides the fact she’s a slayer from her husband and kids. One days she takes out the trash and is attacked by a demon only for the scooby gang to show up to kill it. I’d love the take of grown Buffy coming out retirement or even being a watcher or something. It’d be cool if we could see a snippet of her life even if was just for an episode in a new story. However, I respect that she’s done.

Ripper would’ve been a great story."
The Slayers,I don't understand why they haven't/won't do an animated series. It could be so good.
The Slayers,This wouldn't happen without Wheedon. He's notoriously obsessive over this show and likes to be puppetmaster. No one would want to work with him again.
The Slayers,She’s such a queen 🤩
The Slayers,Already being made. It's basically what Wednesday is. Mythical monsters? Check. Teen girl who is just good at everything? Check. Bunch of other weirdos around her? Check. First bf turns out to be a maniac? Check. Etc etc
The Slayers,Thanks god for SMG
The Slayers,"***ReVAMP***, headline writers, ""Geller shuts down starring in Buffy revamp""!

For god's sake, it's right there"
The Slayers,"It really really, doesn’t need to be done.  Reboots are becoming an absurd meme of Hollywood, constantly playing the nostalgic angle and rarely succeeding to recreate the magic of original content.   Bringing things back to inject current social norms is also tiresome.  Goddamn. Where’s the creativity these days?  You know what I damn well mean!!!  There *has to be* new original content out there, probably sitting stagnant on some desk but won’t get green-lit bc of fear of not turning a profit."
The Slayers,Good for her for not taking this obvious cash grab. That show was just as much about Joss' scripts as it was the actors. I think everyone knows it would suck without Joss' writing.
The Slayers,She's 100% correct. We don't need a Buffy the Vampire slayer reboot. A Buffy TNG though could be interesting but it doesn't need to happen.
The Slayers," I dread a direct reboot just because they always seem to turn out like garbage.

Warrior Nun is legitimately the perfect spiritual successor to Buffy, in my opinion. Really hoping they get picked up because I'm hooked on the lore – *so* much potential."
The Slayers,"If there is money to be made, it will get done.

-any greedy Hollywood producer"
The Slayers,Sanity prevails.
The Slayers,Respect.
The Slayers,"100% don’t fucking reboot beloved, perfect tv shows. hope this show crashes and burns and the show runner who greenlit it"
The Slayers,Finally someone in with some sense... Reboots are generally not better than the originals and most of them don't need to be done. It's purely a profit-driven practice to milk the nostalgia of gen Xers and millennials.
The Slayers,This is true of all reboots…
The Slayers,Good on her for having the guts to say it
The Slayers,"I mean it all ended with dam comics, they didn't really finish it on TV, same with Angel"
The Slayers,"Sad as i am to say it, she's right."
The Slayers,This is the most rational news headline Ive seen in years.
The Slayers,It needs to be done because Hollywood is out of ideas and loves money.
The Slayers,"Good, I absolutely agree.  It doesn't need to be done.  Want to watch more Buffy?  Just rewatch the show again, it's more than good enough.  Really want to know what happens after the end of the story?  Well, there's a comic series that picked up the story and was even written by Joss Whedon if you really must go that route."
The Slayers,It’s great being an 80s kid. I get to watch my younger years microwaved shows with awful writing and worse acting /s
The Slayers,Unpopular opinion: that show and universe is fine as it is. It doesn't need a reboot and it doesn't need a spin off.
The Slayers,"Agreed. Enough with the reboots. Let's have the talented writers pitch original television/movies. 

Seems like the writers with original content are not being heard."
The Slayers,"I'd like to see Gellar as the mom in a conventional teen drama centered around her kids as high school students doing TV high school student things... but every now and then you get a scene like Gellar washing her stakes and knives as the kids come home to tell her about their day. Strange events would occur - skies darkening, earthquakes, etc. - without any explanation and would just end up being resolved while the kids stress about making the cheerleading squad or their latest love triangle."
The Slayers,I have honestly never cared about this show at all.
The Slayers,"I don't want season 8.  I don't want a remake either.  


But a story continuation in the same universe with different characters would be the sweet spot.  And that leaves the door open for the odd cameo should anyone wish to do it"
The Slayers,"I agree with the sentiment that we don't need a Buffy reboot, but if there was one why would Sarah Michelle Gellar be starring in it? She's 45."
The Slayers,"You could argue her Buffy show was ""a reboot that doesn't need to happen."" too. And it turned out to be pretty good after a rocky start."
The Slayers,"I agree with her, do something new."
The Slayers,"Haven’t heard anything from her in years, first thing is a shameless repudiation of reboot frenzy even though it may be financially lucrative. Lots of respect"
The Slayers,It also probably wouldn’t last more than a season in today’s environment.
The Slayers,The TV show WAS the reboot.
The Slayers,I would argue that as a society we're ready to be done with anything associated with Joss Whedon.
The Slayers,"I mean, the original Buffy didn't need to be done. So, good for her for growing up."
The Slayers,Cell phones would make that whole series 5 minutes long
The Slayers,"People crying for a sequel, reboot, anthology, whatever and then get surprised when Disney launches 15 shows in a year with the same IP. Just let things end with grace. Let new things pop up."
The Slayers,She must still be doing very well financially.
The Slayers,Buffy was an artifact of it's time.
The Slayers,The first series didn't need to be done either. No tv show or movie needed to be done.  Doesn't mean it won't be re done anyways
The Slayers,"Most reboots can fuck all the way off. The only legitimate reason to reboot, or remake something, is if the original was lacking in some way. I’m not a fan myself, but every single woman I’ve ever met absolutely loves Buffy, and would spit on the floor in disgust at the thought of a reboot, or anything that would retcon or diminish anything at all in that universe."
The Slayers,"Once she sees that paycheck ""it absolutely needs to be done, they convinced me we'll do it right"""
The Slayers,FFS stop rebooting shit! Have an original fucking thought for once.
The Slayers,Also she’s no longer a high school teen so…
The Slayers,She’s always said no. She’ll never work with joss whedon again. He was too abusive.
The Slayers,"Glad she was real about it. It'd end up being total shit crammed with woke, shallow agendas that serve only as a checklist in an effort to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Especially in this day and age where streaming services become more desperate.

I'm not saying a younger generation's adolescent experiences are somehow not significant enough or whatever (they have a whole new world of material that could be used) to match the OG show but rather studios today are so inept that it'd come off that way. It'd just be hollow."
The Slayers,"Isn't ""The Chosen One"" by definition, required to be a teenage girl? I thought ""Slayers"" aged out, or do they usually just die before they make it to adulthood?"
The Slayers,She already WAS in the reboot
The Slayers,thank god. That last season was rough enough
The Slayers,She's right. Also she's difficult to work with with so that's another reason.
The Slayers,Jenna Ortega
The Slayers,"How about ""Cissy The Vampire Slayer"" starring Kathy Garver?

/obscure?"
The Slayers,"Buffy is a product of it's time. What made it special in the 90's early 2000's is how everything is done now. You throw it all together now and it looks like any other CW baked show.

The only thing you get with Buffy now is the lore and the supporting characters. And the lore of Buffy isn't that great. And really you can't reboot Spike and Angel because the actors really made those characters. 

If you really want to continue Buffy then the best way to do that is break the universe. It's not the world we know but something drastically different. Vampires and other monsters have taken over, they each have their own countries or places of power. Maybe there's pockets of humanity. That's probably too much budget wise but just returning to the high school procedural is going to look like so many other products already out there."
The Slayers,Goddamn I respect the hell out of SMG for this statement.
The Slayers,"She’s a true artist.

Ugh bless her"
The Slayers,"Yes, it does. I’d love to see a big budget, all-in reboot."
The Slayers,So then write zero words about it
The Slayers,"I wouldnt want to see a new buffy, or spin off with the way hollywood is now, they are woefully inept at doing an actually good show and all they want to do is push a totally unrealistic storyline, look at rey(cant do anything wrong, good at everything), they are even worse with trans or nonbinary characters( only well done char was M in motherland fort salem because being nonbinary wasnt all the character was, they were an effective soldier, but not perfect) and you can bet they would be jamming gay/trans/nonbinary chars in at every possible opportunity, they need to stop jamming these type of badly written chars into EVERYTHING, there is a place for all characters if they make sense in the story, but a show needs a story, not just gender box ticking"
The Slayers,Didn't the world end at the end of the series?
The Slayers,She doesn’t own “buffy the vampire slayer” lol. Who cares what she thinks needs to be done?
The Slayers,"... she says after staring in a reboot no one thought needed to happen.

Am I taking crazy pills? The whole show was a fucking reboot."
The Slayers,"Senora, you better get your coins."
The Slayers,"Eh, I dunno. I'd be interested in seeing a middle-aged Buffy juggling being a Slayer and a normal adult life."
The Slayers,https://share.getcashto.com/@rocboyz4life

The Slayers,"Should've stood up for Whedon, but at least she's saying something worthwhile here."
The Slayers,What did she think they’re going let let her reprise the main character role? She ain’t black.
The Slayers,very disappointing. who does she think she is??? she OWES it to us!
The Slayers,[deleted]
The Slayers,Translation: “it’ll be expensive to get me.”
The Slayers,"The dialog is painfully unnatural, like hilariously so bad."
The Slayers,She worried about people seeing her turkey neck.
Free Rein,This will go well
Free Rein,"Everyone's gonna be expecting him to do something crazy, like talk about himself as Picasso or play Taylor's phone call. Honestly, the funniest thing he could do is just do a normal, inoffensive performance, maybe Real Friends or Saint Pablo."
Free Rein,"The big surprise!

Free Rein,"i can see the promos now
*NEXT ON THE VMAS JUST WAIT TO SEE WHAT KANYE WEST WILL DO*
*IN 10 MINUTES KANYE WILL HIT THE STAGE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT TO EXPECT*
*YOU ARE 5 MINUTES AWAY FROM KANYES APPEARENCE #KANYEVMA*
This will hopefully backfire on MTV,They are just using Kanye as way to get ratings like last year when they had Miley Cyrus host just hoping she did more crazy shit and like she kind of did,but at the same time she seemed pretty awkward on stage"
Free Rein,For four minutes. Who gives a shit?
Free Rein,omg i can't wait for sunday
Free Rein,God help us! Kanye needs to be exiled and never allowed to come back. He's soooooo annoying!!!
Free Rein,Makes sense. MTV hasn't given a shit about music in years
Free Rein,If that piece of shit is on then I won't watch. 
Free Rein,I like the angle.  Take the fun out of it for him....much like how one would deal with a 4 year old.
Free Rein,"Rihanna, Future, Ariana Grande with Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears.. Plus Kanye West doing some pretentious egotistical crap.. I honestly don't know if there's a lineup i'm less interested in watching perform. "
Free Rein,"[After ratings for the VMAs dropping significantly last year](http://variety.com/2015/music/news/video-music-awards-viewership-plummets-on-mtv-1201581910/) you can bet they're counting on it not going well, to build buzz and so everyone and their friends are sharing clips of the outrageous thing Kanye did the next day."
Free Rein,I would love to see him perform Saint Pablo! Such a great song.
Free Rein,Watch out man you might cut yourself on that edge.
Free Rein,"""Edgy"" doesn't mean ""opinion I disagree with."""
Free Rein,"imply something isnt music when it literally fits the definition just to piss people off is, he should have just said he personally found kanye to be poor quality music and opinion that is wrong but is an opinion "
Free Rein,"so, its okay with all of you?"
Free Rein,go away fluffykerfuffle1
Free Rein,what? are you a sausage vendor?
Free Rein,The janitor from scrubs was supposed to be only in j.D's imagination and only supposed to be a minor insignificant part of the show.   By the end he was a major character and one of the many many many reasons scrubs is the best show ever made.
Free Rein,Jesse from Breaking Bad. He was only supposed to be around for season 1 as a way for Walt to be introduced to the meth world. He acting was so compelling they decided to keep him around and make him a main character. 
Free Rein,"Carol on The Walking Dead. In the comics Carol is a pretty weak character and dies pretty early on in the comics, but Melissa McBride is such a great actress she brought so much out of that character and created a character with so much potential. She was supposed to die in season 3 instead of T-Dog, but they decided to switch it to delve deeper into Carol’s character"
Free Rein,"John Noble got the role of Walter Bishop in Fringe [because he created the broken, yet self-awarely humorous tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-x37G0U1sI#t=07m30s) that came to define the character in large part."
Free Rein,"**Fonzi** from Happy Days

Went from wearing a wind breaker and being mostly in the background, to being offered the staring role of the series. ( he turned the offer down) 

Don't forget the jacket...

**Spike** from Buffy.

Went from guest star to series regular. 

Went from the bloodiest bad guy (only surpassed by ""Angelus"") to fighting for his very soul for the love of a vampire slayer

**Castiel** from Supernatural

Again, from guest star to series regular.

Started out as soldier of God, leading his garrison.

Transitioned to  guardian, champion  and protector of the Winchesters.

edit: forgot Fonzi's jacket"
Free Rein,"I don't know if it really counts but Fitz from Agents of SHIELD. Started out nerdy and awkward but after the writers saw what Iain de Caestecker was capable of (aka making us cry all the time) they made his storyline quite tragic and the character became, dare I say, a badass."
Free Rein,"Michael Emerson on Lost was going to be a minor character in only a few episodes, he was so chilling and creepy they made him into the leader of the Others."
Free Rein,"Donna in Parks and Rec was almost a non-character in the first two seasons, however, Retta made her into quite a strong female supporting cast member. She developed a chic mystique around her and elevated the show with it, IMO. Treat yo’self!!!!"
Free Rein,"Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard. His character started out as a gruff hard case who didn't like kids and was not particularly friendly to underlings.

But Stewart is much too warm and charismatic for that, and so Picard mellowed out and became one of the most admirable characters in sci-fi. "
Free Rein,House benefited greatly from all of Hugh Laurie's other talents.  
Free Rein,"Here's another example: Bob from Twin Peaks. Wasn't even meant to be a character. The guy who plays him was a crew member on the set who accidentally got included in a scene. Lynch decided to keep it in, and the rest is history."
Free Rein,"Good pick. Yeah, that Janitor went through quite the evolution. At first he only harassed J.D., but before long he became part of the main cast and interacted with the hospital as a whole. The series even ended with the characters attending his wedding if I'm not mistaken.

Speaking of Community, A lot of characters in that show changed, in part because of their actors. Britta went from somewhat aloof and confident to being a total ditz, Annie went from a snobbish know-it-all to the more mature voice of reason (which Britta started out as) and kind of a sweetheart.  Chang went from just a burnt-out apathetic college teacher to a complete nut job, and Dean Pelton went from being incompetent if not sort of corrupt, to part of the main group and a major character who was unambiguously one of the good guys."
Free Rein,[deleted]
Free Rein,"Read about this. Apparently, Fonzi was meant to be a one-time bully character, but Henry Winkler didn’t want that. They let him improvise something, so he walked up to a mirror and said “ayyyy”."
Free Rein,He's an amazing actor.
Free Rein,"Andy was supposed to be this hopeless moron that was only supposed to be in the first few episodes. He did such a good job and turned the character into one of the best ""lovable doofus"" characters on TV that they asked him to stay on and he was integral to success of the Parks & Rec series. 

I loved Donna too. Every now and then, I have a ""Treat Yo'self"" day :-)"
Free Rein,"There’s an episode in season 3 or 4 where a Romulan almost begins a war just because he wants a brighter future for his family. One of the final scenes has Picard talking sense into him from a very logical perspective and I️t was then I realized two things: Picard is amazing. Two, this show is amazing, and it’s not even that highly esteemed of an episode."
Free Rein,"Rotinaj? Josh? 

The goldfish episode was wonderful for seeing the Jan in a different view."
Free Rein,"His [iconic move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCJrtuV9bE) was to walk up to the mirror, pull out his comb, then see that his hair was perfect already. 

It defined his character"
Free Rein,Good answer! Andy is better
Free Rein,"They're both great answers. 

Heck, the entire finale centers around Donna's wedding. "
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"He spoke about it in a podcast with Michael Rosenblum.

Playing Superman made him turn down a bunch of roles because he thought they were beneath him but eventually he just stopped getting roles. He got angry about it fir a while then after some self reflection realised it was his own fault and started rebuilding his career with a more humble attitude."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,James Spader
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Chicken is not vegan?!
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,so he was the Lazenby of Superman films you could say
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Brandon Routh was a pretty wooden Superman. Maybe he couldn’t get more meatier roles in the big screen because he can’t act. Maybe his agent sucks. 

And TV roles are just as prestigious as movie roles nowadays. Well… mainly if it’s on HBO or a stream service. Not CW and Network TV shows."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"LL Cool J, Danny Devito, Chris Odonnel, Winona Rider, Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner..."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Superman Returns was an epic face planting **FLOP**. It made 390 Million on a 270 Million dollar budget.  So Brandon Routh did not have success on the big screen. Yes his high water mark was Superman Returns, but that was a failure.

Really Routh's ""small screen success"" is only for a single role.

So I don't really accept that he has a successful small screen career either. Sure he is getting work but he is a journeymen TV star, he has a lot of single episode appearances."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Jim Caviezel
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I watched that Dylan Dog movie he was in, boy was it bad"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Sounds like an understandable mistake and a pretty reasonable response eventually.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Interesting. I will have to search for that episode. Thanks!
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I will definitely have to look for this episode. I love Superman Returns, warts and all, I'm currently rewatching Smallville, and I really liked the podcast episode with Tom Welling. Michael Rosenblum seems like such a nice dude.

Brandon Routh is also amazing in Scott Pilgrim."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"It took me a few minutes watching him in that role in Scott pilgrim before I was like ""holy shit, is that Superman??"". Even funnier now seeing that Brie Larson who plays Scott's ex and the lead singer of that band goes on to be captain marvel. I think Tom Jane was in a brief scene, so you go the Punisher there. And then of course good ol Captain America, aka Chris Evans, playing one of the exes. Movie was full of soon to be superheroes

On a separate note, my favorite Routh role is his brief appearance in Zack and Miri make a Porno. Him and Justin long had me dying"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Agree nowadays they are but I think even in 2008 they had a different perception.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Um Harrison Ford and Costner are legit movie stars. Im not saying did TV, I’m saying bad that one huge movie then dropped out of big screen besides the occasional movie and stuck to tv."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"there is a little more comicbook characters in scrott pilgrim. Aubrey Plaza is the shadow king in legion , Mary Elizabeth Winstead was huntress in Bird of prey"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Yeah Thomas Jane is one of the 2 vegan police who depower Brandon Routh's character.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,de Vito is a movie star in my eyes......
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Jean Smart HAS to win that comedy actress award. Her performance in Hacks is far and away the best TV I've watched in a while.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"TV Winners:

* DRAMA ENSEMBLE - **The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTRESS - **Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTOR - **Jason Bateman, Ozark**
* COMEDY ENSEMBLE - **Abbott Elementary**
* COMEDY ACTRESS - **Jean Smart, Hacks**
* COMEDY ACTOR - **Jeremy Allen White, The Bear**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — FEMALE ACTOR - **Jessica Chastain, George & Tammy**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — MALE ACTOR - **Sam Elliott, 1883**
* STUNT ENSEMBLE - **Stranger Things**"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,The Bear is a Comedy???
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I hope Jeremy Allen White wins the Emmy. He is such a good actor and The Bear is so good
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"How did the cast of Game of Thrones never win Drama Ensemble at the SAG Awards? Forget the writing of S8 (well S7 too), the show had a phenomenal cast."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I’ve seen White Lotus. I’ve seen Better Call Saul. 

Rhea Seehorn not even being nominated in favor of Jennifer Coolidge, and Coolidge winning, kind of boggles my mind."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Redditors seething at yet another BCS snub in favor of Ozark.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Really enjoyed this season of Abbott Elementary. Glad to see others did as well.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I cannot believe Sam Elliot won over Paul Walter Hauser, Evan Peters, Taron Egerton and Steve Carrell in the ""Male Actor in Miniseries or TV Movie"". He was, IMO, the worst choice in the whole category. I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but the other nominees were far, far better."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,The bear is the most stressful comedy I’ve ever watched.   Wait no i take that back. Space jam
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I can tell by these comments that the Abbott elementary backlash is about to start.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I still haven't gotten around to *The Bear* but Jeremy Allen White must have been incredible to beat out Bill Hader for *Barry*.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"In terms of best acting in a Comedy, hands down Abbott Elementary delivered great comedy acting. In terms of the best acting in that category though, it’s Barry without question. It just wasn’t really “comedy” this season 🤷🏼‍♂️

Same could be said for The Bear."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I didn't know anything about Abbott Elementary until I heard about all their golden globe sweeps and I gave it a go and now it's one of my current fav shows and my main comfort happy place watch.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Abbott Elementary is perfectly *enjoyable*, but I'm still very surprised when they *win the big categories especially over the other shows listed."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I dont get the love for white lotus.  I tried to watch it and it's just a show about shitty hotel guests?  Why not just watch reality tv?
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,The White Lotus and Bear were phenomenal
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,The awards need to get their shit together when it comes to comedy categories
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Great to see Abbot winning ! It’s an amazing show and one of the few that I can sit and watch with my parents and we all enjoy together . 
More such shows please… please 🙏"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Ugh, Severance deserves better."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,The Bear was phenomenal
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,[deleted]
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"The show bear makes you realize what a shitty career a chef is, extremely hard stressful job with little pay"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,As they should.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"What am I missing with Abbott Elementary?  I watched the first few episodes and they were just, not good at all.  What is the charm I'm missing on this?"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Unpopular opinion here:  I watched The Bear and don’t really get what all the hype was about.  I mean I thought it was OK but nothing really above and beyond anything else I’ve seen the past year.  And before anyone says anything, yes I’ve worked in a restaurant before"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Why do people give a shit about Hollywood giving Hollywood bullshit awards as one massive circle-jerk?

I don't watch any of them, but the only that would mean anything to me at all would be Viewers' Choice Awards."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Sam Elliot's performance in 1883 winning over Paul Walter Hauser's performance in Black Bird is absolutely criminal. Sam Elliot just acted like Sam Elliot, Paul Walter Hauser became a cold-blooded killer."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Crazy I've never even heard about all three shows
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Now there’s an award for sag?
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Abbott Elementary is so overrated. It’s ok. If it came out in the 80s or 90s, it wouldn’t even be a blip on the radar."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"My aging badge of honor is that I have never heard of these shows.  Ahhh, I remember fondly when I cared about TV, and wish I had the time."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Looks like they rounded up 4 of the ugliest women in the audience and said do your worst smile
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Really happy for Jessica Chastain, she was phenomenal as Tammy Wynette."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I haven’t seen White Lotus yet but I have seen the other two shows and they are what I would quantify as “good watchable television” which is a standard that’s getting higher and higher with how much is being shown. I’m going to watch White Lotus.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I really like Abbott Elementary.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"She is fantastic, but the show isn’t going to hold up as she is all they have."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Wait, The Bear was a comedy? I must have been watching it wrong."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Not surprised *Stranger Things* won the Stunt award - it got the Stunt Coordination Emmy last year. Of particular note would be ""Dear Billy"", which included a one continuous shot gun battle and an impressive drop from height."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,That BCS lost to WL is a joke
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,All great shows with a lot of variety. I would have gave Zendaya the win over Jennifer or BCS over WL ensemble
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Jennifer Coolidge won as a dramatic actress? 

I'm so confused"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Obvious for a drama ensemble. White lotus season 2 was a riot.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I’m getting orange is the new black flashbacks after reading your comment
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,It’s especially odd considering White Lotus was placed as a drama.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Yeah, every time I see The Bear listed as a comedy, I kind of do a double take. I guess there's some funny stuff, but even if it's a dark comedy, it's much more of a ***DARK*** (comedy), it seems to me."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"And the award for best heavy metal album goes to...


...Jethro Tull

SAG awards are kinda like that."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,And the White Lotus in the drama category...
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Dark comedy to me
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,C’mon cousin
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I downloaded it having heard nothing except that it was labelled as a “comedy” show with great reviews. Was confused and exhausted as fuck by the end of the first episode. Was expecting a relaxing laugh.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Historically, like from the Greeks, comedy just means it’s going to have a happy ending and is the opposite of tragedy"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"In one episode they accidentally drugged a birthday party full of kids. That’s IASIP-type humor.

Yes, its a comedy."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Oh damn. He was good in shameless, and the bear is at 100% on rotten tomatoes. I need to check that out. No Hulu though"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"HEARD, CHEF"
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Hulu better not fuck up and bring it back for season 2. They already canceled Reboot 😒
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,SAG didn't seem to like GOT at any point.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,[deleted]
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Because many of the top billed actors in GoT were mediocre at best.

Kit Harrington,
Emilia Clarke,
Sophie Turner,
Maisie Williams,
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau

They were doing fine in some scene or another maybe; but nothing memorable about their performances overall. Actually with Jon and Sansa it was as wooden acting as it gets all through. The show was a lot of fun but in terms of acting it was meh."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,It’s not an ensemble. composed of multiple PRINCIPLE actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly EQUAL AMOUNTS OF SCREEN TIME.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"It really does feel weird to me that it’s being pushed so hard as a drama. Both seasons to me feel like 90% comedy with the last episode trying to go full dramatic tilt. 

It would be like trying to push the Righteous Gemstones as a drama or thriller instead of comedy purely because there are a few dramatic elements to it."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Its beyond parody.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,And Jason Bateman winning for Ozark. SAGs are worse than the Golden Globes
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Kudos to The White Lotus which has successfully jumped categories and is winning every guild award possible.  I don’t see it losing the Emmy for Best Drama later this year, and I thought the first season was better than the second lol.  Jennifer Coolidge and Mike White have a lot of voters everywhere rooting for them it seems.  HBO will have a hard time choosing which of its series to promote as Best Drama."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,It’s some sort of sick joke
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I like Coolidge but she didn't do anything we haven't seen her do 100 times before so I really don't see why she was even nominated
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Yeah. I enjoyed White Lotus, but pretty much every other actor in that show was better than Jennifer Coolidge. She was fine, but she doesn't deserve an Emmy."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I don't get the love for White Lotus. It was bland.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I swear people around here only pay attention to award shows for validation of their own opinions. Any time something they want to win doesn’t win or get nominated the put on an Olympic level mental gymnastics performance of why instead of just accepting that not everyone thinks the same way as them. It’s sad really.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,[deleted]
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"It's a nice accurate representation of the school systems in black and brown communities. May not be the freshest directing style, but you don't see many comedies actually highlight this stuff."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I get that it highlights some big issues, but I just don’t find it funny at all. Lame jokes, writing that is too obvious and set ups that fall flat."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I haven’t liked it. It’s fine but not award-winning. Too many mediocre actors and too few surprising, original moments. To each their own though! At least it’s not a formulaic horseshit show like Big Bang Theory or 2.5 Men."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"I have to agree, and I was a big fan of 1883 but Sam Elliot - played himself - again - the others played and transformed themselves into their characters. All these awards are a scam."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Understandable. The stakes were high in Space Jam. Anyone who has ever balled out to defeat an evil cadre of basketball playing aliens probably had some flashbacks
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,[deleted]
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Start? I feel like it’s been ongoing. Almost every day I see a low effort “DAE think Abbot Elementary is overrated?” post in this sub.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,Network shows and comfort food shows eill always do poorly on the internet.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,"Jeremy Allen White is reallllllly good in the Bear. He crushes a devastating monologue in the final episode of the season. But all season long he does a lot of small stuff so well and a weaker actor would've over acted when he went for subtleties. And when he does explode it feels so much more impactful.

Hader has been incredible, but he has gotten two Emmys for his acting in Barry. Would be a-ok if Jeremy Allen White got it."
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,I think half the shows in the comedy categories are way more dramatic than comedy and are lucky they aren’t clocked as such … it’s kind of unfair to have two half jokes an episode and then super serious scenes that allow for range and dramatics the rest of the season and then get called a comedy.  Abbott is one of the only true intentional comedies this season and so I think their wins make complete sense.
Miffys Adventures Big and Small,you don't have high quality writing and high end gays on reality tv
Let’s Eat,"While HBO Velma is an indisputably awful show, I commend your efforts to try to fix it. You actually tried to make the race changes matter and I respect that. Representation coming from the heart is a good quality to have.

  Uber eats (and possibly other food delivery apps) keep focusing their ads on this angle of ""save your local small business restaurants with us!""  
  
  What they conveniently leave out is that the fact that they bully these small restaurants into squeezing their profit margins super thin in order to work with the delivery app. Please, for the love of chtulhu, if you want to support a local business, make an order with the restaurant instead of using a 3rd party.

Lets Eat 2,Fuck. I stopped at episode 4 of 1899 to wait for my lazy friend. Guess I’m part of the problem.
Lets Eat 2,"Very much this, but there’s another big factor being weighed: cost of production. 

This applies directly to the Heartstopper vs First Kill comparison, which became a trending social media conversation over the summer because both were LGBT shows with substantial audience overlap. Heartstopper had a high completion rate AND was cheap to make; First Kill had a low completion rate and was much more expensive due to CGI/action. Add that Heartstopper was lauded by critics (and has gone on to win Emmys and other awards), and First Kill was panned, and it was an obvious choice to renew the cheap show and cancel the expensive one.

There’s a lot of discussion about shows needing to be mega-hits in order to succeed, but that’s really only the case for high-budget shows. Cowboy Bebop was cancelled because it was quite expensive and didn’t reach mega-hit status. Stranger Things endures despite being quite expensive only because it’s such a phenomenon. If it was even somewhat less of one, it wouldn’t have lasted.

Netflix’s brand could certainly benefit from the PR of giving shows a little more of a chance, but currently they’re not really being any more cancel-happy than TV has ever been. They do have reasons based on data, most of which we don’t see."

This is me. I started it and dropped it after episode four because it seemed like the stories in each episode were 95% filler between one or two intriguing moments and paying attention to it became a chore."
Lets Eat 2,Hold on. I do plan to pick up 1899 right after I re-watch every season of Selling Sunsets! Come on. Netflix. I would watch it. Please!
Lets Eat 2,"I don't think ""I liked it but I just didn't have time to finish it and had better things to do"" is the argument for not cancelling it that some of you think it is."
Lets Eat 2,"A lot of people in the comments seem to be missing the point. 

“So what I have to cancel my entire weekend plans and binge watch the entirety of a show I like the minute it’s released?”

No. We’re talking about *macro* trends. We aren’t talking about your individual viewing habits. They’re looking at insane quantities of data and comparing shows to one another. 

The bottom line is at a macro level, shows like 1899 didn’t captivate the audience. It’s clear from the data that viewership fell off a cliff after just a few episodes. The data is large enough that “I personally went on vacation” isn’t the root cause. You can tell how millions of subscribers felt about a show. If they don’t keep watching epsiodes, they simply weren’t interested. And shows that aren’t interesting to enough people get cancelled.

1899 has been out since November. They’ve got enough data out there to see that people weren’t hard pressed to finish the show. If people really liked the show they would have found time to watch eight episodes in a month and a half. They just didn’t care enough. Netflix can compare 1899’s performance to other shows at the month and a half mark and see what people like and what they don’t. The data doesn’t lie."
Lets Eat 2,This feels like it encourages addictive binge habits.
Lets Eat 2,The anti-Netflix circlejerk in r/television is pretty heavy so I applaud your bravery on posting this here.
Lets Eat 2,I watched the first episode or two of 1899 when it premiered. And then stopped. It's all my fault.
Lets Eat 2,"Thank you! Finally someone gets it. Completion rate is also probably the only way you’re able to measure perceived “quality” for the target audience. Netflix also likely tests their shows with a panel, but if they score high on that with few people actually finishing it in the real world, the latter is a much better signal of if people actually enjoyed it or not.

Plus, the majority of viewership for shows is usually within the first 30 days of its release, so if you don’t see decent completion by then, it’s probably not going to happen"
Lets Eat 2,"My knee jerk reaction is that completion *rate* may not be as relevant as, say, season finale viewership (because those numbers may still sustain the show), but your general point is spot on.

I do question whether Netflix gives a show enough time for the completion rates, but at the same time, I expect that Netflix's decision making is informed by data and certain modelling / assumptions, and is not arbitrary.

Netflix analyzes the data and concludes that a show is not worth continuing based on viewership.

Broad strokes, that makes sense."
Lets Eat 2,"Thank you. I'm getting tired of people pretending like Netflix is canceling its most popular titles when most victim shows, while they may be quality and/or beloved, are very clearly not pulling enough attention, discussion, and completion. It's a sad reality of the business that they can't keep paying to make more of shows that aren't even drawing people to finish one season promptly. 

I think many people online are getting confused by Netflix publicly releasing the ""hours viewed"" metric for their top 10 but not the actual data they use to make renewal decisions (completion rate, among others). But it makes sense: saying all their shows have ""X million hours!"" viewed makes them all sound successful. If they tell the public ""only 42% of people have continued this show past episode 2"" then it's not a good endorsement on their own product. However, that piece of info IS hugely important for their internal decision to put more money into the show or not."
Lets Eat 2,"Who are all the assholes that watched The Witcher through to the end?

Edit: This was mostly a joke.  For all I know, they greenlit season three after the first season, which I watched through."
Lets Eat 2,"Wholeheartedly agree with OP. People forget that Netflix makes money from subscriptions, not ticket sales. I.e. the shows it decides to invest in will be the ones that Netflix deems will bring, retain or bring back subscription revenue.

Resident Evil had one of the highest debut numbers in the history of the platform, but was still cancelled. Clearly this was due to high drop-off rates with each episode. The high initial numbers only really indicate the strength of brand recognition. A name that will draw in boatloads of eyeballs to check it out. 

Although I would say 1899 is a tragic case. It wasn't horrible at all. But I feel it relied far too heavily on 'mystery box' for most of the season. There was no compelling reason for why the boy didn't speak other than to keep pushing the mystery box down the road. So the plot became frustratingly tedious. Dark was unique in that its first major plot mystery was addressed very soon. I'm also not sure how people felt about all the 4th-wall moments in 1899 too. I myself found it a bit of a cop-out."
Lets Eat 2,Thanks for this breakdown and enlightening everyone on completion rate.
Lets Eat 2,"I’m sure completion rate isn’t the only factor. I’m sure a cheaper show can get renewed with a lower completion rate than a more expensive show. That’s just obvious and simple cost vs benefit. 

But I’m sure completion rate is a major factor."
Lets Eat 2,netflix looks at the number of people who completed a full season of a show within the first 28 days and the number of new users the shows bring in.  i suggest everyone to read this [inside of the binge factory](https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/how-netflix-swallowed-tv-industry.html)
Lets Eat 2,"The problem with using completion rates as a metric is in an environment where there’s no urgency to complete a show, because it’s always available and you can stream it at your own leisure, people might tune into the first episode, go “that’s something I *need* to watch”, but then leave it on their watchlist for a bit. This is the problem with a platform where everything and anything is binge-able. If Netflix more often used a more conventional approach to releasing series it would give audiences a chance to catch up and for word of mouth to spread that it’s worth watching—and shows wouldn’t get dropped as easily because without most of the audience knowing the ending, no bad word of mouth could spread saying it’s not worth finishing."
Lets Eat 2,"This post puts things into perspective, and as frustrated as I am I can begin to understand it. That being said, why do people seem happy that it was cancelled? You didn't like it - that's great, but there were still millions of people what want to see the story properly concluded, especially after Dark, or hell, what the story was *actually* about.

Those two creators are extremely valuable in the creative space imo - mystery shows that eventually make perfect sense (or at least they would if they had 3 Seasons). They wrote both entire shows in advance, so everything hinted at likely has a purpose. If anybody saw the ""making of""  documentary, you can see how passionate everyone is to work on the show - the writer especially.

I bet if they released weekly episodes it would've done so much better. It's only been out for 6 weeks. Hopefully we get some other method of realising the entire story, it felt like it was just getting started."
Lets Eat 2,I completed The Dark Crystal four times. Does that count as 1 or 4 completions?
Lets Eat 2,"People on Reddit are delusional.  (I’d like to elaborate and use harsher words but I know better).   People on here act like it’s some guy smoking a cigar behind a desk throwing darts at a board like it’s the 1950’s.   

Netflix has data on every minute of every show they stream.  They know how many hours, minutes are watched and they know exactly when people lose interest.   People either weren’t watching or stopped watching these shows.   Netflix show budgets are insane compared to network tv and they aren’t going to waste that on shows people aren’t watching or sticking with."
Lets Eat 2,"Great explanation, than you.

>So let's stop blaming Netflix for canceling things that its own audience decided to abandon. If you want a show to get another season, be sure to finish the previous one.

Using your own logic, I imagine that the only people complaining about a show getting cancelled are the ones who did in fact watch the entire season. Otherwise, as I believe you rightly pointed out, they are unlikely to care about a next season."
Lets Eat 2,"Yeah, I always find this uproar super amusing, as if this incredibly successful business is somehow making irrational decisions about which shows it should cancel or not.  Accusing them of not valuing artistry and quality is one thing, but obviously Netflix isn't cancelling shows unless that's a wise business decision for them."
Lets Eat 2,"I mean this is a perfect example why more data and algorithmic analysis can lead to worse understanding of what users actually want. Just because someone didn't finish the show it means you have a good picture of why. One small example by me. Years ago I heard about the show Succession, so I turned it on and was passively watching it on the second screen, mid-way through the episode was like ""I don't care about some rich people bullshit"" and turned it off. But guess what, I kept hearing about the show and how great it is and blah blah blah so I gave up, sat down and watched it.... and it was one of my favorite shows of the year! Every season slaps, it's a brilliant show in so many ways!

Not every show is going to hook you instantly from the first minute, not every show is going to instantly go viral (Netflix doesn't help it with their dumb release schedule - if you disagree bite me), not every show is going to have a great first season. Friends, Seinfeld, Office, Family Guy, TNG, Buffy, Simpsons and so many others had middling to poor first seasons and then they turned into some of the most iconic shows of all time.  I shudder to think what would happen if these shows were made by Netflix, or better yet shudder to think what iconic shows were taken away from us because Netflix wouldn't give them room to breathe.

I don't want to call this robotic decision-making because I am pretty sure in a few years deep learning AI will be able to do a better job than these stupid Netflix execs. When evaluating a show as the network more than just raw numbers. Is the show good? Does the show have potential? Can you fix the flaws? Do you believe in the project? Literally build it and ~~dead baseball players~~ viewers will arrive. Yes, absolutely some shows need to be killed off, but if they have potential and viewer numbers are not an absolute disaster, then you need to reinvest and improve what you have instead of greenlighting yet another dumb project that you have no confidence in."

Lets Eat 2,"Not only do I think this is spot on, I think it explains why Sandman didn't get an immediate renewal despite high viewers. I loved the first half of the season, and then I didn't finish it, and apparently, it turns out a lot of people are in the same boat."
Lets Eat 2,"Netflix works as a black box for viewers, what cancelled then its LOGICAL to form a opinion on the information given.      

No info given random opinion is a situation Netflix created"
Lets Eat 2,"Likewise, I argue Netflix's ""Completion Rates"" for shows are the key to subscriber renewals or cancellations. Shows that I emotionally invested in but are often being left incomplete form the main reason why I cancelled my subscription."
Lets Eat 2,"As much as Reddit is getting up in arms about 1899 being cancelled, it makes COMPLETE sense. It would be unbelievably stupid of them business-wise to have kept it going.

I get that the concept is cool, and Dark and Dark-related things are popular here on Reddit, but the viewership for 1899 was just NOT there."
Lets Eat 2,"Netflix stole a play out of Who's Line Is it Anyway. Here's a [quote](https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a42383449/1899-season-2/) from the CEO about cancellations. 

>As Ted Sarandos explained of the cancellations: “It’s 70 percent gut and 30 percent data. Most of it is informed hunches and intuition. Data either reinforces your worst notion or it just supports what you want to do, either way.”

Where everything's made up and the points don't matter."
Lets Eat 2,"Do you people not remember how broadcast TV used to be? if a show had terrible ratings it was pulled within 5-6 weeks! and that's just with live airing to pull in the audience.

Once Netflix releases a show they give it a thousand hours to find an audience."
Lets Eat 2,"Totally get it with 1899, i started it and stopped watching after a handful of episodes too due to thinking it's not good enough.   
I am sorry, but you need to do more than throwing mysteries at the screen for me to be thinking your show has real potential, and i honestly don't think they really did that here. We're in the the 2020s, you have to do better than that."
Lets Eat 2,"Ugh. A month before cancellation, I wanted to watch 1899. But this time I wouldn’t be binge watching a whole series until 4am like I did with Dark. And I still have one episode left to watch, maybe today. Then I hear as of yesterday they canned it. Such bullshit"
Lets Eat 2,"I think this is all well and good, so maybe the issue is they have no idea how to schedule their line up.

1899 was something I really wanted to watch...but not in the middle of the holiday season. I just didn't have the time and was saving it for January when things calmed down.

Considering how long it takes them to renew a lot of shows, why do they cancel them *so* quickly?"
Lets Eat 2,So the way to not get a show you like cancelled is to watch the first couple episodes and if you like it just let it continue playing all the episodes and then go back and watch it later when you have time.
Lets Eat 2,"damn this post fucking slaps. finally someone comes in with some real critical thinking and a solid, reasonable explanation that’s backed up."
Lets Eat 2,"I think the main problem here is time. 

I'm a 40 year old father of 2 young children so I don't have time to watch more that 2 or 3 hours of Netflix per week.

That means binging a series is impossible for me.

I added 1899 to my list but didn't start it until I had finished watching the series I had previously started.

I eventually watched the first episode a week ago but haven't had the time to watch anything since."
Lets Eat 2,"Finally someone makes a reasonable post on this subject. The amount of people whining without understanding the metrics is astounding here. People love to blame a show failing due to netflix's lack of marketing but these people have already been engaged in the show. If they aren't finishing the first season there is less chance they will even watch season 2 so why invest. 

Also lol shout-out to those people who say they will never watch a Netflix show unless it gets renewed."
Lets Eat 2,"Completion rate is a pretty solid indicator to use so no arguments there. The main issue is that many, many people don't watch shows until they evolve to a certain point. How many people (myself included) didn't watch Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad etc. until 3 or 4 seasons in?  Pretty much all of the shows I now consider to be my favourites are ones I picked up late (even after they finished airing).

The other, and probably bigger, issue is that it's a very short sighted approach. People are already starting to catch on and say they're not even going to bother investing in a Netflix show as its pointless as it will just be cancelled.

Appreciate its not as easy as this but Netflix really need to take a gamble on some of these shows (even if only temporarily and potentially at a slight loss) to gain back some trust. Otherwise its just going to spiral as they cancel shows because noones watching, but noones watching because they're cancelling them.

I can't see it happening though, but also I'm not running Netflix so what the fuck do I know...."
Lets Eat 2,"Yeah everyone is weirdly jumping to 1899's defense but all the reviews up until this point was that it sucked. 

Why is everyone desperate to defend what's at best a boring show and at worst garbage? I never read one review when it came out where anyone was excited about it, but I read a ton that dogged it for being 4 episodes longer than it needed to be with a cheap cliffhanger ending."
Lets Eat 2,"Might be a hot take, but Studios have the right to cancel any project for any reason they see fit, they're the ones paying for it

Like I see it all the time when it comes to discussion DC films. If Zack Snyder was willing to foot the bill out of pocket for his $200 million+ trilogy out of pocket, you would be watching it today. That's not how it works though, Warner Bros is paying for it, and they expect a return on investment, which some projects just do not provide, so that money is going towards projects that potentially will. 

I think there's some disconnect where people think these corporations just have infinite money, when what we actually see released is maybe one out of a million pitches that they chose to get greenlit. Only one in a million of those million will become the next Stranger Things, but if it was your money would you spend it on a show you already know isnt the next breakout hit, or a new one that has the possibility of becoming it? 

It sucks, especially for shows that are actually well made and have a lot of backing like 1889, but unless a show is printing money out of the gate, it's always going to be a gamble and they atleast got a chance, which is more than many potential shows had."
Lets Eat 2,"By what date though? 1899 has only been out for like six weeks. It seems to me that these metrics only cater to audiences that are willing to binge the whole season in a few days. Plus it doesn’t give time for a show to build buzz and have people come back to it later. Maybe Netflix just wasn’t publicizing the cancelations like they are now and they always made a decision at six weeks, but it seems in the past shows were given more time to find an audience.

People love to throw around comparisons to cable TV, but broadcast tv has as six months to build an audience in its first season.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure Netflix has all the data backing up their decisions, but I know there’s growing sentiment (that I also feel) to just ignore shows until there’s a second season announced because it’s not worth investing in a single season just to be disappointed."
Lets Eat 2,"I wonder if something like ""binge rate"" factors in? 

I'm watching 1899, but it's not a great exercise show. I watch most of my streaming when I'm doing cardio, and don't really watch any other times... So I'm slowly getting through this one. 

Same thing with Westworld and HBO. I was watching, I just can't sit and binge an entire season. 

But then I really liked Another life, and the pacing worked for me and exercising, so I got those done in about a week. Still cancelled."
Lets Eat 2,"Huh... this is actually makes a ton of sense. 

I'd probably make the same decision as an exec with this line of thinking. Thanks for the good tip."
Lets Eat 2,"***shocking completion rate of just 32%***

Just my opinion, but 32% to me is a lower boundary for actually continuing a season if you're still making money off of it.  That's still a whole lot of pissed-off viewers.

Admittedly, I'm biased because I suspect I'm in that ""patient viewer"" category a LOT, and get really irate at prematurely canceled shows, when stuff I consider to be absolute garbage survives for multiple seasons."
Lets Eat 2,Wow this is a great write up and very interesting. Thank you for sharing.
Lets Eat 2,"They canceled diriliş ertuğrul and stargate sg1, I am done with Netflix forever"
Lets Eat 2,"Some shows are easier to watch in a short period of time than others, though. And sometimes I just want to watch an episode here and there. Out of curiosity, how do rewatches work? If I rewatch the first two episode of a show, does that count as me not completing it, or does it track that I’ve already completed it once?"
Lets Eat 2,"My issue is they are hurting their own completion rate. I have lost track with how many shows I have not finished simply because they were cancelled. 

I have no interest in investing time in a show that won’t continue so once they are cancelled I rarely finish them. And I rarely binge a show in under a week."
Lets Eat 2,I always slow down on a show after a few episodes. I’m sorry I’ll do better
Lets Eat 2,It kinda makes sense but i think they need to let shows breath a little before deciding. I think 3 months minimum before deciding and if the completion rate/views are steady or going up it might be worth another season. Maybe a 2 season minimum? It’s a self fulfilling prophecy right now because a lot of people don’t watch since there is no guarantee of more. And an incomplete is usually worse than a bad one.
Lets Eat 2,"I'd love to see the completion rate of Mindhunter, if you all are responsible for that getting canceled I'm coming for you!"
Lets Eat 2,"Great insight. 

It is interesting that a show with a massively watched first episode could be sowing the seeds of its own downfall if it doesn’t get its audience to watch the whole thing. 

You’d think the statisticians would want to consider the size of that audience that finishes the show and not overvalue those that start it. But nonetheless, fascinating insight in the minds of corporate decision making."
Lets Eat 2,Then they should stop turning what should be a movie in to several episodes of a show that is going nowhere.
Lets Eat 2,"I mean... Duh??

Why would someone create more of something if they didn't finish the first season?

There's already more content out that people are unwilling to watch, why would they release more if they aren't going to complete it."
Lets Eat 2,32 percent of 1899's viewership still has to be a massive number no? Did they think the next season will not have higher percentage completion rate after building a strong viewing base? I guess it was not worth the expenses which is a real shame
Lets Eat 2,"Me who only watched the first episode of 1889 and it didn't keep my that interest, so i figured I would watch the rest of it later: ☠️"
Lets Eat 2,"So true. I only watched 3 episodes of 1899. My wife and I were just talking about it and boom, axed! Must shows that we watch by don't finish often get canned.  
Funny, never knew they use the completion rate, but makes sense. 


Now, can this turn Netflix shows into a fast paced  series in order to hook ppl and have em keep watching? 
1899 was slow and bored us. While Alice in borderlands is non stop stress, making is watch the next episode. 

I can imagine this will change the way ppl make series now"
Lets Eat 2,I pirated all but the first episode of resident evil so I think I did us all a favor
Lets Eat 2,"What's netflix's completion rate?  How many new shows get a 2nd season and how many get a full run and wrap up without being cancelled?
Probably time to start basing renewing my monthly subscriptions on Netflix producing shows that are complete and worth watching."
Lets Eat 2,"I'm one of the 68% that didn't finish 1899. Then again, I haven't finished Dark either. One episode each from both shows. Just not my cup of tea I guess. I'll probably revisit Dark in the future though."
Lets Eat 2,"Well, that’s the thing that frustrates me, because if I like a show, I finish it, then it gets cancelled.

Thing is, some times it *does* take more than four weeks to finish a show (depends on how many episodes it has). That is often due to either simply not having enough time to sit and binge the whole thing, or even wanting to savor it, and take my time.

If four weeks really is the cut-off Netflix is watching, they should consider expanding that, because they’re clearly doing something wrong, as so many people are confused and surprised about why their shows keep getting cancelled. Maybe the average viewer doesn’t have time to blow through a new show quickly? And since there are likely more users who *don’t* sit and watch tv all day than those who do, it sounds like Netflix needs to adjust the way they decide if a show is “good enough” to continue."
Lets Eat 2,"1899 had a lot more people watching it than First Kill, and 32% completion is still a lot more people than First Kill had, no?

Like, it had a big ad campaign on Netflix for it, so it is going to have a load of people watching it that likely were never going to really care for it... thus damaging that completion rate ?"
Lets Eat 2,"This is great and makes perfect sense, but it also is arbitrary unless it's assessed within a set timeframe. 

I liked 1899 and watched the first four episodes in about two weeks. They're heavy, slow-paced episodes which is NOT a bad thing to me, but meant my viewing afterwards slowed down to match the pace of the show. If it was released weekly, I think we'd have seen much higher completion rates.

To bring up another TV darling I'd be curious to see how numbers for Andor would look if it had been dumped all at once vs. weekly.

Another missing piece here is convenience and flexibility. Netflix value proposition for me (busy millennial with kid) is that I can watch shows at my own pace depending on my mood. I think one reason people are pissed is that Netflix has made it clear that's not the case! If I have any interest in a show Netflix is telling I'd better fucking binge it in two weeks or it's getting the axe, quality be damned."
Lets Eat 2,"This absolutely makes sense. I enjoyed 1899 but I absolutely have to say that I pushed through it against my own wishes. I’m a bit of a masochist. They were a lot of problems but also a lot of possibility with making a course correction. ￼

I’m definitely concerned though about the future of entertainment if the system pushes towards easy pleasing, fast binging without taking into account how shows can grow on people and improvements that can be made in a second series. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
Lets Eat 2,"That’s a fair point, thank you for bringing this information to the community."
Lets Eat 2,Stopped watching 1899 because it was just weird and didn't make much sense. Got 5 episodes in.
Lets Eat 2,I almost gave up on two different times during the 1989 season. It really was too slow and unrewarding to the viewer until the very last episode.
Lets Eat 2,"I love stats and I can see that completion rate is very important. However, what were the actual numbers for those who completed 1899? Obviously 32% of 1,000,000 is a almost the same as 75% of 500,000. Now, I made up these numbers but I would like to know them for a better insight. I would hope that if the actual number of households who finished 1899 were higher than shows they kept around, then they should have kept 1899 around.

I looked briefly and couldn’t find the numbers."
Lets Eat 2,How much does the recently added double thumbs up factor into the algorithm compared to the normal thumbs up?
Lets Eat 2,Isn't it likely that people are less likely to start watching a Netflix show now unless all seasons are guaranteed?
Lets Eat 2,"I didn’t finish 1899 because I had a busy month. I will finish it, even knowing more seasons aren’t coming. Give people more time, or base your decisions on the watching habits of cranked out trailer trash slamming through reality drivel.


Ps: lesson here is if they ever put out a decent show again, just leave it running on something until it finishes, even if you aren’t actually watching. Then you’ll satisfy their dildo analytics."
Lets Eat 2,dam got me on 1899
Lets Eat 2,"I think it makes a lot of sense. I just wish Netflix gave things more time. For instance, I planned to start 1899 next week. I was just finishing up some other shows first. Now I may never start it"
Lets Eat 2,"I got pissed up by it. I saw first eps and was about to start the second when I saw the news regarding 1899. Not gonna finish it now.

Some people have jobs and other stuff to do, not everybody is a fucking teenager with time to spare. Also, there are too many shows in too many different places, I'm watching 5 shows at the same time, 1 eps a day, so today I'll watch one eps of Andor and tomorrow I'll watch Jack Ryan. Its the only way I found to keep track of everything I want to watch without being overwelmed."
Lets Eat 2,"So, does people who rewatch entire seasons of a show multiple times on repeat to fill the void caused by stress and anxiety add more weight or does it only count the first time?

Asking for a friend."
Lets Eat 2,"This perspective comes from people that don’t understand life.  There are many shows I love and rewatch that I either took a long time to start or took a long paused for a long time in the middle.  My watching habits revolve around work needs and family needs and other things, not the other way around.  If they are not careful, they will be shooting themselves in the foot.  It’s the streaming services that let me take my time viewing on my schedule that I will remain faithful to."
Lets Eat 2,"So in theory, shows with shorter seasons have a much greater chance to succeed."
Lets Eat 2,To be fair heartstopper had like 20 mins episodes of course the completion rate would be higher
Lets Eat 2,"That's still quite an assumption on Netflix's side. 30% completion rate still accounts for something like 80m viewers for a multilanguage show. People also might give it another chance once they knew it was renewed. Also, Netflix still tells me to finish shows I've actually finished, so clearly it's not a good system."
Lets Eat 2,"The sad bit of 1899 was it was deliberately intended to be a season 1 of 3 playing the long game. I just wish they gave them 3 seasons from the start or told them to make something that worked as a standalone without the ""we'll see"" middleground."
Lets Eat 2,"My issue is it feels like they give it about a week for the season to be out to decide if enough people watched the whole season or not. My dudes, I am MONTHS behind on my ""to be watched"" queue across various services, give me a fucking chance to find out if I like it or not. I have a job and kids and shit"
Lets Eat 2,NETFLIX -- You keep making seasons of Kobra Kai and I'll keep doing my part. It's a strange arrangement indeed.
Lets Eat 2,"Yes, thank you! I have been writing this in all the threads complaining about the cancellation of 1899. Viewed hours in isolation is a terrible metric, it tells you absolutely nothing, yet people parrot it as if the viewed hours is this holy grail and that high viewed hours = popular show."
Lets Eat 2,"So on order to keep a show alive I HAVE to binge it before some arbitrary time before Netflix cancels it?

I'm 2 episodes away from finishing 1899 but the holidays had us traveling.

Edit: I get it, you all have tons of time to binge watch shows, congrats."
Lets Eat 2,"I started watching 1899 on release but didn’t finish watching it till a month later. Slow pacing threw me off initially, but I went back and finished the entire show regardless. It was really good and it seemed like a no brainer that it’d get a second season. 

I swear, with the way Netflix goes about doing it’s renewals, I doubt shows like Better Call Saul  would’ve got a second season if it was a Netflix original."
Lets Eat 2,Same answer still applies. A show can still become a sleeper hit if you allow it to find its footing in subsequent seasons.
Lets Eat 2,"It sounds logic and obvious but it’s also Netflix fault, when everything starts the measurements given from NETFLIX where always *minutes viewed* not completion rate, not rating per episode, how WE and the media in general can understand this when there’s not easy access to this data?"
Bad Guys,"I've always thought that if it's dangerous enough, they should interview the person, rewrite the answers so their mannerisms don't show, and have an actor read it while being disguised."
Bad Guys,"I’ve wondered about this as well.  Not just for drugs/scam etc. cases but for informants and whistleblowers too. 

For example, if someone was a mob informant on a documentary and covers their face, I think people they knew for years would probably realize their identity from their body shape, gestures, or style of dressing."
Bad Guys,"I've asked someone familiar with such things, and his answer was there are certain topics that involve very dangerous people and they might be willing to answer some questions, but only thru a trusted intermediary (who is also trusted by the crew).  Often they won't meet the subject at all simply because it is far too dangerous to do so. 

Some interviews are on paper only, or they might be audio recordings. The questions are often laid out ahead of time, with restrictions on certain topics/lines of questioning which allows the interviewer to know how far they can press with follow up questions.  This is especially helpful if there is a language barrier, as the intermediary will also be an interpreter and will know when to shut down a question without translating it.

The responses are then acted out, blurred video/masks and distorted audio. This allows for the interviewee to speak a little more freely then they would if being recorded, and also allows some level of plausible deniability should the interviewer get pressed by authorities over who they met and where they met them. Plus, it means that anyone who tries to correct the footage (descrambling the video, adjusting the brightness, or correcting the audio) isn't actually going to unmask the interview subject."
Bad Guys,"I have interviewed a lot of informants and also did a major  newspaper series about a couple who were living in the Witness Protection Program. 

""Reformed"" criminals go from exciting adrenalized lives to anonymity in podunk towns and a decent number of them simply get bored and want attention. 

They also delude themselves that they will get paid enough to be consultants on other projects as a result of coming forward and they can spin those gigs into being some kind of producer themselves. 

Also I don't know what the percentages are for how many remain on the straight and narrow under their new identities but the ones I dealt with all ended up getting their hands dirty again.

Bear in mind that if these were criminal geniuses, they probably wouldn't need witness protection."
Bad Guys,some of them are fake... most maybe?? i remember watching one a while back which featured my home country. it was a mix of obviously fake interviews and *seemingly* genuine ones.
Bad Guys,https://youtu.be/vJki8XXqVws
Bad Guys,"With money and ""bad guys"" like to brag about their crimes so they can have what called clout or street cred. For a whistleblower or informate it's to get the truth out there."
Bad Guys,">illegal trade so how much can they be getting paid to make it worth the risk of death should they be recognized??

but they're not ""unrecognized"" IRL are they? so is there really any additional risk compared to ""day to day life"" in the illegal drug trade?

&#x200B;

i don't think ""nat-geo"" does anything more than record evidence that could be used against them.. (the cops are not UNAWARE of their IRL identities, either).

&#x200B;

risk of getting shot already exists.

risk of getting arrested already exists.

not sure risk is that much worse."
Bad Guys,"Y'all do understand that Pyromaniacs have been known to have orgasms at the scene of the fire they set themselves, right?"
Bad Guys,I guess some use proxy
Bad Guys,"Some UK shows announce that was done. I assume the rest, and some US shows, do it but don’t say."
Bad Guys,"Yeah, there is no way those people would ever go onto television as themselves. Besides a persons stature, the mannerisms and speech patterns alone would be enough to recognize a person well known within their networks."
Bad Guys,"Exactly. It's SO risky for them, what's the incentive?"
Bad Guys,I dont think you're right here. They could be putting themselves in more jeopardy especially if they were like moles or informants that infiltrated drug rings or whatever may have you. I think its more about what they say that will be more dangerous for them after the video ends because someone always knows someone.
Bad Guys,"I did, but I personally wasn't a big fan of it. I thought it was more style over substance (some lines seemed taken straight from memes that are popular in Italy and I couldn't help but cringe). Definitely above average when compared to most Italian shows (which is not surprising since our public TV is still very much into soap operas with low production values), but at the end of the day it's yet another TV show about mafia, and our TV is over saturated with mafia shows.

Loved Slevin by the way, it was totally unpredictable and fun."
Bad Guys,Yes I watched and I loved it
Bad Guys,"Tell me more., I'm not seeing it in Canada"
Bad Guys,"That makes sense. I'm watching in the US so that now makes me curious how the show has been received in Italy vs other places. 

For us it was more of a fun watch for the same reasons I might watch a show like Only Murders in the Building."
Bad Guys,He’s a premiere villain now since breaking bad. Loved him in the mandalorian.
Bad Guys,"[Hes also got a very menacing cold CEO vibe going in The Boys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L09zfsVYQz8)  
  
**Warning :** Clip contains Spoilers, Violence and Adult Language."
Bad Guys,">I grew through the period of time where I was relegated to playing thieves and thugs.

I get what he means, but I kind of find that mildly amusing; relegated to playing thieves and thugs, finally upgraded to... a Nazi"
Bad Guys,"Was this interview from an alternate timeline where he wasn't Gus Fring? I would have thought he would see that role as a career highlight, but apparently not.

He's awesome in both, so whatever."
Bad Guys,It’s so nice to finally see a person of color play a space Nazi
Bad Guys,Hes also gonna be the main villain in Far Cry 6 and man im sure he got that role nailed.
Bad Guys,The dude is a perfect villain. Seeing him in Do The Right Thing juxtaposed with Gus Fring is incredibly jarring. I kinda want him to play Doctor Doom.
Bad Guys,"He's awesome in the role and I can't wait to see where he takes it.  


That being said, ""Non-white Playing Imperial Bad Guy"" feels like a click bait question. And, here I am!"
Bad Guys,"I'm all for this, but Darth Vader was literally voiced by James Earl Jones."
Bad Guys,"I’m confused. Aren’t the Empire officers basically thugs and thieves? Especially in Rebels, we see them harassing people, taking their property away. How is a well dressed officer thug better than a poorly dressed thug?”"
Bad Guys,He is superb. One of my favorite actors to portray villains these days!! He truly becomes the character and it’s a joy to witness!! So excited for more.
Bad Guys,My favorite bit easily has to be the whole scene with the two troopers just waiting outside of the city w. Baby Yoda because he was busy soing a monologue and murdering subordinates who interrupted him.
Bad Guys,">I grew through the period of time where I was relegated to playing thieves and thugs.

Jon Favreau: Yo G i got a role i wrote just for you.  

Giancarlo: Excellent. Please tell me all the details. 

Jon Favreau: You're a space thug/thief."
Bad Guys,"I loved Season 1 of the Mandalorian.  I specifically made sure I read no spoilers at all.  I shit my pants when GUS FRING showed up to lay down the law.

Can’t wait for Season 2"
Bad Guys,Should we tell him?
Bad Guys,"Ironically, the Galactic Empire is very racist... against the non-human aliens. We still have yet to see that portrayed on-screen well."
Bad Guys,I guess nobody tell him he's still playing the bad guy.
Bad Guys,It sure is great that minorities can now be the violently oppressive bad guys too!
Bad Guys,"I'd rather see/know him on his merits as a credited actor from Breaking Bad, Community and his upcoming appearance in Far Cry 6 as opposed to being an essential character in the SWU who just happens to be a POC.

I understand that current social topics have given focus to POC being in the limelight, but honestly, i dont care. If the man can act, he can act. Creed has nothing to do with the success."
Bad Guys,"It’s true the ‘evil white male ´ is kind of a tired trope by now especially in Star Wars. Thank goodness there’s some changes, maybe this will help  change the flawed perception that white guys, particularly British guys are inherently evil.  This is a good first step!"
Bad Guys,"There are so many things he's been a main villain in who isn't a thug. Far Cry 6 (going to be), Breaking Bad as Gus Fring, Revolution (I forgot the villains name but he was great in that role.), and the Mandalorian. So he's been the main antagonist quite a few times and more than just a thug usually. Frankly I'm just glad he keeps getting these kinds of roles because he plays such a great bad guy."
Bad Guys,On the flip side though we have an Empire that has access to the most brilliant tactical and strategic genius in the galaxy and they barely use him because his skin is blue.
Bad Guys,He did amazing with this but I will forever see him as Gus Fring
Bad Guys,He'll always be Buggin' Out to me. Not a Thief. Not a Thug.  A righteous black man.
Bad Guys,Esposito will probably kick ass as the villain in Far Cry 6.
Bad Guys,"Not just non-white, but also not an alien character that hides who you are."
Bad Guys,Oh shit he wrote it with Esposito in mind? I had no idea
Bad Guys,"Isn't the US Hollywood and the entertainment industry as a whole almost exclusively black and white artists? 

Had they cast a First Nation, Pakistani, Indian or Filipino actor that would have been something unusual. 

The progessive left in the US is really weird about socially identity, it seems that instead of promoting unity the goal is to create division."
Bad Guys,Literally did not have to mention a colour
Bad Guys,And holy hell did he nail it.
Bad Guys,Nails it too
Bad Guys,This is the way.
Bad Guys,"Let me guess, he plays a cold and calculating bad guy with connections in the underground drug/fighting/smuggling business and isn't someone to be crossed."
Bad Guys,"I don’t care what his skin color is, he’s a amazing actor. That’s what got him the role."
Bad Guys,"""... Relegated to playing thieves and thugs...""

Should we tell him?"
Bad Guys,"Awww I had to play the best and most beloved character on breaking bad, I’m so oppressed and disadvantaged."
Bad Guys,Oh ffs. Why the fuck does EVERYTHING have to be about race and fucking gender?!! Does anyone remember the fucking A-Team? That shit was dope. Nobody talked about Murdock’s bi-polar shit or B.A’s struggle to intergrate. And it was fucking epic.
Bad Guys,"I mean, Lando is a bad guy more or less in Empire, people have mentioned James Earl Jones... it hurts my head how uninformed and ignorant most entertainment journalists are."
Bad Guys,This head line is bull crap. He is not a bad guy. He is just trying to make sure a dangerous religion dose not come back to the galaxy. The Empire did nothing wrong!
Bad Guys,"🤦‍♂️

Everything is about race on this site. *Everything.*"
Bad Guys,"Uhhhh sorry to say this is stupid.

He complains about thug and thief roles but plays 2 thug roles... 

Ok

Edit: for the downvoters
 Darth was black and we knew it
The dudes black and Italian from what i read.

Your telling me those are the only roles for people a shade darker than mayonnaise?

Man you all must have been TV and movie deprived .

Edit 2:
Cuba gooding Jr was always a thief or thug?
Denzel?

All the way back to the 30s roles were diverse in movies and tv"
Bad Guys,Jesus Christ the chips on their shoulders these people have. Multi millionaires who have been given the easiest job in the world and they still bitch and moan. Yeah you’re so oppressed compared to a out of work blue collar white guy in the rust belt whose house has been looted from rioters and can’t even go to church anymore
Bad Guys,Was Gus from breaking bad white?
Bad Guys,"Finally a non white bad guy. Now my kids have people of color to look up to.

WTF people?"
Bad Guys,"As is your grandson, Joaquin."
Bad Guys,I like both the actor and the director. I’m glad they’re both doing this.
Bad Guys,fantastically skilled actor all around
Bad Guys,Has nothing todo with color? Maybe he’s just a good actor?
Bad Guys,"Ah yes, now instead of playing thieves of thugs he will play a space nazi.

All jokes aside tho that’s amazing!"
Bad Guys,Why are people acting like he's whining? Seems like he's happy to have been envisioned for a character.
Bad Guys,I don’t know this guy hasn’t been a James Bond villain yet
Bad Guys,"I love this guy. Not only is he a great actor, but he seems to legitimately love playing villains so much"
Bad Guys,"Wait, chef John wrote the mandalorian?"
Bad Guys,"If an actor of his caliber is stoked for his role in the Mandalorian, then I’m stoked to watch it."
Bad Guys,"I love him as a villain, but at the same time I don't want him to go the way of Sean Bean, where there's a good chance he's going to die just because he's a villain.  It's nice to have some layers than something drawn with a fine line between good and evil."
Bad Guys,This man’s acting is so powerful i had nightmares about him when i watched the breaking bad
Bad Guys,He completely slays as Lex Luther too
Bad Guys,"Breaking Bad’s 4th season was the greatest television season ever for me. The wheels had come off for Walt and Jesse, and Gus Fring was the greatest villain ever. I also hope they expand his role in season 2 of the Prime’s “The Boys”."
Bad Guys,Oh my god who cares what skin color you have. If someone writes a good character and a good actor brings it to life properly I couldn't care less what race they are
Bad Guys,"The Imperials have always been ""bad white men"" White guys are literally the bad guys. All throughout the story. When a black man is about to save the galaxy, he's betrayed by a white guy. A white guy kills an entire planet. The entire galaxy is fighting white men in the story. I mean did you see those uniforms? Where do you **think** they come from... 

Whats it mean to play an Imperial bad guy who isn't white? That people of color and/or minority groups are capable of acting despicable too? [Who'da thunk?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/a7/38/d3a738413b1b9c65333276c89ed82476.gif)"
Bad Guys,You mean an Imperial Patriot of Color r/EmpireDidNothingWrong
Bad Guys,This is Gus from breaking bad right?
Bad Guys,Is there any canon reason for why there are so few black people in Star Wars?
Bad Guys,Darth Vader?
Bad Guys,Easily the worst villain ever. About as threatening as a theatre coach.
Bad Guys,White has nothing to do with anything
Bad Guys,The real star of Breaking Bad!
Bad Guys,"Congrats - you're no longer a thug or criminal, you're a corrupt government bureaucrat."
Bad Guys,ya because a black person has never had a role custom made for them....🥴 so tired of these racist titles and conversations
Bad Guys,What does skin color on a human mean in a sci-fi universe with thousands of alien races.   Why do these people feel the need to inject real world identity politics into every damn thing?
Bad Guys,Giancarlo IMHO will go down as one of the greatest villain actors of all time.
Bad Guys,Does Giancarlo think the ex-Imperial Warlord is.... not a thug?
Bad Guys,Oh boo hoo. give me a break.
Bad Guys,This kind of racial relativism sickens me.
Bad Guys,"He was great in the season finale, I’m excited to see more of him in season two. Good actors always add to the show they are in, no matter their ethnicity."
Bad Guys,">Giancarlo Esposito on What It Means to Play an Imperial Bad Guy Who Isn’t White

Hooray! Now someone of color can get to play the....bad guy?....what is the celebration here for?

>It’s quite conspicuous for a franchise that has become a battleground for very modern debates over race and gender. 

In the pantheon of interesting Imperial characters, Gideon doesn't even crack the top 10. Mara Jade, Daala, Thrawn, Marasiah Fel, Antaras. This character, despite such a great actor portraying him, is so pathetically underwritten. [Like, I would much prefer the Empire characters to have more nuance like this fan film gave.](https://youtu.be/M9bPc2tmu_M).

>“Well, it means a lot to me because I’ve strived in my career to be colorless,”

He then goes on to talk about his race, because nothing says ""I don't want my race to be a factor"" like talking about your race as a factor. 

>I am of mixed race, half Italian, half African American, and I grew through the period of time where I was relegated to playing thieves and thugs. 

And you're happy you're playing a flat-out bad guy which.....what?"
Bad Guys,James Earl Jones wasn't white either
Bad Guys,See Hollywood not all bad guys are white.
Bad Guys,Huh. Didn’t realize this until now. Damn. I should really start paying attention to people’s skin color. It’s increasingly important.
Bad Guys,"Who cares?

Its because hes a badass actor not because of his skin color"
Bad Guys,Spike Lee cast him as a thug that killed Malcom X. Shame on him.
Bad Guys,He was great as the investigative reporter in Bob Roberts.
El Chapo,what is our world
El Chapo,Shame on vh1
El Chapo,[deleted]
El Chapo,Let’s just keep glamorizing the worst society has to offer eh?
El Chapo,"If VH1 was around in the late 40s I’m sure they would have made a show following the wives of SS officers.

Bunch of degenerates."
El Chapo,We live in a simulation
El Chapo,Who the fuck is going to be the crew? No way I would ever do the hair and makeup of a woman marrried to EL Chapo. She ends up on air with some lipstick on her teeth and boom you end up on a milk box
El Chapo,She SERIOUSLY wants to go on american television and talk about the Sinaloa cartel when they're stronger than ever right now putting her life in danger? lol ok I guess.
El Chapo,The world is really fucked up.
El Chapo,What even is vh1 anymore?
El Chapo,Ooh next they should do a reality show on the families of genocidal maniacs!
El Chapo,VH1 is fucking trash. I remember watching general Top 20 music videos a decade ago but that's it.
El Chapo,I'm kind of disappointed he didn't do a better job of providing for her retirement.  This really hurt my opinion of El Chapo.
El Chapo,This is how we have fallen as a society.
El Chapo,Thanks ladies.
El Chapo,"Twitter ""activists"" cancel people that make asian jokes but can't cancel this garbage? Shame on anyone that watches this garbage. Shame on VH1."
El Chapo,Have you ever played sim city and got bored to the point where you destroy it with every natural disaster?
El Chapo,Peak trash.
El Chapo,Shame on the *millions* of people that are going to waste their lives watching it.
El Chapo,Because neither VH1 nor the American public have any principles.
El Chapo,"> Like what next, ISIS wives reality show?

You say this as if people wouldn't watch the shit out of it."
El Chapo,"We already had that awful Mafia wives show... it’s disgusting. Jersey Shore was one thing, and it was somewhat entertaining, but cmon let’s stop giving money to these criminals."
El Chapo,"This got a chuckle out of me. Have an imaginary $5, guy."
El Chapo,She got more balls then the entire Mexican government
El Chapo,i’ve never played the game but yes i’ve thought about that
El Chapo,"i wish it was peak, but it seems to just keep getting worse"
El Chapo,Truth
El Chapo,"As long as it isn’t happening to them, no one cares much."
El Chapo,I heard Burqa Bitches is already in production at Starz
El Chapo,"Well atleast the mafia is pretty much just a bunch of poorly dressed italian slobs pulling credit card frauds now, not much to glorify there"
El Chapo,These types of shows are basically what happens when you lock Sims in a room with no means of escaping.
El Chapo,I know it's a meme at this point but Idiocracy is becoming real life.
El Chapo,**GABBBAGOOOL**
El Chapo,Lol not true if you actually know the mafia
El Chapo,"meme or not, it’s pretty much true"
El Chapo,He broke out again?!
El Chapo,"I don't care if it doesn't make any sense, i demand a crossover between Narcos and El Chapo!"
El Chapo,A couple episodes in and so far so good! Has a high production value similar to Narcos and looks very promising. 
El Chapo,"How does this compare to Narcos? Same, better or worse?"
El Chapo,Is this a miniseries or season one of many?
El Chapo,I don't recall ever needing to backtrack and ask so many questions during a TV show before.
El Chapo,"Is it me or is the audio pretty bad? Seems like there is a voice track but really really low volume effects for almost everything else. You see them running, hitting objects, you hear mostly nothing. My surround works fine with movies and other netflix shows."
El Chapo,"I just wanna know if it is as fun as Narcos. I really wanna see this, because this doesn't seem to have a forced lead US character who overnarrates and repeats everything that's happening and being said right in front of our eyes."
El Chapo,Is this similar to Pablo Escobar El Patrón Del Mal? 
El Chapo,Netflix really will take in anything!
El Chapo,escobar is in the first episode. but it is a different actor
El Chapo,"Isn't Narcos supposed to eventually lead up to modern day Narcos like El Chapo?

This series doesn't make sense to me because it seems redundant if Narcos is supposed to cover that eventually"
El Chapo,You very much got what you wanted
El Chapo,"This series badly needs some sort of narration akin to Narcos. The pacing is off severely and I would assume there was heavy post-production issues. There had to be. I cannot fathom how a script like this would be granted such a budget.

Don't get me wrong. The content matter is very interesting, but the execution really batters it down to a pulp.

Edit: As I'm watching this, I think it's just subpar across the board. Very sterile acting and erratic photography. I mean, if it wasn't for the subject, this would be considered a disaster.

Edit 2: I also have a really hard time accepting the fact the series portrays Guzman as a victim. The man is a mass murderer, a crime lord guilty of thousands of deaths in the region.

And I don't buy for one second the anti-hero parallels with Narcos. Escobar's perhaps sympathetic narrative in Narcos is completely swept away by the tragedies he caused to his society. Narcos is not about Escobar. It is about a whole culture devastated by the clash of political oppression and narcotrafficking.

Netflix's El Chapo is only about El Chapo. A very uneventful, biased portayal of one of the worst crime lords in recent history as if he's a victim and a martyr."
El Chapo,Only watched 2 episodes of El Chapo. It's worse than Narcos in every way in my opinion. I'd give Narcos an 8.5/10 and El Chapo a 6.5/10.
El Chapo,Multiple seasons. This first one has 9 episodes and the second season is supposed to come out this September.
El Chapo,"This is my main issue with the show, couldn't make it past the first episode. "
El Chapo,"Stupid Narcos for sticking to the real story and forcing that dumb American into the plot, he totally wasn't there IRL right??"
El Chapo,"That show was something else, damn good Colombian production, haven't seen this one yet, hopefully it's similarly shot, I'm not sure sure who produces it; Univision or Televisa, they're not known for good series. "
El Chapo,"I just watched the first episode and you're right. The show is interesting and i'll keep watching, but it definitely has a problem in writing and pacing, the first episode felt like a ""What sort of wacky hijinks will Chapo run into while trying to smuggle drugs!?"" 

Then at the end of the episode when his brother tells him ""You'll never be the greatest drug kingpin of all time!"" holy shit did I groan when I heard that line. The show is also a bit overly dramatic, almost bollywood esque, but that could just be how Mexican TV is made."
El Chapo,That's my issue with the show. It's purely from el chapo's perspective and rampantly biased because of that. It even attempts to paint the Mexican government as the biggest criminals when the cartels kill thousands.
El Chapo,"I think you are completely wrong. The pace is great and a good series shouldn't need narration to move it along. While Narcos was good, its main problem was that they tried to compress the story in about 20 episodes. 

I think the Colombian series ""Pablo Escobar: El patron del mal"" did a good job with the pacing at about 100 episodes."
El Chapo,"Yeah, that's a hard pass then."
El Chapo,As far as Univision productions go this is the creme de La creme.
El Chapo,I guess I'll give it a miss then. Cheers.
El Chapo,Thanks.
El Chapo,"From what I've read they put the two protagonists in the middle of a bunch of situations they were far away from during the real events.

Which is fair enough in the name of entertainment and storytelling, but I think criticizing it is fair as well.  "
El Chapo,"That's another thing, yes. Dramatization through forced sound design. El chapo moves from motel to car to trunk to motel to restaurant back to motel, absolutely nothing happens... and the score is hinting at Jesus Christ walking the Earth again. Off, almost amateurish."
El Chapo,Wait..he only watched 2 episodes...
El Chapo,If it ends up being good I'll find out eventually.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
El Chapo,[deleted]
El Chapo,"I've watched all 9 episodes, it's actually really good. Up there with narcos if you ask me."
El Chapo,No Bueno...
El Chapo,"So I've recently started watching it, and I'm 5 eps in. It's not bad in some parts, but there's one thing I'm really disliking (and I may very well be the only one):

From the first episode, whenever a problem came up for him, it was resolved pretty much instantly. There's no real buffer between El Chapo going 'Ahhh FUCK!' and 'Oh ok, all good, let's move on'.

I find the storyline quite clunky. Further to my above gripe, it also just feels like a fair bit of the stuff really serves no purpose and is a bit random/silly being there. Like, if it was omitted, the story would still make sense and be fine (maybe even better). Again, might just be me here, but it feels like they're just trying to fill each ep out to ~45-50min.

All in all, it's ok. Not great, not shit. But ok. It's nowhere near put together as well as Narcos, but it serves as a bit of entertainment if you don't really have anything else to watch on Netflix currently (which is exactly why I'm watching it)."
El Chapo,I'm enjoying it so far
El Chapo,"Watched the first 3 episodes, and i've liked it okey so far. Don't go into it expecting it to be anywhere near as good as narcos, though "
El Chapo,It's really badly executed and doesn't really seem to go anywhere or give you the impression El Chapo was anything other than your oridinary fugutive. El Patron del Mal blows and narcos blow this show out of the water
El Chapo,"Seen episode 1. Not too great, I'll try to watch more because I like the topic but it's not as good as say Narcos"
El Chapo,It's good and bad. Not as good as Narcos but if there isn't anything else on it is worth a watch. Some episodes really drag
El Chapo,I was all set to talk about the real El Chapo but then I remembered what sub I was on.  
El Chapo,First few minutes were boring as fuck.Turned it off
El Chapo,"Maybe even better than Narcos, and I loved Narcos."
El Chapo,"I enjoyed it too although it appears to be a little one sided and is maybe lacking on the back of story. The Mexican government are made out to be the biggest crooks in this show, when someone like el chapo must have hundreds of deaths to his name. "
El Chapo,Judging a show on the first 5 minutes.. nice. 
El Chapo,"I like it too. I'm only on episode 4 right now but I've really enjoyed it so far. There may be some pacing issues but it doesn't take away from the show that much for me. I think the bar is just set really high with Narcos and other great TV shows, but El Chapo is totally watchable/worth my time."
El Chapo,"good show, enjoying more than narcos"
El Chapo,[deleted]
El Chapo,"Never understood why people praised Narcos, and especially the guy who played Escobar.

There wasn't a single moment where I thought, 'yea, that guy is a killer, a monster'. Unlike previous actors who have played Escobar where you generally get that feeling straight from the bat.

Cliff Curtis in Blow, Benicio Del Toro in Escobar for example.

When you play someone like Escobar you need your audience to tremble with fear (so to speak) when he's in the room and not focus all your acting skills on 'look at my belly, it's so big, I need to adjust my pants, again'.

The actor who played Escobar in Narcos was the biggest let down, and I really wanted to like that show.

Thankfully Javier Bardem will play Escobar next so I might just be able to remove the last shred of Narcos from my mind and in the bin.

El Chapo,Worse in every way.
El Chapo,"I mean, it doesn't "
El Chapo,it's a lower budget version IMHO but I like it
El Chapo,It's way worse but it's still a great adaptation of real history.
El Chapo,"> There wasn't a single moment where I thought, 'yea, that guy is a killer, a monster'.

That's kind of the point. He's based on a real life person, he isn't Keyser Soze."
El Chapo,"You have to change your Language and Subtitle options in the settings, you have it set wrong. You are watching an English DUB with English Subtitles on. You can change the language to the original language which is not English."
El Chapo,"It's in spanish, at least in Netflix mexico. Maybe try the undubbed version"
El Chapo,The dub not matching the subtitles is pretty par for the course.
El Chapo,"I saw Narcos complete and it's way below Chapo in every way. Hell, Wagner Moura can't even speak Spanish. The production of Chapo is lavish, the cinematography exquisite. Even the music is better. Mexican directors are no joke.

The cast is stellar, they pick a handful of unknown yet great talent. I can understand the fascination with Narcos but it comes across a bit conceited.  The dialogue sounds sophomoric."
El Chapo,"It also shows how people who do horrible things are not 'monsters.' Or rather, there is a monster in all people and it comes out in certain circumstances.

At the end of the day he was still a human being and he wanted the same things as other people, but he developed a careless attitude toward human life. Hell, you could argue the guys who wanted to catch him became just as monstrous, as they did some fucked up things in the name of justice."
El Chapo,"I really liked the series. I kept telling my co-workers about it and when they finally gave it a shot, they said, ""you never told me it was in spanish!"" I completely forgot. It was a great show."
El Chapo,Vy
El Chapo,I expected it to get more traction off the back of Narcos. Most people I know who are into this kinda stuff haven't even given it a try. I'm definitely looking forward to the second series if nothing else 
El Chapo,Agreed. Any word on when it is going to come out?
El Chapo,"I wonder if the El Chapo series will eventually just become the third season of Narcos, at least for non-Univision audiences."

> The company on Monday said it will be tweaking its compensation packages for top executives, offering bonuses in the form of performance stock units based on their success in generating cash and helping the company reduce its leverage. 


> That includes WBD CEO David Zaslav, who will see his 2023 performance restricted stock units (PRSUs) tied to free cash flow. Those PRSUs have a target value of $12 million, however, if the company overdelivers on its cash flow effort, it could be doubled. He will also be eligible for a separate $11.5 million block of PRSUs, which will also be tied to cash flow performance, and which could also be doubled if the company overdelivers.


> Zaslav’s total compensation was $246 million in 2021, tied to the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. Of course, much of that compensation will depend on performance (specifically on share price, a metric that few media or entertainment companies have been able to deliver on recently).

Those are your customers not us.

Free cash flow means that a company is making money as opposed to whatever you know about other tech companies when they were growing. It costs more to borrow money today and you can’t keep burning cash like netflix.

Free!,The fuck dose he do to deserve that kind of pay
Free!,"I'm sorry but you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

Warner Bros didn't pay him $250m in cash. He got $3m in his regular salary, $22m in cash bonuses, $5m in a one-off bonus, that's what the company actually paid him in cash, around $30m. Then you have $13m in stock bonuses which is the value of newly issued stock, not cash money transferred to Zaslav's account. That lands us at a total package of roughly $43m which is what he usually gets every year.

The $250m number is a one off thing based on the $205m valuation of future stock options he received through the Discovery merger. The company is required to assign a valuation on that form of compensation, but the number is very rough at best.

The most important part of those $205m options is that they are literally worthless as long as Discovery stock trades at under $35.6 per share. It was trading at around $23 per share when he received that bonus so to see even a dime of that $205m the company would have to increase in value by over 50% under his leadership (roughly a $30b increase)

I’m going off on numbers from memory so they might be off by a couple million here and there but you get the idea"

It's easy to be the CEO of a company like McDonalds but it's way harder to be the CEO of a company that is very much staring down the barrel of eventual demise."
Free!,"That's not how that works. It's not cash and he doens't reward himself. Even though he's the big boss that doesn't mean he picks his own pay. He agrees to be CEO and accepts a certain compensation package (e.g. salary, and bonus structure). The company's board of directors determine what kind of package is offered. Commonly bonuses are based on performance of the stock. But in this case. the article is saying the board of directors want to see FCF and reduction of debt as their key metrics to whether or not he gets a bonus. In regards to it not being cash. These deals have moentary values but it's speculative. He gets shares/stocks of the company estimated to be worth that much if he reaches his goals and the stock price is the same. These shares/stocks are either shares in their treaasury or shares that they create from thin air."
Free!,"Welcome to capitalism, where the goal is more money for the rich through exploitation."
Free!,"What you're saying is true but it's also equally true to say ""man gets compensated for doing the things he was hired to"" even if those things are in the best interest of shareholders instead of creatives and consumers"
Free!,"You misread what the article said. They aren't giving away cash bonuses, they are giving away stock bonuses based on the company's FCF. The execs who lower the most debt, get the most stock bonuses."
Free!,"They didn't give themseles personally more money. Zaslav and other executvies agree to work for certain compensation package (e.g. salary and bonus structure). The ones making the changes are the board of directors who want to fix the massive debt problem and make sure the company has more money coming than out. It's common for bonus to be based on stock price but stock price can go up regardless of FCF, profit or debt. So to make sure they aren't jusst trying to raise the stock price or the stock price goes up on its own without fixing their other two problems they are changing the bonus condition to be based on them improve two metrics of FCF and debt instead of share price.

Killing those shows/movies and firign people is what reduces how much money goes out and it also reduces their losses helping curb debt. So the board of directors making debt and FCF as key metrics for whether or not Zaslav gets bonus compensation does not go againsst all the stuff Zaslav been doing."
Free!,"reddit is so financially illiterate, it's sad. Every WBD thread is just embarrassing."

Or the company can stay on it's current trajectory and those will for sure get unemployment checks down the road."

Not exactly relevant to the discussion at hand though, but I guess if you wanted the Elon comparison, you got it."
Free!,"Probably not, as the article states his bonuses unlock when the company does better in cash flow and debt reduction. So, he's got to the balance sheet fixed in order for him to profit which is a tougher task than just cutting staffing or reducing department budgets.

- these bonuses aren’t real money, they either come from thin air or from a reserve of shares previously made from thin air.

Hopefully somebody does fund one of her projects bc she sounds like somebody who has a future in helping make sure her cast and crew are safe and protected!
Stranger,It's totally bullshit that with film unions and guilds that Producers can keep their job after such disgusting behavior.
Stranger,">“One of the last movies I did, one of the producers asked me to… like, he hired a girl that he was sleeping with and then he had her ask me to have a threesome with them,” Van Dien said. “So… that’s my boss. And then I didn’t and I cried and I was so upset. But when people are like, ‘How is streaming better for your mental health?’ That’s how. I get to stay inside my house and play video games and I don’t have my boss asking me to have sex with them.”

Just one of the many benefits of working remotely."
Stranger,"Chrissy wake up!

On a serious note, good for her by not compromising her morals to advance her career."
Stranger,NPR just did a story about how conditions in the entertainment industry are basically back to pre me too. Large companies hired experts to help them change but just used them as shields whenever concerns were raised. All outward change was purely performative.
Stranger,Chrissy woke up!!!
Stranger,"I gotta say, for one of the most unioned up industries in this country, they do fucking fuck all when shit like this comes up."
Stranger,"Harvey Weinstein was just the tip, the whole industry is fucked"
Stranger,So in other words nothing has changed at all?!
Stranger,That’s awful. Hopefully she can find some projects without any sex pests. I was impressed with her on Stranger Things. She really elevated what could have been a typical mean-girl cheerleader tropey character.
Stranger,"On another note, it just hit me that her dad is Johnny Rico from Starship Troopers, Casper Van Dien. My mind is blown that he has a 26 y/o daughter, but it makes sense."
Stranger,I wish some of these women would be more Ellen Barkin-like and say names when they talk of these things.
Stranger,Good that she knows her worth and kudos to her for sharing what happened
Stranger,What is it with Hollywood and the total inability to not be a creep?
Stranger,Wow that sucks. But at least she can get some joy out of streaming
Stranger,Out that boss - hollywood still full of assholish men treating women like shit.
Stranger,Stranger things star? She was in like one episode
Stranger,"No relation to Casper van Dien, is there?"
Stranger,“Star” is used pretty loosely these days eh
Stranger,Her twitch handle is BlueFille. I couldn't find it in the article.
Stranger,"More power too her. She’s doing her part!

She was good in Stranger Things, her role was small but complex and her performance was memorable. I’ll miss seeing more from her but she doesn’t owe us her talent. She owes herself her happiness."
Stranger,"I love that she not only didn't cave to the pressure, but called it out. She can't name the man because he'll bury her financially in litigation, but she can make it known that she's experienced what we all know the industry does and that other women don't have to accept it either."
Stranger,"I don't want to in any way downplay the inappropriate sexual situations she was exposed to, but this article really exaggerated and overplayed her role in Stranger Things.  She was in part of one episode... Not exactly ""the breakout star"" they claimed

Jazzing up the story is not how journalism is done"
Stranger,What’s sad is after everything the last few years these abusers in Hollywood can still get away with it and keep doing this awful shit to more people. I’d like to think we live in a world where they can’t hide anymore. I wish she could name this person but I get why she can’t. I feel for her.
Stranger,Didnt know she was Johnny Rico's daughter.
Stranger,Had no idea this was Casper Van Dien's kid.
Stranger,"Understandable, have a great day"
Stranger,It’s horrible that so many industries are operated this way and not enough people put their foot down and expose it.
Stranger,Johnny Rico doesn't like this
Stranger,Why can’t people just go to work and do their job instead of trying to sleep with people / sexually harass or assault those they work with?
Stranger,name names. burn that cesspool to the ground
Stranger,Y’all should watch the movie “she said” came out late last year and is about Harvey Weinstein and that New York Times article. Really begs the question of how many other Harveys are out there?
Stranger,"I feel so bad for her. She's been bullied by people who are obsessed with Joseph Quinn (Eddie from Stranger Things) too, because they are friends.

I hope things look up for her."
Stranger,"Amuzing people are still dubious of potential repercussions if she spoke out more, considering the trash she's already getting in this cesspool of a thread, entirely from people with no stakes in the matter."
Stranger,"She was only in 3 episodes, how is she a “star”?"
Stranger,Name them!
Stranger,"Stranger Things *Star*? I watched it and don’t even remember her character, let alone know who she is."
Stranger,Wait… that jawline. I just realized she’s Rico’s daughter.
Stranger,No idea who this is
Stranger,Hollywoods gunna Hollywood
Stranger,"Common Hollywood L 

Wish more actors and actresses were strong enough to call out all the predators

Sadly doing so puts their career and money at risk"
Stranger,"A producer asked his girlfriend to ask Grace if she would like to have a threesome. 

She decided not to. Then cried about it. Then left 

What a load of overblown hysterics."
Stranger,"""star"""
Stranger,Back in the day that would have gotten you blacklisted from movies. Hopefully this isn’t still the case.
Stranger,"I didn't know she streamed and I thought I'd check it out, but she has no archived past broadcasts or anything at all eh?"
Stranger,It is unfortunate when an industry becomes known for having a toxic environment. It is important for all industries to prioritize creating safe and respectful spaces for everyone.
Stranger,"Waiting for the usual suspects to attack and vilify her for daring to speak out against an abusive man, the way they have for other women over the last four years. Claiming it was their fault they were abused, or that they were the ones abusing the men."
Stranger,Hollywood never cleaned up after Harvey obv
Stranger,"One horrible takeaway from all of this is that too much of this comes down to “talent”. 

The producers with “talent” get away with this shit behavior while the many victims have to hope they’re “talented” enough to be heard. 

Super mature move out of her to acknowledge how toxic that is instead of suffering."
Stranger,"Inaccurate title: ‘Stranger Things’ Star

‘Stranger Things’ Actor more like it - she's in 1 episode, and 2 flashbacks (uncredited)

Regardless - why is this still happening? Did Hollywood ignore the Harvey Weinstein crap"
Stranger,[removed]
Stranger,Why is the industry that prides itself on moralizing to the world is actually the most racist and sexist hive of villainy?
Stranger,hows this still happening after weinstein?
Stranger,"I always find it interesting when people in America express such sexually liberal views, and then something like this comes up people act as though the employee and worker relationship is somehow sacred. 

She is an attractive and semi-notable young actress, who must receive attention from many men, especially as a streamer. Is the only reason for this being news and outrage-worthy the fact that her boss tried to get his way with her? 

Perhaps it’s the power dynamic people find offensive. They picture a helpless and naive young woman, and a strong older man who aims to take advantage of her. However, the woman in question is well of age, so is this really anybody’s business other than her own?

Surely we wouldn’t mean to patronize the young woman, who is obviously more than capable of rejecting someone’s advances on her own, without the aid and outrage of the thoughtful Reddit community."

Stranger,Least depraved Hollywood director/producer
Stranger,Star and Twitch streamer
Stranger,"*credited with 3 out of the shows 42 episodes*

""Star"""
Stranger,Totally understand. I wish she would name names. These animals need to be outed.
Stranger,"I'm a bit confused. Inapptiateness withstanding...is she turning down these roles because those several offers were associated with said producer? If so, I totally get it. But to turn down all work indiscriminately? Idk...sounds like we are missing some info here."
Stranger,She needs to get her dad to kick some ass.
Stranger,The number of people defending the dude as just asking her out is pathetic.
Stranger,Chrissy wake up!!! I don't like this!!! Chrissssssy wake up. I didn't know who she was in Stranger Things from the picture without looking her up. Fyi she is Chrissy from S4. Too bad she has to deal with creep producers but it looks like she has been streaming on Twitch so at least she is enjoy still making content.
Stranger,Wait til she finds out about the people on twitch too
Stranger,Ah... to be a woman. And they say rape culture doesn't exist
Stranger,"Imagine thinking that after Weinstein … you of all people can somehow get away with it …

Good for her honestly. She’s making money and she doesn’t even have to leave her house. She literally stays home, plays video games, and gets paid. If you’re mad you’re just jealous because she’s living the dream."
Stranger,I like how people can do this and have no repercussions because people around them aren't willing to expose the truth on how bad they are. I get not wanting to as a victim because of how much harassment they get but it's annoying how many people stay silent when they see their boss being an absolute creep. This shit just causes a cycle of harassment because obviously the sexual advances aren't going to stop because they're not punished for their crimes.
Stranger,So when are the women in this field going to be smart enough to carry some sort of recording device with them so that when these shit producers do this then there is some sort of evidence against them?
Stranger,And people wonder why celebrities keep their kids hidden from the public
Stranger,"Hey, guys, we get it, you think the word ""star"" is misapplied. Glad you're all so focused on what's important."
Stranger,"Not the point of the article, but: Does anyone else not remember her in Stranger Things?"
Stranger,So who’s the producer? Get the name out and hopefully he’ll never produce anything again
Stranger,"Apparently if you want to bang women while in a position of power and authority over them, but are dumb and can't become a teacher, you become a sleazy EP."
Stranger,The two Coreys took a huge hit for talking about what happened to them. They were mocked reviled and blacklisted. All because pedos make money for Hollywood.
Stranger,"""Stranger things star""

Bit generous, that."
Stranger,"Hollywood is friggin gross. Always has been always will be, until there’s no more Hollywood."
Stranger,"Awful through and through.

We should watch in the future to see if she files a lawsuit for sexual harassment. It’s arguable she’s laying the groundwork for damages (loss of income from psyche basis).

Hypothetically, if she does file suit and prevails, she may get paid for said contracts of films. 

While underhanded, who gives a shit. The industry should not allow this type of crap to happen, they let fucking that sexual predator Weinstein do what he wanted for 20+ years without consequence.

This scum bag probably has a reputation for doing it much the same."
Stranger,"not a star of the series, but sucky situation."
Stranger,I would be surprise if anyone would hire her after this article.

Stranger,Stranger Things star is a bit of a stretch isn’t it?
Stranger,"Say they name! Put them on blast. Only way you finna weed all these creeps out, they need to be put on blast. I know it’s difficult and you’re concerned about not being blackballed but we’ve seen people will collectively get together and weed out the bad ones if it’s enough voices. Just get these creeps out."

Noddy Toyland Detective,Shocked It’s a Wonderful Life isn’t on the itinerary.
Noddy Toyland Detective,Pretty interesting the only movie from the 90's is Little Women. Pretty rare to see something so recent on TCM.
Noddy Toyland Detective,I think NBCUniversal hoards the rights to that on broadcast and on cable (seen it on USA before)
Noddy Toyland Detective,Amazon Prime Video has it. 
Noddy Toyland Detective,It got so oversaturated in the 70's and 80's- it makes me glad NBC only plays it twice a year.
Noddy Toyland Detective,2nd and 3rd movies in the list are from the '90s
Noddy Toyland Detective,Interestingly I had never heard of those and they were by the same woman that's no longer with us: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jacobson
Noddy Toyland Detective,"Especially now that Filmstruck is gone, I'm glad that TCM is still occasionally running stuff like this."
Storage Hunters,One of them had better scripts.
Storage Hunters,You would say they were all fully using scripts ??
Storage Hunters,"Most of it is scripted and semi-fake. They've been fairly upfront about it. Its real items, but they do some magic behind the scenes to make it look more interesting than it is and most of what is said is scripted."
Storage Hunters,"I feel like reality TV is part of the golden age of television we currently live in. I know it sounds strange but hear me out.

Reality TV nails the lowest common denominator. Appealing to that audience would drag down a good show, I think we would all agree. Now because that market is tapped, great shows on the air currently (Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Louie, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, The Venture Brothers, Community, Game of Thrones, etc) don't have to reach that audience. They rarely even try. Meaning more quality programs for us.

Let's look further. You could argue that this could be done without reality TV. Every channel could push out some 2.5 Men as a mouth breather lightning rod. Here's the catch. 2.5 Men has a production cost far exceeding a reality show's cost. What that means for us, the parent companies owning reality shows can dump more money to hire better writers, directors, actors, hair makeup costume set lighting designers to produce a better quality product. When you have money it's easier to pursue art, and that's what reality TV does. It makes money while costing very little. "
Storage Hunters,"Let people enjoy what they enjoy.  A huge amount of people enjoy these programs as their ratings will show.  I think you are taking TV way too seriously.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying ""stupid"" shows.  If you don't like it, then don't watch it, but don't tell other people what they should be tuning into.  I enjoy a wide variety of shows, some being shows like Breaking Bad, Louie, etc, and some being shows like Pawns Stars and Jersey Shore.  I guess it all boils down to, ""Who gives a fuck"".  "
Storage Hunters,"Oh my, no-one has ever thought this before."
Storage Hunters,American Reality TV is bad.
Storage Hunters,"Have you actually watched much reality TV? Shows like the Amazing Race or Top Chef are definitely worth watching IMO. There are different levels of quality within the genre, as with any genre.

Yes, I know, defending reality TV on reddit, downvotes to the left."
Storage Hunters,"Reality TV subsidizes quality content (well, for the networks that produce both categories). I think that broadcast networks developed the model and have capitalized best on it. For example, NBC has its Must-See-TV on Thursdays with scripted comedies, followed by an episode of the Biggest Loser or Celebrity Apprentice.

Then you've got AMC, which arguably has the best scripted shows on cable, but even they have succommed to the cheap reality television model with Comic Book Men. It's all about hooking the viewers with quality content, and then getting them to stick around for the sideshow.

History, Discovery, Vh1, TLC (but TLC has arguably always been reality based) etc. have just devolved though. They put ""interesting"" people in front of a camera with a few guides/careful edits, and they make bank.

FX has done something different lately though (starting with always sunny) - gambles on cheap concepts that have ultimately panned-out well for them. Unfortunately, this model is tricky and just doesn't have the returns of reality television.

Any questions? I watch a lot of TV.

Edit: I don't like to moan about downvotes, but I'll make an exception. Really? At least give me a dissenting opinion."
Storage Hunters,"I agree with you, but I don't think reality TV ever attempts to mimic or sell reality. I think they are selling emotion and cheaply manufactured tension. Everyone one of these shows with their all-to-similar soundtracks and pregnant pauses and confessionals where the douche bag explains in plain English what they just did is all designed so that you feel something. 

Take Real Housewives for example. No one in their right mind should care about anything that happens to them. But it's designed so you sit there and think ""oh my god I hope Carly and what's her tits work out their problems because one of them wore purple to the party where no one was supposed to wear purple."" 

It's an addiction after a while. You get addicted to the manufactured drama and the emotions. 

Same with all those pawn shows and the ones where they open up storage lockers. The audience is addicted to the tension and the reveal. 

Also, on a personal note, the death of actual creative writing TV is fucking depressing. The whole reason I want to write and create shit is because of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. What do kids have now? TV is a powerful medium and I am terrified of a generation brought up on 16 and Pregnant and whatever the hell is on Mtv these days. It's just going to turn them into conniving backstabbing bickering little twats. "
Storage Hunters,Is it exhausting being the last bastion of intellectual superiority in a world filled with shallow idiots?
Storage Hunters,Mining for gold? Is that the one they keep on going on about the glory hole?
Storage Hunters,"I don't really think that is entirely true. A show like the Amazing Race manages to remain (relatively) classy, is always entertaining and in a way educates people about different countries and cultures."
Storage Hunters,"You are right.

Solution:  Cancel your cable subscription. "
Storage Hunters,Don't you fucking DARE speak ill of the great Bob Saget. 
Storage Hunters,Reality tv shows people for what they are. If you think that is degrading your problem is not with tv but with people. 
Storage Hunters,"As someone who makes reality TV for a living, I disagree with you.

As someone who also gets paid to write screenplays for a living, I agree with you.

I AM TORN."
Storage Hunters,"That's a nice essay for someone your age, I'm sure you're going to get a very good grade. Just make sure you get rid of the swear words and add paragraphs before you hand it in.
"
Storage Hunters,[deleted]
Storage Hunters,"There is a certain merit to that argument. I'm pretty sure it could be easily toppled, but I don't know how."
Storage Hunters,"TLDR fodder for the majority of mainstream retards to fund higher quality TV.

I applaud you for writing this in a way that didn't get the bandwagon easily offended PC redditors butthurt."
Storage Hunters,No.
Storage Hunters,Have you seen Charlie Brookers documentary screen wipe? It has an episode on reality shows and literally everything is manufactured in them. Even the good ones. 
Storage Hunters,"Good points. I think you hit the nail on the head with FX. The success of Always Sunny, The League, and Louie all work as great examples. Do you remember how much they shopped around the space after Always Sunny? The main one I remember was Testies. Proof that their model could survive failure."
Storage Hunters,"TLC, The Learning Channel, enough said... What can you learn from Dance moms, and Toddlers and Tiaras?"
Storage Hunters,"Agreed ghost song, but you have to realize that a real psychological disorder has arose because of this cheap manufactured emotion, where people earnestly believe that they are apart of a ""reality"" TV program in their lives.Truman show delusion:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/04/truman-show-syndrome-disorder-counterfeit_n_1568159.html"
Storage Hunters,"It can be, that's why I posted it on reddit, to hear your comment."
Storage Hunters,"Keep writing, please.  I understand that reality can be stranger than fiction, but on the same token, reality tv is an oxymoron. I have an Idea you could have for a movie.  Make about people who work on a reality tv show behind the scenes, the camera guy, the security guy, producers, editors, grips whatever, make it a romantic comedy, throw in Seth Rogan, and some of his lackeys, splice in some reality tv elements, go nuts.  I don't write screenplays, but I'm sure whatever goes on, on the set of any TV show is pretty funny. Best of luck to you Sir."
Storage Hunters,Thanks gee golly I do hope I get a good grade.
Storage Hunters,"There's still a market for quality programming. LCD gets a lot of views, but the goal is to have everyone buying your product. With more specialized shows they better know their demographic thus can better shop the advertising space. 

Other goals of more specialized shows is DVD sales and other merchandising opportunities. 

Clearly all speculation."
Storage Hunters,"Exactly. These studios are in the business to make money and when people watch, in disturbing numbers, Toddlers and Tiara's there's gotta be some executive chin scratching as they look at something like Castle and say, you know we could save X amount of cash if we replaced this with a show that's just like Toddler and Tiara's but with band moms..."
Storage Hunters,"I've been thinking on it for the past hour, and OP touches on something I never addressed. I point out a lot of ways it's helped scripted comedy and drama, but reality TV has diminished the prevalence of documentary television. History and Discovery channel are super weak these days because of how much attention they focus on the reality TV aspect of things. 

As for toppling the argument, I think we would need to look at actual number on funding for shows.

Edit:Oh god The Learning Channel, RIP"
Storage Hunters,"Which ones did it cover? My favorites are Amazing Race and Survivor and while some of the shots are redone and the editing can be annoying, the gameplay itself usually seems authentic (especially when you read contestants' exit interviews)."
Storage Hunters,"Louie is a prime example, and I imagine that that was dirt cheap too with Louis CK doing like half of the work for the show (star, writer, editor, producer, am I missing anything?).

They built up a damn good reputation, which led them to be able to afford Archer (animated shows aren't cheap) and ultimately Anger Management with Charlie Sheen (which apparently they're milking too by streamlining production so they can shoot two seasons in a year).

The League was an interesting one - I don't like it, but the whole fantasy football shtick attracted a huge (marketable) audience, even after they drifted from the original concept (my roommates loved it, so I was often around when they watched it).

I thought Testies looked pretty funny before it aired - but oh man was that bad."
Storage Hunters,"What the shit. 

I guess it makes sense though, but I don't know if it's a new psychological disorder. It sounds like a variation on all the ones that make you break with reality, but because of the influence of reality TV their brains incorporate that into their delusions. 

However, the first person who I meet who believes they are involved with the Kardashian family because they watch them on TV I will shoot them. For the greater good. "
Storage Hunters,Market saturation is part of it. Also they know the people they have watching ads during Castle wouldn't be watching the ads during T&T. On top of that they can sell ad time during Castle differently as the viewing demo is more well defined and the people watching it are typically more invested than the audience watching T&T.
Storage Hunters,"It didn't so much cover every show, but rather how one is created from scratch, and the editors can create anything they want. 

Here is a clip, but there is much more. 

http://youtu.be/BBwepkVurCI"
Storage Hunters,"Pretty sure he directed a lot of it too, but I could be wrong. You are an insightful dude. Now I just want to study FX. Such an incredible cable network. From what I hear their dramas are good too. Justified, Sons of Anarchy, Terriers. I've never checked them out, but they put out some quality shows. Also FX got the movies is always in my head."
Storage Hunters,Please do...
Storage Hunters,"The editors have a lot of power, for sure. Part of the fun with Survivor for me is trying to figure out why the editors made the choices they did (and trying to spot the ""winner edit"" among the players). But ultimately, the editors can't change who wins competitions, who votes for whom at Tribal Council (or, on Amazing Race, the finishing order at the Pit Stops), and who ultimately wins the game. I think that's why I prefer competition-based reality to candid reality. I'd prefer an unedited version - like Big Brother's live feeds - but the edited shows are still very entertaining.

Now, if I felt that the producers were actively manipulating the game (say, by rigging competitions), that would be a dealbreaker for me. I don't think they do though, at least not for Amazing Race, Top Chef, and Survivor, because some of the people who win are clearly not production favorites. Editing is just another layer of the puzzle; it doesn't affect the results of the game."
Storage Hunters,"You're right, I think director should be in there too, and they got the movies jingle down (usually they play pretty good movies to boot). Their advertising kind of lacks otherwise, but I think that's a trait of nearly all of the cable network shows. I would imagine that they just don't have the budget to advertise across other networks, and rely on buzz/word of mouth."
Storage Hunters,"Actually they can change who wins. 

Again Brooker does a mock reality show where the contestants don't realize it. He then goes on to make them film two endings where a different person wins each time. 

But also by changing public opinion based on the edits. I recommend watching it, unless you like reality TV shows and think they are not staged. "
Storage Hunters,"With how outlandish Always Sunny and Archer are, I think they will always have word of mouth. 

Similarly The League and Louie target specific communities very well. So they'll always have buzz. Seriously thinking about it, comedians love Louis CK and regularly tweet about it. Comedians are some of the most popular people to follow on twitter. 

Shit FX how are you killing it so hard. "
Storage Hunters,"Sorry, but that's just silly. There's real money at stake and the contestants would sue if the producers changed the ending. Just because you can fake it in a production studio doesn't mean they do it for actual shows."
Storage Hunters,">  Sorry, but that's just silly.

Watch the documentary and then get back to me. 

Even found it for you: 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXM5lnikSv0
"
Storage Hunters,"How about you watch a season of reality TV and get back to me?

Seriously, explain to me how they could fake the ending of the Amazing Race. Since you've clearly never seen it, the winning team runs to the finish mat with all of the eliminated teams applauding. They stay on the mat while the second- and third-place teams finish, so everyone knows which team won. Or Survivor, where the winner is decided by the votes of seven to nine jury members. The jurors are allowed to talk openly about why they voted the way they did after the finale, and it's always matched exactly how the vote went down."
Storage Hunters,"> How about you watch a season of reality TV and get back to me?

I have, and I gave up after watching Charlie Brookers Screenwipe series, because Reality TV is total fiction, just requires much less money to churn out."
Storage Hunters,I like how you completely ignored my second paragraph.
Storage Hunters,Because I already answered. More then once. 
Storage Hunters,"No, you didn't. Please explain how the endings of the Amazing Race and Survivor can be faked.

I went and watched the documentary. They filmed an alternate ending? Don't you think the contestants would be more than a little irate about that?"
Storage Hunters,"I'm enjoying it, probably more than dark matter but I don't give a shit about production values or special effects, they are nice to have but they aren't the reason I love sci-fi, I'd rather they go onto a space ship with concrete walls than visit a forest planet every episode, you have to be realistic in what to expect from a startup sci-fi show.

Killjoys is setting up a decent world, some back story for likable main characters. It's not so easy to explain the dark and mysterious past of every character in 5 episodes as a B or C plot with very little time and money to work with, better to be dark and mysterious with a small crew than ""this guy has a drinking problem"" 

If they can pick up the pacing of episodes so more stuff happens and less investigating while standing around talking it would be great, maybe use the extra time for more back story.

My rule with sci-fi is that the first season is probably going to be absolute garbage, here is my list of some great sci-fi shows where the first season was terrible compared to season 2-3 and beyond.  

Farscape, Babylon 5, TNG, Stargate SG-1, The 100.  

Battlestar is the only one I can think of where the first season was just as good as the rest, and their budget was probably higher for just the mini series than Killjoys would get for the entire season.
"
Storage Hunters,"Killjoys is good.. it just isn't great... it is perfectly fine 2nd or 3rd tier content, along the lines of Grimm or Suits.  People are spoiled now with all the amazing stuff we have... the Game of Thrones and Hannibals. Killjoys is fun, and has good action... no reason to shit on it."
Storage Hunters,"I enjoy it as mindless Friday night fare. It's at least fun. Not as ""by the numbers"" as Dark Matter.
Defiance is the best show of the three.

As for the  concrete walls on a spaceship bit... limitations of production. Show is made on the cheap, as most of these are, even up here in Canada, we can't perform miracles :) So a warehouse will sometimes have to be a cargo hold. Just the way it is.

Could be worse, could go all green screen and look like total shit."
Storage Hunters,"I've been complaining for years about there not being any space ship type Sci-fi shows on, syfy finally made one, it's a fun if unremarkable show but I'm still enjoying it. I think it will improve like Defiance has so I'm going to keep watching and hope that it does get better.  

Personally I feel like I need to watch so that syfy knows that there is an audience for space type Sci-fi so as long as its at least average quality I'm going to watch it because if viewers don't watch the space shows syfy will go back to just making cheap present day shows about people with supernatural abilities or stuff like Ascension. "
Storage Hunters,"I've only seen the first two episodes, but I got the same sense that you describe here. The show would really benefit from more sympathetic moments for the characters. 

Stuff like wash playing with dinosaurs, Mal washing his face in a folding sink... Who are they when they aren't trying to get stuff done?

EDIT: It has the potential to be a good show. I'm certainly going to stick around for a while. It's not amazing, but there's nothing actually wrong with it."
Storage Hunters,"I enjoy it, except for D'avin (or however you spell his name). His characterization begins and ends with ""former soldier."" "
Storage Hunters,"Your title describes my viewing experience with The 100 precisely, I have watched all of it :("
Storage Hunters,"> why would you put concrete walls in a spaceship?

Because Realism.

In 1981, Construction Technology Laboratories, a division of the Portland Cement Association, initiated a study of the feasibility of using concrete for structural components of a space station. **The idea of using concrete in space may seem absurd to many scientists and engineers.** Nevertheless, the study shows that concrete is not only suitable but also economical for space station construction. 

http://www.nss.org/settlement/nasa/spaceresvol3/cpmss1.htm

>pretty much every episode so far has been them fast-traveling to some remote planet and shooting most scenes with a desert backdrop with few, if any buildings.

So... just like Firefly?
"
Storage Hunters,"Man, I haven't seen this show yet, but it's not sounding to be too great. I would love a new quality show centered around a spaceship crew. Maybe bring back the Farscape universe!"
Storage Hunters,I think I am done with Killjoys.  Dark Matter I couldn't even finish the first episode.  Strange thing is my 44 year old wife loves Killjoys for some reason and this show is not in her wheel house (Big Brother and Two Broke Girls)
Storage Hunters,"i 100% agree. some people are just expecting too much out of every new show. The reality is most shows arent ""Masterpieces"" like Breaking Bad or Mad Men, but that doesnt mean those shows cant be enjoyable. "
Storage Hunters,Honestly a lot of time I prefer the lower tier stuff. Its much easier for me to shut my mind off and relax with some mindless entertainment
Storage Hunters,"> even up here in Canada, we can't perform miracles :)

WHAT? You just shattered all my illusions of you magical Canadian folk!"
Storage Hunters,"Yeah, Soldier with a big S, complete with PTSD because that seems to be all the rage these days.

I get that he has issues, and the last episode delved into them somewhat, but until I know what it is I don't care why he is being so moody and guarded all the time. And if you are making character like that you need to give him other qualities beside, so he doesn't just end up as a one note.

Which I guess they do with his relationship with his brother, but then again Jimmy Olsen is the best part of the show."
Storage Hunters,"I really dig the 100.  Its not ground breaking, but does surprise me for a low budget sci fi show."
Storage Hunters,"Interesting point, and yeah its a lot like the early episodes of Firefly in that regard, or Stargate SG1 for that matter. (Lots of Canadian trees around the Galaxy for some reason)

Unfortunately it lacks the charm of Firefly, despite Jimmy Olsen's best attempts."
Storage Hunters,"Killjoys is better then Farscape, IMO."
Storage Hunters,"Oh we're still awesome, just not as magical as you would think :)"
Storage Hunters,"Yeah, I haven't seen the most recent ep, but I liked how quickly he learned all of the girls' names at the convent a couple of episodes ago. That was a good example of giving him some character outside of ""guy who kills stuff.""

And yes, Iceman's twin brother is the best part of the show."
Storage Hunters,I heard they pooled together some of their budget with The Flash for their gorilla in a zoo (I haven't seen that). That's why gorilla grodd was pretty decent. 
Storage Hunters,"I honestly had to force myself to watch Firefly after it came out on DVD, because I could not get through it's broadcast run. Fox playing the episodes out of order really screwed up the narrative."
Storage Hunters,Repeatedly failed to get into Farscape.
Storage Hunters,"Daily Show, Food Network Challenge, and Law and Order SVU reruns."
Storage Hunters,I watch most shows in the background while doing other stuff. The only exceptions are the good cable dramas like Boardwalk Empire or Masters of Sex.
Storage Hunters,"Star Trek: TNG, Kitchen Nightmares, and Top Gear, because that seems to be the only thing BBC America airs during the day."
Storage Hunters,"I tend to put on TV shows that I've seen many times as background noise when I'm busy on the computer. Shows like Modern Family, Futurama, New Girl, 30 Rock, Everybody Hates Chris and The Big Bang Theory. "
Storage Hunters,"I always have to pay attention to Star Trek, or at least DS9 and TNG I can put Voyager or TOS on in the background while I'm doing other things."
My Little Baby,"Damn Nick Cannon really gets a whole ass game show where women compete to see who gets to have sex with him.

Also I legit thought this was some sort of mystery game show where a contestant has to figure out which woman is pregnant with Cannon's baby"
My Little Baby,"From the headline, I thought it was a gameshow about Nick Cannon finding out who is already pregnant with his child, which would be vastly more entertaining."
My Little Baby,Like an SNL sketch come to life.
My Little Baby,"> In what's being billed as ""the mother of all game shows,"" Nick Cannon is set to pick from a slate of contestants who want to have his next baby in a new game show hosted by Kevin Hart.

Kevin Hart's career is deadddd"
My Little Baby,"Imagine being a contestant on this show... That this is your concrete history and what you'll be known for until the last person forgets you. Your existence 

A woman competing to have a nutjob's 14th baby for ratings"
My Little Baby,">Cannon also jokes about his selection process when he says, ""Eeny, meeny, miny, [moe].""    

When this is inevitably a hit, and some other network decides to make their own version, I vote for *Eeny Meeny Miny Mom* as the title."
My Little Baby,Not it!
My Little Baby,"He is going to be the father ?

We are truly on the road to greenlight Ow My Balls!."
My Little Baby,This isn’t an early April fools joke?
My Little Baby,"""Jim Wallace, Associated Press [ Clears Throat ] Is this a joke?"""
My Little Baby,"This is disgusting.

And no one should reproduce with that black supremacist."
My Little Baby,"This gotta be a joke, right!?"
My Little Baby,"Who the fuck would green light this and fund it.

>on E!. 

Reality tv has reached its [current] low point."
My Little Baby,Spoiler Alert: it’s everyone!
My Little Baby,Creampie Cannon
My Little Baby,Yeah this feels like it would be a subplot in a dystopian novel or something.
My Little Baby,Not real: https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/nick-cannon-whos-having-my-baby-game-show-kevin-hart-1235545865/amp/
My Little Baby,As if I needed to dislike Nick Cannon even more.
My Little Baby,Your mom had Nick Cannon's baby
My Little Baby,I would love to see the pitch meetings for this show.  Who actually green lighted this and thought it was a good idea?
My Little Baby,That's the sequel show.
My Little Baby,"Easy. All of them, including the crew and audience."
My Little Baby,"""No, really, who is having my baby? I need help."""
My Little Baby,Same
My Little Baby,He's got a bunch of Capital One cards. He should be fine for a while with all that cash back.
My Little Baby,He already has 12 kids...We've been on this road a while and the destination is closer than most people realize.
My Little Baby,I’m convinced it’s a joke
My Little Baby,Sounds like something from the producers of “Milf Island”.
My Little Baby,Comcast ‘we can’t let WBD beat us in the no taste wars’.
My Little Baby,"And 7 of them are a year-old or under.  My god, there has to be some sort of mental illness at play here, right?"
My Little Baby,"Amazingly Zazlav has nothing to do with this, it's all on E!."
My Little Baby,Bronys have really put a “stank” on the MLP brand.
My Little Baby,"Can only speak for myself of course but, I only knew about the show and the “brony” sphere from youtube videos, I didn’t even know what network the show was on and never saw any ads, even though I was still pretty frequently watching cartoon network, nick, disney, and a channel surfer when bored. I was 14F when it came out. 

I will also say that the shows you mentioned, while not my favs, are all very original ideas. My little pony is a show that was based on a thirty yr marketing scheme of toys and such."
My Little Baby,"My daughter loved it. She watched all the episodes, all the movies including the ones where they become “human”… and I always thought it was a solid show. 

My wife came home and found me actually paying attention to the show and I was like, “honestly, it’s far better than most of the other kid’s content out there and this is legit entertaining in its own right”."
My Little Baby,"The Bronys didn’t help, I can show off Adventure Time and Gravity Falls and Steven Universe shit and not feel weird, but if I were to wear anything Pony related I’d be concerned people would confuse me for a Brony.

But I think it was also just too cutthroat. They kicked Lauren Faust out early seemingly because she wanted to to be a show first and a toy commercial second. And then they did those godawful human version of all the ponies going to a high school movies that really screamed “none of this matter, all the rules will change whenever we think we can sell you more toys because of it.”"
My Little Baby,"I'm not saying furries and MLP are linked, but both are loved and hated in much the same way."
My Little Baby,"Jenny Nicholson released a superb deep dive [report](https://youtu.be/4fVOF2PiHnc) on FiM and the subculture impact on YouTube.

You might want to have a look."
My Little Baby,"It is very difficult to assess the ""impact"" of any show without a concerted effort to either interview and collect data from fans (and in your question, non-fans). This usually requires some level of academic research and funding interesting, which MLP:FIM never really got to the level of say, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".

However, we do see some cultural critics pointing to the idea that MLP:FIM, while driven by commercial interest (selling toys) targeted at girls was able to expand to a dual audience (men) through more hard fantasy and even hard sci-fi plot lines.

Contrast this to, say, The Powerpuff Girls which used similar ideas, but still had a primarily male audience, and did not achieve MLP:FIM's dual audience success.

The most obvious outcome of the success of MLP:FIM is DC Super Hero Girls which follows the MLP:FIM archetype, again, attempting for a dual audience.

But overall, MLP:FIM I would say is part of a trend (or maybe started the trend? Reinforced the trend?) of ""girls programming"" that treats its audience more seriously, more maturely and appeals to both boys and girls. Other examples of this are Miraculous (super hero theming) and even Barbie: Life in the Dream House (essentially a parody of Barbie which seems to inform the upcoming Barbie Movie.)

How much of this came from MLP:FIM and how much was just MLP:FIM being part of a trend? Hard to say. But if you look at the timeline, MLP:FIM preceded many of the other examples I cite here.

My Little Baby,Never heard of it.
My Little Baby,The what now?
My Little Baby,"The biggest impact in my opinion was the absolute vilification of men enjoying children's targeted shows. The brony community became more famous than the show.  MLP only achieved popularity with girls aged 4-12...and men. Boys around that age hated the show and it just never achieved popularity with women. 

For the non animation community, it was jarring to see men express fawning interest of a young girls show on the local news. I remember being shocked to see the segment because it mentioned 4chan and at that time 4 chan was still kinda underground.

For the animation community, the brony subset were treated like pariahs because their fandom was out of control. Subset members were never able to completely shirk off the now public pedophilic association. Not to mention as the brony community became more mainstream, explicit MLP context exploded.  Look up 2010s YouTube as bronies were the butt of pedophilia jokes. It was that bad. 

The show's inability to gain dual gender viewership and the ever growing negative connotation of bronies publicly ruined whatever impact it could have had within the animation community.  I forgot to mention that MLP never could secure an overlap with another fandom to help its adult fans. You mentioned steven universe, adventure time,and gravity falls. All of those shows have overlapping fans. All of those shows appeal to multiple genders. The 2010s we're heavy in overlapping fandoms. Remember the Tumblr days of Superwholock? I can't name any shows that I would put in the same category of MLP due to its fan base."
My Little Baby,"Honestly I just don’t get the appeal. I’ve watched a few episodes. It’s mediocre. To me it’s identical to anything else that came out around then with young women as the targeted demographic. It’s a bright goofy show about toys, to get children to ask their parents for toys. I mean that’s okay, that’s what most kid shows are. I just don’t understand why this particular show sucked up so many adult men. It’s strange. And there’s something to it that we just haven’t quite cracked yet. A common assumption is they’re pedophiles, I don’t think that’s quite the case. Others say it appeals to people with autism, there’s evidence to back it up, but that seems more like correlation than causation. Ive also heard people say it’s a joke but I don’t believe people are spending thousands of dollars on conventions and plane tickets as a joke. I feel like there’s something else about it that made it take off so hard. Something that separated it from the Barbie shows or the bratz movies, despite the fact that they’re essentially identical. (From the perspective of a non fan) 

The impact is has made for me personally is that it is an enigma. It’s like if one day adults just started losing their shit for coco melon. It makes no sense to me, but I’m pretty fascinated by the whole situation. I don’t care that people are bronies but I personally don’t want to hang out with them. I like plenty of shows for kids. Adventure time, regular show, spongebob, drake and josh, Jake long, etc. and I know my friends watch them too. However, I’m not going to drake and josh con. I’m not buying over the garden wall jackets for 80 dollars from hot topic. I’m not going to wear a hat like finn’s to school everyday. It’s strange to make a children’s show your entire identity. No it’s not a crime, but it’s weird. I feel like the bronies know it’s weird, that’s part of why they do it. I’m not trying to be a jerk but most people will always see it as weird. Bronies made sure of that. 

Also my niece used to talk about it constantly and she says they ruined the show when they made the main character a unicorn."
My Little Baby,The cartoon was not watchable
My Little Baby,"MLP along with Adventure time essentially laid the groundwork for 2010s animation, MLP was without a doubt the biggest cartoon of its time from 2011-2015, but it did fade in popularity after that but retained a dedicated and active fanbase. 

Also the term cultural impact makes me roll my eyes after the Avatar discussions lately.

  
Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences."
My Little Baby,"I'm a brony so my answered is a bit skewed but.
I think it really paved the way for kids shows enjoyed by adults. Yeah there where some before, but this one was in the unique position of coming out 2010s.
The early 2010s where weird, the internet was growing, internet culture was growing aswellm but also was it getting easier to watchs. The first 3 seasons of mlp you could find the episodes in full uploaded to YouTube, just there. It wasn't hard to find them. Before that you had to look at shady sites where you downloaded the show. Alot of people wouldn't do that."
My Little Baby,"It ruined its own impact by being ruined forever once Lauren Faust left. And G5 is the worst show of all time and is humiliatingly grasping onto relevance by constantly making shitty references to G4, but nobody cares. I don’t see it lasting beyond Netflix’s original order. After that MLP cartoons are *dead*. It’d be remembered so fondly if they hadn’t fucked everything up!"
My Little Baby,"I mean the name itself implies that it's targeted for kids and girls at that. Soo the immediate impression is always going to be, dudes a creep."
My Little Baby,"Nah, few bad apples, but the stank came from insecure men calling bronies pedophiles, homosexual slurs and the like, maybe you don't remember well, but the way the average person treated a brony after say...2012 when bronies weren't everywhere is the kind of bigotry that gets people cancelled like nothing today, it was simply a more toxic time."
My Little Baby,"A show which celebrates friendship, how overcoming differences/conflicts can deepen friendships, and how friendship and social support can help one get through stressful times. I’m definitely ok with my kids watching it."
My Little Baby,Yea.  Had a daughter in the target demographic at the time it was on.  Watched a lot of kids content during that time and it stood out with having a decent story.  Been a long time now so can’t really say what was unique about it and have no desire to rewatch but it was a good show for what it was.
My Little Baby,I was 50+ when my daughter was deeeeep intonthe whole MLP world and thoroughly enjoyed the Equestria Girls movies.
My Little Baby,"So...many...bodypillows...

It was an uncomfortable but still interesting watch."
My Little Baby,"I have to say, this is a very will thought out answer."
My Little Baby,"I heard about it and didn't really understand what a Brony was at the time, but I knew of Adventure Time and similar shows, thought it would fall into that category of cartoon based on reviews people were throwing out at the time. It took me about 2 episodes to realize it was literally just... A show about ponies for kids.

Also when the core audience is a split of children and adults on 4chan... Nothing good is gonna come of that."
My Little Baby,"> Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences.

Unlike other kids shows at the time, MLP’s market was (after a bit of time) and adult demographic that was full of die-hard fans that could 1.) Afford merch, and 2.) Wanted every piece of merch they could get.

Just because something is prevalent in stores doesn’t mean it’s “culturally relevant.” By all means, most people had no interest in show simply because of the culture surrounding it.

I myself stand to think that the show is probably a good one and is probably (maybe?) Adventure Time-esque in quality, but I have literally 0 interest in watching it because of the stigma. I think that at the end of the day, this was the zeitgeist the show had (and even if people were unaware of Brony culture, they likely associated it as an overly cutesy show for little girls) and thus it wasn’t really in a position to gain ground."
My Little Baby,"The show peaked in ratings during season 4, and had the biggest fan events during season 5, so clearly ditching Lauren didn't damage the brand that much"
My Little Baby,"Uh I think 90% of the stank and mistreatment probably came from the fact that the ponies (including young looking ponies) got sexualized by weird people and those perverts took up more and more space in the fandom until they scared off the rest of the normal fans and kids, so it became a self perpetuating problem"
My Little Baby,"I love all the downvotes, indicator that people will resort to negative dismissal instead of just admitting that they were probably the asshole 10 years ago buying into misconceptions or misinformation and generalized a group of people based on nothing but a show they liked and what a few people who also liked that show did."
My Little Baby,a few bad apples spoils the whole batch.
My Little Baby,"This is ultimately why I hate discussions around cultural impact, its nigh impossible to find an objective to the goalposts can constantly be moved.

Look at Avatar (Cameron), people say it has no cultural impact due to reasons such as, no memes, lack of internet activity and discussions regarding it, and lack of popular common merchandise

MLP: FIM comparatively has, millions upon millions of memes, tons of internet activity and discussions even now (albeit massively less than when the show was still airing and in it's peak) and tons of merchandise for all ages from toys to clothes to school supplies. 

A massive youtube scene both official and fan wise, with fanmade song ""Discord"" having 65 million views and tons others reaching to 10M and beyond, fan animations such as Snowdrop having 20 million views or Lullaby for a princess with 51 million views. On the official content ""Welcome to the show"" from the second Equestria Girls movie has 338 MILLION views for its oldest upload, with another upload having 138M views  
and of course tons of other official content reaches into 10s of millions of views even into the later seasons

Surges of conventions with the most prominent reaching double digit attendance a few times for such a specific niche show.

So where is the line of it having no real impact besides popular merch, popular on the internet, popular with fan content and official content, and being the talk of the internet for both good and bad for nearly a decade?"
My Little Baby,Yes it did.
My Little Baby,"As someone who was actually in the Fandom
No, not really
Obviously there was a porn problem, but it was aboalutelt not a majority or even discussed in any of the sites or circles I used, maybe on 4chan it was

Seems more like people just grasped onto it as a reason to demean others

Look how much Pokémon or Animal Crossing porn there is...or actually don't. But it's there, and yet they are considered demented perverts"
My Little Baby,"...is a fundamentally problematic saying when you're talking about individual human beings.

Calling people, Mainly teens and young adults slurs and telling them to off themselves isn't suddenly justified because you heard some of them were drawing porn or that you personally thought they were weird.

You as in general people, not you specifically"
My Little Baby,"“Cultural impact” isn’t always positive. I don’t think that the show was ultimately viewed as anything more than a kinda awkward thing that only the fanbase wanted anything to do with.

I suppose it entered into the cultural Zeitgeist sure, but at the end of the day, it was a relatively niche thing tied to a weird corner of the internet that a lot of people wanted nothing to do with."
My Little Baby,"Adult male MLP fans literally all had autism. This is not me using autism as an insult, I unironically believe if they academically studied it they would struggle to find non-autistic adult male MLP fans.

MLP was an incredibly appealing world for autistic people, because the key theme was friendship and the messages near universally was “if you are nice to people, they will be your friend, and if they aren’t your friend after you are nice to them then something is wrong with them, not you”. This isn’t true, you can be nice and still be an incredibly annoying, or even repulsive person to be around, but autistic people have huge trouble understanding **why** people might not like them, so MLP was perfect escape fantasy in the same way Scott Pilgrim or Fight Club might be for other people.

The stink was because it was a community of almost exclusively autistic men, and pretty much identical to 4chan if 4chan decided being nice was better than being a meanie. Oh yeah and it literally started on 4chan."
My Little Baby,"Maybe, but within the broader ""niche"" of western animation, it still is among the top, search trends while not infallible or even super reliable show MLP with a steep lead over the 2nd biggest of the 2010s, which was adventure time in the U.S. As for Worldwide it is much closer with MLP still in the lead and AT close behind (both of which far beyond the other options.

That extends to today where its avg interest is still higher than these other shows (AT, Steven Universe, Gravity falls, etc) all ended for years now"
My Little Baby,"This is arguably one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read, and is peak redditor (since we are generalizing here) thinking they have anything near the ability to diagnose MILLIONS of people based on a show that they had a shared interest in. You do realize that many many many people liked MLP not because and absolutely not solely because of the theme of friendship right? A lot of people liked it for the same reason adults to this day enjoy Disneys animated films, because they are lighthearted simple escapism in an enjoyable universe with engaging although no overly complex characters and stories.

It is really that simple, but instead of simple acceptance you reach into this insane idea that It attracts exclusively autistic adult audience for these reasons you made up, reasons that aren't even true which is the funniest part.

MLP even at the simplest point of its storytelling (the first season) never once said that as long as you are nice everyone will be your friend and ABSOLUTELY never went with the ""if they are not, it's with them, not you"" that is just made up drivel.  


I liked MLP for the same reason I enjoyed Gravity Falls, or Owl House, or Steven Universe for a time, because I thought it was a well made animated show, and I love the medium of animation."
My Little Baby,Are you autistic?
My Little Baby,"No, fantastic response though."
My Little Baby,"Your posts are all about video games, hypothetical matchups between 40k characters and superheroes, and you haven’t noticed that the Brony fandom is extremely autistic, so I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that either that’s a lie or your mum just never got you tested."
My Little Baby,"You felt the need to check my profile and want to diagnose me with some kind of mental illness? 

Reddit is an extension of my free time,specifically the free time I spend inside and not going out with my friends or family.  I like spending that free time with video games, films, tv shows, books and yeah vs matchups are fun lil comparisons to make between characters. It's silly but fun, in the same way any entertainment is.

Seriously you think you are clever? You are an ableist piece of shit trying to pretend you aren't using autism as an insult while using negative connotations to then accuse me and others of being autistic.

I didn't ""notice"" the brony fandom is extremely autistic because I actually knew a bunch of them, not got my information from cringe compilations like you seem to have. Some definitely seem to be autistic of the ones I meant, or display some other kind of developmental disorder, but the majority I met were just...young adults who seemed perfectly devoid of anything.

Look inward, you're an asshole."
My Little Baby,[deleted]
My Little Baby,"I love Twin Peaks. Even season 2, which is better on rewatch. That middle section is a bit rough, but it all pulls together in the end, and there are no fully bad episodes.

That being said, the Evelyn plot can go to hell. It's completely pointless.

I've always felt that it was the victim of a last minute rewrite, possibly due to Lynch and Frost returning for the final few episodes.

It's structurally weird. James rides off from Twin Peaks on his bike leaving Donna behind, meets Evelyn, gets in over his head (not easy with that head), and Donna saves his ass. So James...rides off on his bike leaving Donna behind again. What exactly was achieved here?

The logical thing would be for James to realize how much he needs Donna, and for them to leave town (and the show) together, getting a mutual happy ending. Buuuut then someone decided that Donna had to stick around so she could be one of the decoy victims in the beauty pageant and also a prop in Ben Horne's arc where it turns out she's his kid. So she needs to stay. So James just leaves, which he was doing anyway. So the subplot might as well have never happened.

Just my theory."

My Little Baby,"I'm rewatching The Mandalorian to get ready for season 3 and I think the answer for this show is easily Boba Fett. All the other character reappearances make sense for the overall plot of the season of Mando tracking down a Jedi to hand Grogu off to... except Boba Fett. He inexplicably pops up out of absolutely *nowhere*, has nothing to do with the plot other than promising to help Din track Grogu down (which Din does via Bill Burr without much help from Boba Fett anyway) and then he leaves.

And then yeah, Book of Boba Fett was weirdly bad. His motivation throughout is unclear and not a whole lot *really* seems to happen. He takes over a town in Tattooine for some reason, I guess relating to him wanting to have some kind of clan? Family? I have no idea. It has nothing to do with Din or Grogu though.

It'd be pretty easy to retcon him out of the episode where Grogu gets kidnapped, simply not make Book of Boba Fett, and then start Mandalorian S3 with the two (incredible) episodes of Book of Boba Fett that are entirely focused on Din and/or Grogu... and don't feature Boba Fett at all."

Throwing away the character growth from Robin and Barney, turning The Mother into a way for Robin to not want kids but still end up with Ted, ignoring the years of storytelling that Ted and Robin just don't work together, etc.  All so they could use the ending they filmed 8 years earlier that no longer fit the story they had told."
My Little Baby,The X-Files: Whatever chunks of vomit Chris Carter strung into a failed attempt at a coherent mythology post-Season 7. *Especially* the Seasons 9-10 mytharc.
My Little Baby,The theater troupe in season 3 of Deadwood. Might have worked if s4 had happened and it had been capitalized on in some way. But as it is it's the one part of the show that feels entirely pointless on rewatch. Brian Cox is quite a talent to waste on that plotline as well.
My Little Baby,"Gilmore Girls - Rory and Dean getting back together when he was married to Lindsey.  Dean was so pathetic by this time, and it was completely unnecessary to the storyline.  Also putting it in the same episode when they finally put Lorelai & Luke together."
My Little Baby,The Tritter story arc on *House*.
My Only Love Song,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
My Only Love Song,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
My Only Love Song,People are so stupid.
My Only Love Song,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
My Only Love Song,Good. What a POS.
My Only Love Song,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
My Only Love Song,What a gross thing to do.
My Only Love Song,Holy fucking loser Batman
My Only Love Song,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
My Only Love Song,Celebrity is quite a stretch
My Only Love Song,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
My Only Love Song,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
My Only Love Song,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
My Only Love Song,I hate everything about this headline.
My Only Love Song,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
My Only Love Song,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
My Only Love Song,Good. Fucking loser
My Only Love Song,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
My Only Love Song,Who and who?
My Only Love Song,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
My Only Love Song,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
My Only Love Song,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
My Only Love Song,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
My Only Love Song,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
My Only Love Song,Never heard of him.
My Only Love Song,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
My Only Love Song,As he should. If not more…
My Only Love Song,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
My Only Love Song,[removed]
My Only Love Song,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
My Only Love Song,Nasty bastard
My Only Love Song,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
My Only Love Song,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
My Only Love Song,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
My Only Love Song,Link?
My Only Love Song,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
My Only Love Song,Lame.
My Only Love Song,Remindme! 2 hours
My Only Love Song,20000 channels here
My Only Love Song,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
My Only Love Song,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
My Only Love Song,*Sigh*
My Only Love Song,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
My Only Love Song,See ya
My Only Love Song,Loozah!
My Only Love Song,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can’t help themselves.
My Only Love Song,Good
My Only Love Song,"Surely that should be ‘celebrity’ Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
My Only Love Song,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
My Only Love Song,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
My Only Love Song,What a douche.
My Only Love Song,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
My Only Love Song,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
My Only Love Song,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
My Only Love Song,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
My Only Love Song,Picture checks out
My Only Love Song,Disgusteng
My Only Love Song,Neck tattoos…
My Only Love Song,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
My Only Love Song,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a “celebrity?”
My Only Love Song,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
My Only Love Song,Both of them are a waste of space
My Only Love Song,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
My Only Love Song,"“I’m terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me”"
My Only Love Song,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
My Only Love Song,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
My Only Love Song,He’s probably a big Andrew Tate fan
My Only Love Song,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn’t already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
My Only Love Song,How do you know it was rented
My Only Love Song,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I’m sure you’ll find your answer
My Only Love Song,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
My Only Love Song,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
My Only Love Song,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
My Only Love Song,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so…"
My Only Love Song,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
My Only Love Song,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
My Only Love Song,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
My Only Love Song,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
My Only Love Song,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
My Only Love Song,Which beckons the question why we’re giving them more publicity
My Only Love Song,He’ll probably be paying that in legal fees.
My Only Love Song,Holy shit that guy is huge
My Only Love Song,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
My Only Love Song,The narcissistic wound in public format
My Only Love Song,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
My Only Love Song,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt’s Creek.

“Eeew, David.”"
My Only Love Song,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
My Only Love Song,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
My Only Love Song,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
My Only Love Song,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
My Only Love Song,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‘social media’ that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‘all in a house’ only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‘a career in being famous’ and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‘just in a house’ and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‘washed up’, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‘famous’.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They’re already ‘scene’ if they’re hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something’s who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That’s the point that it became clear ‘the kids’ make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
My Only Love Song,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
My Only Love Song,"Hilariously, I’m pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren’t becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there’s no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
My Only Love Song,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
My Only Love Song,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
My Only Love Song,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
My Only Love Song,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can’t be more masculine than that!"
My Only Love Song,I can't find it
My Only Love Song,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
My Only Love Song,"But he is also a registered sex offender, and all that entails"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I wish they would go back to more traditional artwork.  The fluidity of the animation in this trailer is just awful.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Why do all the characters look like faces drawn on balloons?
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Imagine it's 2022 and people using SFM and Blender for hobby animating create more fluid animations than a professional studio. 

Or like.. imagine looking at the original GitS and thinking ""this beautiful animation needs to be all CGI."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,how anyone can tolerate this kind of animation is beyond me
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I know people hated on the first season but after five minutes I was used to the artstyle.

I'm just happy to have some more GitS."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,At least the plot is not shit
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I am honestly surprised it got renewed for a second season given how terrible the first season was
Ghost in the Shell Arise,this looks worse than fuckin Reboot did 30 years ago
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Really did not like the animation for season 1.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I was pleasantly surprised by the first season. Found the art style jarring at first, but got used to it eventually. By the end I really felt like I was back in the world of gits sac."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Was the first season of this the one with the self insert character backflipping naked down a hallway for what seemed like 10 minutes?

That was unintentionally hilarious"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Arcane basically ruined animation for me. I just can't get used to anything else because that one was so beautiful.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I mean this animation wouldn't even be acceptable for 2007 PS3 cut scene animations.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,2045 because it's 2045 frames of animation across the entire series.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"What the *hell* did I just watch? Star Wars: Clone Wars managed to be great CG, this is years later and...yegods."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,The original stand alone complex show from early 2000s was masterpiece great show with really good animation
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Why do something when you're just going to half ass it
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"This got a second season!???? Well to be fair, I barely have it a chance because I thought it looked awful."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,How did I not know there was a Season 1? GITS is my favourite anime of all time but not a fan of CGI over animated.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,This looks exceptionally ugly.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Right. The 27 yo original absolutely blows this away.  It shouldn't be that way.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I thought these comments were being hyperbolic just because it wasn’t the same as the original, because fans of shows can be overly critical of new things. And then I watched it. Holy cow it’s awful. Reminds me of the last Berserk remake a little. Claaaang. It’s embarrassing anyone would willingly put their names in the credits for this."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Moe ruined anime.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Its the expression that looks awful. The overall animation looks okay.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"It's not so much the medium or type of animation as the animation quality and budget. They could have done this in 2D and it would have still looked terrible, because the issue is it's not being driven the same way as the movies or SAC"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,It really is kind of strange. Anime once became big in the West for its kinetic and detailed hand drawn animation and now Netflix puts out these cheapo shows that look like shit and it still finds an audience. I guess that's why it's gotta be established brands to find any viewership. I love Oshii and his GitS version but I have zero interest in seeing this.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Profits.  And simply not caring about the integrity of the animation quality or the overall production.  Which is kind of contrary to maximizing profits.  Dang.  You're right.  It makes no sense.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I kinda like this one, it's nice for evening chill"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,This was actually planned for two from the start.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Especially after how easily netflix cancels good shows. Although they could still find a way to make it worse like they did to Altered Carbon
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"if you get past the art style it's great, and I'm pretty sure that's all the original voice cast still....."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"The Stand Alone Complex hand drawn style with light CGI was phenomenal. What an awesome, forward thinking anime to have received in the early-mid aughts"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Also dialogue writing skills, but yes."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Wow that was a resentful review
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I have no completed yet the series, but is not so bad. I dont gonna read the review because Im sure there some spoilers..."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"This will be a collaboration between studios Production I.G and SOLA DIGITAL ARTS, Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) & Shinji Araki (Appleseed) confirmed to be working on this."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"More Stand Alone Complex?  Yes, please."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I really hope that this is essentially a “3rd gig.”
Ghost in the Shell Arise,So this is going to be a sequel to solid state society? I hope they will dub it with the OG cast.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Yoko Kanno to write the ost please!
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Wait, is that Kuvshinov Ilya's artwork I see?"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,They got the original director of stand alone complex to direct blade runner Black lotus and another ghost in the Shell series? Netflix is on a motherfucking roll
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"On the CG quality metric, there's Land of the Lustrous and then there's Berserk 2016.... let's hope it's at least far enough away from the latter."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Will Scarlett Johansson play every character?
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Yes!!! Ghost in the shell is my favorite!
Ghost in the Shell Arise,[deleted]
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"\*SAC\_2045\*  
YESSS  
\*in 2020\*  
FUUUUUUUUUUUU  
"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Please just be in 2D, not that loathsome CGI that Netflix uses for so much of their stuff."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,You guys miss me? 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,So excited for this project. Ghost in the Shell continues to be my favorite everything.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"So, it's going to be set \~15 years after SAC?..."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,God dammit yes. I stopped watching anime years ago but GiTS SAC was always my favorite and just fantastic TV.
Ghost in the Shell Arise," SAC and 2nd Gig were some of the best stuff ever made.  IMHO better than the seminal movie, in part because there was more time for a paced story but in all the world was so much richer. 

""Innocence"" and ""Solid State Society"" were good, well I remember they were ok but not top-notch.

Then ""Ghost in the Shell: New Movie"" came out.  The writing and animation were not up to par, I stopped watching in 15 min.  Now this was not the live action movie (which wasn't great).  They actually only CALLED it ""New Movie"" and nothing else, which was of course superseded by an actually newer movie.

 "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,">New Ghost in the Shell series

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

>Coming to Netflix

ಥʖ̯ಥ"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I hope they capture the tone of the original SAC. The Arise series was pretty good, but it missed the soul of SAC. Hopefully that's what Kamiyama will bring back to the franchise."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Please don't fuck it up. 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,That's a release year? Oh... Gods. I've become old.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Please be decent.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"i'm not gonna lie, i didn't like the reboot/sequel/w.e the fuck that was that happened. it makes me skeptical of this one. "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I've been hurt before. 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,This is good news.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"...coming to Netflix in 2020

&#x200B;

...cancelled by Netflix in 2021"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Hey, while y'all at it, can ya stick SAC and 2nd gig back on the roster? "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,If it is 75% as good as the two seasons of SAC we already had I will be happy. 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I'd honestly rather a radio drama than 3DCGI. Hopefully it looks more like FighterZ and less like Vexhille
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Anyone have a source for the art piece?
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Love the idea, just not sure if Netflix is doing this a justice with their, one-of-a-kind animation"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Assuming this is voiced by Emma Stone or...Hermione or something 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Someone please tell me how to get into Ghost in The Shell? What do I have to watch or read? 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"""Why can't Hollywood come up with any original ideas?""

Also...

""I can't wait for this new show based on something I already enjoyed!"""
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"As a huge GitS fan, this is what I've been waiting for for 12 years."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Adult Swim announces a Blade Runner animated series and Netflix answers back with a new season of Stand Alone Complex. This has certainly been exciting news all around.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Sounds great, can't wait for it to be cancelled 2 seasons in! "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,#HA!     They said sack 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"The original anime is the only one I like. Literally, it is a piece of art that stands apart from the genre."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Dem she lookin fine boi 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Another Stand Alone Complex? Sign me the fuck up! I’m stoked!
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Plz don't suck...
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I am beyond hyped for a new season of stand alone complex, my favoritest show of all time. This is exactly what i wanted when i heard Kamiyama was making 2 seasons of GitS (12 episodes each).

If you aren't familiar with GitS: Stand Alone Complex, I'd highly recommend it, but i also acknowledge that it is not for everybody. Tbh it is confusing as fuckkk. However, the tactical action and gunplay is unmatched in animation and cinema. To summarize the premise: the show follows an investigative police department that is also a unit of (mostly) ex-military cyborgs that is also a team of hackers. There's 8 of them. The exact overarching plot is nearly impossible to fully understand the first time you watch the show, but that's ok because you will be blown away by the awesomeness of the music, action, characters, visuals, etc. The last ~6 episodes of both seasons are packed with nonstop amazingness.

For an easier introduction than SAC that many recommend you start with, watch the 1995 Oshii Ghost in the Shell movie. I think it's 90minutes. This is not connected to Stand Alone Complex but it has the same characters, they're both based on the same manga series. It has one sequel which i would hold off on until later.

Ignore GitS Arise imo, because it's the worst of all the GitS continuities. Not saying it's bad, but it absolutely does not compare with Stand Alone Complex."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Theyre gonna fuck it up
Ghost in the Shell Arise,if it doesn't star scarlet Johansson then i'm not watching /s
Ghost in the Shell Arise,News is barely out and people are already making up ways of how it can go wrong. Geez. Have faith in Kenji. 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"long as they don't turn it into leftwing garbage I""m ok with it. "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"I've been a long time fan of GitS, but there's been so many productions around it at this point that it feels pretty disjointed."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I really hope product placement from our current year again.
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Anything to do with the guys that did stand alone complex Im in 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Christmas 
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"It would be great if they keep the interesting philosophy in it - or better yet expanded on it. That's the original reason I loved GITS, and its what the resent stuff could do better. "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Never really gotten a spinoff, for gits have we? Has it always just either been continuations or reboots?"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Live action or animated?

Edit: **ANIMATED, HELL YEAH!**"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Alas, something to look forward to. "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"When you don't have Netflix, so you'll wait online."
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"New SAC?! 

Not even mad about Dare Devil after this news.

Seriously. I can't really stand anime. A few shows here and there. All old stuff like Cowboy Beboop. But I have rewatched SAC 1 and 2 three times. It's just Amazon. "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Oh, I might have to renew my Netflix for this"
Ghost in the Shell Arise,I could never really get into this anime
Ghost in the Shell Arise,Fuckin A!  I just now finished 2nd Gig
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Ghost in the Shell, innocence and SAC 1 and 2 were cool but it’s been downhill since then. I’ll keep my hopes up but I’m not expecting much. Also if that’s the art style I won’t even watch it lol. "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,right...but will it suck?
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Hell yeah, I just rewatched the first two seasons for like the 5th time 

I'm optimistic if kamiyama is still involved "
Ghost in the Shell Arise,"Wow, has any series constantly got so much reinvention?

Rhetorical question, will there ever be enough GitS?"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,This is a child actor going off the rails done RIGHT.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I'm still amazed this show hasn't been cancelled yet. Not that I want it to be or anything. It just seems like one of those shows that would be cancelled by now.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Can't wait for the next season
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I love that he has that Harry Potter money and he can just do whatever the fuck he wants now.

Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I fucking love Daniel Radcliffe.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I watched the first season and enjoyed it, but from there it seemed to be a different conceit each season, at least looking at the trailers. Is there a link between the first season and the others, or is each it's own stand alone thing? I'm guessing Buscemi doesn't return?"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Without context this scene is something. What is going on in this?
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,yeah she came alright

Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,rumor has it that this coming season will be the last. :(
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Each renewal has been as surprising.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"If only that you have no idea why the first season is about some angels trying to convince a god not to destroy the world on a bet, and then the second season is the same actors in medieval times shoveling shit and not working miracles."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"For real, I fucking love that he does shit like this, Swiss Army Man, Guns Akimbo and the Weird Al Movie was probably the best movie I watched last year."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"It is the anthology comedy. First season is about God, second season is about medieval time, third season is about the Wild West. The fourth season is about the Judgement Day.  I really hope that they can do a Star Trek or Star War parody.  BTW, the first and second season were based on the books written by the creator of the show."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Buscemi is actually in this clip! The one that makes the ""oh"" face and yes he's in all 3 and the upcoming fourth seasons. Each season is based on one of Simon Richs short stories, so different stories every season but recurring themes and character dynamics/relationships. For instance, for two of the actors their characters always end up together. I think the 3rd season was the best so far."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,The second season is my favorite!
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Its an anthology series, same actors each season with different stories and settings, in season three Radcliffe plays a reverend on the Oregon Trail who has feelings for his best friend, a married woman. Here he is drunk on snake oil dealing with his feelings in the best possible way."

Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Don’t fool yourself, the UK had plenty of issues with how they treat children on TV — just look at Jimmy Savile."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Nah, it comes down to your parents. For example Rick Schroeder only went off the rails in his 40s because of a divorce. as a child actor his parents did not live off of his TV salary so he was never the breadwinner or the one paying his parents."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"> Emma would be building an apocalypse bunker

I mean who’s to say she isn’t?"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"In the UK they have wonderful people looking after the children, like Jimmy Saville. I heard he shared a special bond with many children."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"He is an executive producer, so I think he will be in all of it."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,‘Drunk’

Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,What other word would you use?
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I see what you are saying, ""Those are okay because they are corporate shills, but this thing that people like is wrong."" Sound logic."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Nah it's just the only one that works without context.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Bro, the last time it was posted was a year ago. Also I'm just rewatching the show and this is one of my favorite scenes, thats all there is to it."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Uhhh, yes."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Both
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,The snake oil salesman says the next morning it wasn’t effective snake oil. So it was just him being himself. So it wasn’t in reference to the word and more in reference to him letting loose while assuming he was getting ‘drunk’ or ‘drugged up’.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,[deleted]
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Well I mean he is a snake oil salesman, it isn’t really a prop using opinion from him that it isn’t “effective”, like what is the end goal of snake oil? I’m pretty certain it isn’t dressing up as a flamboyant wwe wrestler pelvic thrusting to she be coming (cumming in the version?) around the mountain and so maybe he meant that Zeke suffered bad side effects."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"This 2013 account poster is not botty, he's previously talking about non-binary fetuses and his own personal stuff. Is this the Sadcliffe you're going to die on? ;)

I also might leave /television, it's really nothing but instructions telling you what to consume."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Not sure I follow. From my perspective it not having any impact on him played into the plot with Zeke and Prudence. That his prolonged repressed feelings being let loose was relieving for him and let Pru see his wild side, yet also all at once made him go too far to the point of offending her. And it just being himself, not drunk/drugged, makes him vulnerable the following morning to own it and open up to Pru about his feelings for her."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"See and I think it did have an effect on him. Snake oil wasn’t a legit medicine, they through in some things they new was healthy and a bunch of other shit. The salesman might have believed it would cure an illness but not cause someone to be high as fuck when using it. So it is either a case of bad writing, which caused Zeke to go too far off the deep end or they made him do shit like see satan when in reality it would’ve been better to tone it down a bit but make him cocky and flirty."

Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I think the American ghosts are more sympathetic to Jay and Sam and I think try to help them succeed. There’s more wins. The BBC Ghosts seem to like the owners but are more set in their ways. Plus the BBC version has them set up to fail a lot more. That might be also because the series are much shorter so the character growth is much slower. I think the CBS one has already surpassed the amount of episodes on the BBC and that’s 1.5 seasons vs 4 series.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,The American Ghosts work with the the homeowners and definitely grow
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Hi! I’ve only watched the BBC one and it’s become one of my favorite shows of all time. 

The ghosts never stop being themselves if that’s what you mean, and all of them retain their original character, but as the show progresses, you see a lot of growth in the dynamic between the ghosts and Allison and Mike. There is subtle growth which I feel is more realistic than a 180 of their annoying or bad characteristics. I think the joy of the show is to see the growth in the relationships with each other though, and how they become their own weird little family."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I just finished watching the 4 seasons of the UK version, and have been watching the US version as it airs. 

I think there IS growth for the UK ghosts. There are episodes where they realize they don't want Mike and Allison to leave, where they show compassion for Kitty, where they learn about Mary, where they team up and try to contact Mike while Allison is gone. There are also episodes where they come back to deciding they don't want the place to be a B&B anymore so they fight against it, where they want to celebrate a holiday their way, etc. 

It's definitely not Humans vs Ghosts all the time. I can't believe that's how you still feel after 6 episodes...seems to me like that premise gets buried after 2 or 3 eps.

The UK version is SO much shorter than the US one, but I really like it too. Someone else pointed out that the creators are the actors and they're a troupe, which I think gives it a different feel than the US version."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Love the American version. Have not seen the BBC version yet.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I haven't watched the US version, but, IMO, the UK version seemed to get much better at this. I think the ghosts grow as characters. Sometimes helping the owner and sometimes helping each other. I'm not gonna lie. I welled up a few times in Season 3... maybe 2. I can't remember.  
  
Oh they still go around f*cking things up. Not to be a dick against Allison and Mike, but because they are self-centered."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"If it was nothing but jokes about ""getting sucked off"" and ""going down on us"" that would be sufficient, but yes American Ghosts have arcs for sure."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I love both shows.  The UK ghosts can be pretty grating at times, but it's still very funny.  The US Ghosts aren't as insufferable."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Ghost are doomed to repeat their mistakes eternally.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I haven't watched the UK Ghosts (yet, it's on my list), but the US ghosts are definitely growing and developing. I think the second season of the US version has done a LOT to both give us back stories on the ghosts and give them growth, as well."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I’m caught up with the US version and Just finished season 1 of the UK version. Both are good but I definitely prefer the US version in that there’s a gold nugget of good somewhere in there whereas the UK is a constant shit storm of chaos. Narratively, I think the US version is more polished in their setup and payoff. To each their own."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,We’re definitely gonna get an American Ghost “sucked off” by the end of season 3 IMO.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"British ghosts are 4 seasons in and still floundering doing anything with the house

American ghosts are 2 seasons in and its a functioning B&B trying to get noticed"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Yes, they di. Get to the current season. They all change and grow."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,There is wonderful character development with the gay UK ghost. The gay US ghost is just a stream of cheap in your end ohs.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Hey, hey… it’s a comedy, don’t overthink it. 

But yeah the American ones at least have positive moments, doesn’t always seem to have continuity though."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I think the many fails/mishaps in the BBC version made me stop watching after about 6 or 7 episodes as I needed more wins for the characters. I really sympathize with characters that can't catch a break so I had to stop watching because it was too draining emotionally. That said, I did like what I saw and I'm glad America got a BBC/UK remake right as it rarely happens.

Looking at you Taskmaster..."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,The dynamic absolutely changes after season 1. By season 4 they're essentially one giant family.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I heartily agree. I think that the BBC series is much more nuanced and entertaining. I tried a few episodes of the American one and just found it really flat.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"I've skimmed through the first seven episodes again to see what the ghosts do:

1. >!Julian tries to kill Alison!<
2. >!Ghosts try to drive Alison insane to leave the house!<
3. >!Ghosts try to frame the builders for stealing Alison's ring, ultimately ending in the builders leaving and no fixes being made!<
4. >!Robin messes up with the TV crew lights and the other ghosts make Alison look crazy to the crew (a recurring theme). The house is a hazard because of what the ghosts did in ep.3 so the TV crew leaves, the owners get no money!<
5. >!Ghosts do their very best to mess up the dinner with the neighbors. The only saving grace is Julian mentioning the Fiji account, but it's purely by accident!<
6. >!The captain thwarts the plans to sell the mansion for his own selfish reasons!<
7. >!The ghosts actively oppose the owners when trying to get some money from the ghost hunters. Julian also spends money the owners don't have on an app. All of this happens while Alison tries her best to accommodate the ghosts - watching TV, playing games (Julian), doing crossword puzzles (Robin), teaching Mary how to read, timing the captain.!<"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"We watched the American version first, loved it and then watched the BBC one. It kinda took us out of some of the enjoyment of the American one it was that good. 

The ghosts are definitely pricklier (it’s the best word I can think of) but the BBC version has so much more heart and charm to it. I imagine it’s because the ghosts in the original are not only the creators but have done other comedy projects together so their chemistry is unmatched."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,There was actually huge character development for the gay ghost in the Christmas episode last week.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,They did a us taskmaster and they fd it up somehow even though every other version of taskmaster I have seen was ok.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"The BBC creators are cool with it, in the Dumb Deaths episode one of the actors played a pompous British actor."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,NZ is as good if not sometimes better than UK
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Headlines are making it a much bigger deal than it actually is. 

TLDR is Jackson wanted to see scripts first before committing, Amazon then got dicey about getting Jackson involved due to his LOTR movies being owned by Warner Bros and wanted to be extra careful about rights complications. PJ has no ill will to Amazon or the show runners and is excited to watch a Tolkien product as someone completely absent from the production.  

A tldr of a tldr; it was just legal bullshit."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Very smart to want to see the script first before committing. You don’t want to have your name attached to something that might stink up the franchise.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I love entertainment news in the 2010’s to today because the internet boom in the 90’s/2000’s led to them figuring out clickbait headlines are what drive clicks and views and now we will get them forever
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,">  The Oscar-winning director of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies reveals the studio asked him to be involved with its upcoming mega-budgeted The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and promised to send him scripts – then never contacted him again.


> “They asked me if I wanted to be involved – [writer-producer Fran Walsh] and I – and I said, ‘That’s an impossible question to answer without seeing a script,'” Jackson recalls to Scott Feinberg on The Hollywood Reporter‘s Awards Chatter podcast. “So they said, ‘As soon as we get the first couple scripts, we’ll send them to you.’ And the scripts never showed up. That’s the last thing I heard, which is fine. No complaints at all.” 

> In an upcoming The Business podcast talking to The Hollywood Reporter‘s Kim Masters, the filmmaker echoes the anecdote and phrases it slightly differently, yet makes the same point: “About four, five years ago they asked if I would be interested in it,” he says. “So I said, ‘Have you got the scripts yet?’ Because I know how hard the scripts were to write for the films and I didn’t know the people writing their scripts. They said, ‘Oh no, we haven’t got the scripts yet, but as soon as we do, we’ll send you the scripts.’ So I was waiting for the scripts to arrive and they never did.” ...

> Amazon responded to Jackson’s comments with the following statement: “In pursuing the rights for our show, we were obligated to keep the series distinct and separate from the films. We have the utmost respect for Peter Jackson and The Lord of The Rings films and are thrilled that he is looking forward to the watching The Rings of Power.”"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Personally, I am sick of getting invested in a show. Watching it for a season or two and then they say “nope it’s too expensive to keep making it.” And they just cancel it. 

The most disappointing one for me is Netflix and Dark Crystal. My daughter and I loved it and watched it together. I’m sure some of it was due to the pandemic but they axed it for costing too much for production. Pisses me off."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"“\[T\]he \[Tolkien\] estate had no involvement with \[Jackson's\] films and Christopher Tolkien has previously slammed the trilogy in the press as 'eviscerating' his father’s books, claiming they turned his novels into action movies for young people that lack 'beauty and seriousness.' ***But the estate is involved with the series...***”

Huh. If the Tolkien family hated Peter Jackson's movies, then their being involved in the series is the least reassuring thing of all time.

I'm excited for this show. I hope it succeeds. But everything I hear about it (save for a couple of the writers hired) has me worried: Spending $465 million on one season of TV; showrunners with no proven track record of success in screenwriting; involvement of the family; some less than impressive cast pics; no sense of the story from watching the trailer.

Ultimately, none of this matters. It could 100% go the other way. But it smacks of treating a production like product you can cash in on. Demanding, not just assuming, that you have a story worth telling is a key part of the process. I'm doubtful of that. On the other hand, of course, all that can be true and if the writers still bring it, the studio's motives will mean sweet fuck all. So, let's hope!"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Well, regardless of whether the specifics of that title are true or not, it's important to remember that **Peter Jackson is the competition.**

Even if they openly claim otherwise.

If I say the word ""Gandalf"", a picture has probably formed in your mind. And that picture probably features Sir Ian McKellen.

If I say ""Sauron"", you probably think of a giant orange eye-thing with fire around the sides. Or maybe some lanky dude in pointy armor.

The larger a fictional property looms in the minds of audiences, the greater the **mental anchor** that exists for their expectations. Whether that's legitimate or not. And therefore the greater the penalty that exists for making changes, and the less wiggle room one has to follow their own vision. Even if you're ostensibly working on the same property. You're fighting the individual memories of the viewer after they've consumed another piece of media.

The prior work is the competition.

Push things too far and you can trigger a legitimacy crisis. Where the newer property doesn't *feel* like the same setting. Even if the changes are truer to the original work. You deviate too hard from the mental anchor, and you shoot yourself in the foot. And turn those *most* familiar with the work, your super-fans, into super-critics. Those with the most energy to identify what they perceive as illegitimate, and broadcast it outwards towards the normies.

So yes. Whether the new TV series likes it or not, they're competing with Peter Jackson."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Possibly unpopular opinion, but kinda glad Peter Jackson isn’t involved. Do t get me wrong love,Love,love the lord of the rings trilogy. One of the best cinematic adventures ever and an amazing adaptation of the book. 
However, the hobbit worried me. Felt too much like it was trying to get the old LOTR magic back instead of doing its own things. It definitely suffered for it. My other reason I don’t want him involved is aesthetics. Again LoTR is an amazing series and looks great, but now it feels like if fans see any lord of the rings art, games, costumes, etc if it’s not in the “Peter Jackson aesthetic” it somehow isn’t correct. 
So yeah I don’t want him involved so we can hopefully see something that hopefully charts it’s own course more so it can maybe stand next to the LOTR trilogy as it’s own thing to consider instead of under it like the Hobbit came to be. Just my thoughts."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"after the hobbit, maybe it’s just better to let someone else have a go"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,maybe they saw The Hobbits..?
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Tolkien Estate really hates Peter Jackson.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Interesting how ghosting happens at the high end corporate level. I get offended when a recruiter spontaneously stops responding to me.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I mean I would have ghosted him after the hobbit movies.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Is this really a big deal? Jackson didn't create LOTR, it's not his universe and story, he just made an excellent adaptation. Does Nolan need to be consulted on any future Batman movies? Raimi for Spider-Man movies?"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Sounds like what Disney did to Lucas. But Jackson didn’t create LOTR lest we forget
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Yeah, I'm not sure about the show, really, then again I find it hard to get into potentially multi-seasonal shows anyways. I enjoyed the Jackson films despite the differences and complaints people had.  It's just another's take on an established story when all is said and done.  The LotR films were really fun movies, and unless you dislike fantasy in general, I don't get how someone couldn't enjoy them for what they were.  If you want a story that follows the book, word for word, just re-read it.  Stories adapted to film never live up to the fantasy the written word presents to a  readers imagination.

If they were going to make a series out of anything, I'd have preferred the multitude of differing tales from the Silmarillion, personally."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Peter Jackson : *Can I see the script*?

Amazon : *Whats a script?*"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Peter Jackson quoted as telling Amazon, “Just don’t make this Elfishness of yours a Hobbit’"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Did Amazon pull out after they watched the hobbit?
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Maybe he backed out when they told him there would be an editor
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,[deleted]
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,The shows gunna be trash anyway oh well
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,I believe Peter Jackson over Amazon
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"The trailers look awful, the characters look generic, and this is most likely Tolkien in name only and will just be a mish mash of popular current fantasy TV shows while occasionally using Tolkien settings and characters.

This is gonna be the most expensive fan fiction ever produced."
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"Unless Peter was willing to go for a a tv budget pay packet.  I can't imagine they could have afforded him.  But he did joke about directing a Doctor Who episode.  So I could be very wrong.

I imagine the story isn't that simple"
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Prob cause he required 300m
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,Anyone who was responsible for that Brontosaurus stampede scene in King Kong should have their movie making card revoked.
Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture,"> you’re likely going to get a fine and a slap on the wrists

The “fines” in NDAs aren’t the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Breach confidentiality = lose a high paying non-writing EP job with higher episodic fees than most families make in a year on with 2 salaries."

I'll admit for some of the later seasons, the writing isn't as strong and does get insane to the point where it becomes a little silly. But for the most part, the show is so intense and serious that I'm gripped by what's happening without feeling like it's campy.

Jack Bauer isn't some quippy action hero who's always doing the right thing and gets a happy ending, he's a no-nonsense tragic figure who's forced to do terrible things which causes him to suffer more loss than any character on TV. 

And while supporting characters definitely don't get the same treatment as Jack in terms of character building, there are some with pretty engaging storylines. Namely Tony, Chloe, Renee, Bill, etc"

Saint Seiya,"Didn’t even know they were doing something like this. 

It didn’t look too terrible,  even though I strongly disagree with making Shun a girl (I can understand the why but it’s maybe one of the worse character to choose to do so).

Hope there gonna be a japanese dub, otherwise it’s gonna be painful to watch."
Saint Seiya,[I'm going to be really disappointed if this isn't the intro song.](https://youtu.be/lqcULdDQmR0)
Saint Seiya,"I think Shun being a girl is a missed opportunity.

His brother, Ikki, should have been the girl. Shun could stay the way he always was and every time he asked for help he would be asking his SISTER to come to the rescue instead of her BROTHER.

"
Saint Seiya,i feel like ive been assaulted 
Saint Seiya,Didnt this use to be a Anime series from back in the day that played on Fox Kids or CN or something? I know iv seen this before.
Saint Seiya,I'll pass. I'm not big into CGI and the Knights of Sidonea really left a bad taste in my mouth for Netflix created anime. 
Saint Seiya,"Man, Operation Desert Storm was a lot different than I remember."
Saint Seiya,"It's amazing that despite the fact that anime has gone so mainstream, mainstream media companies *still* have no idea how to license or adapt anime properties."

Saint Seiya,If it was really successful in Japan why was the dub considered crappy here? Bad voice work?
Saint Seiya,"The anime looks like a video game cut scene...I wonder if there will be Japanese audio available, and if so, if it'll be any good?"
Saint Seiya,With this trailer I think it's confirmed that Netflix is trying to introduce anime to the general public rather than an already established niche audience

Saint Seiya,Nice well-deserved swipe at the Dragon Prince.
Saint Seiya,"Out of curiosity, why? Big Caballeros del Zodiaco fan, I see some resistance to this change I'd be interested in knowing why you think Shun is a worse character to change genders than say Cygnus?"
Saint Seiya,Nah. Give me Pegasus Fantasy over that crap anyday. Heck I'll take Soldier Dream as well.
Saint Seiya,So much this.
Saint Seiya,"saint seiya is a super successful anime in japan

a dub called knights of the zodiac ran for a season on cartooj netqork and was cancelled for sucking ass"
Saint Seiya,"Yes, it's a classic anime from the 80s."
Saint Seiya,Are you thinking of Ronin Warriors?
Saint Seiya,Anime is mainstream?
Saint Seiya,"Pretty sure Netflix only has the exclusive streaming rights for this. They had no creative control, just like pretty much all their other anime."
Saint Seiya,Doubtful the female knight still wore a mask where Shun didn't
Saint Seiya,"What agenda? And in the same way, whsts wrong with shun being a girl?"
Saint Seiya,"Are we sure?

Female knights have to wear a facemask and Shun doesn't in the trailer. Maybe they gave boobs to the armor because his constellation is Andromeda (a woman)."
Saint Seiya,"Who cares? What's the agenda that they are pushing? It's a fictional character, it's gender could be Apache attack helicopter, it doesn't matter as long as the writing is good."
Saint Seiya,"Saint Seiya is really successful in Japan, Europe and Latin America. Apparently the US dub was extremely bad. "
Saint Seiya,"it's a fighting anime that was HEAVILY censored, even in comparison to shows like DBZ that were currently airing. 

""edits made to this dub included cutting overly violent scenes, adding in previously non-existent digital scene transitions, coloring all instances of blood blue and renaming it ""magical energies,"" rewriting the scripts, renaming several characters, and replacing the opening theme, ending theme, background music, and sound effects.""

It also was kind of hard to market, and they didn't do so well. They sold it as a big epic show and while it does become that, the first season is mostly about grappling fights in a tournament between the main characters. Between that and how cleaned up it was, the young audience turned back to the 100 other animes airing and the older audience laughed at it. "
Saint Seiya,"It seems that you're talking about the first American dub made by DiC which was censored a lot.

It did get an uncut version by ADV which is a lot more faithful to the Japanese script. It still wasn't as successful."
Saint Seiya,"I don't think this is even a Japanese production. The original Saint Seiya was Japanese, but this reboot/reimagining looks super western to me."
Saint Seiya,"Then why don't they create an actual anime instead of a western 3-D animated series? Other than being based on a Japanese property, there's next to nothing aesthetically Japanese about this. "
Saint Seiya,"I think this is a short sighted attitude to take. Shuns gender is not pivotal to the character, whether Andromeda is a man or a woman makes no difference as long as the show is good.

Edit: folks it is your right to down vote, all I respectfully ask is if you do down vote to articulate your reasoning, thanks!"
Saint Seiya,"First, it’s easy in the way it play with the cliché : the guy has a pink armor representing a girl, he look/act like a girl, so let’s make him a girl. I was around 8 years old at the french release of St Seiya and that what I, as many if I remember correctly, though then.

Second, Shun, he’s actually the only of the five bronze Saint that goes away from that ""man must be tough"" male model but still manage to be a strong Saint in the end.

Third, what it’s gonna looks like the numerous time Ikki come to the rescue of Shun. The girl can’t defend herself and need the big strong man?

I’m all for inclusiveness but that have to be done sensibly wich doesn’t seems to have been the case here. The guy that looked like a girl became a girl and now, that girl will be see first as more weak and in need of a man.

Personally, I think Cygnus would have been a great choice, that would have made a strong female saint equal to the other with little change.

Ikki would have worked too and here, with Shun, you actually would have reversed the girl need a man thing and had Shun saved by his big sister. You could also change the two brothers, that would balance a lot a thing (my point 3 would not exist and point 1 would be minor).

Shiryu, with his Shunrei love story, that would have been more complicated but that could work.

Seiya, I wouldn’t have minded but too controversial."
Saint Seiya,At first I was but i do remember this one two because of the armor power up being the gold pegasus armor well Ronin main up grade was white armor
Saint Seiya,"Compared to what it was a decade ago? Yeah. I said ""despite the fact that it has gone *so* mainstream."" That's a relative statement comparing its mainstream appeal now to what it had in the past."
Saint Seiya,Because in the original Shun was written as a bishonen. Some of his interaction with other characters is based on that trope. It won't work as well if he become a she. It's like changing Sasuke into a woman or Sakura into a man (in Naruto).
Saint Seiya,"Normally it wouldn't matter but shun in particular, it's a big fuck up for both sides"
Saint Seiya,It's not that they haven't created actual anime. There is Devilman Crybaby and B The Beginning. 
Saint Seiya,"I disagree.

Now they have a bunch of gungho male saints and, oh what a coincidence, one female saint who is the opposite of the other main protagonists. Shun's gentleness/kindness/etc in spite of his gender might now be seen as being because of her gender.

Unless they completely change Shun's character to avoid that stereotype, but then that's as pivotal of a change as it gets.

And by your own logic, why change his gender if it makes no difference as long as the show is good?"
Saint Seiya,Thanks for your thoughts.
Saint Seiya,"100% Agree Shiryu or Ikki would have been great as female saints.
"
Saint Seiya,"That makes absolutely no sense, shuns character doesn't change at all if you change his gender, Sakura and Sasuke do only because of their sexual orientation. 

And saying it ""was written as a bishonen"" is really fucking stupid, then again, there's no point with arguing with people on the level of ""Netflix's agenda"" lol"
Saint Seiya,"Not really, as long as the show is good. If it isn't, then they have bigger problems on their hands."
Saint Seiya,"They didn't make either of those. B The Beginning is Studio I.G. and Devilman Crybaby is Science Saru. Netflix just writes ""Netflix Original"" if they have the exclusive North American distribution license. It's totally misleading and as false as if Funimation called One Piece their ""original series."""
Saint Seiya,"I mean, nobody objected when they did it to Pidge."
Saint Seiya,"Because it's a new show, and they are trying to update it. As the writer points out these kind of changes can work very well as it did for Battlestar Galactica. Of course it is up to you as the consumer to decide whether to watch it, but it's pretty silly to complain about any fictional characters gender being changed as long as their gender isn't central to the plot. I think we both agree that the only thing that matters is if it is good, it wouldn't matter at all if they changed every saint into a woman if the show is good, right?"
Saint Seiya,"Bishonen is a staple in manga/anime culture. It's actually a very big deal. The yaoi vibe will be gone without Shun being an androgynous man. 

They can change Seiya or Shiryu gender for all I care. Their character tropes aren't gender specific so it doesn't change much. But Shun must be a bishonen.

Btw, in Sakura and Sasuke gender switch, sexual orientation is not a problem. Sakura must be a woman because her core character is a personification of feminism. She's written for teenage girls to look up to. As such she started like the average teenagers drooling over boys and such but grows into a capable and independent woman.

If Sasuke were to switch gender, his whole dynamic with Naruto or his brother will not work at all and the whole story will fall apart."
Saint Seiya,I will never understand people who get super invested in a fictional characters race or gender. 
Saint Seiya,[deleted]
Saint Seiya,"But of all characters, they change shun?! Like I dont think you understand the implications, they took some who defied gender norm (pacifist, emotional, sensitive and wears pink armor) to someone that would become a stereotype. The only way to prevent the character from becoming a stereotype is to rewrite the character and at that point, it's a completely new character. That affects the plot significantly "
Saint Seiya,Because shun was the guy who defied gender norms and changing to a female makes the character a stereotype 
Saint Seiya,"No, not the same at all. Bojack is a show that Netflix has the exclusive rights to in its country of origin. They may even have the authority to sell international rights to third parties outside the US. This stands in stark contrast to anime series that are controlled by a different company in their country of origin, and which Netflix has only licensed for north American distribution. "
Saint Seiya,"I think you are making a lot of assumptions over a show you haven't watched yet. Shun can still defy gender norms as a woman, and you're right it's a new show so the storyline will change. That's fine, if the show is good. Do you agree that's all that matters in the end, that it is good and entertaining?"
Saint Seiya,You can't really say that about a character on a show you haven't seen. 
Saint Seiya,Not really since basically taking away a beloved character is going to rub people the wrong way
Saint Seiya,It's the equivalent of changing the Tom boy character into a man
Saint Seiya,"Oh lord, what is that? The animation looks awful."
Saint Seiya,"Yeeeah, I refuse to watch this in any language that isn't Spanish.

Also, why are the Bronze Saints fighting the military?"
Saint Seiya,"Wow.  Graphically it looks pretty damn bad; those dead, dead eyes everywhere.  And the voice acting is pretty bad sounding, too.

I want to give the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were *trying* to make it look ""retro"" or something, but it looks way too far in the wrong direction.  I know the original is kinda a thing for a lot of people, so I'll probably give it a shot, but wow.  This doesn't even look like it compares with the quality of similar Trollhunters/3Below shows."
Saint Seiya,That CGI animation is actually great here.
Saint Seiya,"I started watching Sons of Anarchy in like 2009. It was back when we got DVDs from netflix because that's how I watched it. I loved it so much that I bought the 3rd season on DVD.

I still haven't finished the show yet. I watched like a season every couple of years. It was the kind of show where I would get super into for a strong but brief period of time and than take a long break."
Saint Seiya,"Yes, of course."
Saint Seiya,I have a backlog that I won't even start until I'm bored and have nothing else to do.
Saint Seiya,I did this with Star Trek DS9 and voyager. I wold just watch one ep a day and it took about a year. Some days I would skip.
Saint Seiya,"Absolutely.  Sometimes I binge shows and sometimes I mix things up watch what sounds the best to me on a given night.  This has two benefits, if the show is really intense I can spread out the episodes and if I never seem to choose to watch a particular show it can clue me in that I'm not ever going to really enjoy watching the show enough to complete it."
Saint Seiya,I started watching Under the Dome when it first came out in 2013. I’m finally now on the third and final season.
Saint Seiya,"Yes, I have had both Parenthood and Friday Night Lights on my back log for years. And dont even get me started on anime."
Saint Seiya,I have tried to watch The Wire at least 3 times now. I just get distracted with other shows and life in general.
Saint Seiya,Took me 6-7 years to finish Legend of Korra and Community.
Saint Seiya,It took me 3 years to watch Seinfield from start to finish.  I wanted to make it last and I didn't have a lot of time for TV back then. Is def one of my favorite shows.
Saint Seiya,It took me two years to finish X-Files.
Saint Seiya,All of ER took me almost 2 years to finish.
Saint Seiya,"I don't binge tv and I really don't prioritize it unless I'm absolutely loving a show so it can easily take me years to finish tv shows or books. It took me about 4 years to finish Mad Men, especially around Seasons 3 and 4 which I found particularly depressing. I really had to be in a particular mood to watch it."
Saint Seiya,It took me a good year to catch up on GOT before S8
Saint Seiya,"I usually only watch a few episodes of a show a week at most. I have about 20 shows going at any given time so some of them end up taking a long time to finish, usually shows with 100+ episodes."
Saint Seiya,"Depends on the show, honestly I own so many on DVD that have been over for YEARS and it's taken me a long while to get through some, even having to restart a good deal. A couple of my favorite examples Forever Knight and Star Trek The Original Series, others include Enterprise, Star Wars The Clone Wars, Avatar the Last Airbender (plus Korra), Columbo, hell even The X-Files."
Saint Seiya,"Because American (and British, to a lesser extent) media being popular worldwide is pretty much a given, media from literally any other country being popular worldwide is not."
Saint Seiya,Johnny Bravo was so loved in India that there was a movie created just for that market
Saint Seiya,"It isn't. American Animation is still very much at the top of the echelon. None other Animation production in any other country has come close to toppling the US from that industry.

Particularly Disney.

Disney Animations aren't just targeted for kids, but they are admired in the Profession since their first animated film, which was partly Rotoscoped, and genuinely amazing too.

It should be noted that Animations have had a dip in Quality. Not just the quality of the animations themselves, but quality in story telling, beat boards, Voice Acting, expressions, and marketing, among many other elements that help an Animation Studio to stand out.

Anime does well, because of quite a few reasons that people may not want to read, which I am about to type.

It's simple. Anime uses a lot of tricks to minimize the work and pump out their stories quickly, with the rare occasion of an Episode or a Scene in a movie that looks outstanding.

Studio Ghibli is one of few Japanese Animation studio's whose films are consistently gorgeous. In comparison, Naruto Shippuden has a lot of badly animated episodes and scenes, with few moments of gorgeous Counts of 1's instead of the typical 3's.

For instance; 

[Pinocchio(1940)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_POK-52yvM) was animated in 1's and 2's. So 1 or 2 unique frames per second, out of 24 frames. So some scenes have 12 unique images per second, or 24 unique images per second.

The closest Anime comparison, is the revolutionary Animation; 

[Akira(1988)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_MONOV1_sc) which is also created with the 1's and 2's method.

Typical Anime would normally run on 3's, with some Action scenes depicting 2's animation. Examples being Naruto, One Piece especially, but they hide it very well, and infamously, Dragon Ball Z.

The same method used by some American studios for Animation series, like He-man and the Masters of the Universe, Transformers, and Justice League Unlimited are this way too using 2's and 3's. Transformers may have also used 4's resulting in some awkward movements.

>So I am curious why America's impact on animation world wide is so overlooked esp on the internet? 

It isn't. America's impact in Animation is long standing as among the top. Unfortunately, many American Cartoons are outsourced to Korean and Indian animation companies. You may notice similar Designs with other Cartoons and Anime."
Saint Seiya,"Did we really need two impossibly long wall of texts that no one is going to read about anime versus western animation in less than half an hour?  Just watch what you wanna watch.  If a McDonalds Double Cheeseburger is your favorite food it's your favorite food, who cares what other people have to say about what *should* be your favorite?"
Saint Seiya,"The main thing is that Japan released cartoons that are aimed at slightly older audiences, which are things that the geeky guys who use the internet a lot are more likely to care about. Yes, American cartoons are HUGE internationally with kids. But Japan makes cartoons that people will talk about online, since they are aimed at older audiences, and that skews results."
Saint Seiya,"Most of the anime mentioned aren't actually main stream though. Sailor Moon is one of the most popular anime up there that you mentioned, but outside its own fanbase and animation fans in general the show never really made a massive splash outside of Japan. Today One Piece and My Hero Academia and Dragon Ball Super are among the most popular anime outside Japan, each of them releasing theatrical movies... theatrical movies with incredibly limited and short stints in theatres."
Saint Seiya,"People are pretty confused about the Japanese anime outside of Japan market.  There are a couple worldwide properties, that are known (but may not even be popular, they just may be know, it its really two, Sailor Moon and DBZ) but otherwise is pretty much dead outside of Japan (and east asia) and super niche audiences in the west.

Western animation is pretty much the go-to animation worldwide that isn't east asia.

Japanese anime has some die-hard non-Japanese fans, but simply isn't on the level of western animation (which really means US/UK).

Its hard to argue with fanboys though, and they'll say <anime program> is the biggest thing ever...

Pokemon though whether we consider this ""anime"" would be the exception to everthing though"
Saint Seiya,[deleted]
Saint Seiya,"Well, for one, most American animation is now actually Korean animation."
Saint Seiya,"Is it really overlooked?

We had both American and Japanese animated TV shows airing near each other in my country."
Saint Seiya,"You do realize that Anime in France, Germany and Italy is hugely popular probably even more so than in the US. France for instance has 3 tv channels dedicated to Anime and Manga ([Game One](https://www.gameone.net/), [J-One](https://www.j-one.com/) and [Mangas](https://www.mangas.fr/)),"
Saint Seiya,"Disney was a major influence on Japanese comic and animation legend Osamu Tezuka, and his style had a lot of Disney influence in it. Over time, other Japanese creators built on his style and evolved differently than American animation did."
Saint Seiya,"The story is that Astro Boy's creator was inspired by Disney animation, and since basically all anime evolved from Astro Boy, everything is kind of inspired by Disney.

Ususually it's used as an excuse for why I shouldn't just *assume* that the blonde haired blue eyed characters with no epicanthic fold on their eyes are white.  They're not actually white, they're just drawn like white people cause a dude like Disney animation once, but we're supposed to read ""Japanese."""
Saint Seiya,"Mickey Mouse. Astro Boys design is partly inspired by Mickey Mouse.

Edit: And Superman(1940)."
Saint Seiya,"Anime is still niche even though its on TV. I know the market for it fairly well. Its one of those things its hard to argue with fanboys about to tell them its not as popular as you think it is. Anime in the west is often very very cheap to buy (especially in europe) and brings in decent ratings (especially late night), so its a bit of a value play, not a play on popularity.

Traditional western animation instead completely dumps on it for ratings, viewership, and ad relevance."
Lovely Complex,[deleted]
Lovely Complex,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Lovely Complex,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Lovely Complex,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Lovely Complex,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Lovely Complex,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Lovely Complex,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Lovely Complex,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Lovely Complex,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Lovely Complex,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Lovely Complex,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Lovely Complex,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Lovely Complex,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Lovely Complex,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Lovely Complex,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Lovely Complex,🙂💕
Lovely Complex,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Lovely Complex,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Lovely Complex,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Lovely Complex,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Lovely Complex,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Lovely Complex,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Lovely Complex,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Lovely Complex,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Lovely Complex,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Lovely Complex,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Lovely Complex,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Lovely Complex,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Lovely Complex,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Lovely Complex,I'd say Schitt's Creek.  For the Roses at least.  Especially Alexis who starts out as the typical Paris Hilton socialite trope and turns into a really grounded self-assured character.  But even Moria goes from melodramatic screams over everything to behaving like an actual person sometimes in later seasons.
Lovely Complex,"Community is my all time favorite show, so I say this with love. Those characters were absolutely flanderized.

Winger lampshades it best: they went in one side as real people and came out the other as mixed up cartoons."
Lovely Complex,The ways in which they failed haliey in the final seasons is so disappointing still
Lovely Complex,"M\*A\*S\*H did it pretty well, especially with Margaret, Charles and Potter."
Lovely Complex,"Did we watch the same show? 

The characters were not pigeon holed into those stereotypes but by the end of the show they were all ridiculous caricatures of themselves."
Lovely Complex,Bojack Horseman did a great job developing characters
Lovely Complex,"I liked that in ""Ugly Betty"", all the characters are revealed as... people who lean into the stereotype for personal reasons. so: they can still be just as broad or crass as in the show's very beginning, but over time, you understand why they think this is the best way to face the challenges. (but it's set in the fashion industry and it deals a lot with first impressions, so it's both fitting and... kinda trite/obivous)"
Lovely Complex,"Moral Orel is the most extreme example of this possible. Well, maybe it's somewhat different but it turns complete caricature/stereotype puppets into some of the most emotionally complex characters ever written."
Lovely Complex,"This is pretty standard stuff though especially for a network tv sitcom.  The characters are drawn pretty broadly at the beginning to get mass appeal, then given time, the writers can add some dimensionality to them."
Lovely Complex,"Community in general went in such a different direction compared to most regular sitcoms. Love that show.

I think another good one would be Malcolm in the Middle. Most of the main characters delevoped pretty well."
Lovely Complex,Death in Paradise. Every new detective they introduce arrives as a walking British cliche to exaggerate the culture shock and then they slowly become tolerable.
Lovely Complex,"Parks and recs was like that

I prefer 30 rock precisely because everyone got more crazy, makes it funnier"
Lovely Complex,Crazy Ex Girlfriend really did this for me. In fact I’d argue peeling back initial stereotypes was one of the shows major driving factors.
Lovely Complex,Venture bros is a good example of this.
Lovely Complex,"A lot of the classics. Taxi, Cheers, and Frasier come to mind as a few of the really good ones."
Lovely Complex,This is the reason I really enjoyed New Girl
Lovely Complex,"I think this is true for Phil, Gloria and Jay - Claire kinda stayed the same with just her relationships changing, and i'd say similar for mitchell as a character (not his relationship with cam tho) - the kids all just grew up but I think they did expand on thier personalities very well, they felt fleshed out EXCEPT for manny, he was majorly flanderized and was just super aggravating. Cam was already nuts and just kinda stayed that way"
Lovely Complex,Parks and Rec did this too imo.
Lovely Complex,"The Good Place. It's the whole point of the show, actually."
Lovely Complex,"The golden girls. Went from dumb old lady, horny old lady, old old lady and Dorothy to some really well rounded 3 dimensional characters who are not really that old."
Lovely Complex,"I think it’s exactly the opposite for Modern Family. They got less interesting and more stereotypical. I ended up hating Mitch and Cam because they became lying mean girls and never changed. Every episode lies, lies, lies. And so catty, unsupportive, and sarcastic towards each other. Just the worst. The kids stayed pretty stupid, nerdy smart, and stupid stupid. Phil is the only one that got better. He started out creepy and ended up the only redeemable character, as he was kind and sweet to everyone and worked on his relationships with his Claire, kids, and FIL. In the last season, the writers must have figured these people must have been nasty enough to finally learn some lessons. So they made Claire a little less rigid, gave the kids more than one note personalities, and Jay more loving but the seasons before was just episode after episode of people who supposedly loved one other being terrible to each other and never learning to be better."
Lovely Complex,"Honesty, Rick and Morty

All the characters start out very one note and grow a lot over the seasons. 

Rick becomes a little more understanding and selfless. Morty learns confidence and to stand up for himself. Jerry and Beth come into their own individually and in their relationship. Summer does whatever she wants and dgaf"
Lovely Complex,"I could be wrong, but it sounds like you’re describing almost any successful show I’ve seen on network tv (or streaming too). They all start with pretty clear stereotypical characters for mass appeal (so anyone can quickly identify with one of the characters), but they are able to add layers and subtlety over time.

Your two examples are good starts. Others off the top of my head that fit that description: Fringe, Scrubs, HIMYM, Dexter, Lost, Breaking Bad, The Office, Parks and Rec, Schitts Creek."
Lovely Complex,I guess sometimes it takes a while for characters to get fleshed out and find their voice. One of the beauties of the 22 episode season is that the writers have more time to develop
Lovely Complex,Is Modern Family worth watching? I'll see it's airing on a channel a few times & I get curious on whether if it's worth watching or not.
Lovely Complex,"I felt the total opposite about Community which was what really started killing my interest in the show in later seasons. Every now and then a character would have an episode with a story that breaks them out of their role, but mostly they devolved into caricatures and callbacks."
Lovely Complex,You mentioned Community but Brita is probably one of the most flandizered character since maybe Flanders….
Lovely Complex,"I’d say Bob’s Burgers is a good example of this.  The characterization jump from the first season, to that Christmas episode they just did, is crazy.  As the show went on and found its voice as a more understated and (usually) wholesome comedy, the characters were allowed to become *less* exaggerated, and consequently more human and relatable."
Lovely Complex,"I'm actually not a fan of this.

It made the stereotypical side of the show stand out more when the show became less of a whacky comedy.

And sometimes the character development just didn't go anywhere."
Lovely Complex,"I feel like Community fleshed their characters more out as it went on. We got to see goofy and emotional sides of Jeff, Britta became funny and wasn't the only voice of reason, Troyer stopped being the average Jack, Abed was always fine"
Lovely Complex,American dad sort of does this. They develop in their own way and stay mostly true to who they are but they are more of themselves if that makes sense.
Lovely Complex,"Honestly a lot of decent shows (especially sitcoms) do this. Doesn't seem that rare? The pilot and first few episodes have a lot of archetypes and then they are able to flesh out characters as they build on storylines and there is more content. Parks and Rec, Community, the office, Brooklyn 99, all the shows people fawn over in this sub."
Lovely Complex,"Not true. Most characters devolved over time. It’s inevitable. The decline is there, but it’s spread out through 11 years. Watch Gloria season one and compare her to later seasons, or Cam who became more camp and played up the stereotypes. 

It was interesting how Cam, played by a straight male, made his character campier each season, while Mitchell, played by a gay male, stayed the same throughout."
Lovely Complex,"I think you're mostly right about Community, but Britta definitely gets Flanderized (Or Britta'd?) She follows a similar trajectory to Lisa Simpson, who goes from being the smart writer-insert who's usually right about things, to a caricature of whiny, self-righteous progressives. Except while it took around ten seasons for Lisa to devolve, Britta Britta'd early in the first season."
Lovely Complex,This feels like almost every show
Lovely Complex,"NYPD Blue - Andy springs to mind. It's hard to say for all characters as there was a lot replacements over the years. 

Andys arc is tremendous though."
Lovely Complex,"Schitts Creek. The office. Parks and Rec. 30 Rock. That 70s show. 

More or less any show that makes it past three seasons does this."
Lovely Complex,"You're the Worst has some really moving and meaningful character progress. 

The first season primarily highlights just how the characters are awful to everyone around them. They continue to be awful to everyone around them all the way through the series, but it explores in meaningful and interesting ways WHY they do this, as well as their successes and failures in terms of how they try and grow as people."
Lovely Complex,All I know is I can't fucking stand Sofia Vergaras voice.
Lovely Complex,"I honestly hated Modern Family. I liked it at first, but how exactly did these characters change? Haley continued to be a ditz, as did Luke, and Alex became horrifically unlikable and stuck up. I found the adults to be OK. 

Schitt's Creek was so much better."
Lovely Complex,"Big Bang Theory.  At the beginning they were just a bunch of nerds who didn’t have a social life except for their clique and Penny was a young actress who moved across the hall.  But as the series progresses, the characters grow, get married, Penny at times outsmarts the guys, ends up with a successful career in sales. For example look at the characters of Howard and Sheldon from the start of the series to the end.  

Young Sheldon does too.  Sheldons siblings are depicted as the ones who aren’t smart and at times come across more likable and with more common sense than Sheldon."
Lovely Complex,Do they? I only tolerated the characters enough to finish the show. Can’t say I *liked* any of them besides Lily
Lovely Complex,"Their character arcs were amazing. Seriously needs to be studied for future tv writers. I loved that show and how it went from basic family chaos to get viewers hooked into the comedy of it, then getting to see each one develop by the time Luke is ready for college and Gloria had her baby and Cam and Mitchell got to adopt. I’m sad it ended really.

How I Met Your Mother  SORT of had that with Barney. You get to see him kind of become redeemable towards the end after being your stereotypical womanizer, and Robin’s growth after being such a stereotypical flighty party girl but the writers screwed that up. Made me so mad 😂 that’s really all I can think of for series that I stuck through to the end 😂"
Lovely Complex,"Hated the show. Bad acting and predictable jokes. And all the ""heart"" felt incredibly forced."
Lovely Complex,~~Most~~ ALL shows are like this. It’s this thing called character development.
Lovely Complex,"The show is absurd and cheesy. It’s not well-written, sorry. 

A mockumentary style that’s never explained and used solely as a cheap way to talk to the camera or give “looks” in situations. Sure.

You have a dumb dad who makes the money, but the housewife is the smart one. Sure.

A Latina trophy wife married to a 70 year old, but she actually loves him. Sure.

Every absurdly dumb character is white. Sure.

A gay couple where one of them wants to be a football coach. Sure.

I watched the first 2 seasons, and then only watched the series finale. Nothing changed. It’s still dumb.

It’s a shallow show written by trust-fund liberals scared of offending anyone."
Lovely Complex,[deleted]
Lovely Complex,The society does this
Lovely Complex,The original Night Court
Lovely Complex,"I thought Daria was a great example of this - the artsy friend is more than a standard artsy person, the airhead fashionista sister becomes more intellectual and independent, etc."
Lovely Complex,See Venture Brothers if you want a great example of Reverse Flanderization.
Lovely Complex,M*A*S*H
Lovely Complex,It’s called “the arc in the series.” 🤓😊
Lovely Complex,I've stopped watching after 6 seasons and I don't know when the characters supposedly became three-dimensional...
Lovely Complex,"It’s a hallmark of proper character development and good writing. Brooklyn Nine-Nine was one of the best examples of this, even hilariously addressing it in the first episode"
Lovely Complex,Reversed Flanderization???
Lovely Complex,M*A*S*H. They all start as kinda stereo types and end up realer people by the end. Especially Margret. Loretta Switt even temporarily left because she did not like the way her character was portrayed and they made a real effort to portray her as a better person.
Lovely Complex,"Red Dwarf did this - most obviously in the  case of Cat, who in series 1/2 has loads of cat mannerisms which over time get moderated. Rimmer stays neurotic but doesn't get any more so, and lister doesn't become any more of a curry/lager fixated slob.

Personally I loved early season Cat and all the mannerisms and things they had, danny john-jules was just awesome in this role with his background as a dancer and how he'd move on set, his little vocalisms and all the bits of writing, like pulling out the mini iron in a hurry to sort out a crease.But can you imagine if they'd flanderised from here:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFItQPBF3E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjFItQPBF3E)

&#x200B;

(edit: note that I haven't really watched past series 6, idk what happens in the later series as I thought 7 and 8 were terrible)"
Lovely Complex,Mad Men
Lovely Complex,"a lot of sitcoms do that, from Frasier to The Jeffersons. I guess it's because these characters need to be introduced to the public as simply as possible and once the hook is firmly in their mouths, they can start evolving them with no fear of losing audience"
Lovely Complex,Brooklyn 99
Lovely Complex,"I found Agents of SHIELD to have great character development. From the pilot, I thought I’d be very cliche—Sky was the edgy outsider tech guru, Ward was the tough/popular/love interest, Fitz and Simmons were the overly nerdy comic relief, May was the weathered badass (that stayed true, May kicks ass), and Coulson was the seldom used wiser one who guides every one. But each character develops so much, a ton of new twists are brought in, and there’s a real emotion to many of them. Even new introduced characters have an immense charm (Mac, Enoch, etc) which made this show a ton of fun for those of us that stuck with it through its run."
Lovely Complex,Bojack Horseman. By the end of the series they really explored the depths of the main characters
Lovely Complex,"The Venture Brothers has a number of characters that seem like a one off gag (ShoreLeave the gay soldier in the GI Joe knockoff, etc) but who end up being semi major characters and seem to get more depth and reverse Flanderization"
Lovely Complex,Reboot is doing something similar.
Lovely Complex,"I'd say this is even more pronounced in reddits' favorite sitcom, Big Bang Theory. 

All characters became more normal (and boring)."
Lovely Complex,"Honestly very few shows don’t have charachter growth. 

One example that didn’t have charachter growth was Glee. And it was a show that was loved at first and then people got sick of it. And a big part of that was because the charachters didn’t exist as people. They just fitted the storyline."
Lovely Complex,Just started this show and almost to the end of season one. I think it’s pretty good so far!!
Lovely Complex,Yeah this show for sure. I hated all the characters at the start but by the end I loved them even with all their foibles
Lovely Complex,This is why I tell people to stick with Schitt’s Creek even if they don’t like the characters at first. They grow and evolve in surprising and poignant ways
My Princess,"So first it was **'The Defenders Saga'** joining Disney+ with the newly implemented TV-MA/rated-R parental controls, then they added all 3 seasons of **'Love, Victor'**, then just yesterday they added **'Deadpool'**, **'Deadpool 2'**, and **'Logan'**, making them the first R-rated movies on Disney+ in the U.S...

And now this.

The 2024 Hulu merger is getting more & more real as the days go by."
My Princess,"i really hope we get a season 4, with or without seth in the show. its been so good this season in particular imo"
My Princess,I was heavily downvoted for saying Hulu's days were numbered but come on now...
My Princess,"In Ireland and the UK, Disney+ and Hulu are merged into one app. You have the Disney stuff, Marvel, star wars etc & there is a separate section called Starz that has the Hulu content."
My Princess,I already subscribe to both Disney+ and Hulu so this announcement doesn't really do anything for me. Good that more people can watch it though. Would have been more excited about a Season 4 announcement. I guess if they are doing this it shows they value the show enough to bother so that might make another season more likely.
My Princess,"That's great but when are they going to add [The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_100_Lives_of_Black_Jack_Savage):

A notoriously greedy and corrupt blond Wall Street businessman hiding from the FBI on a Caribbean island run by a gaudy dictator teams up with the legendary ghost pirate Black Jack Savage to save 100 lives and avoid going to hell."
My Princess,"So instead of announcing season 4, it's a move from Hulu to Disney+

Sounds like the show is dead."
My Princess,"I really love this season of the Orville but that's a weird choice unless Hulu is just dead. Which if it is, fine one less service to pay for. But that means Deadpool and Archer associated with Disney+ directly which I wouldn't have expected."
My Princess,"The hell are you talking about, I’ve been watching it on Disney plus these past three months. It’s right there.

Edit: Oh, US."
My Princess,Breaking news: all three season are already on Hulu
My Princess,Great series
My Princess,Also on my Plex.
My Princess,Please dear god if Hulu drops it have Disney pick this up
My Princess,"Awesome, I love this show"
My Princess,Awesome news! I was watching S3 before my Hulu ran out and Aug 10th is my birthday. Perfect time to watch the rest of the season.
My Princess,"Just so there’s another voice in the pile, *please* make a season 4. This last season has been incredible"
My Princess,"Every episode of this I watch I am always amazed that they're able to put together such a perfect encapsulation of the 90's 2000s syndicated sci-fi show. Every single episode is like a great Stargate, TNG, Sliders, or whatever other great show from that era you can think of. Each episode stands alone, but you also have the ""season arc"" in the far background (very similar to Stargate). 

I'm just in perpetual shock that Seth McFarlane could make this"
My Princess,It's already on Disney+ where I am (Nordics). All of it including season 3.
My Princess,Disney doesn’t deserve The Orville🫵🖕
My Princess,It they are putting mature content from Hulu and elsewhere on Disney+ then wtf did they cancel Lizzie McGuire?
My Princess,Cool
My Princess,Disney+ is going to need a major UX update if they are bringing everything over. Already tough to find things outside of the major brands without searching directly for things.
My Princess,this is all chapeks idea and credit where credit is due its the best idea thats come out of the mans head in a while
My Princess,"Love being a non-US TV viewer for once. For us, the merger happened only a few months after Disney+ was created."
My Princess,"They also announced that Marvel Zombies is going to be TV-MA yesterday. 

Hulu is pretty much dead"
My Princess,I always forgot you have Hulu in US. Here all of the stuff you mentioned is already on Disney+ including Orville (and new episodes are added as it airs)
My Princess,"Yeah. Once they started adding anything ""not Disney"", it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to run multiple platforms.

They should move or duplicate all the on-demand content over to Disney+, but keep the Hulu Cable TV system under the Hulu branding with it's selection of on-demand content (like Youtube and DirecTV have). Then close down the dedicated Hulu on-demand options."
My Princess,Still waiting for Legion
My Princess,"I think this might be some good news in that direction. I can't see Disney doing this and then just cancelling it before it actually goes to D+ lol. And the cast did confirm that at a fourth season has not been declined yet and the reason for the wait is more to do with how the streaming metrics work. Paraphrasing a bit, but this was said at their panel at Comic Con from what I saw. So the show is not cancelled but not renewed just yet. We'll probably find out within the next month I figure."
My Princess,"I agree, I've really enjoyed this season"
My Princess,"I don't think Hulu's days are necessary numbered, but I do think once Universal sales their shares in it to Disney. Both Plus and Hulu will be merge into something like Disney Plus Hulu, similar to how Disney Plus Stars exists outside of the US."
My Princess,"Same. First thing I said when the Futurama revival was announced was ""no way Hulu will still be around at that point, this will definitely be a Disney+ title"" and got shit for it lol."
My Princess,"I mean, if Hulu is absorbed by Disney, I'd rather sail the high seas that contribute to that all-consuming Leviathan that formulaicly kills franchises by identifying every marketable aspect and creating 11 different spin-offs to try and capture as many audiences as possible while tossing the what made the original series great in the trash."
My Princess,It ain't much but I gave it an upvote :)
My Princess,Same here in Australia. We’ve had MA +15 content for more than 12 months now.
My Princess,I wish it would happen in the US.
My Princess,"My first time on Hulu was for Orville season 3. Verizon gives me hulu for free so why not?

I hadn't seen an ad outside of the superbowl in like 10 years. I hate ads.

Apparently Congress is messing with people's phones to make them more prone to violence and ""Everything is Trash""


This is good news - even better if there's a season 4"
My Princess,I’m currently watching all 3 seasons of the Orville on Disney plus in Canada and it’s July?
My Princess,Now that is a series that should be rebooted.
My Princess,"Had no idea this existed, so many future X Files people behind the scenes. Glen Morgan and James Wong, Kim Manners and David Nutter, holy smokes total blindspot"
My Princess,"And that two part movie, Earth Star Voyager, while they are at it."
My Princess,How is it I'm only hearing about this now?
My Princess,I was beginning to think I was the only one who remembers that show.
My Princess,Yea I came here to say this. I always forget since we don’t have Hulu here all that stuff we just take for granted requires extra subscriptions south of the border.
My Princess,It’s the same people.
My Princess,"It's about the US. It's on Disney+ everywhere else, except Latin America and the US."
My Princess,"It's produced by 20th Century (Disney) and distributed by Disney. 

So what are you on about?"
My Princess,I imagine they've either changed their minds in regard to that or didn't want to have a kid's show transition into something more mature. Logic's still dumb but I can get why at least.
My Princess,"Just make Hulu a brand on Disney+, FX gets a brand and maybe find another one for things that don't fit those."
My Princess,[deleted]
My Princess,"They also have categories that keep disappearing.

Like 'Disney Through the Decades', that was an especially good one that showed movies/TV by era."
My Princess,"Only reason Hulu yet lives is because Disney can't yet buy them outright. If I've understood things correctly (which to be fair isn't a given), then Disney will have the ability to gain full control of Hulu in January 2024."
My Princess,"The problem is the cast has been released from their contracts. It’s certainly possible for everyone to come back for a 4th season, but that means a long round of new negotiations and a much more expensive show for Disney."
My Princess,"Seth definitely wants off the show at this point though, and you can tell they seriously downplay his role in most episodes. hoping they can just transition Kelly into the captain role and kill off Seth or whatever to keep things moving"
My Princess,"
>I can't see Disney doing this and then just cancelling it before it actually goes to D+ lol.

This happened to Love Victor though. Although it wasn't cancelled. It was previously announced that the third season will be its last. 

I'm for sure holding out hope a fourth season because The Orville has just been great and I want at least three more seasons and a movie."
My Princess,I pay extra for no ads in Hulu so I don't have ads when watching The Orville on that.
My Princess,Note the topic title says US. Which isn't Canada. Canada doesn't have Hulu so the show airs on Disney+ instead.
My Princess,To be fair it would be pretty fucking hilarious if Hulu cancels it and then Disney+ gets it and they just did it for good PR of saving a show even though they did nothing lol
My Princess,Bortus is best Disney Princess.
My Princess,"I mean, they kind of have to move towards more adult content at some point if they want to own the entire universe."
My Princess,I just want FX to be added and I will be set.
My Princess,Star will probably continue to live for things that don't fit.
My Princess,Is it all just stuck together or does 'Star' have it's own categories and that inside of it?
My Princess,[deleted]
My Princess,Yeah I remember that. Sucks to hear that's gone. Was a great category.
My Princess,Plus another likely 3 year wait between seasons
My Princess,Time for Orville: TNG?
My Princess,"he has a lot on his plate atm. from said show, a new one,family guy,cosmos series ."
My Princess,"Give him a promotion and a flagship like the enterprise an write it off, ship Charlie with him too. 

Kelly and the small orville can go and have small adventures on the side.  Edd can have cameos 2 times a season whenever Orville needs backup.


Hope Seth can pump out more shows and use that to keep the Orville on for few more seasons."
My Princess,"Would love to see Kelly as the captain, I always enjoy her episodes the most I find."
My Princess,Thats fine with me. Keeping the writing solid and the characters great and i dgaf who the captain is.
My Princess,Is it worth really paying extra? Does the top tier still have ads or just show previews/trailers?
My Princess,"I can't wait to watch ""Atlanta,"" ""Dave"" and ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" on Disney+."
My Princess,In Canada it doesn’t separate it into Star it’s just all intermingled with Disney content.
My Princess,I think most don't do this sort of thing to prevent subscribers from noticing how repetitive or lacking a lot of their content library might actually be.
My Princess,Shudder is one of the smaller ones that I would kill to have this feature added. It's a horror platform and being able to search by decade would be huge.
My Princess,"For regular Hulu if you get no ads it removes all of the ads in everything except for one show, Grey's Anatomy. I don't recall seeing any previews before shows either like HBO and Amazon have but if they are they are skipable and I'm just forgetting them since I always skip them. For Hulu Live TV however it's different, subscribing to no ads does not remove all the ads, even from non live content on that plan, but I only have regular Hulu so I never see any ads. Whether it's worth it will depend, I consider it so since I hate watching ads."
My Princess,"I never get trailers and I use it pretty frequently. It's worth it to me. I do still see ads on my parents' Paramount and on linear TV during football season. I wouldn't pay for Paramount because of the ads, but it I still use it despite them."
My Princess,I love that I already can 😁
My Princess,It's not. I've used the Canadian version of Disney+ and the implementation of Star is just like everywhere else.
My Princess,That answers it for me - thank you. I got the 99 cent special and I thought I could live with the ads but I find myself hitting up other services and avoid Hulu. The no ad plan is $12.99 so I guess I can just add this to a rotation and turn it off when I get through a series like I do with D+ or paramount+
My Princess,"See P+ no ads and Showtime I think I got on a special for 14.99 ( can't remember) and I've been watching a good portion on showtime as of late and using the ""live"" channels on P+ to throw something random on (all ad free maybe news isn't but I don't put that on). To me the few extra dollars for showtime has been worth every penny.

I'm also kinda weird but I enjoy seeing trailers for shows. HBO used to have some really good intros when they first started their linear broadcast. As a kid I thought that it was cool because it was kinda like a short theater experience without bobs car wash ads lol."
My Princess,"Watch enough Star stuff and it'll at least end up all over your home page so you won't need to continuously dig for it.

Like at this point I don't even see any of the traditional D+ plus stuff without scrolling for it. It's all mature shows or whatever the latest D+ exclusive Marvel/Star Wars show is"

My Princess,"You call it the Disney to HBO pipeline but really it’s just the child actor to adult actor pipeline.

Also known as aging"
My Princess,"Brenda Song is already accomplished.  She was in the Social Network, The League, Station 19, and does a bunch of voice over work."
My Princess,Austin Butler wasn’t necessarily a Disney Channel Star but he did appear in many Disney Channel shows. Now he is the star of Elvis and even hosted SNL two weeks ago.
My Princess,Also: Surprised at how much this is being downvoted...y’all hate Disney that much?
My Princess,"I mean, sure, but where's the fun in calling it that?"
My Princess,And New Girl as Furguson's original owner
My Princess,"Never said she wasn’t accomplished! I really like her work, but she’s of a similar level (i.e. “not A-list”) to a lot of the actors HBO has brought in for recent projects and she has the Disney connection."
My Princess,"I think a lot of y'all are misinterpreting: I don't mean that Song and Butler have ONLY done Disney stuff. Obviously not. But they both really moved around the Disney circuit (Song moreso than Butler...he ALSO appeared in a few Nick properties) and are recognizable from those properties IN ADDITION to their more recent (and more critically acclaimed) work. 

I just picked up on the fact that, more than any other network I can think of, HBO really pulls from a deep bench of Disney/Disney-adjscent peeps. I was merely asking others to engage in a nostalgic thought experiment. 

I don't really think it's a coincidence that there's overlap. I know for Succession, at least, the intent was to cast talented actors who weren't SO famous that it was distracting. Obviously if you're an actor of a certain age there's a good chance that you've been on a Disney show, but I think it's interesting that HBO seems to be a landing spot for a lot of them. It was something I've been thinking about because I saw clips of DiMarco in Radio Rebel circulating online."
My Princess,[removed]
My Princess,"Forreal. I love HBO stuff, but as someone who grew up with Disney/Nick I also LOVE seeing a lot of the crossover. I lost my mind when I realized Cousin Greg was the glow-in-the-dark dude from Sky High. 

I thought I'd picked up on an interesting phenomenon and wanted other people's takes because I legitimately believe that a lot of ex-Disney stats fit into the current HBO landscape, but I guess this is a no-mouse zone. 

I'll go back to commenting on one of the million ""Is this show really that good?????"" posts that crop up in this sub every day instead of trying to generate discussion, I guess."
My Princess,Yeah this sub is only good for finding out about the big news updates. The discussion is quite biased towards one side unfortunately.
My Princess,[deleted]
My Princess,This sounds like a perfect show for my wife and I to watch. Excited to check it out.
My Princess,"So, she gets a bunch of people killed?"
My Princess,She plays a serial killer?
My Princess,"Seen it avertised on one of the Australian watching apps.  Really looked bad, and us Australian tend to make some bad tv.

She was good in Xena though."
The Day Will Come,"To everyone who said they filmed each cast member getting whacked to avoid leaks, you're technically right.
"
The Day Will Come,The Glenn death has got to be up there when it comes to all time most brutal TV deaths.
The Day Will Come,Suck... My... Nuts...
The Day Will Come,Still annoyed with the last season finale but it's *really* hard to hate JDM as Negan
The Day Will Come,"After watching this episode, all I can think of is ""Oh jeez Rick."""
The Day Will Come,They surprised me by doing what was in the comics. Color me shocked and impressed.
The Day Will Come,"Pretty disturbing stuff overall. They definitely went all out and beyond what I expected. It's set up to be a really interesting season, so we will see if they deliver overall. "
The Day Will Come,"See, that scene right there would've been way better as part of the last episode. Would've been much more powerful having just watched someone get wailed on (yes, actually show us who gets it). And getting dragged away still gives you your cliffhanger."
The Day Will Come, Have to say I'm impressed. Didn't think the show would go there
The Day Will Come,I have never been so stressed
The Day Will Come,[removed]
The Day Will Come,"I wasn't aware that they could even show that kind of gore in tv. That was wild. 

Still debating if I'm going to continue to watch until Negan is dead. My money is in Carl to eventually take him out. "
The Day Will Come,"Abraham Lincoln just set the bar for best actor. Never said that about any category for the walking dead but tonight's episode was brilliantly acted by him.

Correction: best actor bar has been set by steven hauschka and chandler catanzaro for pretending to be NFL kickers"
The Day Will Come,"Boy I can't wait for the next 5 or so filler episodes!
"
The Day Will Come,"I got the one thing i wanted, an [Spoiler](#s ""eye hanging from the skull of Glenn""). I must reluctantly say i think the cliffhanger is good for AMC because it had good delivery and they will learn their lesson... hopefully"
The Day Will Come,I'm not sure what led me to the decision to eat spaghetti and meatballs during this episode but it's safe to say I won't be eating it for a long time
The Day Will Come,Well shit. 
The Day Will Come,"As many others have said, the stuff that happened in this episode should've been in the 90-minute finale (which was very stretched out for what plot actually occurred in that episode).

The episode itself was good once they finally revealed what happened. However, they wrote themselves into a corner and had to use some really weak techniques to build back up tension (flashbacks of all the characters, repeating the non-sensical shots of the bats approaching the faces) whereas the finale had done *all* that work and would've paid it off well. I actually laughed around the third time they *almost* showed who died; I get why they have to do it (though, at the same time, *this wouldn't have been an issue if it was part of the finale!*)

The deaths would also have paid off better in the finale (at least for non-binge watchers) as you've spent the season watching the characters. For me, I haven't watched the show since the finale last year, so, it really sucked the air out of the episode. 

I'm sure a fan will almost instantly make an edit of last year's finale with the remainder of the scene from the premiere edited into it so the entire bat-scene plays out at once, and it'll work far better. 

As it is, great acting, JDM is great, but, god this episode was a structural mess for the first 20 minutes as they essentially tried to roll-back the clock to try to recapture how tense the final scene of the finale was. 

Pretty much exemplifies how the Walking Dead can so jarringly bounce back and forth in quality. There is just no consistency in their writing, and the moments that are *actually good* suffer due to all the crap around it. 

Also, watching this, and hearing that it's already renewed for a Season 8, really made my heart sink and go ""is it ever going to end?"". Game of Thrones is a depressing show, but, it's building to something. The Walking Dead will far surpass that show's run length (already has far more episodes) but without much in the way of overarching plot. "
The Day Will Come,"Personally it was...disturbing to the point where I'm not sure I want to watch more. I'm not saying it was bad, just that...I wouldn't rewatch this episode for the same reasons I won't rewatch, say, Requiem for a Dream. "
The Day Will Come,This is too much for me. 
The Day Will Come,"Damn, as somebody who didn't know what was coming that was intense!  The practical effect on Glen's eye were amazing!"
The Day Will Come,"I understand they wanted to shock the audience but the doom and gloom for an hour was too much. And I don't even hate Negan, but the producers for dragging me through the mud. Nothing about that was enjoyable"
The Day Will Come,Still absolutely hilarious they waited 30 minutes to get to the fucking scene. This show frustrates much more than it should. 
The Day Will Come,"The long delay definitely numbs the deaths, maybe mostly just because i haven't watched the show in a year so don't have the characters clearly in my head anymore, where if it had happened at the end of last season it would've had more impact. Now it's just like, well, they got off pretty easy. Also just find it hard to believe that Negan would bother with this. Rick & co. took out, what, like 1/3 of Negan's fighting force without suffering a single casualty before this? I suppose you could say Negan's just Rick on steroids as far as misplaced confidence goes,  but it requires some serious suspension of disbelief to think he wouldn't have just killed them all like any remotely intelligent person, including Rick, would've done. "
The Day Will Come,If this episode ends with another cliffhanger I might rip off my dick and throw it at the tv.
The Day Will Come,http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/its-negan-bat-walking-dead-hits-new-low-244690
The Day Will Come,"Wow, I am angry."
The Day Will Come,Can someone explain why they killed Abraham? I get Glenn cause it sets up the story of Maggie and the unborn child growing up without a father/husband.
The Day Will Come,"Even before this detour into violence porn, the show had become a total trainwreck. The writing and plot is a complete mess. The characters exhibit no ability to form coherent thoughts, learn, or act rationally. Nearly every major plot ""development"" is the result of a character doing something insanely, inconsistently stupid and/or some random act of God (Maggie going into labor at the worst possible time, a wall falling down at the worst possible time, a tornado arriving at the best possible time, a gate being left open because Gabriel was sad, etc... this list could go on forever). It didn't even matter who got killed. None of the characters are developed enough or unique enough beyond their basic superficial qualities and circumstances to even really feel their loss, hence the reliance on graphic violence. "
The Day Will Come,"Brilliant episode and phenomenal acting! 

I loved both characters but I'm glad it went that way, there are only so many times the mains can walk away without a scratch."
The Day Will Come,Is anyone annoyed theyve had this shit filmed for 8 months? they still did a pathetic cop out on the finale
The Day Will Come,I don't care what everyone says. This show is so good and JDM is incredible so far 
The Day Will Come,That was great.  So sad
The Day Will Come,"Simultaneously a great and a terrible episode.

The writers completely shot themselves in the foot. It was a great episode for ENDING a season, as the finale episode. It was a terrible episode because now I finally get that satisfied feeling and therefore have no need to keep watching. I will simply wait until the entire season is on Netflix.

If the episode had been the season finale, I would have definitely wanted to watch the next season premiere and have it drag me into a new story.

Such a shame. "
The Day Will Come,"Should've killed Abe in last seasons finale and Glenn in 7x01. Or the other way around. Doing them both in this episode, while makes for entertaining TV, could have hit twice as hard and bridged the offseason well."
The Day Will Come,"yo, glenn was my favorite character so that was rough. but the way he acted that out was phenomenal. he literally looked like his bodily functions were shutting down, as they should after a blow like that, and he was just doing everything he could to form those words to try to comfort maggie. selfless to the end. brutal and traumatic way to go "
The Day Will Come,I'm mainly curious to see if the ratings took a hit after the shit they pulled last season.
The Day Will Come,I wish that comments that were only critical would get upvoted and lead to discussion.
The Day Will Come,"I got to ask if people hate the show so much, why do they keep coming back? I stopped watching the show around the 3rd season but still keep up with the comic."
The Day Will Come,"""If we take any of this seriously, it’s a slow slog to hell without any of the insight or catharsis that would make the trek worthwhile."" Pretty much sums how I have felt about the show for several seasons now. Oh, well, it was alright while it lasted. Read the review at http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/its-negan-bat-walking-dead-hits-new-low-244690

Long live the Glenn!"
The Day Will Come,"I can't help but think about how much more impactful this all would have been if they would have ended last season showing him beat Abraham to death, but the group still being in peril. The show-runners and cast teasing that it might not be over over the course of the summer off-season. 

Then this episode starts, and we do NOT see it coming. It picks up where it left off (or maybe they use the plot device they used in this premier, not sure if I like it) and then we see the Daryl moment, the Glenn moment, the Rick & Carl moment...it would have BLOWN OUR MINDS. 

We likely would have NOT been thinking that they'd go that far and kill Glenn and show it like that. That would have done Issue 100 of TWD justice IMO. 

What they did is tantamount to splitting up the Red Wedding, showing the betrayal but having the camera be the POV of a character and show the bad guy cut the camera mans throat and blood spurt on the camera then fade to black. Then open the next season premier with what actually happened in the Red Wedding. That would have been AWFUL.  "
The Day Will Come,"Great episode.
I don't know how long the show will last once they start killing off the original cast. They will be hard to replace. 
"
The Day Will Come,[removed]
The Day Will Come,"I made a thread in the twd sub, but my issue is after all the posturing about how they wanted the death to be meaningful and impactful by leaving it on a cliffhanger, it made the deaths ultimately less meaningful.  Honestly, had they ended on Abraham taking the hits and going face first into the ground and it fading to black on Negan brutally bludgeoning him with the thuds and weeping, and opening with him finishing the job it would have been more impactful.  

Then you'd have Darryl starting off by taking a swing at him thus leading to Glenn's death you'd have another shocking episode one without completely ruining the momentum of the finale.  

I just felt like they truly had no idea what they wanted to do so they wound up doing what everyone thought they'd do anyways.  Also Glenn's deaths felt tacked on to either please comic book purists or last minute rewrites due to Spoiling Dead fans guessing Abraham before shooting started, though I obviously could be wrong.

Lastly, it's really funny Chris Hardwick had such a raging hard-on to completely shit on the fans for saying the finale was garbage, and then be proven wrong when the premiere ultimately was a let down for such a stupidly long wait.  I'm sure he's going to be stupidly proud about it and talk about how it's the best hour of television ever, even beating battle of the bastards...but ultimately it could have been so much better if they didn't rely on a stupidly over the top cliffhanger."
The Day Will Come,Are they going to suddenly introduce a new Asian character?
The Day Will Come,"Am I the only one thats finally tired with this show?

This episode was a perfect example of what's wrong with this show. It takes itself so seriously, besides the ridiculous things characters say and the situations they're in (I laughed so hard at Rick grabbing at the hanged zombie and his body coming off). They also pad out the episode with so much fake intensity and 'drama' which is really just overlong conversations and boring exposition. I feel like this show is really lowest common denominator, which is a shame because the comic is so good.

I mean, Better Call Saul is slow paced, but the characters and their intentions are so good that it feels like the slow burn makes sense, here its just padding.

I was gonna give this show another chance after the atrocious cliffhanger last season but this was the final straw."
The Day Will Come,Holy crap.  We had to stop watching at the arm proposition and we are grown ass folks.  She couldn't go back to it... I finished and joined her in bed and she still can't sleep 
The Day Will Come,this show sucks
The Day Will Come,"This article sums up my feelings on the episode pretty succinctly: http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/24/13378876/the-walking-dead-season-7-premiere-recap-review-end-of-quitters-club

If it's just going to spiral down into a torture porn series I think I might just tune out from now on."
The Day Will Come,What the fuck. I wanna know!!!!!!
The Day Will Come,I seriously couldn't watch about 50% of this episode. Too violent for me. I mostly just listened. 
The Day Will Come,"Waiting for Negan to hit Glenn in the head was similar to watching my cat getting ready to surprise-attack another cat. 

"
The Day Will Come,"Back in the late '80's, when James Cameron released Aliens, the movie got good reviews but many found the prolonged intensity of the violence very disturbing. This episode reminded me of that experience. Not sure I'm gonna like the new world order, but it sure as hell sets up a great revenge story.  "
The Day Will Come,This episode just left us with the last three characters from the pilot. Hope this doesn't change later in the season.
The Day Will Come,I'm okay with all this. Cause Negan is now my new favorite character.
The Day Will Come,Yoh. Emotions are running wild!
The Day Will Come,"I got upset when we got the first commercial break and they still didn't show us who got killed. 

Overall it was a good episode. I honestly would've cried if the deaths happened at the end of last season. 

"
The Day Will Come,"I knew Abe was gonna die in this episode, but it still stings just a bit. He was such a nice contrast to the gloom that the rest of the characters exhibited.   He's my favorite character right next to Carl. At least he got one more Abe-ism out before he kicked the bucket. "
The Day Will Come,"The way the deaths played out somewhat justified the bullshit cliffhanger last year.  While that left us blue-balled and seemed to immediately remove all dramatic tension from the ensuing episode, adding the second blow of killing Glenn was an extra surprising and sadistic move, especially since he's easily the more central character, and even comic fans may have let their guard down after Abraham.  All in all, those scenes were structured more or less perfectly in a way that did justice to the comic scene while still surprising even comic readers.  The directing and acting, particularly from Steven Yeun, was on point.  Giving him the line ""Maggie, I'll find you"" could have been corny, but Yeun sold the hell out of it without losing the nightmarish quality of his physical state.

That said... There's also the rest of the episode.  This could have been edited together much better as a whole.  Yeah, there's tension in pacing the flashbacks out over the course of the hour, but it also really cheapens them.  Give us the gut punch in the opening minutes, then drag Rick through the rest of his personal hell culminating in the emotional brutality of the scene with Carl, and let us revisit the loss of Glenn and Abraham at the end of the hour (plus presumably throughout the season).

The episode also fell back into TWD's old pattern of thrilling us with excellent, gut-wrenching scenes of likable characters dying horribly, then suddenly hitting the brakes and basically acting like it's not the kind of show where that happens all the time, giving a sappy, half-hearted ""sad moment of reflection"" which is apparently necessary but absolutely meaningless.  Let the grief and horror speak for itself.  Let the characters' reactions to loss change noticeably from the redundant way in which you've handled grief dozens of times over the past 6 years.  No more sad, sentimental montages, please.  You cannot have it both ways.  You showed us Glenn's eye popping out and his hands twitching during a lingering shot of his head turned into a late November jack-o-lantern.  Your camera captured this in an impressively calculated and sadistic manner.  Don't turn around and pretend you're in it together with the audience in their shock and grief.  This is the basic hypocrisy that has always made the show feel a bit too staged and emotionally dishonest."
The Day Will Come,"HARRY HAS SPOKEN
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65tS5FtlDzU"
The Day Will Come,Haven't watched the show since the season 4 mid finale. I kind of want to catch up but I'm wondering if it's worth it? I already kind of know most of the spoilers that's happened through now. 
The Day Will Come,"I just don't understand why nobody moved their head. I don't care what you say, if you're about to brain me with a bat, I'm going to fight. "
The Day Will Come,"By the first commercial break we are no better informed than we were at the finale, fuck this show and its lazy writing. "
The Day Will Come,"Is it wrong of me to enjoy seeing Glenn get killed? I've been waiting for it for so long and now it happened. Now I have to see Maggie with her boy hair cut make an ugly crying face. Oh well, win some, lose some. 


However I don't dislike the character Negan. I get it, he's fought so hard to make it in this world. He's the same as Rick, but more willing to impose his power. Is he a fucking bastard? Sure, but does he seem to have his shit together? Yeah. 


Again, glad to see Glenn is gone. Abraham, meh, it sucks. I don't feel that way about all the characters, but most I do. "
The Day Will Come,"This really may have been the single least enjoyable episode of television I have ever seen.  Just a long list of cliches and tropes, piled one on top of another.  Emotional manipultion at it's cheapest."
The Day Will Come,"How is talking dead on the air? I get it's cheap as fuck and fills airtime but ffs, why does anyone watch it? Seriously, someone explain to me."
The Day Will Come,I think Negan could go down as one of the best villains not only on television but on screen period. His on screen presence was amazing. He made me feel like I was watching Game of Thrones and anyone could die at anytime. It was actually hard to hate him even though he killed Glenn and Abe. 
The Day Will Come,[deleted]
The Day Will Come,"I'm from the UK, haven't seen the episode yet, why did I click on this thread, RIP sweet Glenn and Abe"
The Day Will Come,"My only complaint is that JDM needs to shave, Negan being clean shaven always seemed a good contrast to Rick and his constantly fluctuating facial hair."
The Day Will Come,"I'll stick to Kirkman's written material. He seems to get his vision across beautifully on his own. His characters develop and change from issue to issue and come across as authentic. How it explores what the people did in their lives prior to the event, and how it has hindered/helped them since.

With the television show it seems they took a knee in the writing department, to lock up easy ratings grabs on a show they weren't sure would catch on. Keeping Shane in the story to produce the Shane, Rick, Lori love triangle instead of sticking with the written story, seems to be the largest indicator to their lazy writing and audience pandering.

The recent episode with them taking Daryl for hostage over Carl goes to show that relationship dynamics in the characters takes a back seat to audience demands.

Rick loves is son, what the fuck does he care about Daryl?
BUT the fans love Daryl."
The Day Will Come,"Jeffrey Dean Morgan may save the show for me.  The only reason that I watched last night was to see who got Lucile'd, but JDM's Negan is just really great.

I was really impressed that they went with the comic death, because I honestly didn't think they had it in them.  It gave me a little bit of hope for the season that the plot armor of the main cast may not be as thick, but as soon as Negan and Co left, I just could not case about Rick and Crew.  "
The Day Will Come,Standard reddit TWD butthurt going on in here
The Day Will Come,"I'll never watch another episode after tonight. The most we can have is hope in life. I am very tired of the constant darkness an negativity in our tv shows now. They use to be our escapism from reality, some positivity - but after Lost and reboot of Battle Star Galactica..  SG1 - Start Trek Next Gen, the original McGyver, Airwolf, Quantum leap, the Pretender (which got dark as well) & original knight rider - sick of the negative of humanity . There use to be real heroes without super powers that made a positive lesson in life NCIS, CSI - FFS Family Ties and even ALF made people better, even if the science was bull dust. Sorry No, no more~
"
The Day Will Come,"The part when he said ""Suck my nuts"" was stupid, they should have just let him say ""Suck my dick."" It just reminds me of the Terminus or w/e when they made Ricky say ""They messed with the wrong people"" instead of ""they messed with the wrong fucking people."" AMC censors are dumb."
The Day Will Come,I'm finding the online viewer unusable.  It plays commercials every 30 seconds and starts the whole show over if you close it.  I might be done with this
The Day Will Come,"Possibly the most brutal and most gut wrenching death scenes in television history. And that's including premium cable stuff like Band Of Brothers. It's not gratuitous violence, it's emotional and it's for a reason, but it's extreme. The role of Negan will impact the rest of Jeffery Dean Morgan's acting career. His next role will not be some friendly Patch Adams Mrs.Doubtfire lovable character, because casting directors will just see Negan. Same thing that happened to Ted Levine after Silence Of The Lambs."
The Day Will Come,Welp after last seasons ending glad we cut the cable cord. The only reason we even had cable the last two years was to watch TWD pretty much. With what I've seen and heard this show is now a total dumpster fire. The only people left watching are reality TV fans.
The Day Will Come,I literally don't remember anything that's happened in this show since the governor died.  Negan is the bad guy the show needs to be great again 
The Day Will Come,So happy to finally be free of TWD...tuned in to see who died and turned it off for the last time. Love the guy for Negan though.
The Day Will Come,"Probably the worst episode I've seen from the walking dead so far. Shitty visual, shitty ""flash back"" things, can barely hear wtf negan is saying while ricks on top of the RV.  This show has went down the shitter guys. Just watching now because I'm too invested to quit. "
The Day Will Come,"Meh...mostly a waste of time. Ok we saw who died and everyone else looking shocked, etc. That's it. This show is awful."
The Day Will Come,All I want to know is how soon does Negan get paid back?
The Day Will Come,[removed]
The Day Will Come,Glenn will be probably be back somehow in a few episodes.
The Day Will Come,that sunday brunch scene was so dumb to see
The Day Will Come,"Wow didn't realize it was that bad. I feel bad for the non comic readers, I've known what would generally happen for years."
The Day Will Come,This show needs to just end already
The Day Will Come,"This episode was borderline impossible to watch, but I believe it was important to viewers and the progression of the show. The gratuitous violence could have been toned down, but we needed to really hate Negan. This show requires suspense, we need to fear for each character in every scene. It was getting a little dull knowing that characters could be surrounded by walkers and they were going to be ok. Two MAIN characters are no longer ok, and certainty of safety is long gone. "
The Day Will Come,"Did Negan not say 'you can sit, cry, watch' etc but warned against interfering otherwise they'd cut Carl's eye out? (Surely this wasn't just a warning to Rick?).

Daryl interferes ... kill Daryl!

I think they wanted to tease it being Daryl. Even at the beginning they were talking about 'right hand man' to make us think it may be Daryl but nah, wasn't buying it"
The Day Will Come,I keep getting Jeffrey Dean Morgan mixed with Javier Bardem because they both portrayed psychotic characters that the audience loves to hate. 
The Day Will Come,"Hey guys, i stopped watching walkind dead mid-season 3 (in the prison). My question is simple : is it worth it to continue? Tbh, there is so many good shows and i can't watch everything..."
The Day Will Come,"I can't stand when people hate a show because the previous season had a cliffhanger that they couldn't handle.  This happened with the Killing too and despite the second season of the killing and the resolution being awesome so many couldn't get passed bitching about season 1.

This episode of Walking Dead was incredible and traumatizing like nothing I have ever seen on TV and I was a shit ton of shows.  It was fantastic."
The Day Will Come,I didn't feel it. The deaths were hollow. I actually laughed during the first.
The Day Will Come,negan is ricks sugar daddy
The Day Will Come,Carl
The Day Will Come,As opposed to what?  It's a show about zombies.  
The Day Will Come,I'm guessing this show is still terrible and revered by Kardashian fans.
The Day Will Come,"That having been said, the summary on the Spoiling Dead was completely accurate about how it actually went down."
The Day Will Come,I actually saw a full length version where he kills Maggie instead of Abraham. Keeping in mind this is was not one of the quick flashes but was in fact an entire scene. I am now pretty convinced they did actually film an execution for each one of the characters in the lineup. Then they may have used pieces of footage from those full length executions to make that hypothetical montage.
Splash and Bubbles,Hope they reveal that ww2 Spielberg show
Splash and Bubbles,I wish Apple would throw some money to make a Dark Tower adaptation.
Splash and Bubbles,What's Mister Quest?
Splash and Bubbles,Oh they're just pitching the shows they already have? I was really thinking they'd be announcing something bigger with the start of that headline.
Splash and Bubbles,"Is liket hem to pick up some dark fantasy.

Maybe Apple can do Malazan correctly"
Splash and Bubbles,"Mythic Quest and Severance are both really great, yeah, but don’t sleep on The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey."
Splash and Bubbles,I'm pissed they haven't marketed the shit out of Severance
Splash and Bubbles,Remember with Comic Con was about comicbook related stuff?
Splash and Bubbles,"I’ve been pleasantly surprised by quite a few AppleTV originals. In terms of show quality, they’ve been up there with HBO, imo."
Splash and Bubbles,"the best things ive seen TV this year?

Severance

the Offer"
Splash and Bubbles,"I just got Apple TV for a year through TMobile. Aside from Ted Lasso, which I've seen, anything else I should check out first? I prefer comedies but I can handle some drama too if it's a future classic kind of thing."
Splash and Bubbles,[deleted]
Splash and Bubbles,[deleted]
Splash and Bubbles,Why do all their shows have one word titles
Splash and Bubbles,I started watching Suspicion because it started playing after the most recent FAM played. I only stopped watching because I had to leave. I was so intrigued.
Splash and Bubbles,"God I hope they get the rights to Raised By Wolves, such a perfectly weird sci-fi for their catalogue"
Splash and Bubbles,No Ted Lasso? That’s the real crime.
Splash and Bubbles,Masters of the Air; same.
Splash and Bubbles,Curious if Cary fukanaga will part of the promotions for it given his recent headlines also they’ll def promote the hell out of Austin butler given his “Elvis” performance acclaim
Splash and Bubbles,"Hopefully they get to it before Amazon does, that sounds exactly like something they'd try to snatch up then half ass"
Splash and Bubbles,The rights are still with Sony for that one right?
Splash and Bubbles,Cutthatcutthatcutthat
Splash and Bubbles,"While it's not listed, I still hope Apple TV+ will release first trailer for 'Wool' or at least a teaser."
Splash and Bubbles,Heck yes. ATV+ has some killer sci-fi but is missing in the fantasy genre. If they did Malazan I’d flip.
Splash and Bubbles,Or maybe some Joe Abercrombie books. The First Law.
Splash and Bubbles,"Not really, it’s included sci-fi and fantasy as long as I can remember"
Splash and Bubbles,"Severance was something else, cant get that show out of my head and I'm alright with that."
Splash and Bubbles,I think Severance is one of the best shows I've watched all year. Slightly slow start but has an amazing final few episodes (finale especially) which will have you shouting at your TV.
Splash and Bubbles,Mythic Quest might be right up your alley. Some good comedy plus a few more drama episodes.
Splash and Bubbles,"Severance is just mindblowing. It's a masterpeiece.

Comedies

* Central Park and Schmigadoon if you like musicals
* The After party - great comedy/murder mystery
* I am enjoying Loot (going on now)
* Acapulco is straight up happy making, a similar energy as Ted Lasso
* Mythic Quest is silly, but fun
* Trying is a very sweet and funny story about a couple trying to adopt a child
* I really liked Dickinson. It's not completely haha funny, but it's a fairly light hearted and surreal drama, and I'd put it closer to comedy than ""Drama""

Movies

* Coda is god damned amazing
* Come From Away, recording of the stage musical

Dramas

You asked more for comedies, so I won't list everything, but I think For All Mankind is worth calling out. There are other dramas I liked, but I won't go on and on"
Splash and Bubbles,"'Invasion' was a complete waste of time. Can't believe that Apple TV gave Simon Kinberg $200 million, which doesn't show on screen at all, and we end up with a terrible boring show. 

As for other Apple TV series, 'Severance' is not just a great Apple TV series, but it is also one of the best new TV series of the year."
Splash and Bubbles,"it's been announced for quite awhile now they've been renewed for seasons 3 and 4. they just wrapped season 3 filming.

edit: idk why i got downvoted, but the person i was replying to said they hoped mythic quest had not been cancelled. i just said season 3 filming wrapped and season 4 is also on the way lol but ok i guess"
Splash and Bubbles,"Defending Jacob, For All Mankind, Amazing Stories, The Morning Show, Mythic Quest, Ted Lasso, Shining Girls, Now and Then, Mosquito Coast, Prehistoric Planet, Little America, The Essex Serpent, The Shrink Next Door, Slow Horses, Truth Be Told, The After Party, The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey."
Splash and Bubbles,"Oh boy, I don't even want to say >!how angry you're going to be at the end of the show!<. But go on, find out for yourself."
Splash and Bubbles,"tbh Suspicion is the only thing they've had that made me feel like I was actively having my time wasted. Foundation I kinda bounced off of (and I read the books young, I'm a prime candidate for it)."
Splash and Bubbles,"I'm not really following the news about this show atm because it was like 6 years when the show was announced.

Don't know who Cary is"
Splash and Bubbles,Amazon already filmed a pilot and passed on it.  And from that sounds of it it was going to be absolutely perfect.
Splash and Bubbles,"Isn't Sony behind For All Mankind?  If they have a good working relationship with Apple, I can see them producing it for them.  As far as I know they don't have plans to launch their own service, it'd be nice to see them get behind Apple and start producing some other IPs."
Splash and Bubbles,What’s Wool?
Splash and Bubbles,I still can't believe this is actually happening.  I'm hyped.
Splash and Bubbles,"I’ve only read the first book but my uncle dropped off books 2-6 for me, literally 2 weeks before he passed away... I really need to continue reading the series in his memory"
Splash and Bubbles,"I need to read this but my library does have it, I will try the used book store after I have worked through some of my backlog"
Splash and Bubbles,"Still kinda amazed that they set up so much for the finale to handle, and the actual episode delivered 110%"
Splash and Bubbles,I'm still having anxiety about that last episode.
Splash and Bubbles,"I binged it after reading for weeks how terrible it was on reddit.  I think maybe because my expectations were in the basement and I knew going in that there wasn't going to be a *full scale* alien invasion shown, I ended up actually enjoying it.   It was kind of like This is Us with an alien invasion mystery backdrop.     
  
Yeah, I have criticisms, I don't understand how, with such a massive budget we didn't get to actually really see any of the big battles but I kinda feel like that's what they were going for.  Not Independence Day or War of the Worlds but more Signs.  An insulated perspective of the invasion through the eyes of the characters living in the world, bits and pieces of information, it never zoomed out to really give us all the details and show us the invasion on a macro level. It's a slow burn and once I got on board with the vibe, I was kinda digging it.  Sure, there is some character writing that could definitely use improvement but by the end of S1 I actually found myself looking forward to a second season."
Splash and Bubbles,You know too much
Splash and Bubbles,Cary fukanga he directed the new bond movie and a few episodes of masters of the air he’s recently been accused of grooming sexual assault and other stuff even on the set of masters of the air
Splash and Bubbles,"Sony, especially their TV studio, has good working relationship with almost every streamer. They make For All Mankind for Apple. They are making The Boys and a few other shows for Amazon. They are also making Goosebumps for Disney+. So it's not much of a stretch for them to work with Apple on this. I just wanted to ask if The Dark Tower is still locked at Sony or no one has the rights now."
Splash and Bubbles,"'Wool' is an upcoming Apple TV+ series based on Hugh Howey's post-apocalyptic novel, the first in a trilogy. 


[Variety](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/tim-robbins-wool-series-apple-1235043924/): **Tim Robbins Joins ‘Wool’ Series Adaptation at Apple** 

> Tim Robbins has signed onto the series adaptation of Hugh Howey’s “Wool” at Apple, Variety has learned.


> Robbins will star alongside previously announced cast member Rebecca Ferguson. “Wool” is a set in a ruined and toxic future where a community exists in a giant silo underground, hundreds of stories deep. There, men and women live in a society full of regulations they believe are meant to protect them."
Splash and Bubbles,What is that series about? I’ve never heard of it.
Splash and Bubbles,Dylan holding both those levers the entire episode with his glasses falling off his face.  So stressful.
Splash and Bubbles,"I think it's OK. I also didn't hate it as much as reddit. My wife liked it. In all fairness, both of us like kind of slow stuff sometimes. Maybe from reading long  book series all of the time? Idk."
Splash and Bubbles,"I didn't know they did The Boys too.  Interesting.  I actually think what they're doing is smart, playing the field and not trying to launch their own platform right now.  I think at least a few of these services are going to end up merging anyway in the future.   Might as well just focus on content."
Splash and Bubbles,"If Im not mistaken they make Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul for AMC, too? And I think Community back in the day for NBC. could be mistaken."
Splash and Bubbles,"Sony doesn't have the same revered catalog (save for classic Columbia and TriStar releases) that their competitors do. Launching a streaming service would be suicide for them because of how much of a money sinker it is. Too much risk, with no guaranteed reward."
Splash and Bubbles,Yup. All those are produced and distributed internationally by Sony.
Splash and Bubbles,"I wonder how many people get it mixed up with Locke and Key, another Netflix show about a young trio (both two boys and a girl) dealing with supernatural mysteries?"
Splash and Bubbles,The intro song is a banger! lol
Splash and Bubbles,"I enjoyed this show so much, hopefully they make another season."
Splash and Bubbles,"Surprised too. Just started watching it. It was on one of the Netflix lists but I can't recall which one. I guess not trending. When I saw it, I did think the title looked pretty boring, though. 

The first episode started a bit cheesy, but during the main characters ""job interview"" scene I got hooked. Surprised it hasn't gotten much attention even online. Haven't heard about it before this week."
Splash and Bubbles,"It's a great show. The cast have some great charisma and chemistry. So while the writing's a bit 'plot armory' at times it's still swashbuckling fun! I'm loving it tbf.

It's like a quirky, more fun descendant of Sapphire and Steel"
Splash and Bubbles,"It is a great show, Joe Cornish, the writer and director has done promotion on UK tv and radio.  He and stars did a AMA on Reddit a while back.  It just never seemed to get taken up but it is a solid show with some really great bits.  I really hope it gets renewed."
Splash and Bubbles,"It was the number one show on Netflix (at least in the UK) the first week, so I guess it reached some people at least."
Splash and Bubbles,Its a strange yeah some shows like Wednesday break out while other fall off
Splash and Bubbles,Tumblr is going crazy over it! Definitely has a dedicated fan base already. I’ve rewatched twice to try to help it’s #s
Splash and Bubbles,"I loved the show. They did a good job of adapting the books, which are even better. They are way more dark/scary than the show. The casting is spot on too- exactly how I imagined the characters when I was reading."
Splash and Bubbles,It's a solid adventure show with very little to complain about.  Maybe that's not good enough these days?
Splash and Bubbles,"I'm an adult male, and I had a lot of fun watching it.

Looking forward to another season."
Splash and Bubbles,Me and my wife really enjoyed this show!
Splash and Bubbles,"I really hope it gets a second season because I really enjoyed the first season. It was an interesting spin on a ghost hunting show that I'd love to see more of. Of course, I'm a Joe Cornish fan too, so there is that too..."
Splash and Bubbles,I loved this show. I wish there were more episodes.
Splash and Bubbles,"Ugh, I LOVED them all! I really hope there’s a season 2!"
Splash and Bubbles,"Its like an actually good CW show. Not a super gripping thriller, but it makes folding laundry take a half hour longer. I would absolutely watch more of it."
Splash and Bubbles,"Do you guys use Netflix differently than me?  It was the splash page whenever I logged in for like two solid weeks. Plus all the “Lockwood and Co is a breath of fresh air in the CW dominated teen adventure show market” posts we got here.

Anyway I gave up four episodes in.  It was just “kids do ghost stuff as well as possible, adults come in, ruin everything, blame kids for everything being ruined, oh also there’s a bunch of mystery boxes I guess” every episode and I got bored."
Splash and Bubbles,"I really liked it.  As a hardcore Ghostbusters fan, I really dug its “alternate take” on the “ghost busting business” premise, and would recommend it to any fellow Ghostbusters fan."
Splash and Bubbles,"I've watched way too much YA stuff. Lockwood and Co did a great job of world building, makes sense compared to some of the others, and is okay for tweens. I really enjoyed it over some of the others."
Splash and Bubbles,"What has surprised me is that it’s nice adaptation of a fantasy book series, but ‘booktube’ has seemingly ignored it. There’s very few reviews on YouTube. Maybe no one was  sent screeners? I would think that is a failure of promotion by Netflix."
Splash and Bubbles,I work at a bookstore and the book sales for it increased
Splash and Bubbles,Personally I really liked it..... was a lot of fun.  I hope it gets renewed.
Splash and Bubbles,"Yoooo no way, I loved reading this series. I had no idea there was a show. Ahoy mate, lift anchor!"
Splash and Bubbles,Great show! Enjoyed it thoroughly!!
Splash and Bubbles,"I watched the trailer and it looked like one more show to toss on the pile of uninspired Netflix YA shows that end up canceled after a season, like The Irregulars. I didn't even realize Joe Cornish was involved, and I like his other work, so I might give it a chance after all. If it's better than it looks, I don't think it's a matter of not marketing it so much as mismarketing."
Splash and Bubbles,"I loved it! I’ve read the books it’s based on and feel it was a really good adaptation. My husband and I binged it the weekend it came out, and I’ve been disappointed that no one’s talking about it."
Splash and Bubbles,"I watched the preview on Netflix and decided not to watch it. The preview made it look like a kids show so I skipped it.

It's got a lot of praise in this sub though, so I'm going to back and try watching it"
Splash and Bubbles,I really enjoyed it!
Splash and Bubbles,loved the books as a kid so i really enjoyed it but it’s not for everyone
Splash and Bubbles,There's too many dang shows to watch. I'm overwhelmed with all the shows on my lists. I'm sure there are great shows I haven't gotten to yet because I just don't have the time.
Splash and Bubbles,I watched the show. It was quite enjoyable
Splash and Bubbles,"I dunno, it was promoted enough through Netflix that I watched it even though I'd never heard of it. I guess it was ok, if you really love YA. It felt like they had one of those big lists of every YA trope ever and just went down checking off boxes. But I *did* watch the whole season, because I liked the worldbuilding and if you only paid attention to the 5 minutes per episode that wasn't ticking off one of the checklist items, those bits were good."
Splash and Bubbles,No one wants to invest in a new Netflix show (especially a teen fantasy show) with the fact that I can bet it will be canceled within the next 6 months.
Splash and Bubbles,"watched the first season. seems decent and its an easy watch, could be a good little program but nothing really stands out too me. comes accross as a sherlock style program with the supernatural but no characters really grip you that much and neither do the story lines. i think it deserves a second season but they need to really push some top tier writing for it to be a quality show."
Splash and Bubbles,"I thought it was good, fun and well done but was simultaneously not interested in it. If I was a kid it would have been my jam, probably."
Splash and Bubbles,"It had engaging premise and world building, incredible start and solid middle but that's all for me. Later parts were a bit too childish and forced. It's always irritating when smart characters devolve into dumb and careless ones just to push narrative. Still rooting for S2 someday because show has a lot of potential and actors were enjoyable to watch."
Splash and Bubbles,I hate loving this show because I know it's going to get canceled 😞
Splash and Bubbles,"watched it with my tweener daughter and it was surprisingly decent, she loved it. Hope they make season 2."
Splash and Bubbles,I started watching it because it was in trending and the RT reviews were good. It was a fun show and I liked how the plot kept moving along instead of drawing out the first mystery. The world building kept unfolding. Would really love a second season but doesn’t seem likely.
Splash and Bubbles,Just one of those shows Netflix puts outs out with little to no marketing. Sucks cuz I really enjoyed it
Splash and Bubbles,"They promote it all the time on Instagram. I saw it on my Netflix homepage a lot as well personally.

Sometimes a show just doesn't have an impact. Giri/Haji is one of Netflix's best shows, and yet, no one talks about it either."
Splash and Bubbles,"Thanks for the post, I didn't know the show exist. Just finished episode 4"
Splash and Bubbles,Because it starts out really great and lands with a thud. The last two or three episodes got so darn stupid.
Twin Peaks,Wait til you get to episode 8 of season 3
Twin Peaks,Make sure to watch Fire Walk With Me. It's a prequel but meant to be watched between season 2 and 3.
Twin Peaks,"It is, believe it or not, the most heartwarmingly wholesome TV show about >!a dead teenage hooker.!<"
Twin Peaks,"I remember years ago I downloaded Fire Walk With Me. The story made no sense but I thought, ""It's David Lynch...so yeah that checks out.""  The movie was super short which I thought was weird so after it was over I looked at the file and realize it said ""Deleted Scenes"" at the end. -\_-"
Twin Peaks,"> We got to the end of the first episode and we had no idea what the hell was going on, but we liked it.

You're [not alone](https://youtu.be/xjDa-_Vq51I)."
Twin Peaks,Would have been even funnier if you watched all of episode 4 and then a 1990 adult Michael Cera shows up.
Twin Peaks,[Twin Peaks // The Danish National Symphony Orchestra (Live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtGL2Tqfdws)
Twin Peaks,"I was in your shoes a year ago.

Dale Cooper is a wonderful, delightful character, and Kyle McLachlan portrays him perfectly. The goofy side characters, the humor, the heartfelt moments alongside the deeply disturbing and horrifying ones are a spectacle to watch.

I think the thing that saddened me the most about it ending is that there won't be anything exactly like it. Sure, I see derived inspirations in Gravity Falls, Silent Hill and Deadly Premonition, but nothing quite like our cast and their small rural town."
Twin Peaks,This reminds me of the time when the fantastic four 2005 movie came out. I downloaded it on torrent and watched the movie and thought it was great only to find out that the one I watched was a much older 1994 movie that was unreleased and never came out in theatres.
Twin Peaks,"The first season of the 1990 twin peaks might be the best season of TV ever. Never been so captivated by a show.
  
I thought S2 was a noticeable decline but it was so weird it was still interesting"
Twin Peaks,"I kind of feel like it makes more sense now, or maybe just I'm older now. The things it does with playing with the medium, seems more understandable now that it's sort of established ""this is what 80s tv was really doing"" and it wasn't just ""why is this show weird?""

My absolute favorite thing about the show, and I can't explain why, is how food is constantly being ordered and never eaten. It's just the right weirdness that expresses... something? in the right way? (I did say I couldn't explain it.)"
Twin Peaks,"The fact that you not only did this, but *posted about it here* makes me really wish you lived next door to me."
Twin Peaks,"Love Twin Peaks. Haven’t watched the new one though. Back in the day, I lived very close to North Bend, WA. The amount of tourism the show generated was incredible."
Twin Peaks,[deleted]
Twin Peaks,"I decided to watch it a few years ago, mentioned something that seemed off when talking to my stepfather (I knew he was a fan at the time it aired) and he casually spoiled the whodoneit. 🤣 I somehow managed to avoid knowing for 25-ish years... whomp whomp."
Twin Peaks,"It is such a wholesome charming show, it has that stranger things like vibe. small town setting, an overarching surreal mystery it's too good, wish we could've had more shows like this"
Twin Peaks,Watching s2e8 is my most special TV memory. I’ll never forget where I was and how I felt. It feels silly to call Twin Peaks my favorite TV show - it truly is *the* piece of content that has affected me the most
Twin Peaks,"I started Twin Peaks earlier this year, but as I got half way into season 2 it disappeared from the streaming service I was using :(

Still haven't found anywhere to stream the show and before you start listing a bunch of alternatives I'm outside of America

Either way I enjoyed it so far. A little scary, but not too bad"
Twin Peaks,"I just recently watched season 1 and half of season 2 for the first time, and was blown away. It's such a good show. But once the main plot line was resolved, it's like a switch went off for me - utterly zero interest in continuing any further. Oh well."
Twin Peaks,"I've done a similar thing. Back when DVDs first came out, I got the goodfellas dvd, and not knowing it had the video on both sides of the disc, I just inserted it without thinking. The movie for me started with Lorraine Bracco banging on Ray Liotta's door, upset about some girl he had been sleeping with or something. And then the movie was only about an hour long, too. I wasn't sure what was up, but I didn't see what the hype was about the movie"
Twin Peaks,"I hate how streaming services offer you up the latest season. We were on prime and decided to try Yellowstone. First episode people are getting shot and killed and shot is going down. What is going on. So confusing, I assume it was throwing us right into the action. 3/4 I paused the show to find out it was season. 4 episode 1"
Twin Peaks,Highly ronemd you skip Janes snd the Milf subplot
Twin Peaks,"When you finish the original 90s show you should watch the Psych episode Dual Spires. It's an homage to Twin Peaks which features the same actors (not Kyle McLachlan). You don't have to have watched all of Psych to understand the episode (you should watch Psych anyway). The episode makes no sense to me because I've never watched Twin Peaks.

I have a story that has a same ""oh I feel stupid now"" vibe, one time I was watching Scary Movie on tv. It goes on and on, and I think ""Wow I remember Scary Movie being way funnier than this. I know stuff can get less funny as you get older but I'm only one year older than I was when I saw it before?"" 

Did not realize until the commercial break that it was *Scream* that was on, not Scary Movie. To my credit I did at least wonder why the lead actress looked so different from how I remembered, but nothing beyond that and it not being as funny struck me at all. In hindsight it's like ""how did I not notice this was Scream"" so I still feel dumb about it."
Twin Peaks,"This is the one that to this day I still don't understand the absolute adoration that so many people, often with very similar taste in television to myself, have for the show. I don't hate it, but I simply don't get why so many love it."
Twin Peaks,😂😂😂😂😂😂
Twin Peaks,"I live in “Twin Peaks” and have never seen it. 

(North Bend, WA)"
Twin Peaks,God we’ve tried to watch the original twice and its just so SO bad now.  Unwatchably cringe bad.  Im sure theres something to it but cant even get through episode 1…
Twin Peaks,"There's a 4.5 hour ""explanation"" video from YouTube channel Twin Perfect.  If you're interested. 

https://youtu.be/7AYnF5hOhuM"
Twin Peaks,I didn't finish watching it due to work but the one thing that stood out to me was that it looked so nice. The cinematography looked so damn good and it still stands all these years later.
Twin Peaks,"A new season of a favorite show came out on Netflix. I think it was season 3 or 4. I'm 15 min in after hitting play and thinking ""this is so familiar"" ""what a long flashback"". Turns out Netflix had started season 1 episode 1 for me instead of the new one lol."
Twin Peaks,"When you're caught up, I would recommend you take a look at this:  


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AYnF5hOhuM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AYnF5hOhuM)  


It's kind of amazing as a piece of analysis."
Twin Peaks,I love lynch but I dont get the show. EVERY time I try to watch it i fall asleep within the first 20 mins.
Twin Peaks,"Watch all of TP.

Then watch this:

https://youtu.be/7AYnF5hOhuM

Then watch a follow-up video on the same channel.

The re-watch all of TP again."
Twin Peaks,"If you dare say you didn't like it, be prepared to hear that you are dumb. That's the center of the Rick and Morty fans and Twin Peaks fans Venn Diagram."
Twin Peaks,"As someone who lives where the shows is based out of, I should probably watch this as well…"
Twin Peaks,There’s no way someone would’ve bust out a smart phone on season one at any point because it was made before those existed. PalmPilots only started to become a thing in the late 90s early 2000s. Some of them might be confused for a smart phone. My guess is that you saw something else and because you’re so accustomed to seeing smart phones that’s what you assumed it was.
Twin Peaks,Just watch season 1 only..
Twin Peaks,"Well, your both morons"
Twin Peaks,"Go on. Get your wig, giant shoes, and red nose. You're a clown."
Twin Peaks,[removed]
Twin Peaks,"Haha, don’t worry about it"
Twin Peaks,"Okay, so I watched the original pilot for Twin Peaks about a decade ago and liked it a lot, didn't really like any episode after so I stopped.

I watched The Return in full when it aired and I fucking loved it.

I didn't really feel the need to watch the rest of the original show because The Return is anti nostalgia anyway.

Mr Jackpots > Agent Cooper"
Twin Peaks,"Ah reminds me of when I pushed my girlfriend into watching Good Omens with me. 

Tuned it in, finished it and was very confused. Turns out I had played the season finale..."
Twin Peaks,"No, you were watching the right one, David Lynch saw into the future and could see iPhones 20 years before they happened"
Twin Peaks,This will be largely how you feel about the original as well
Twin Peaks,No way…. Lol I can’t believe it! 😂😂😂
Twin Peaks,yeah netflix doesnt have the ABC episodes of Twin peaks so you watched what they have atm.
Twin Peaks,So you are watching season 3 without watching seasons 1 and 2??
Twin Peaks,"C'mon, anything David Lynch is high performance surreal art at its finest, especially compared to the drivel that is most of the past 10 years.

Make sure you have seen the films Lost Highway and Blue Velvet too."
Twin Peaks,"I am a David Lynch fan.  And I am old.

But I missed the entirety of the Twin Peaks thing when it was at it's height.  Back then I didn't know - or care - what a David Lynch was.  Was sometime later I found the guy.

Thing is, Twin Peaks has always felt like quite the time commitment to me.  I kept putting it off for watching or rewatching a favorite movie.  

Then Showtime did the Twin Peaks thing in 2017.  It premiered and I said, 'Fuck it.'.  I went all in on the show without any previous viewing experience at all.  

Hands down, one of my favorite TV experiences ever.  Just flying blind like that.  

I mean, the thing about Lynch's stuff - it isn't always supposed to make sense.  Us fans, we love Mulholland Drive - ask us fans to explain it.  We can't.  David gave us a list of 10 things to pay attention to.  We still don't get it.  But we love it anyways!"
Twin Peaks,"If it makes you feel any better, watching the original 2 seasons and the movie won’t really make you know what the hell is going on in season 3 either.  I mean, you’ll know a little more, but not much."
Twin Peaks,"OMG LOLOLOL!!!!!!!! The original still blew minds back in the day, but WOW, this would have been something else!!!!!!! Great post!"
Twin Peaks,"This is the water, and this is the well…"
Twin Peaks,"Been said a million times, but I don't think this will ever be topped as my favorite episode of TV of all time. I've never felt so strongly about liking something I've watched as the first time I saw that. I was thinking about it for weeks afterwards."
Twin Peaks,Maybe my favorite single episode of television ever. After watching it I immediately watched it again.
Twin Peaks,Season 3 Episode 8 is my favorite Lynch film.
Twin Peaks,Best hour of TV ever.
Twin Peaks,I will never forget this experience.
Twin Peaks,"Thanks!

Just started season 1.

Thoughts so far:

1) right this makes sense now
2) This actually looks like it was made at the start of the 90s"
Twin Peaks,Go out and seek the deleted scenes. They were gutted from the film but they are more like the TV series. Explain things a little bit better...
Twin Peaks,"So I always thought the movie was a “made for tv” type film, so when I finally watched it years ago during a rewatch of Twin Peaks, I was shocked at how dark it was in tone and all the nudity."
Twin Peaks,I accidentally watch the movie first before watching the series
Twin Peaks,And watch 'What Did Jack Do?' between seasons 1 and 2.
Twin Peaks,I enjoyed the show but FWWM was too much for me.
Twin Peaks,Is the entire show and 30 years of spin-offs about this? Do they ever solve it?
Twin Peaks,[removed]
Twin Peaks,"well, it's more about how a murder of a girl in a community affects all of these lives in a certain way. It can argued that Lynch is giving commentary on our society and his dislike for throw away violence in TV."
Twin Peaks,Hilarious and fitting that one could watch a bunch of contextless deleted scenes that make no narrative sense strung together and be like “yes classic David Lynch that makes sense”
Twin Peaks,I did the exact same thing!
Twin Peaks,The same thing happened to me. But i caught the mistake like 30 minutes in the film.
Twin Peaks,Well if that ain't the most accurate thing I've seen today...
Twin Peaks,Beautifully haunting or Hauntingly beautiful?
Twin Peaks,Title song with bass line.  https://youtu.be/pXrjMaVoTy0
Twin Peaks,Title song with bass line.  https://youtu.be/pXrjMaVoTy0
Twin Peaks,"Omg yes. 

He just said he takes his coffee black as midnight on a moonless night and I bloody died.

What a dork.

Wtf they just there was fish in the coffee pot. 

This show."
Twin Peaks,Pete and Pete was Nickelodeon's Twin Peaks.
Twin Peaks,The 1994 movie made on a shoestring budget only for the purpose of retaining the rights to the Fantastic Four is somehow the best of the Fantastic 4 movies by far.
Twin Peaks,"Thanks, but me neighbour is a bit bored of me already"
Twin Peaks,I live in North Bend now and we still get the occasional tourists at Tweede’s cafe.
Twin Peaks,What I'm finding interesting is that the soundtrack is proper bringing back some strong childhood memories
Twin Peaks,"I'm in UK and we found it on Paramount streaming, hope that helps"
Twin Peaks,[justwatch.com](https://justwatch.com) select your country and search twin peaks
Twin Peaks,"I also find myself usually fast forwarding every scene with Donna after a certain point whenever I do a rewatch, both James and her should've been pushed in the background after the central mystery was solved since (IMHO) they're just boring characters."
Twin Peaks,"In my view, this is true only after the first complete watch. Too easy to miss some important details in those episodes if one is aggressively fast forwarding.  No one when this first aired even could have fast-forwarded. Better to experience it more like the original generation of us did. (Preferably on an old-fashioned CRT TV... just kidding... mostly. )"
Twin Peaks,"Did you watch it when it was on TV the first time?  I don't think it's the full reason, but a lot of the adoration is admiring it for how revolutionary it was at the time. Music, cinematography, pacing, and much of the acting were unique and opened new vistas for what television could be."
Twin Peaks,"Don't waste your time with this please, its a pretentious and self-opinionated take on the series that presents itself as the *true* interpretation, which is inconsistent with the show's production context and Lynch's own creative process. [In other words](https://youtu.be/xmnE4FfvXUM)"
Twin Peaks,You very clearly did not read the post.
Twin Peaks,"Season 3 is one of the most critically acclaimed shows of the decade and Fire Walk With Me a cult classic. Season 2 begins and ends well, the middle is the part people don't like. Ignore this person."
Twin Peaks,"You're*

Edit: we prefer to go by ""gimps"""
Twin Peaks,">The Return is anti nostalgia anyway.

I've seen that take a good bit (just finished the show and getting into the lore), and I like it. Looking back at s3 it does feel like a lot of it was just a big ol' way of saying ""you can't go back"".  From Harry only being mentioned and never shown, Audrey getting her tiny little wtf cameo, and the way it just.... Ends."
Twin Peaks,"I found his list of ten things to be rather helpful. Unlike most of his films, MD can be deciphered fairly well if you really want to. Without spoilers, the key is dividing the real story line from the hallucinated dream of how she wished it had been. For me that accounted for about 85% of the scenes (on about my 4th watching.)  But unraveling it is not the point, just an extra game on top of the masterpiece."
Twin Peaks,Got a light?
Twin Peaks,That summer was magical
Twin Peaks,"I was informed after complaing about twin peaks on another thread, its made to exagerate soap operas and their style of acting. 

I felt something was off about it until about season 2."
Twin Peaks,"Personal advice, feel free to take it or leave it.

For seasons 1&2 It's not a bingeable show

One or two episodes at a time are the most you should do, that's the way the pacing is built.

Season 3 is perfectly bingeable."
Twin Peaks,So did you watch season 3 when it came out and then you’re starting season 1 now?
Twin Peaks,"> 1) right this makes sense now

Enjoy that feeling while you still have it."
Twin Peaks,[The Missing Pieces](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLswgFs_bu87Pc-O_TGYhtAu7yEdPQRkk4)
Twin Peaks,"Would you be willing to talk about your experience watching the show in that order?

I've thought about someone watching it that way before and it seems like it would be a very different journey."
Twin Peaks,Did you watch The Return?
The Keepers,"So I binged watched all of it in one sitting. This is the type of doco series that makes you pissed off, and makes you think... if I am this angered I can't imagine what the victims must feel. 

Now I will be delving down the rabbit hole of online articles. I wouldn't be surprised if a whole subreddit dedicated to this shit-show springs up, and I hope it does, the more exposure this gets the better."
The Keepers,"This might just be the best true crime doc I have ever seen. As the Guardian review pointed out it really portrayed the victims plight against the corrupt systems in society specifically the church.

My favourite scene was with the Baltimore Police detective who was in charge of the cold case file. When they asked him about the letter the sister had got and he left the room to go make some calls when he realised they were never given the evidence. You know someone got a bollocking on the other end of the telephone.

Very compelling stuff"
The Keepers,In love with Abbie & Gemma- those ladies rock! 
The Keepers,"It's amazing that so many people decided to dig in and investigate, rather than argue over whether to believe people.  Some of these people have done amazing work.  "
The Keepers,"On E2 atm. Geesh. This is so ugly. Beware, there are a lot of sexual abuse victims recounting their experiences. I'm already angry, so if that was the goal they got me there quick. "
The Keepers,"Just finished episode 2, so far it's absolutely chilling."
The Keepers,"Just finished it.  I'm sickened, disgusted and angry."
The Keepers,"Watched all episodes. Had a bit of a hard time after the first 2-3 episodes (it wasn't as engaging as I would've hoped), but it's well produced and in the end it was a good watch. But doesn't deserve comparisons to ""Making a Murderer"". Any episode of that has more twists than this entire docuseries."
The Keepers,"Premiere was fantastic. Obviously this will be compared to Making a Murderer, but the only similarity to me is that it's a Netflix Original.

It's chilling and the second episode is really horrific with some of the revelations. I really like and feel sorry for all the main people in the show. It's very hard hitting."
The Keepers,I just finished the second episode. I keep finding myself crying over what happened to these girls so long ago. Its just terrifying this occured and was allowed to happen.
The Keepers,"I just finished episode 2 and I need to vent. I' m getting real anxiety watching this. Child abuse topics fuck me up. 
:( "
The Keepers,"Watching it now, really enthralling, I have no idea if the case has any resolution or not, but Im in."
The Keepers,"something tells me we will find out the true villain is the RCC, which wouldnt surprise me at all."
The Keepers,Really love the intro to! Sets the show up so well. 
The Keepers,"FYI, after you finish this search the news for new developments (e.g. CNN), there's a story from May 17th about a DNA test ;)"
The Keepers,"Sounds good, might have to watch it sometime"
The Keepers,Watching this now...it's difficult to watch. Descriptions of the abuse are fucking horrifying and sad. Those poor girls and what they went through. 
The Keepers,Watched the first episode and it has me hooked! Definitely gonna binge it all this weekend. 
The Keepers,"Wow...I just wanted to watch one episode tonight, I'm on number 4 already. I didn't really understand Jane Doe saying she saw maggots on sister Cathy's face one day after the murder. Any thoughts?"
The Keepers, Been waiting for this! Just started episode 1
The Keepers,"I finished the series over the weekend, I have one thing that is severely bothering me that seemed to be just completely swept aside. It seems there is another suspect, but for some reason, it's being completely not looked into or maybe I missed something, but it would seem completely obvious to at least clear his name quite easily or at least give some ease to clarity.  Can someone please explain.... 
[Spoiler](#s ""Why were we shown Gerry Koob discussing how the police showed him Sister Cathy's vagina as a threat, which we were then told would never have occurred by police.  Yet later when they were interviewing the man who did the autopsy, never once did they ask if Sister Cathy's body (specifically her vagina was mutilated or if during the autopsy, he would cut that portion... thereby giving clarity as to why Koob would even say such a statement.  It seems beyond suspect for him to even say such a thing?  If by no reason then to throw people off the trail of him being involved, if he were to pose the idea that he was the one trying to solve what happened and was in fact threatened himself.  Yet it seems like we were shown this very odd thing Koob presented that seemed completely false and then it was never looked into.  Why?  Did I miss something?"")
"
The Keepers,"wow, that Jean lady didn't say anything?????????????????WTF
guess I just need to keep watching, but I just started ep 3 and because she was scared she didn't say anything? Oh, poor you, an innocent woman that was trying to help your ass was murdered and you're worried about your own problems?...this is a big deal you dumbass!! (is what I would have told her at the time)"
The Keepers,"How does it hold up compared to other shows like it? Making a Murderer, The Jinx, The Staircase, etc.?"
The Keepers,I'm with you I'm furious right now. Catholic church wow how evil and law enforcement comes off as super clueless. 
The Keepers,"that scene gave me some hope.  I live in Baltimore and it's nice to know some people still care about their jobs- even when reviewing cold cases.  
"
The Keepers,which epsiode is this? im currently on five and am wondering if i missed it somehow
The Keepers,They really had their shit together- impressive.
The Keepers,"I feel somewhat horrible saying this, but here it goes: my mom is of the same generation as these ladies and is the antithesis of a strong, independent woman. I love her lots - she just wasn't a particularly good role model for what I needed as a kid.

These women show me it has nothing to do with generation. I've been blown away with how determined, intelligent and amazing they are. I couldn't agree with you more!"
The Keepers,Episode two was definitely intense. Had me nearly sick to my stomach at some points.
The Keepers,"""Let the holly spirit flow through you."" Something that could be funny in a joke story but when it hit me that that piece of trash was actually doing that...awful"
The Keepers,"Just a warning. There are pretty graphic depictions of sexual abuse by victims. It could be very triggering to some who've suffered past trauma.


I'm watching episode 2 right now and I feel physically ill.


I feel like it's an important investigative documentary, though. This is probably one of the best benefits of the age of information. Victims can make themselves heard. And we all have the ability light up dark corners that monsters used to be able to hide in."
The Keepers,"Please join us at /r/The_Keepers at join the discussions. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Just finished it as well, and I'm so unbelievably angry."
The Keepers,Ep 2 had the most difficult and upsetting subject matter so you have made it through the hardest part. The tone of the show shifts more to the murder mystery and cover up after that
The Keepers,I think we already know that. 
The Keepers,Yep yep.  The priest's body was exhumed.
The Keepers,Keep going.
The Keepers,"She didn't see Cathy the day after the murder. But as Chocodong said, keep going. :) "
The Keepers,Hang in there for second episode.  What'd you think of first?
The Keepers,"SPOILERS:

I became super confused with this part as well. Did Koob ever even explain if this was a just a picture? or actually a part of Cathy's body? Did he even remember the police officer that did this? Whether by physical appearance or just a simple name?
I completely agree that this was not a completed investigation of either parties.
Here I see one of the following to be true:
1. Complete dishonesty and Gerry (or another person) made this up to make the viewers see the police as corrupt as the perpetrator. (This tended to be a common theme!! Although not to say I don't disagree with the fact that the injustices in Baltimore happened due to the corrupt higher classes of the city).  
2. Gerry told the truth and the show did not look into it as much as they could have.
3. Gerry was not fully explaining the occurrence as what it was and what exactly happened.
4. Gerry was not telling the truth and no one knew why he said such a thing but the show should have investigated that suggestion more throughly other than asking one police officer.

One more thing about Gerry, does anyone else notice how he tells us in the beginning of the series that he purposed to Sister Cathy, and Cathy turned him down. Yet at the end of the series we find out Cathy kept the ring and was wearing it when her body was found?

Another thing...
If the letter Gerry received was written after Cathy's disappearance, who wrote it? And why would they write those deeply specific personal things to Gerry in pose of Cathy?
""I can't deny I want you in me, I want to bear your children.""..?

Did I miss something?"
The Keepers,[deleted]
The Keepers,"Of those three I have only seen Making a Murderer, I would say I was just as captivated by this as I was MAM. With MAM I kept thinking this can't be true, this can't of happened, I thought the same with this doco."
The Keepers,"I personally still think The Jinx and The Staircase are on a bit of a higher level, but The Keepers feels very similar to Making a Murderer. It's a very interesting case and so far it's been fascinating to watch. Altough I haven't seen the whole thing yet, so I can't speak for the whole show."
The Keepers,"I wouldn't automatically assume the detective placed in charge of that particular cold case is actually working to solve it.

I'm not making an accusation, but considering everything else around the case, I think it's certainly something to think about."
The Keepers,I'm not sure but I think the 6th
The Keepers,When she said the line about how he said his cum contains the holy spirit so she should swallow I actually exclaimed out loud in disgust. They didn't hold back in this doc so far 
The Keepers,I believe Jean about Brother Bob -- that he did it and Maskell was in on it.
The Keepers,"Really enjoyed it so far, just started 3rd episode. "
The Keepers,"Thank you, I don't read too much into the other things... but that body part reveal he did... nothing... no one wanted to go back to that at all.  It just seemed ridiculously confusing they didn't question it with the guy that did the autopsy.  Though I didn't follow the ring info... I missed that.  That is interesting and adds more suspicion to Koob."
The Keepers,[deleted]
The Keepers,"Cathy disappeared on a Friday evening. The letter she wrote to her sister was postmarked the next day, Saturday. She must have dropped the letter into a mailbox that Friday, the seventh, after work, therefore it would have been postmarked on Saturday the eighth."
The Keepers,"Did you ever think that Gerry might have been deceived by the policeman?  It could have been a piece of meat from a butcher, like a cow's tongue or anything and he just TOLD him it was her intimate part. I think they were just messing with his mind, anyway, assuming that he was a naive priest and would not know the difference. Just my two cents' worth."
The Keepers,"I agree. It may be because I live in Baltimore, but I found myself feeling actually scared while watching The Keepers, which I don't remember during making a murderer or the jinx or serial. "
The Keepers,"The jinx was insane, I haven't seen the staircase... where can I stream it?"
The Keepers,"It really doesn't inspire confidence, even an amateur like me realises how important that letter is."
The Keepers,Apparently there was no match to Maskell for the DNA test.
The Keepers,"Yes, there is.  Dr. Werner Spitz, the assistant Medical Examiner said he could not tell if she had been sexually assaulted because there had been mutilation by animals at the dumpsite."
The Keepers,"Yep, that's what I meant -- that Brother Bob actually did the killing, not Maskell, but Maskell was still involved/oversaw it. Sorry I wasn't as clear! "
The Keepers,Holy hell
The Keepers,I'm definitly watching this. Also because it's Baltimore.
The Keepers,It looks pretty good and informative. I love learning about cover ups if they are actually real. 
The Keepers,"So as a Catholic, is the solution to basically clean house with the priests? This is a cultural cancer."
The Keepers,I'll have nun of that. 
The Keepers,Another insanely addictive murder documentary that ends with no definitive answers... I can't wait!
The Keepers,"Looks good, but I wish I could watch it now."
The Keepers,"""From the home of Making a Murderer"" is kind of a stretch to put in your trailer...

It's also the ""home"" of The Ranch. That means nothing. "
The Keepers,I swear this trailer gets posted here four times a week...
The Keepers,Would've been a good name for this series.
The Keepers,Think McNulty can solve this?
The Keepers,I am ok 
The Keepers,"Religion itself, is a cancer. "
The Keepers,You would want to see that statistically they have higher numbers of crimes than the rest of society before you can make that sort of call. My understanding for example is that there is a lower percentage of pedophiles priests than pedophile teachers for example and the priests just get a lot more press so the perception is that its more widespread than it is.
The Keepers,"Is that with the thinking that if we replace all the old priests with new priests that these problems will just go away? If so, I sadly doubt that is true."
The Keepers,[removed]
The Keepers,You shouldn't make a habit of using terrible puns.
The Keepers,Didn't the makers of that show also leave out some information and really tailor the narrative to tell their story?
The Keepers,"Honestly. I got excited because I thought this was a new trailer, but alas just a reminder that nothing new to see until May 19th."
The Keepers,Except netflix already has a popular documentary with that title. 
The Keepers,Only if he follows chain of command.
The Keepers,Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck ... Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
The Keepers,Edgy 
The Keepers,"It's debatable. They left out things that support and hurt both sides, but Katz, the prosecutor, really tried to argue ""his side"" and those ""omissions"" were the most public. He says they left out sweat DNA that was found on her car, that her phone and keys were found on his property, but we know the Sheriff staff planted evidence, so the prosecutor's word that *other* easily plantable evidence was not planted is pretty suspect. 

They also left out the fact that 2 of the jurors in the trial had relatives working for the Manitowoc Sheriff's Department, which would have helped Avery. Not everything can or needs to be included. I think the overwhelming evidence supports the position the filmmakers decided to take. 

"
The Keepers,t'Fuck did *I* do?
The Keepers,"Don't get me wrong I'll sign the petition, but isn't there a very slim chance the archdiocese would have destroyed the files by now? "
The Keepers,[deleted]
The Keepers,"> According to the petition’s page (which currently has more than 11,000 signatures), the Archdiocese releasing all their files on Maskell would help “thoroughly investigate all avenues that may have led to the murder of Cathy Cesnik in 1969.”

Oh please, if there's one thing that The Keepers proved it's that there isn't a shred of hard evidence connecting Maskell to Cathy's murder. I highly doubt there's some secret files the Church has that meticulously details the murder of a nun in 1969. "
The Keepers,I bet there was a flood of some sort that destroyed all of the files.
The Keepers,"""Unfortunately we lost those files."""
The Keepers,The Catholic Church keeps very detailed records. 
The Keepers,I feel like most of the premise of the show was that the archdiocese couldn't care less about people asking for documents
The Keepers,"> never once tied any of the events together.

That's the point. No one actually knows the answers and it's messy. They could have easily present a single version of events (which many documentaries would do) but this is just about a bunch of different events, stories and people. Many which are quite unbelievable and over the top. Yet that's often where the stories are proven to have truth. Yet other bits still seem far fetched. We don't know the truth, it's messy. Then there's the massive backdrop of sexual assault and cover up by the church and it's always had a looming shadow and influence over this case. Even if it's not related."
The Keepers,"> but it was completely biased in its narrative and it never once tied any of the events together.

I agree with you completely on that. It never did make a strong link between the death of the Nun and Farther Maskell, the only connection was Jane Doe's memory of seeing the body with Maskell and the maggots on the body's face. The doc touched briefly on the actions of the Gerry Koob but quickly abandoned that story.  

The doc also wanted so hard to show a conspiracy involving the Baltimore Police and other police departments. Unfortunately the doc never really did. Yes the investigation of the murder was poorly handled but so was the other murder investigation the documentary illustrated. 

The molestation of the children and the murder of the nun are horrific events but this doc didn't do a really good job of liking them."
The Keepers,[deleted]
The Keepers,"I totally agree!!! It was pretty apparent that the nun was not killed by someone trying to cover up the school disaster that was happening at that time. It was like the production company manipulated the situation to merge the 2 murders and the horrible molestations into some type of doctoral thesis. We know who was at the center of the sex crimes against the children. He is dead, and probably the other perps are long gone too. Also, the statute of limitations is in effect, so there was no way for the producers to move this story forward without the murders, for the murders are the only real mechanism that could open this story up. I have a feeling that the production company concluded that the murders were unrelated to the school, but all the heartache was in that school, and there was very little material regarding the murders. Other than feeling sick to my stomach for what happened, I felt that this was totally misrepresented.

Hell Teacher Nube,"This is very interesting! Not exactly something I would have expected to see on this particular subreddit (is there a subreddit for categorizing speech patterns?) but interesting nonetheless.

  Did you come up with these statement categories yourself, or are you drawing on some pre-established category system? I think your conclusions look fairly sound based on the examples you provide, but I would say the criteria by which you sort the statements could use refinement. The difference between 'binary quality' and 'non-binary quality' doesn't really look like a measurable difference at all to me (why, for instance, is 'very tough' given as an example of a binary quality, whereas 'very annoying' was given as non-binary? Is it solely the sentence structure that defines which of the two it is, not the descriptor?)

  You've got me thinking about this and I didn't expect to think about this today (or any day), so that's a win."
Hell Teacher Nube,Does anyone know why there only 56 episodes out of 62 on paramount+ for avatar
Hell Teacher Nube,"Thank you! Yes, I came up with those concepts/categories myself.

> (is there a subreddit for categorizing speech patterns?) 

A more or less popular subreddit for ""categorizing speech patterns"" would be like literal heaven to me!

> The difference between 'binary quality' and 'non-binary quality' doesn't really look like a measurable difference at all to me (why, for instance, is 'very tough' given as an example of a binary quality, whereas 'very annoying' was given as non-binary?)

Could you give examples of problems with other distinctions? The ""binary/non-binary"" one turned out to be the weakest in this analysis.

You're right, if we're comparing specifically ""very tough"" and ""very annoying"" - they're the same. I was thinking about something else, but the fishing example of ""binary"" is probably not very good anyway. 

> Is it solely the sentence structure that defines which of the two it is, not the descriptor?

The category of a description is never truly defined, it depends on the context of other descriptions. *(the fishing examples skip that)* I made an illustration about this: [here](https://i.imgur.com/FBSGtbk.png).

Circles are like quotes. Colors are like categories potentially applicable to those quotes. Any particular circle can be just a mess of colors, but when you check a **group** of circles - you may notice the color that pops up more often than others. In the upper line it's **red**, in the lower line - it's **green**.

A weirder illustration, with trees: [here](https://i.imgur.com/EI5st53.png). Upper pictures emphasize tree trunks in a special way (compared to the lower ones), even though tree trunks are present in every single picture. Elements of the trees are the same, but you pay different kinds of attention to them. It's a weirder illustration, but I like it more than the color one: I like to think about my categories as ""attention patterns"".

> You've got me thinking about this and I didn't expect to think about this today (or any day), so that's a win.

I don't know how to objectively test the idea by myself (I'm not a programmer, I don't know a cheap way to generate many speech tests), so I want to get people interested in this topic by posting analyzes.

I think that categories like this can be applied to the speech of real people... and if speech patterns exist, people should know about them.

Do you think there's a way to share something like this with linguists or machine learning people?"
Hell Teacher Nube,"I don't have paramount+, but do they combine multipart episodes to one? That cutting out 6 episodes sounds about right."
Hell Teacher Nube,"ATLA has 61 episodes. They probably just combined The Day of Black Sun episodes (+1), The Boiling Rock episodes (+1) and Sozin's Comet episodes (+3).

56 + 5 = 61 episodes."
Hell Teacher Nube,"> Circles are like quotes. Colors are like categories potentially applicable to those quotes. Any particular circle can be just a mess of colors, 

Ah, so what you're saying is that they're not intended to be mutually exclusive descriptors. That may be where I was seeing ambiguity; I understood the categories to be akin to dividing lines, not independent 'applies / does not apply' assessments. 

  Knowing this, I don't think I have any further individual instances to point out in the quotes you categorize; any discrepancy between my evaluation and yours is likely to just be a difference in judgment, not an objective difference. (Which one could say means the system needs further refinement? Generally, the purpose of rules for quantifying something is to allow different individuals to reach consistent conclusions over different sets of data by applying consistent judgment criteria.)

  I'm not a programmer either, but in any case, to use a program for this you would almost certainly need to be able to express your qualifying criteria in pure logic such as (If word = Verb And location(word) = 3...) or something along those lines. So you would first have to do that, and to do _that_ you would probably have to do a really deep dive into the theoretical construction of the English language to understand what strictly quantifiable constructs and patterns correlate to your definitions. And the English language is an contradictory bitch, so _that_ is probably where this spirals into impossibly complex territory perhaps better approached by machine learning or something.

  If I had infinite free time I would try it myself, but I most certainly do not so that's about as far as I can speculate.

  As for where you could share this: Hell if I know! I'm an amateur writer of fiction and a Material Engineer. The former is why I'm interested, and the latter is where I got enough programming experience to begin to speculate on what you would need to approach programming something related to this, but neither mean I'm in any way involved in or even aware of a relevant field. Maybe look for groups of hobbyist linguists? That might be something that exists."
Hell Teacher Nube,Didn’t look like but you have to look at each individual episode to see runtime

I think there're problems if we disagree about whole groups of quotes. If you look at a bunch of quotes of Katara and a bunch of quotes of Aang and don't see how they gravitate towards different descriptions - I didn't reach my goal. But if we agree, you can say that the rules are consistent for groups of quotes.

> And the English language is an contradictory bitch, so *that* is probably where this spirals into impossibly complex territory perhaps better approached by machine learning or something.

I agree and think that maybe even without language contradictions such approach could be still impossible: you need to analyze the quotes in context of each other + you may need at least on some level understand the actual ""meaning"" of the quotes.

But by testing I meant this (sorry for not clarifying): you could use a program to take, let's say, random redditor's quotes and generate a test for a human. A test can give you **N** sets of quotes and ask you what sets you're sure don't correspond to a single person. (If speech patterns exist you should be able to do that.) If you can solve those tests and teach others to solve them, it won't prove the idea outright ('cause personal information can get into samples and serve as a hint), but should spark more interest in investigating the issue further. It also won't be testing my particular descriptions, but the general idea that distinct universal speech patterns exist. The idea that you can tell apart the speech of people you don't know.

I can ask a friend to make **1** test for me, but what if I need **50** tests to do a little bit of training? 

> but neither mean I'm in any way involved in or even aware of a relevant field. Maybe look for groups of hobbyist linguists? That might be something that exists.

I see... thank you for the idea about hobbyists! I myself heard about [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) (but it's usually not about **universal** patterns, as I understood) and [Discourse analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis).

As I've wrote about the tests I started thinking... maybe it's possible to get people interested in creating a ""speech tester"" just for fun? I guess it can be funny or interesting even if you don't believe in the patterns, since anything can come up in random quotes (funny, thoughtful, important or sad)."
Hell Teacher Nube,"It sounds like in some places you just missed the point entirely. 

Jet was a character designed to morally challenge the main characters. His motivations, hatred of the Fire Nation, were correct, but he went so far out of his way that regular people were being put in harm’s way. It makes our main characters re-evaluate their conflict and their own actions.

Aang’s blue tattoo isn’t because he’s an Avatar, it’s because he’s an air nomad, and most people really don’t care to notice him. Whenever they go into enemy territory, where people *would* recognize him, especially towards the end when he goes to the Fire Nation, he wears a disguise or hides himself.

Zuko and Azula’s character arcs are really well done by the end. Azula went completely crazy as a result of wanting to be desired and praised by her father (which was never going to happen), and Zuko learned to move beyond hatred and anger and found forgiveness in his heart. He finally moved past his own self-hatred like Iroh pleaded with him to. Their final Agni Kai isn’t just a big explosive action scene, it’s representative of an internal battle for Zuko, as he’s fighting against someone that is as ruthless and angry as he used to be. Katara saving the day & helping Zuko is also representative of her finally forgiving him instead of resenting him for what he had done. They finally became true friends in that moment. 

Both Zuko and Aang’s stories are mature. Aang’s people are dead, he’s a child, oh and by the way he’s been told his whole life how he has to save the world or else it’ll die. He acts childish as a coping mechanism for the unbelievable stress of being “the chosen one” at age **10**.

Sokka’s plans are oftentimes stupid and don’t work at the start, hence why nobody listens to him. His entire character arc is learning to be a good soldier, but an even better leader. By the end of the show, his plans work and are even the key to saving the day a number of times. He *is* the comic relief character, but it’s because he has to learn to grow up and stop “playing” soldier. By the end he is a mix of funny and serious in a way that he wasn’t before.

The magic system IMHO is liked because there is no “best power”. Every power is balanced, powerful, and yet weak when confronted with other factors, and even the most powerful abilities like lightning-bending are extremely dangerous and could kill the user. It’s also a visually exciting system as it combines magic & martial arts, leading to visually stunning moments.

Finally, the finale of the show is literally the culmination of everything it’s set up. Aang has finally mastered the elements, and Ozai is in his most powerful state thanks to Sozin’s comet, which is always how the show was going to end from day one. The “life-bending” from the Lion-Turtle isn’t a deus ex machina, it’s a skill the character learned in an earlier episode that was not shown to the audience to make for a great reveal. If Aang had life-bended without the island episode & Lion-Turtle setup, then it would’ve been a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his taking away of Ozai’s bending is hugely impactful, because he finally found a way to stop him without killing him, as everyone told him he was supposed to do. Life-bending itself isn’t without consequence either, TLA & Korra both show that it is a grave and irreversible punishment, but it shows that Aang has grown to be mature enough to accept that he has to do what needs to be done, but does not need to go overboard. 

You don’t have to like it, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but to post this haughty word salad of a post on here and then to tack on the “I can name ten animated shows far superior” at the end just makes it seem like you’re farming for outrage. Like it or don’t, but don’t come on to Reddit and act like you’re some trailblazer for having an opinion."
Hell Teacher Nube,It's pretty good for being a kids cartoon
Hell Teacher Nube,"I used to think it was overrated too.

Then I watched it."
Hell Teacher Nube,Its actually one of the best written cartoons of all times with an extremely well thought out story arc that incorporated a rich backstory with characters with clear motivations that is very hard to duplicate. Almost every character and location is a full fleshed out idea and could be its own show.
Hell Teacher Nube,"I’ve seen it mentioned that Combustion Man didn’t stop because by that point it was personal. Having lost a group of kids twice already he wanted to take them out. 

An Earth bender could have taken out the Fire Nation capital, but perhaps they want minimal collateral. Fire Nation works just take everyone out, but that doesn’t mean other nations would. 

Admiral Zhao vs the fish. They were the moon and the ocean spirit. They’d taken on a physical form on Earth so by killing the moon spirit, Zhao effectively broke the moon and water bending. 

Wood is not a bendable item. That was the whole issue with that jail cell

Azula had hinted in The Island (or whatever the episode was called) that there were skeletons in her closet where she says my own mother thought I was a monster. Then there’s the whole party scene that happened where she opens up to Ty Lee. After The Day of Black Sun she comes after Zuko. You can argue there that she has begun to slip. Then there’s The Boiling Rock where she loses Mai and Ty Lee and then Sozin’s Comet where the one person she had also leaves her. That all leads into her paranoia and her collapse

Jet was being blinded by his hatred for the Fire Nation, going after the innocent. His crew were trying to tell him that sometimes you should let things go. Katara and Aang were too naive that she trusted him when she shouldn’t have

The Great Divide wasn’t that good. However, spiders in real life can climb vertical objects. Avatar doesn’t have real life animals in it (other than the Earth King’s bear , Bosco) so who knows what they can do. Also, you’re complaining about realistic physics in a show where bending and spirits exist

As for Ozai, didn’t they have a whole scene where they realised the guy is just a normal looking dude from his baby photo. That was probably to show that anyone can end up a bad guy. The episode where there was that dance party was more of the same really. Showed that not everyone in the Fire Nation is bad.

Downvote guy and the turtle was pulled out of nowhere

Katara did ruin the Agni Kai but I’ve heard it said that by attacking Katara, that’s where Azula lost. She broke the rules

Which of Zuko and Aang’s story is childish? One deals with genocide and the other abuse. Nothing childish here"
Hell Teacher Nube,"You raise some good points. For example, the deus ex machina ending is definitely a popular criticism of the show. It helps that Korra does a good job using it, and it fits into the themes of Atla. But it's definitely a valid criticism.

What isn't though is the vast amounts of minor nitpicks you have about the show. It's not that it's exactly bad to have them, but they take up too much of your argument, they are really minor details that every show has, and especially a lot of them can easily be explained in the show itself. 

The wooden cage criticism is especially bizarre. The fire benders know it's prisoners are earth benders. It makes complete sense to lock them in there for the time being. That season has also shown many times that other nation bender's live in the fire nation. So I'm not sure why you're confused they have wooden cages. 

Boom man is another example. I'm not sure how more obvious the show can make it that he has a personal vendetta again the gang. 

For future reference I would stay away from nitpicking. It's really hard to do correctly and just weakings your overall argument.

Also you should definitely try checking out Korra it's in my opinion a way better show. While the overall show is not as consistent as Avatar. It does a lot of more interesting things in its characters and plot than Avatar ever attempted."

I still enjoyed it for what it is."
Hell Teacher Nube,[deleted]
Hell Teacher Nube,"Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale. Once Mai and TyLee betrayed her she became increasingly paranoid and stressed. So much to the point her bending style changed. Notice as early as the southern raiders she started using closed fists when firebending. She never did that anytime else prior, it was always two fingers. Also, her facial expressions and the things she was saying were definitely out of character. It progressively got worse until she started hallucinating and then having a full breakdown after losing in the finale.

You’ve seemed to have missed A LOT of detail in this show overall and made some very bold statements that indicated you didn’t really pay attention or understand a lot of the episodes or characters.For example somehow you think Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol. Or even questioning why combustion man didn’t stop when Zuko ordered him too…. like dude Team Avatar had already injured him by that point and it was personal. Besides, the fire lord would’ve rewarded him far more than Zuko ever could have. 

Therefore, I don’t think your judgment can be accurate. Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe. But your opinion is your opinion I guess. And.. that’s all I’m going to touch out of your essay lol."

And I can see your Katara not listening to Sokka, but he has had great plans too.

Katara had already forgiven him, there was an entire episode dedicated towards that, that doesn't justify the moment she stole from Zuko and my problem isn't that Azula became crazy but she did it in like one episode, having authority can possibly make her crazy but not so fast.

I know Aang's childish he's 10. I'm just saying the feel and tone of his story doesn't flow well with Zuko's many times.

Yeah still not a fan of bending, Earth Bending just felt way too OP for me.

Spirit bending is dues ex machina, It literally fits perfectly in the definition of a dues ex machina, Aang has a conflict what do we do? Conveniently gets a power that allows him to win without killing Ozai, not only has Aang already killed before this conflict just came out of nowhere. Aang didn't went out to learn it or anything, he just was swept away and he got it from the turtle, he just got it. Keeping it a surprise doesn't make the moment better. Just because we saw scene with Aang & lion turtle doesn't mean it's not a Deus ex machina anymore.

Here's a video that might explain it better 
https://youtu.be/jdBnR_Dx4ow

IDC what Katara did that was Zuko's moment, not hers. Didn't Zuko just learned a pure form of fire bending? So that shouldve been used.

Jet is the only character we encounter that died, I wouldn't say he is forgotten. He was a major representation for the increasing danger they faced. 

Zukos ""pure form"" of firebending is redirecting lighting, which he uses to save Katara when Azula attacks her. Because he almost doesn't make it, he still takes a major electric blow and if Katara didn't step in azula would have killed him. 

And as for Aangs story being childish, his 12. Him having to grow up too fast and being reluctant is a main plot point."
Hell Teacher Nube,"They wouldn’t use a wooden cell for a fire bending prisoner. They’d use something like the cooler at The Boiling Rock. 

Katara wasn’t smart in that Agni Kai, that is true. 

Perhaps downvote guy is in denial? Actually he was unaware until he found out a few episodes in. He got mad about it and the whole Avatar State happened. Then later it’s shown the Avatar State scares him so maybe he didn’t want to go to that place emotionally again? Also, different personalities between Zuko and Downvote Guy. One desperately wants approval from his father and what he feels is rightfully his, believing his nation is the best due to propaganda (…what a great lie that was. They hate us - Zuko, Day of Black Sun). 

The other, very much a kid and didn’t want that to change (Why didn’t you tell us you were the Avatar? Because I never wanted to be). See how the other monks’ treated him when it was revealed he was the Avatar? How decisions were being made for him by the adults. He didn’t want that responsibility so he wanted to hang on to the good times.

Hell Teacher Nube,">And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

Zuko's pure form isn't lightning he didn't go there to learn lightning redirecting, he wasn't able to produce fire efficiently, he didn't see colorful lighting there he saw fire"
Hell Teacher Nube,"You dont think Aang took any human life??
Well https://youtu.be/PYmLKzgLbUo"
Hell Teacher Nube,"Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

And yeah maybe you are right about the boom man, He was an actual threat lol like Azula which Aang never defeated, so unbelievable that Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series."
Hell Teacher Nube,People are downvoting because they are not thinking of the show in the context it was created. I can't think of many things before this time on American TV and especially for children come close to avatar.
Hell Teacher Nube,"“A few episodes in.” So…. the episodes before it even touches on grieve, misogyny, war, dishonor, genocide, or any of the characters developed / any world building happened…. wtf? It’s literally only childish for the first 8 episodes. There’s a reason it has a huge fanbase with a wildly varying demographic."
Hell Teacher Nube,Wtf is this argument? I think these shows are better who cares if they came out in seperate years & 3 of these came before avatar so 30%
Hell Teacher Nube,"If your argument is a comparison, its probably a bad argument."
Hell Teacher Nube,I like fantasy much more
Hell Teacher Nube,"I mean it's ya and I'm 18 so yeah maybe, but I think HP got more mature as it went on that's why people like it so much, you stopped at book 3 but that's when the series gets even better maybe it's not for you."
Hell Teacher Nube,what do you mean? It meant a lot in the show. I think you might have been doing something else while watching this show.
Hell Teacher Nube,"Season 4 didn't happen because the story was over.

It was always planned as a 3 season arc"
Hell Teacher Nube,Did you comment to a thread that is over a month old? Also did you ignore all the points I made and listed shows that share none of the ground breaking things I stated?
Hell Teacher Nube,.....dude idk why your writing like an ass again but you wrote like 2 pages of the show. You have a little bit of a strange hard on for this show.
Hell Teacher Nube,"Yes. Fire nation specifically created the water bending jail and rounded up all of the south pole bender and brought them to the fire nation. The do similar things to earth kingdom benders. The wood was to stop earth benders. Iirc they knew that team avatar was in the fire nation at that point but I imagine it was meant for general earth nation benders that may attack the main land. 

If you're talking about when Zuko meets the dragons, he didn't learn a new form of firebending, he learned a new source within himself to replace his original, rage and anger. He was never going to produce flames like the dragons. He uses what he learned from them the remainder of the series. Im talking about when Iroh teaches him how to handle Azulas lightning."
Hell Teacher Nube,Forgot about that. You got me there. Unless that’s the Ocean Spirit doing stuff
Hell Teacher Nube,">Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

They also think an overrated show is the best thing ever. What do they know, in all seriousness though, it's up to you if you wanna watch it. I'm just recommending it.

>Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series.

Yeah, Ozai's my biggest issue with the original series. He is a pretty boring villain and Mark Hammil hams him up too much, ruining any fear factor he could've had.

That's another thing Korra thankfully fixes."
Hell Teacher Nube,Context doesn't make a show more enjoyable though. Just because a TV show was good for the time doesn't make it any good now.
Hell Teacher Nube,I can
Hell Teacher Nube,hahah someone is a little grumpy. You know you don't need to like everything everyone else likes?
Hell Teacher Nube,It also matters a lot when things come out. actually.
Hell Teacher Nube,.....What? Hahaha
Hell Teacher Nube,What did it meant? At the end?
Hell Teacher Nube,"Hardly, there was plenty of story to be told and they even continued doing it in the comics which have been releasing since 2012"
Hell Teacher Nube,"https://screenrant.com/avatar-last-airbender-season-4-scrapped-shyamalan-movie/amp/

Hell Teacher Nube,dID yOu CoMmEnT oN a ThReAd ThAt iS OvEr A MoNtH oLd? What does it look like dumbass. Also I wasnt talking about your other points i was talking about this comment
Hell Teacher Nube,"I just gave my reasons because saying __ sucks without giving reasons would sound dumb why, I just thought it wasn't that great as much as it's praised, on IMDb which I know isn't objective fact but there it's higher than The Sopranos, and also this took like 20 minutes to write."
Hell Teacher Nube,"Yeah but after that dragon thing. It made more sense for Zuko to defeat Azula alone.

I just think capturing Katara and toph in fire bending clothes in a wooden chamber is stupid."
Hell Teacher Nube,And the avalanche?
Hell Teacher Nube,I very very strongly disagree with you. Context matters a great deal.
Hell Teacher Nube,Hahaha you know opinions exist? And I like many popular things
Hell Teacher Nube,Still I believe few years doesn't matter that much
Hell Teacher Nube,Ok so reading those tweets it seems like they had thrown the idea around for a fourth season but never properly confirmed it as the original plan was 3 seasons and the Shyamalan movie just kind of cemented the idea that it should be 3 seasons like it was from the start.
Hell Teacher Nube,hahah....hahaha I hope that comment gave your life meaning.
Hell Teacher Nube,It's Fire *Nation* clothes. Not everyone in the Fire Nation is a Fire Bender.
Hell Teacher Nube,Guess he has then. I've seen this memed before to be fair
Hell Teacher Nube,"It can but not all context will. If its a chinese historical drama maybe knowing a lot about chinese history will make it more interesting. But telling people, it's a kids show so suck it up, even if true will not in anyway positively affect their viewing experience."
Hell Teacher Nube,yeah. Not sure why you are responding like a child.
Hell Teacher Nube,but it does a lot. considering most of the shows you listed weren't available in America or made yet and digital steaming didn't exist and almost all cartoons were episodic at the time.
Hell Teacher Nube,But there was a possibility though
Hell Teacher Nube,When you cant think of a valid argument ^
Hell Teacher Nube, I guess that's a good security system now
Hell Teacher Nube,No but complaining about the special effects from a movie from 1990 its important to know context. If star was made today people wouldn't enjoy the writing and complain the sets are bad and the special effects and fighting or weak.
Hell Teacher Nube,Not sure why are you so angry over me for giving my opinion
Hell Teacher Nube,So? Who says episodic shows can't be better? And besides avatar is also episodic and continuous storylines happens occasionally
Hell Teacher Nube,"I guess. 

The original plan was still 3 Seasons and that's what they went with in the end.

I think that was for the best tbh, I don't know if they could've filled a fourth season without drastically altering the series' pacing"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,The one on netflix?  Haven't seen it but I like to move it.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Yeah, I watched and enjoyed it. I enjoyed Mitch Watson's previous shows (Scooby Doo: Mystery Inc. and Beware the Batman) and watched it. I'm not a huge fan of Madagascar, but I liked the show's weird humor and satire on politics and trends. Plus, I really liked the adventurous tone it took with Exiled. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I’ve watched all 5 seasons.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"If you like adult humour dressed up in kids TV, this is the show for you, my friend. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I've heard, and its nothing special"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,This post brought to you by the makers of All Hail King Julien.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Steve

-4 when fighting Highschool Kids

+8 when fighting Interdemensional Demons"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,The Dustin/Steve pairing was amazing. Steve ended being one of the best characters on the show by far.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Does anyone else see that Dustin is the only one in the pack that doesn’t have a brother or sister? He also doesn’t seem to have a Dad around so to me Steve seems to be his only older guy figure and I think that’s amazing.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,#justiceforbob
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I think Nancy and Steve grown a lot with the story, and a part for the better. Steve had the most growth after getting beat up in the first season, he realized that wasn't him. Anyways, I just hated how the kids would square up with those damn dema-dogs but when Steves was getting the crap beat out of him they were just standing there yelling. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"The pairings of Dustin/Steve and Eleven/Hopper was the two best things about this season. 

Honorable mention to the scene between Billy and Mrs Wheeler."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"""Like the Germans?""

Steve and Dustin were comedy gold!"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,At the beginning of the series I always thought Nancy was too good for Steve. I was wrong. Steve is too good for Nancy.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Never have I hated a character so much in the beginning of a show, only to be rooting like crazy everytime he fucking steps up.

Honestly I sort of forgot about Steve in between seasons, and when I saw him in season 2 my first reaction was ""Oh yeah, fuck this guy."" Then a few episodes later I'm like, ""Oh yeah, this mother fucker Steve."""
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,He arguably has the best character arc on the entire show
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,He broke the camera because Jonathan took nudes photos of his girlfriend. Does nobody remember this?
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I just wish they would have allowed him to beat the shit out of Billy...hated every second of Billy I saw.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I demand a drake and josh style spinoff sitcom where dustin and steve become unlikely step brothers
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Dustin and Steve were the best of the show, but the best scene between Dustin and Mike's dad was comedy gold, I never laughed so hard."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Steve's arc is one of the best ""jerk"" arcs ever on TV. Him and Jamie Lannister. Love it. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I'm actually really wondering about Steve's character for S3. He's no longer dating Nancy, He's not going to be hanging out with the kids or the adults on a regular basis.

He has nothing that grounds him to the town of hawkings anymore. His family was never introduced, He has no siblings, no friends. 

Had Dustin not met him by happenstance he wouldn't have even been apart of this adventure. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Long live the king, and may Nancy forever live in regret!!"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I need to watch season 1 again because I remember not liking Steve but this season I was all about him. Even at the beginning when Nancy was drunk over Barb and he was just wondering if she loved him. He was even super sweet and asked Jonathan to take Nancy home.


Steve....even when in an argument with his girlfriend is still man enough to trust the guy who has a crush on his GF to get her home safely. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,My 2 favorite relationships are hopper and eleven and dustin and steve hes the unexpected big brother and im glad he took dustin under his wing it shows he just needed a friend thats decent
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Too bloody right !
Sod, the kids, Steve was like an epic RPG NPC that helps you out and levels the playing field.

What a guy.

What hair !"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,King Steve grew old and became Steven King 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"The whole season I expected a reveal that Billy is gay. Was it just me seeing things, or were there hints?"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Best character arc of the show. My bet is it keeps arcing. 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I hope Keery is seriously considered for an Emmy nom.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,[deleted]
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I can deal with him being the meme this season since he's an actual character 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Am I alone in thinking Steve was not really being a dick by breaking Jonothan’s camera? He legitimately took pictures of Nancy naked, through a window. He should have gotten reported, not just a broken camera. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,[deleted]
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Is joe any good in this show? Last time I saw him perform was in some plays back in our high school and he always seemed like he’d be going somewhere great
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"The real MVP is Bob, you will forever be missed R.I.P"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,LUCAS is the REAL winner this season 2
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,sticking with the RPG references in the show Steve is definitely the tank. He's not officially part of the kids' party but he's definitely the tank anytime he's involved.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Steve had a really nice character growth towards the end of s1 that it made me so mad that the show redeem Steve for me by not running. I liked that he didn't lose that in the second season and he seemed to have grown into a better person. But that was not cool leaving Nancy drunk at the party. 

Nancy and Jonathan story line was too focus on on justice for barb and just cementing their relationship. Cute and nice, but didn't add to much in their character growth. Although I do love seeing Nancy take charge and have the more ""masculine"" role while Jonathan has the more ""feminine"" role. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,He's the best character in season 2.  It's not even close. 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I really hate the line ""We all like Steve, but we don't love Steve"".

Steve got the best character development in Season One.

1. He started out to look like a Jock-Asshole.
2. He realised his errors and made the best of it.
3. He confronted his asshole ""friends"".
4. He stood up to the challenge and actually rescued both Nancy and Jonathan.
5. He was literally ""there"" for Nancy.
6. In Season 2, he was actually protecting Nancy from being killed, from her own early to expose the truth. Nancy was lucky that ""the agency"" had a change of management. If it was still run by Dr. Brenner, she and Jonathan would be dead.
7. He could have just GTFO, the moment those kids were going on one of their ""adventures"".

I really hope in Season 3 that Steve and Nancy gets back together and Jonathan will be with Samantha.

I really hope this show will not go the ""Gay"" route and make Steve ""go gay"" with the Max's step-brother. They are strongly implying Max's brother is or might be gay, but I really hope that they will not make Steve ""gay""."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,#justiceformews
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,He's second behind Will for me in best expanded character this season.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,bruh did this fucking ad just spoil the show. wtf
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,[deleted]
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,justice for mew mew
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Steve is such a good dude. Shame about him and Nancy. 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I have to agree. Steve's journey has been really great. Every time you think he is going in a stereotypical direction, he changes course and surprises you. That ending with him and Dustin was downright heartwarming. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"He needs to train so he doesn't get his arse kicked again in the third season, or it could be joke. ""You got your arse kicked again?""."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I liked *Stranger Things*. I did not like *Stranger Things 2*. That being said, maybe I could watch it again at a more leisurely pace & enjoy it more, but some of it was dreadful... that Suicide Squad episode was especially awful. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Didn't really like him in season1 but in 2 he turned into one of my favorite character 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I've never seen a heel turn face like Steve.  
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Every time Steve gets punched in the face, he becomes a better, stronger person."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Someone really needs to teach him how to fight though. That's twice he's gotten his ass kicked.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Maybe Kali can be Steve's rebound.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,King Steve or Stephen King?
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I feel like this is a spoiler right? 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"God fucking dammit, if the title is a spoiler I'm going to be so mad."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I’m obsessed with everything about this show. From the 80s nostalgia to the characters. I can’t get over it and I already binged watched :(
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"During the first season I was very much doubtful about Steve, but during season two he became one of my favorite characters"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I really love Steve's character but I can't get to invested in him because I feel like they are building him up to die in the series. That would be too much. 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I was sure he was dead...so glad he wasn't. 
Billy totally kicked his ass though."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,When the hell did Steve become my favorite character? He’s awesome! I must be in the Upside Down. 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,I was a big fan of Goth Eleven and Hoppers reaction to that.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Every time he had a scene I was genuinely excited for what he was going to do, he is such a badass with a good heart"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,His hair style in season 2 reminded me of Jean Ralphio.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"At the end of season 1, my wife and I dubbed him “Good Guy Steve” It’s been really Fun to watch his character grow and change into the hero Hawkins deserves. "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Yes!! Steve was my MVP last season and this season he just did it again! Loved Dustin and him together.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I love the transition from Season 1 Steve to Season 2 Steve. I didnt get the ""Nancys Special"" thing, but you can tell he changed because of her by the end. His transition was perfectly executed. Also the contrast of him and Maxs brother was awesome."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,The scene in the tunnel when Steve and Dustin are getting charged had me emotionally up against the wall by the throat!!
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,This show makes me feel like a kid again. Best feeling ever
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"All hail King Steve and the Royal Consort, a can of Farrah Fawcett spray!"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Steve is a BAMF who gets things DONE
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Dustin and Steve ended up being to each other the sibling they never had 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I was two episodes from finishing when I saw this headline, and I was convinced it meant that Steve was going to die. I was biting my nails for 2 hours."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Yeah, they nailed it.  I hated him in the first season, towards the end was warming. 

Second you get to see that he is a guy who will step up, and is loyal, maybe overly trusting but brave. 

Fucking great show."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,He's a lot better than that asshole Billy! 
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"If any lotr actor they had to cast, the show should have gone with Sean Bean instead of Sean Astin. Then it would be more fitting to kill the poor Bob."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,How about a fucking spoiler tag?! Fuck
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,Can't wait to see the bad bitch Steve upgrades to next season.
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"""Yeah yeah, don't cream yourself""

Edit: Downvoted for a Steve quote?"
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"I liked Steve this season, but I can't forget the awful things he said to Jonathan in season 1. Every time I felt myself starting to like him, my mind just went back to how sad that scene was and how it made me feel about the character."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Anyone else find Eleven to be the show's weak link? Something about how she is written just irritates me.

Great season overall though."
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,"Best character in the show, by far. I was so bummed out for him at the beginning of Season 2 - he didn't deserve what Nancy did to him (that bitch!). "
All Hail King Julien: Exiled,This headline is such a fucking spoiler.

Anne with an E,"Ugh, why?! I've really enjoyed this current adaptation of Anne. The actress playing her has her ethereal nature down to a T. And the cinematography has been brilliant. There is a ton of rich material for several more seasons..."
Anne with an E,"What a shame, really enjoyed this show, very easy to watch, positive and the main character is so charming"
Anne with an E,[deleted]
Anne with an E,I believe it had to do with the fact that contracts are up by season 3 and most of the young casr turned 18 so that means more money but it being season 4 it would mean even more money.
Anne with an E,"I really loved the dark/honest about trauma direction that the show had taken, I hope it comes back maybe when the actress is a bit older. I really like her as Anne."
Anne with an E,"i'm in the depths of despair.

how can i call this a good night when i know this must be the very worst night i've ever had.

i'll miss you anne.

i am so sad to see you go, and yet so happy that I know you."
Anne with an E,"I was really excited when the show first premiered, but I think it went to far astray from the source material.  

I get that in reality, a orphan in 1900 likely has some PTSD, but the book version of Anne of Green Gables is a phenomenally sunny and resilient person.  The tv show changed that too much for me to enjoy it."
Anne with an E,Twitter Stan’s could be heard screaming from miles away
Anne with an E,"Nooooo
I love this show. I've never read the book or watched any other adaptations so this was my first experience with Anne. I'm so gutted."
Anne with an E,"Netflix cancelling something after three seasons? Shocked pikachu face. 

*cries in Santa Clarita Diet*"
Anne with an E,"Was really hoping for one more season at least :(


EDIT: #renewannewithane is trending worldwide on twitter!"
Anne with an E,I wonder why CBC cancelled it.
Anne with an E,Annee with an Ee to Eend With seeason threee
Anne with an E,"I love this show so much.  It might be my favorite thing I've ever watched.  No other show can get me laughing and crying with every single episode.  I saw the #renewannewithane hashtag has over a million retweets so far, maybe the CBC will dig their heads out of their asses and realize they are cancelling an instant classic that can make them lots if money long-term."
Anne with an E,"This show really seemed like it had a couple more good, interesting seasons left in it. Rack up another highly disappointing cancellation for Netflix."
Anne with an E,"I enjoyed the 1st season but the 2nd was near impossible to watch. Between the shoehorned characters, on the nose writing and inconsistent tone made me not want to watch season 3. I love the casting but so much went wrong after season 1."
Anne with an E,"After the minor fight it took to even get it renewed for Season 3, I was expecting this. However, I’m surprised that Netflix didn’t even let it go up on the service and figure out the viewership numbers before cancelling it. Not really fair to the fans if they didn’t even get to show their support."
Anne with an E,the season 3 curse smh
Anne with an E,"As upset as fans could be about this, the fact that the title of the show rhymes with being cancelled at season three is a point in Netflix’s favor for cancelling this show."
Anne with an E,Lmfao CBC cranks out Anne of Green Gables adaptations all the time. Who cares
Anne with an E,"Well I can't say I didn't see this coming. Combined with the end of the  Netflix collaboration, expecting a TV show to GAIN viewers after a stellar 1st season, and a lackluster beginning to the 2nd season is just plain foolish. 

They just strayed too far from cannon. Gilbert on a tradeship? Hardly. Running a farm too? And Matthew, he's *suppose* to die. I guess they pushed his inevitable end further and further back because his character is so popular, but in doing so they've relegated Anne to slowly slowly grow up. There are 6 Anne books, plus two more about her kids, and the show hadn't even gotten to the 3rd book yet. 

If this were produced by a UK house, they would have pushed through with a vision to finish, instead of meandering on new story lines and new characters."
Anne with an E,[deleted]
Anne with an E,"If Netflix is going to make 3 season shows, then *fucking make 3 season shows*.  Don't make per-season renewals then fucking can them all at 3 because of cost, teasing us like we are idiots who don't see what you are doing."
Anne with an E,This show exists?
Anne with an E,"Why: [https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/cbc-will-no-longer-work-with-netflix-to-produce-shows-says-catherine-tait](https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/cbc-will-no-longer-work-with-netflix-to-produce-shows-says-catherine-tait)

Not really anything to do with the show itself, which makes it all the more frustrating."
Anne with an E,Not many shows make it to a 4th season on Netflix.
Anne with an E,Because Netflix and 3 seasons. It's a thing. Search it on this subreddit or maybe Google it.
Anne with an E,"There's a campaign to save the show! Some fans paid for a billboard in Toronto, where the show runners may see it.  https://www.freshdaily.ca/culture/2020/01/anne-with-an-e-billboards/"
Anne with an E,"It kind of ends like Poldark, open for a future return."
Anne with an E,"This isn't true, about more money because they are 18. Their contracts would have been negotiated with their parents, and now them but it would be the same increase you would see season to season on any other show. If anything it becomes cheaper because they don't have restrictions on how long they can shoot with an Actor over 18."
Anne with an E,"I hear this said a lot but Anne With an E is positive and beautiful and wonderful.  It rarely touches on her past trauma and when it does, it's it brief flashes and it's never anything serious.  It is definitely oriented towards positive things like the importance of family."
Anne with an E,">I think it went to far astray from the source material.

You're not alone, [that was brought up often in critical reviews. ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5421602/reviews?sort=helpfulnessScore&dir=desc&ratingFilter=1)

I'm not familiar with the source material but I bailed on it after season 1, looks like many did."
Anne with an E,Pretty Sure CBC cancelled it.  But if we are gonna pile on Netflix then we are gonna pile on Netflix
Anne with an E,It's a cbc show
Anne with an E,Travelers...
Anne with an E,CBC*
Anne with an E,"A couple of Anne mini-series in the 80s (300 minutes in total) and there was Road to Avonlea in the 90s but that wasn't about Anne. ""All the time""?"
Anne with an E,"It's not netflix but cbc, but go ahead and hop on that fuck netflix bandwagon"
Anne with an E,"Cbc, not Netflix"
Anne with an E,"It's such a dumb reason.  Canadian production comapanies were finally exporting some good stuff actually set in Canada and not just producing something filmed in Toronto/Vancouver while pretending to be in New York.  I'm sure these productions created tons of opportunities for Canadian actors, writers, and directors but they want to stop doing them so they can prop up Canadian streaming services like the shitfest that is Crave TV?  A streaming service owned by one of the countries largest telecoms, they totally need that support from the CBC."
Anne with an E,"CBC ended the collabration. 

You should read other comments once in a while: 

https://business.financialpost.com/telecom/media/cbc-will-no-longer-work-with-netflix-to-produce-shows-says-catherine-tait"
Anne with an E,CBC makes it and is the one that cancelled it. Netflix is just an international distributor.
Anne with an E,"Did Anne and Gilbert's romance achieve an acceptable ending, at least?"
Anne with an E,"There is no confirmation either way. Could be both, or one of them."
Anne with an E,I know it's a co-production but Netflix could definitely keep it going if they wanted too.
Anne with an E,"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/will-anne-with-an-e-get-a-fourth-season-amidst-cbc-and-netflix-drama.html/

""Catherine Tate took the disagreement a step further by comparing Netflix’s influence in Canada to that of the British Empire colonizers.""  

""...she remarked that perhaps Netflix and viewers were unaware of the “damage it could do to local communities.”  

Catherine Tate needs to be fired. For one thing, Canada is part of the common wealth, we ARE the British Empire colonizers. We welcome all immigrants, yet most definitely still have the Queen on our money. 

More importantly then history, this partnership was good to show Canadian culture to the world. What does she really want? A show about a gas station on a small corner in Saskatchewan?"
Anne with an E,"Nope, it's a co-production between CBC and Netflix. Netflix has way more money than CBC and 100% could have continued if they wanted to."
Anne with an E,Yes. It absolutely did.
Anne with an E,Yes
Anne with an E,"Well.  Netflix wasn't the production company and CBC was.   If Netflix didn't want to keep it going CBC could have just gone to another international distributor.


So yeah.  Id say it was CBC."
Anne with an E,"CBC was/is the primary rights owner and the production company, Netflix can keep it going, but I doubt the amount of money needed to spend to keep this show going is worth it."
Anne with an E,So Gilbert is dead? Good.
Anne with an E,It's a Netflix/CBC Co-production. Both put in money to produce it. It's a Netflix original outside of Canada
Anne with an E,"Netflix would retain the rights to the previous seasons, so finding another international distributor would be tricky."
Anne with an E,"Yes you’d say so but there’s still no confirmation whatsoever. Netflix is more than an international distributor, they co-produced the show -as in, spent money to make it and not just to buy the distribution rights. They’re co owners of the show. 

I am not saying it’s netflix for sure. Just that we don’t know. Personally I think it’s both. The show has a big budget, the grand majority of its cast became adults so they’d have to be paid accordingly -and that’s a pretty huge difference-. Etc etc. (And it’s worth mentioning Netflix announced it first). 

People are simply trying to blame either Netflix or CBC, either because “Netflix curse! There’s a chance with CBC!” or because they believe CBC is the only one who could make the decision.  Facts seem to be overrated."
Anne with an E,"Also Sullivan Entertainment probably played a part as well, I think they own certain rights to the story and sued for it."
Anne with an E,👀👀👀
Anne with an E,"Honestly, I’m a fan of the show, but if there’s all these issues around it, cancellation might be the best move from a business standpoint."
Anne with an E,"YES. VERY GOOD. The young actors are all very talented, and the show does a great job of basically having Anne be a Modern Woman while still dealing with the reality that it's the late 19th century.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll bop to the theme song.

I've never read the books, but I know there's some changes, but from what I've read, I think the changes work totally fine. No spoilers, but they added some black characters and some Indigenous ones, but in a way that doesn't feel unrealistic and Woke. The ending is mostly satisfying - there definitely needs to be a fourth season, but you won't feel agonizingly frustrated by where season 3 ends.

It's very good, I recommend it."
Anne with an E,"I'm not exactly the demo for this show and I didn't care for it all that much, but the girl in this show should have won every award, just for remembering all her lines.  She talks so much. I was amazed."
Anne with an E,"The pilot had me crying, and I never crying watching TV."
Anne with an E,"My fiance watched the whole thing recently, was a fan of the original movies they made back in the day, and felt this new adaption was very well done. Just popping in and seeing things sometimes I'll say the main character is VERY melodramatic, but I think that's part of the shows charm :P"
Anne with an E,"I loved it, but some dyed-in-the-wool LM Montgomery or Kevin Sullivan fans had issues with its tone and introduction of elements that are more about modern-day sensibilities rather than the books.

I'm a massive fan of both the books and the Kevin Sullivan stuff, and I adored the new Moira Walley-Beckett take, but it's very different.

If you're coming to it clean, without any LMM-set expectations, or love of the 1985 Kevin Sullivan *Anne of Green Gables / Anne of Avonlea* miniseries, you'll probably be fine."
Anne with an E,"Loved it! I watch a lot of period dramas, and usually I don’t watch show with kids as leads... but tried this one and wow, awesome. It’s sometimes wholesome, sometimes tragic. The show was canceled a bit soon. Most storylines are resolved but some aren’t."
Anne with an E,Just finished it. Amazing show. Definitely one of the best things I've ever watched.
Anne with an E,"My wife loved it. She was a huge fan of the book/s? when she was a kid.

It isn't my type of content but it seemed well made."
Anne with an E,"I thought it was excellent. Really annoyed they cancelled it.

GF loved it too."
Anne with an E,It's great! Too bad it was canceled
Anne with an E,Everyone I know who actually likes Anne of Green Gables does not like it. The show is very “gritty reboot” and Anne has PTSD. I can’t cope with it. I’ll watch the Megan Follows version thank you.
Anne with an E,"If you're a superfan of the older series you might not like it - it definitely received some negative attention when it aired for being too different and too ""modern"" which I can understand.

But it's honestly visually gorgeous and overall really enjoyable. I'd say it's well worth a watch. The girl who plays Anne is incredible. It can also be quite dark though, so keep that in mind."
Anne with an E,One of the best I have seen in a long time plus my 9 year old could watch it. We are so bummed it isn't continuing and keep hoping it will get pick up again.
Anne with an E,"Yes very good. Nice family show that will shock you with how intense the drama can get throughout.

Also despite being cancelled  (which was a ridiculous decision as the show is unique) it does end on a suitable note."
Anne with an E,very well made and great acting from everyone
Anne with an E,"I agree. Very watchable and interesting historically. And I'm an older male, not the target."
Anne with an E,I love the pace of the show. They don't drag the storylines foreveeeeer.
Anne with an E,"That girl has 10 monologues per episode /s 

Seriously, I don't know how she does it"
Anne with an E,"Also, ultra-frustrating that it got cancelled [due to politics](https://financialpost.com/telecom/media/cbc-will-no-longer-work-with-netflix-to-produce-shows-says-catherine-tait), not ratings, the creative team, or any of the usual reasons."
Anne with an E,"Count me as someone who loves LMM's ouevre. and still loves the new show.  So, not *everyone* you know.

I do agree it's not for every LMM lover, especially if part of the reason you love the books is a sense of idyllic innocence. But. For me, nearly everything they do (at least in the first season) is supported or inspired by the text.  YMMV. 

I had a friend who hates the Netflix show and claims to be a massive LMM fan, who complained about how they made up Katie, Anne's mirror-friend, out of whole cloth. And I had to dig up the page numbers in *AoGG* to show her they didn't.  So it could also be a matter of having a slightly more open mind about the text.

Also, there's RH Thompson and Geraldine James. Both of whom are amazing as Matthew and Marilla. I **never** thought I'd ever see a Marilla as good as Colleen Dewhurst's, but I honestly think I love James's Marilla a little bit more.  Then again, I love British TV, and have seen her turning out amazing performances for decades.

Coincidentally, the first time I ever saw RH Thompson was as Jasper Dale in Kevin Sullivan's follow-up tv series to the three *Anne* miniseries with Megan Follows: [*\[Road to\] Avonlea*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrV6-9p8mWA).  You may want to find this if you haven't seen it. It stars a very young Sarah Polley (showrunner of *Alias Grace* these days), as The Story Girl."
Anne with an E,"Every opening scene of each season is just so beautiful to watch ! In Season 2, Anne with that butterfly in a field and Season 3 with Anne in the snow riding a horse ! Just wow !"
Anne with an E,"Ok, fair — but I didn’t know you until just now. I’ll adjust to “many” instead of all LMM fans.

I have nothing against the actors — my discomfort is entirely with what I feel to be the darkness of the show.

I watched Road to Avonlea and Emily of New moon. I liked them a lot."
Anne with an E,The actress on this is stunning. Really a talent to watch.
Anne with an E,I feel like more people would watch this if they know the creator and showrunner was the Breaking Bad writer who wrote “Ozymandias”
Anne with an E,Anyone have any idea when season 3 will be on Netflix?
Anne with an E,I love this show! I wasn't familiar with the source material so this is my first time following the Anne story but I've been excited to see more. Anne and Gilbert are so fun to watch.
Anne with an E,"Amybeth McNulty is a far better Anne than Megan Follows ever was.  Sorry, fellow Canadians, I said it!"
Anne with an E,This is a great family show. It's light hearted but dramatic when it wants to be.
Anne with an E,"I haven't seen this, but heard about it. Its supposed to be darker than the source material. Is that a good or bad thing?"
Anne with an E,Really an excellent show
Anne with an E,There's a campaign to save the show! https://www.freshdaily.ca/culture/2020/01/anne-with-an-e-billboards/
Anne with an E,But what if her birth parents are degens from upcountry?
Anne with an E,"This show went so far off the rails in Season 2. Wow. I completely enjoyed the first season, but it totally lost all charm."
Anne with an E,Tried to watch it. Just way too light hearted for me. If it got more serious about stuff then yeah I’d watch it again.
Anne with an E,Agreed. I think the show is underrated as well.
Anne with an E,i mean shes looks like the literal definition of 'red headed step-child' but ok
Anne with an E,Good point.
Anne with an E,"They haven't announced anything yet, but if I had to guess, it wouldn't be until after it finishes airing weekly on CBC. There are 10 episodes, so the final episode should air on CBC November 24, and the Netflix release should be sometime soon after that."
Anne with an E,Completely agree.
Anne with an E,"In my opinion it is a very good thing. It is worth thinking of the series as more of a re-imagining than a straight adaptation, and it is called Anne With An E and not Anne of Green Gables for a reason.  It does change/add many story points and new characters, and while not everything works, what does work is absolutely beautiful and emotional. There has been so much depth added to all of the characters, and everyone feels more fleshed out. The acting is fantastic, and the production, costuming, and cinematography are stunning. The darker element mostly takes it's form in showing the effects various character's pasts have had on them mentally and emotionally. Despite all of these new elements, I still think that the both the characters and story remain true to the message of the books. It also feels very Canadian, which I love, and certain characters and locations that are not from the books have created a richer and more authentic portrayal of Canada. I love it, but definitely go in with an open mind if you are a fan of the books and particularly the Megan Follows films."
Anne with an E,Good.
Anne with an E,It does seem that we are spending a lot of time dealing with degens from upcountry.
Queen of the South,"*It leaves The Sinner, which was renewed for a fourth season last summer, as USA Network’s only current scripted series as part of the network’s move away from ongoing scripted series towards more live and unscripted programming and “eventized” scripted projects such as anthology series.*

Cable is pretty much out of the scripted game at this point. The only networks still trying at all (HBO, Showtime, Starz, AMC, FX) all have streaming services they are interested in pushing and that seems to be giving them some extra life for the time being. 

I’ll miss USA Network as back in its heyday it made some fun TV shows."
Queen of the South,"I love Queen of The South,but i guess 5 seasons is enough for them to tell the whole story. Hope It will be good."
Queen of the South,I need more Teresita and Pote. Hurry up!
Queen of the South,"I watched Narcos and El Chapo ... this worth watching?

I'm a big fan of the lead actress who I know from City of God and Predators (underrated film btw IMO).

I think the character is from Narcos Mexico, right?"
Queen of the South,I wish shooter got a proper ending.
Queen of the South,">Wednesday, April 7, 10 episodes

Btw"
Queen of the South,NOT ENOUGH SEASONS.
Queen of the South,Cool. That's enough. It's a quiet favourite of mine but all good things must end.
Queen of the South,"USA is owned by NBC, it’s eventually just going to be Peacock originals"
Queen of the South,"Wow, that is a shame. It's been many years since I had cable or watched USA shows but back in the day we got Monk, Psych, Suits, White Collar, and more from this network. A shame, but TV has never had better and more variety of content than now."
Queen of the South,"USA will have Raw on Monday, NXT is moving to Tuesday, NHL is moving from NBCSN to USA on Wednesday next season and Chrisley Knows Best on Thursday. They don’t have a lot of room on their schedule for scripted shows."
Queen of the South,"USA will have Raw on Monday, NXT is moving to Tuesday, NHL is moving from NBCSN to USA on Wednesday next season and Chrisley Knows Best on Thursday. They don’t have a lot of room on their schedule for scripted shows."
Queen of the South,Watch the Mexican (original) version with Kate del Castillo. You won’t regret it.
Queen of the South,Hopefully the Peacock Originals will fill the void left by the departure of NBCU’s cable channels like USA and SyFy but we are definitely not at this stage yet. Right now the volume on Peacock is terrible and the output feels like stuff that was originally intended for NBC but was not deemed good enough so got booted to Peacock as a last chance.
Queen of the South,They said they wanted to lean more into sports.
Queen of the South,Agreed
Queen of the South,"She gets killed off in the first episode and everything happening after is what leads up to that. I just hope that when it happens, that it, end scene, shows over.

I don't want to see them have some sort of prologue which ends up retconning that aspect of the show."
Queen of the South,"I really like Queen of The South too,very good show.. even tho i have to say that the first three seasons were by far the best ones.
And yes,i definitely do not expect a happy ending this season.. i hope at least Kelly Anne survives tho,since i fear Pote may die as well."
Queen of the South,Watch the original la reina del Sur is  explosive
Queen of the South,"> She gets killed off in the first episode 

I remember *white dress* T. in the first ep however I don't recall her getting her just dues from season 1 episode 1. I have always thought however as the series progressed that white dress T from the beginning of the show may not necessarily be future T ie. Season 5 T which would be exactly if I understand you correctly what you don't want to have happen. Let's see how they handle it."
Queen of the South,"> Watch the original la reina del Sur is explosive

Just looked it up at IMDB and then went online to check the library and they have it. Mocking me in bold letters however, ""This DVD does not have subtitles."" 

Interesting on IMDB S1 ran in 2011 and then the show came back in 2019 and 2020."
Queen of the South,"Oh right sorry , I'm multilingual  I didn't stop to think language might be a barrier . 

Although I watched it on  Netflix and there is English subtitles as option if needed . Either way it's a great story so most important is you see a version.  I'm just a big fan of kate del Castillo."
Queen of the South,"> Oh right sorry

No need to feel sorry. Silly American can only speak English : ) Do you know the story behind why season 1 aired in 2011 and then was not revived for season 2 until 2019? TIA."
Queen of the South,I know a lot of Americans who speak at least 2 languages especially Spanish.  I'm French many here are abysmal with English as it is .  I am sorry if you thought I was being snarky . I was responding to what you said you saw on IMDB then I remembered that English subtitles were an option .
Queen of the South,">I am sorry if you thought I was being snarky 

Not at all! I was making fun of myself for only being able to speak one language. I am envious and admire anyone who is able to speak any language other then their native tongue. My apologies to you if you thought otherwise."
Queen of the South,👍🤗 alright then seems we both fell pray to online discourse recurrent flaw failure to translate tone of comments .
Queen of the South,This show must be cheap to make or does well in other markets because no one I know watches this show.
Queen of the South,Is this show worth watching? I like a lot of gang shows but I hated Sons of Anarchy and Mayans B.C. I see like a million ads for this whenever I watch wrestling and I always think about checking it out.
Queen of the South,👏👏👏
Queen of the South,"https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/queen-of-the-south-season-four-ratings/

Does a lot better than I thought it was."
Queen of the South,"'La Reina del Sur' was pretty big on Spanish language TV, so it probably got a lot of interest from that demographic."
Queen of the South,"It's alright, like maybe a 6/10 show. It's worth watching if there's not really anything else for you to watch"
Queen of the South,"I am a faithful watcher, I believe it is one of the better shows on TV. First couple seasons  were good, then it took off and became a really good show."
Queen of the South,"I don't feel like it's either one of those shows. 
It hooked me from the first episode and I'm glad to see it was renewed!"
Queen of the South,Awesome. Nothing frustrates me more than when a show is good for a few seasons and then totally nosedives near the end. I'll definitely check it out!
Queen of the South,Title is corrupted.
Queen of the South,"I haven't started it or heard much. What would you say are the ""Recommended If You Like..."" comparisons?"
Queen of the South,">It's not very ambitions or groundbreaking or anything




You answered your own question"
Queen of the South,"I was in a bar with all my hispanic friends a couple of years back and they were playing the original show - La Reina del Sur - on the bar's TV and even though it was on mute the scene was so intense and weird that I just sat there and watched the entire episode.  It's a great show, as is the remake."
Queen of the South,Punched out halfway through the first season.  It just never grabbed me.
Queen of the South,"It used to be decent but now that the Vargas plots are over it's gone stale. Every episode of late is getting repetitive, they're all something bad happens then Teresa and co struggle to sort it out."
Queen of the South,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/queenofthesouth/](https://www.reddit.com/r/queenofthesouth/)

Many series have their own subreddit."
Queen of the South,It's sort of like... cable TV Peaky Blinders meets narcos
Queen of the South,"Lol, that doesn't mean it's not entertaining!"
Queen of the South,I'll have to check out the original!
Queen of the South,Vargas was a highlight for sure
Queen of the South,"I really liked Narcos, haven't started Peaky Blinders. I'll add this show to the watchlist then."
Queen of the South,"I just finished watching the first season of the Original show. The story is ten times better than the remake. Teresa is NOT a pushover in the original like she is in the remake. Teresa starts out as a total victim but once she starts gaining power, she starts ordering the assassination of multiple people who betrayed or tried to kill her. 

Teresa in the original wouldnt have let someone like Camilla live like the stupid remake did at the end of s2. she would have had both of the Varges clan executed right then and there. Shes also way better looking in the original than the remake and made more sense why dudes would be all over her. The original made me realize just how stupid the remake actually is in comparison. Only good thing the remake had was the Teresa/Camilla dynamic but after watching the original, it made me realize that that whole dynamic wasnt even necessary."
Queen of the South,"I stopped watching after Teresa let Camilla live after she betrayed her twice at the end of season 2. She has the varges couple cornered and she addresses them in the most non badass fashion ive ever seen. It was the stupidest shit i ever saw on TV. After watching the Original spanish queen of the south, the story and characters are all WAY better than the remake. Teresa from the original show would have never allowed someone who betrayed her go without punishment like the one in the remake. In the original spanish show, she has a lot of enemies who betrayed her and tried to kill her but the only one she ever spared was Pote who became an ally later. The original pote is also a better character and his side switch made more sense in the original than the remake. Teresa in the original also orders the deaths of multiple people unlike the remake which constantly tries to make her some saint drug dealer."
Queen of the South,">...haven't started Peaky Blinders. 

👀"
Queen of the South,"I just binged the first 3 seasons on Netflix last month, and I'm watching the current one weekly. The first three seasons were pretty amazing, but the show is losing me this season. I can't really talk about why without spoiling a lot, but let me just say that the show is (understandably) very, very different than how it was for the first three years, but it just doesn't feel like the same show I fell in love with. The stakes feel so low and it feels more like a generic crime show than the unique thrill ride it was for the first 3 years. But there's only 3 episodes so far so I'm gonna keep watching, and I would definitely still recommend it to anyone who loves crime/action/thriller shows. Even considering the dip in the current season, it's still an entertaining show that has me invested enough to keep tuning in every week even if I'm quite disappointed with the direction it's taking.

The first three seasons though is a non-stop thrill ride that has you on the edge of your seat nearly every second of every episode. Definitely very enthralling from the series premiere to the season 3 finale."
Queen of the South,I was interested in it knowing Snow That Product was in season 1.
Queen of the South,I've heard it's a bit like La Reina del Sur.
Queen of the South,"Agreed with your comment about the previous seasons.

I think due to the closure of that arc, she really doesn't have a credible antagonist.  This seasons, she is just being toyed by every which way.  She has considerable means and power, she should be using it.  I guess i just gotten used to how Narcos does it's thing. 

She has to let Pote loose and bury some bodies."
Queen of the South,"Its an American version of La Reina del Sur, but with a Brazilian acting in Kate's role."
Queen of the South,;)
Queen of the South,"It's better than expected. A bit confusing that they keep switching from Spanish to English even though they are supposed to be speaking Spanish the whole time. 

I will definitely keep this in my watch list. I hope they keep the momentum and pace of the pilot. "
Queen of the South,"Anyone know the song they had in the trailer? The one that went ""I'm in beast mode""? "
Queen of the South,"The discussion thread in /r/QueenOfTheSouth is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/queenofthesouth/comments/4pn4zg/series_premiere_s01e01_piloto_discussion_thread/). It's a new subreddit; hopefully people can come and make it more active :)

I was not really a fan of that premiere. The plot moved way too fast for any character to get any real development (except maybe Teresa, though even she didn't get much characterization beyond ""secretly a badass for no apparent reason""). It was often not clear why Teresa or any other character was doing what they were doing. As such, I was not very interested in what was going on.

There was also quite a bit of untranslated Spanish; even though Teresa presumably understood it, most viewers - including me - probably didn't.

Also, [this review](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/06/queen-of-the-south-review-season-1-usa-not-mr-robot-1201691574/) nails my thoughts on that rape scene (and on the show in general):

> More to the point, much of the desired feminist kick is deadened by some predictably ugly attempts to be “dark.” Rape is used far too casually to court the desired effect — “We dare you to look away,” to which I say, “OK” — and the stark gore that explodes midway through feels too nasty after near-constant on-the-nose narration. Plus, it’s hard to empathize with a subject whose most identifiable characteristic is claiming to be the source of our “weed for our stupid weekend dinner parties.”

All in all, not the greatest start to the show. I guess we'll see if it gets better now that the necessary setup to the plot is mostly done."
Queen of the South,"Worth the watch? Aside from Mr. Robot, I have not liked any USA show."
Queen of the South,Interesting so far.  I watch next week see where it goes from here.
Queen of the South,So she just abandoned the others?
Queen of the South,Seems to me she should keep that book
Queen of the South,Is this a remake to the spanish series?
Queen of the South,I thought the writing was good and the pilot was better than I expected.  I hope the lead actress grows on me. I plan to keep going and watch another episode. 
Queen of the South,"It wasn't bad, but I agree with the general sentiment that it moved WAY too fast. 

I'll give it a chance though. Something to watch on Thursdays in the summer."
Queen of the South,Slow start.  Hope it picks up.
Queen of the South,"Hey, guy, does anybody know if the episode title ""Piloto"" means ""Pilot episode"" or does it refer to Güero being an actual pilot?"
Queen of the South,Shit
Queen of the South,Nice
Queen of the South,"It's definetly more serious in tone than USA's other shows like Monk, Burn Notice, ect. and more in line with Mr. Robot when it comes to high production values and a more serious and mature themes.  I think the pilot is worth checking out for sure.  I enjoyed it and will check out where the show goes from here.  "
Queen of the South,So much happens so fast that it's almost cartoonish. There is no time to care about what is happening because the scenarios change instantly after being introduced. I watched it but longed for more depth.
Queen of the South,"Psych? Burn Notice? White Collar? Monk? Suits?

USA is fantastic "
Queen of the South,Suits is okay for the first one or two seasons - but then it becomes shitty and repetitive
Queen of the South,same.
Queen of the South,They seem to always abandon one another. 
Queen of the South,Si. 
Queen of the South,Is that a joke?  How bad is your ADD that *this* is considered a slow start?
Queen of the South,"The former (or at least, that's presumably the intent). Most shows have their first episode titled ""Pilot"", this one went with ""Piloto""."
Queen of the South,"This is what I worried about.  I enjoy good stories, the trailer progressed so fast.  I thought it seemed like a rushed action show like a Burn Notice."
Queen of the South,"White Collar was good for a season or 2, didn't care for the others.  :("
Queen of the South,Isn't the Spanish  series based on the novel?
Queen of the South,I meant the first 15 minutes.  The comment was in real time.
Queen of the South,"White Collar and Burn Notice are the same for me.

Neither are the best shows ever made, but they're both so much fun to watch. I love heists and spies, so they're both right up my alley. 

Psych is fuckin' perfection, though. 

All of these shows are some of my go-to shows for background noise. I've watched them all so many times, that I just need to have them playing in the background while I read or play games or whatever, and I'll still be able to know exactly what's happening."
Queen of the South,Si.

Queen of the South,"Please, USA, let this show be so good that it brings your network back to the glory days of Burn Notice, White Collar, and Monk--but then takes you to a whole new level of cutting-edge shows."
Queen of the South,"I got an [advanced screening of the first episode](https://ooh.li/a772ca0), and let me tell you, it's pretty dope! The action is non-stop (it literally starts 15 seconds into the episode), and it never slows down.

Is it worth watching?"
Spirit Riding Free,"As someone who absolutely loves the original movie, I have very mixed feelings about this after watching the trailer. The animation seems... not that good.  
  
And considering the original story was at its about freedom and sort of showed the ""taming"" of the wild west in a critical light, it seems a bit odd to me that this show seems to reduce the theme to ""city girl has to live in the country""."
Spirit Riding Free,Kill it with fire
Spirit Riding Free,Here they go again ruining a classic with a sequel
Spirit Riding Free,Yes but will it have Matt Damon?
Spirit Riding Free,It's actually pretty good imo
Spirit Riding Free,Nothing will be able to reduce my enjoyment of the original movie or its soundtrack. 
Spirit Riding Free,Unfortunately it will not. Nor Bryan Adams afaik.
Spirit Riding Free,"I've also watched it in the meantime! It's not too bad, but the animations are incredibly clunky."
Spirit Riding Free,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

Spirit Riding Free,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Spirit Riding Free,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Spirit Riding Free,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Spirit Riding Free,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Spirit Riding Free,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Spirit Riding Free,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Spirit Riding Free,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Spirit Riding Free,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Spirit Riding Free,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Spirit Riding Free,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Spirit Riding Free,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Spirit Riding Free,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Spirit Riding Free,🙂💕
Spirit Riding Free,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Spirit Riding Free,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Spirit Riding Free,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Spirit Riding Free,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Spirit Riding Free,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Spirit Riding Free,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Spirit Riding Free,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Spirit Riding Free,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Spirit Riding Free,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Spirit Riding Free,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Spirit Riding Free,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Spirit Riding Free,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Spirit Riding Free,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Spirit Riding Free,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.
Spirit Riding Free,"Lilyhammer, one of the first! Also personal fan of Hemlock grove"
Spirit Riding Free,"My top 10

- 1st Dark

- 2nd Russian Doll

- 3rd The Queen's Gambit

- 4th Narcos

- 5th Stranger Things

- 6th Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (BBC America coproduction)

- 7th The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window

- 8th Sense8

- 9th Unorthodox

- 10th Black Mirror (S1-S2 are from Channel 4, S3-S5 are Netflix Original)

My watchlist (what I'm going to watch next): Ozark, Inside Job, Godless."
Spirit Riding Free,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Spirit Riding Free,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Spirit Riding Free,Iweather you have or have not watched bojack I urge you to reconsider
Spirit Riding Free,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Spirit Riding Free,Dark should be top this list
Spirit Riding Free,"There are a lot more Netflix originals that I really like that unfortunately didn't make the list: Unorthodox, Mindhunter, The Queen's Gambit, Quicksand (Störst av allt), Unbelievable, Altered Carbon, Sintonia, Bridgerton, Easy etc.  
  
Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.  
  
*But anyways, since this is a pm\_me\_reason\_to\_livx list, ya kno what I gotta do....*

Here are my specific praises for shows on this list:  
  
**Best concept** — Sense8 \[runner-up: - Squid Game\]  
  
**Best storytelling** — D.P. \[runner-up: - Desenfrenadas\]  
  
**Best performance** — Jharrel Jerome (When They See Us) \[runner-up: Tessa Ia (Desenfrenadas)\]

Spirit Riding Free,OITNB is great. I watched the first 4 seasons.
Spirit Riding Free,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free,I see you haven’t watched bojack horseman in my opinion that is the best Netflix original
Spirit Riding Free,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Spirit Riding Free,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Spirit Riding Free,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Spirit Riding Free,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend “the last kingdom” one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show “russian doll” had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it’s 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Spirit Riding Free,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Spirit Riding Free,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Spirit Riding Free,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Spirit Riding Free,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Spirit Riding Free,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Spirit Riding Free,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I’ve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.
Spirit Riding Free,It's the reason why I haven't given it a rewatch yet. I just can't bare all that pain again.
Spirit Riding Free,Ah feel ya. *But Desenfrenadas tho*.
Spirit Riding Free,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free,"You know, 100+ Netflix series yet I've never actually seen House of Cards. lol. I must acknowledge it though because it's one of the most popular Netflix OGs. But personally, politics? Big *naaaaaaah* for me."
Spirit Riding Free,Because it's bad
Spirit Riding Free,I've watched Bojack Horseman.
Spirit Riding Free,"*I don't know what they want from me, it's like... the more money we come across, the more problems we seeeeee!*"
Spirit Riding Free,"lol, this comment. check some out tho."
Spirit Riding Free,"One of the first chopping block regrets, but not the last"
Spirit Riding Free,Between and Cobra Kai are Netflix originals. Helix is a cancelled Syfy series.
Spirit Riding Free,I never plan to rewatch it. Ain't going through that again.
Spirit Riding Free,"Yea I've seen Marco Polo. The closest thing to it I guess is Kingdom. Vikings Vanhalla is close to that time period as well, but I think it's *where* Marco Polo is set that makes it unique and not *when*."
Spirit Riding Free,Man the first season is peak television
Spirit Riding Free,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Spirit Riding Free,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Spirit Riding Free,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Spirit Riding Free,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Spirit Riding Free,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Spirit Riding Free,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Spirit Riding Free,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
Spirit Riding Free,"One of my favorite moment watching this series for the first time is when Iroh dives into Zhao and the 4 other soldiers. The instant take down of all 4 and the look on Zhao's face when he realizes just how outmatched he is was amazing. On top of that, as an audience learning that Iroh isn't just wiser than he looks, but also one of the best firebenders in the world was amazing. 

Avatar does these ""power reveals"" real well. In book 3, there is an episode where Katara blood-bends the man she thought killed her mom and Zuko sees it for the first time. The quick look on Zuko's face said so much. ""How is she doing this?"", ""How long has she been able to do this?"", ""Could she do this the whole time, and was going easy on me?""."
Spirit Riding Free,"What I loved about the series was the small scenes where you could really see that Iroh was far more powerful and capable than any of his peers. In the second season my personal favorite is the ""Dragon of the West"" scene where he just clears an entire room using his love of tea, and then when you get to season 4 and see him basically topple an army with his fellow white lotus members, its such a great build up. "
Spirit Riding Free,Thanks for sharing! Bob’s Burgers is my comfort show as well and it’s wonderful to know it’s helped other people through their dark moments.
Spirit Riding Free,"Art definitely matters, and I love Bobs Burgers:) most recently Everything Everywhere All At Once eased an existential crisis… it’s already a comfort movie for me now:)"
Spirit Riding Free,"Thank you for sharing a piece of your heart and your love. 

I’ve never seen Bob’s Burgers, but it has been on my list for a long while. Your title caught my attention and it gave me the push to know more. 

Regardless, whether or not I end up liking it, I’ll think about this piece you wrote for a long time, happy that it made one family be able to push forward. And for that, I’ll always appreciate this show and have a smile when it’s mentioned from here on out.

Please know you and your family are in my thoughts and prayers, if you’re open to them. 

Thank you again."
Spirit Riding Free,I teared up at this. I hope you’ll consider sharing it at r/bobsburgers as well.
Spirit Riding Free,Looking forward to the movie which comes out tomorrow.
Spirit Riding Free,"Bob is bisexual? Man, I missed an episode somewhere or this must have come out after I stopped watching."
Spirit Riding Free,Bob’s Burgers is a gem of a show! I was hooked from day one…it’s very positive.
Spirit Riding Free,"If you’re not real, then how can I feel this way? lil babies 😃"
Spirit Riding Free,My emotions! I'm also super bummed that the movie got pulled in my country. Gonna have to wait a while.
Spirit Riding Free,This show is really a diamond in a bag full of nails. Hard for some people to get used to show and I'm glad I was able to give it a shot recently. Going thru something right now and this show has helped with my anxiety. This show really gets me lost in its small beach town.
Spirit Riding Free,"Give it a shot, you won’t regret it!"
Spirit Riding Free,"I remember when the series first came out. Me and my siblings watched the premiere and it didn't click with us. We didn't have cabel just good old antenna, so we were big fans of Fox's Animation Domination on Sundays. 

The youngest sibling kept watching the show throughout the years so I would see snitpest here and then for years and years. It wasn't until like this past year I started watching and i gotta admit.... this show is pretty funny. It grew on me. Went from background noise to watching while on my phone to my eyes only being stuck to the screen. Season 1 is a tad slow, season 2 a better increase and season 3 just kicks it up like 100x."
Spirit Riding Free,"It's not super explicit or anything, and people might be reading into it too much. But there have been individual moments over the series where they make it seem like Bob might be interested in guys if he wasn't married to Linda. 

The best one I can think of is the Thanksgiving episode where Bob keeps buying turkeys, and they keep mysteriously ending up in the toilet. Every time he goes back to the store to buy a new one, he sees the same deli employee, a gay man who thinks that Bob is flirting with him. Towards the end of the episode the deli guy is finally like ""okay okay I'll go out with you."" Bob gets flustered and says that he's ""straight ... well mostly straight."" As Bob is leaving, still flustered, he says the deli guy is out of his league but ... Bob will call him."
Spirit Riding Free,Since season 4 it’s been implied
Spirit Riding Free,[S04e05](https://youtu.be/4A4-4-ZOOmk)
Spirit Riding Free,"Hi!

Thank you for your comment! It’s given me the final push to start it sometime today.

I hope you’re doing well and I hope you have a great rest of your day!"
Servant of the People,I feel like im living a Black Mirror episode with this.
Servant of the People,In the US.
Servant of the People,2022 is so goddamn weird already
Servant of the People,What struck me was how beautiful Ukraine is in the show. All we see on the news is dreary winter war footage. It’s devastating to see how they are destroying this beautiful city and country.
Servant of the People,I'm confused. The internet says there are 3 seasons but I only see season 1 on Netflix. Anyone know what's up?
Servant of the People,"I understand the spike in interest but it's a pretty lighthearted comedy. For me it feels really off to watch hijinks ensuing and know that the lead actor might literally die ""playing"" this same role in real life before you've finished the show"
Servant of the People,"The president of Ukraine, who just adressed the US Congress, is now available on Netflix playing a comedic version of himself that led to his dancing with the stars fame and voicing Paddington Bear and eventually to his election as the actual president at which point the US president tried to extort him when he requested military aid and is now begging the world to stop the murderous despot massacring his people? I think our reality may have folded in on itself..."
Servant of the People,"no one has said it yet so I will: go watch “Winter on Fire: Ukraine's Fight for Freedom” instead. It is a 2015 documentary film about the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 to 23 February 2014, and provides a small amount of context to what is taking place today."
Servant of the People,And they should donate all proceeds to Ukraine
Servant of the People,Corporations: never let a good crisis go to waste
Servant of the People,"They should re-open Netflix for Russia, and have this be the only content."
Servant of the People,"I’d really recommend watching some if you want to understand Zelensky. 

Because I wasn’t really aware of him before the transcript of the Trump conversation, my first impression was of someone a bit clueless and in over his head. Seeing a few clips of the show made it clear how he can deliberately create and use that assumption.   It helps explain the gap between what we’ve seen since the war started and what western media expected of him before. 

And in retrospect, it’s increasingly hilarious that he out-confused Trump on that call with his near Borat level act about ‘I tell Angela Merkel you are best leader, Ukraine is US best friend and wants to buy many weapons, haha blackmail joke, Trump is friend!’"
Servant of the People,">*Servant of the People* follows a teacher (Volodymyr Zelensky) who unexpectedly becomes president after a rant against corruption goes viral on social media. The show ran for three seasons and ended when Zelensky decided to run for president of Ukraine in 2019 under the banner of a new political party, also called Servant of the People.

>Netflix, which originally had the series as part of its US library from 2017–2021, says the show is back on the service in the US as of March 16, 2022.

>Swedish television group Eccho Rights has been licensing the show (and a film based on the series) around the world, with the U.K.’s Channel 4, MBC in the Middle East, ANT 1 in Greece, and PRO TV among the buyers.

>Zelensky also voiced the Peruvian bear in the Ukrainian versions of *Paddington* and *Paddington 2*.

I had been watching *Servant of the People* at https://youtu.be/GZ-3YwVQV0M. The English subtitles even explained some of the jokes."
Servant of the People,That Merkel scene though 😂
Servant of the People,This is a little weird? No?
Servant of the People,Yes brave and a good leader yes. But the hero worship on Reddit is just so weird
Servant of the People,"I told my husband I'd take the hit and watch the first episode to see if it was worth watching together, and yeah, it's very entertaining, I laughed loud enough to scare our kid once. Being from the future makes it weird, pretend you're still in 2015 and it's good."
Servant of the People,It's freely available on YouTube with subs anyway
Servant of the People,[removed]
Servant of the People,"Nice, I can watch my cartoons and propaganda all in one place!"
Servant of the People,Will any of the generated revenue go towards helping Ukraine?
Servant of the People,Nice cash grab
Servant of the People,The simulation seems to have been running without supervision for years now.
Servant of the People,"It actually *re*-added it, started the series during 2020, so glad it’s now finally back"
Servant of the People,"Watch ""Ukraine on Fire"""
Servant of the People,I am so happy. Subtitles on YouTube were very hit and miss. I missed a conversation with Abe Lincoln because they just disappeared
Servant of the People,The first season used to be on Netflix before they removed it. Have they added all seasons now?
Servant of the People,Cool. Gonna check it out
Servant of the People,"For French or German speakers: Last I checked, ARTE had it on their website"
Servant of the People,"I heard this was really good, cant wait to watch it"
Servant of the People,This should be the only show available in Russia!
Servant of the People,"Good, now take all the profits from that and donate it to Ukraine."
Servant of the People,Well that title is fitting.
Servant of the People,is the show good?
Servant of the People,Imagine if Netflix let Russia stream stuff on their platform but only have it this movie
Servant of the People,President of Democracy!
Servant of the People,Damn - now there’s a good reason to restart Netflix!
Servant of the People,I know what im watching when i get home
Servant of the People,[removed]
Servant of the People,Nice to see Netflix capitalising on death and war.
Servant of the People,[removed]
Servant of the People,"Oh no, I've been watching season 4 for 3 weeks now. Do I need to start from S01? It looks high budget with sponsors from many countries, but maybe not enough $$ for suits anymore. (Too early?)"
Servant of the People,Is this why Netflix just announced they're going to raise their rates? Propaganda is costly I guess.
Servant of the People,"Not sure if this is related or not to the show. But please do your independent research on Zelensky’s policies and issues while in office. I understand what he is doing now in protecting his people is noble, but there is alarming evidence to suggest that he has been one of the most corrupt presidents in the Ukrainian government for the 21st century."
Servant of the People,"The clips I've seen are pretty funny. Half way between Parks & Rec and Thick Of It, not quite as Polyanna as the former or as nihilistic and cynical as the latter."
Servant of the People,YAY no more losing the subtitles halfway through the episode
Servant of the People,This dude is man of the decade for standing up to the “Russian bear”
Servant of the People,'Wag the Dog'
Servant of the People,Excellent! I’ve been watching on YouTube. It’s really good.
Servant of the People,"oh my god, it's actually really good!"
Servant of the People,Is this war profiteering?
Servant of the People,Non stop pro Ukrainian propaganda. Really makes you question what’s going on.
Servant of the People,That didn't take long.  Maybe Elon was right
Servant of the People,This feels gross
Servant of the People,Wouldn’t be a movement without corpos finding some way to profit off it
Servant of the People,Yuck. This is fucking disgusting.
Servant of the People,This is like if we got invaded while Ronald Regan was president. The dude is an actor and knows how to capture hearts as well as minds.
Servant of the People,"The hero worship for this guy is off the charts. What is it exactly that he did to gain so much praise. Just curious. Someone explain. I know he played a president on TV before being elected, but is their anything else?"
Servant of the People,Propaganda that you pay for!
Servant of the People,"Also available in India , only the first season tho.

Ive seen the first 5 eps on YouTube , it's borderline surreal  watching Ukrainians live an ordinary life before the war"
Servant of the People,Maybe they will cast Idris Elba to play him.
Servant of the People,[deleted]
Servant of the People,Weirdest propaganda ever
Servant of the People,I will be watching for sure
Servant of the People,"I was just watching. The country is (was ) so beautiful. The TV show gives us outsiders an unnerving view of the people, the parks, the avenues, the buildings …. Before we saw them being blown up on the news. I think the  a grand bridge the actors drive over in the first episode is the bridge that was defensively blown up early in the war.
Geez life imitated art imitating life. Abraham Lincoln’s words in the 2nd episode are too too poignant."
Servant of the People,[removed]
Servant of the People,So strange
Servant of the People,Level of trolls has increased here after russia fck it up
Servant of the People,"Every single major /r is getting hit with politics, it’s almost as if they’ve found a way to follow us from network television to social media.

I hate that every single way is found to interfere in peoples lives when the people themselves find avenues to not let them. 

But why won’t the majority of people notice that’s even happening?"
Servant of the People,"So can this be labeled ""state affiliated media?"""
Servant of the People,Wow nonstop propaganda.   Every Ukrainian is awesome and every Russian is not.   Can the war drumbeat any harder?
Servant of the People,Hopefully dubbed or subtitles
Servant of the People,Of course it does
Servant of the People,Also noteworthy - Zelensky in their version of Dancing with the stars.
Servant of the People,Gotta cash in.
Servant of the People,"Then check out ""Ukraine on Fire"" produced by Oliver Stone and decide for yourself which is propaganda bullshit."
Servant of the People,As a redditor this is something I Consooooooome
Servant of the People,"Dude ever since I’ve heard about his career, I’ve been wanting to watch his show!"
Servant of the People,"Great show, was worth watching when it came out, is worth watching now."
Servant of the People,God i love the CIA
Servant of the People,"Waiting for Netflix to make a movie on this war where Ukrainian POC soldier falls in love with a transgender Russian soldier and then together with the power of love and LGBTQ+ tags in the description, stop the war in Ukraine"
Servant of the People,Jake Tran did a great video on this
Servant of the People,"Damn…I keep hearing Worf’s voice…”Great men do not seek power. They have power thrust upon them."""
Servant of the People,I feel like I’m going to watch this solely because I am not sure of what else I can do to show support for Ukraine in my position.
Servant of the People,Does this apply for Netflix Canada too?
Servant of the People,I can't wait to watch it.
Servant of the People,"It's wonderful.  Been on YT forever, btw.  I saw it on either Netflix or Prime years ago."
Servant of the People,"Dammit! Just looked it up on my Netflix, but it’s not available for my country

Netflix, of course, did the auto fill thing and then proceeded to recommend every Ukraine/war/dictatorships-related stuff"
Servant of the People,Well I know what I’m watching this weekend.
Servant of the People,Awe yell yeah. I’ve been wanting to watch this since the E.U. mistake clip
Servant of the People,How trippy is it that his real life presidency seems to have crazier storylines than anything that happened in his tv show?
Servant of the People,The current season of this show is pretty intense…
Servant of the People,This US only?
Servant of the People,Is there a such thing as ‘good propaganda’?
Servant of the People,It's on YouTube already.  It's actually pretty funny.
Servant of the People,"Watch it on Netflix. He will get paid when viewing is up. I think he needs the money, for security detail at the very least."
Servant of the People,I think its insane how were living through the most blatant propaganda in history. Its almost laughable
Servant of the People,"Netflix -”Oh this guy is trendig”

Also Netflix -”🤑”"
Servant of the People,Of course they do.
Servant of the People,Virtua signalling for the ching ching bling bling
Wendy,I wish Method Man was the one to tell her that her show was cancelled.
Wendy,She’s an absolute mess and the studio is doing their best to keep their distance
Wendy,"If I was one of those execs I'd be volunteering to tell her. Shit, I'll call her right now and tell her"
Wendy,"Isn’t this the chick that talked about how she was giving her husband a BJ when her kid walked in on them, said something idiotic to him, and then just went right back at it?"
Wendy,"""I said, 'We'd love to work with you, and there are lots of ways and lots of buyers, but you need to come back, and we need to know that you're OK,"" he continued. ""You can't just call after nine months and say, 'I'm ready.'""

Holy shit, Wendy Williams is Dirk Diggler.

EDIT - I've never hit 1k upvotes before and I can't believe it's for a fucking Wendy Williams thread."
Wendy,"Took them long enough, she should have been canceled ages ago."
Wendy,Should have called Garrett Morris. She would have got the message.
Wendy,I recently was flipping through the channels and saw the *Wendy Williams Show* being hosted by Michael Rapaport. Is that a rerun? Is he the new host? I'm very confused.
Wendy,">""[My] health is very well and I've actually had a few appointments. I'm 57 now, and I have the mind and body of a 25-year-old,""

Any 57-yr-old that thinks they have the body of a 25 yr old is definitely suffering from a mental illness."
Wendy,"This is done, Ellen is done. The age of the afternoon interview show is over, along with Cable. I feel like HBO is the only service to play with some “Late Night” type formats, curious to see where it goes from there."
Wendy,Love that clip of her ripping a massive beefer on her show
Wendy,They didn't really have to tell her several times. They just kept telling her because it was so fun to do it!
Wendy,To be honest I’m surprised she’s still alive and she would say something worse about someone in her situation if she still had a show
Wendy,"Health concerns aside, the world is better off without her on television turning her viewers minds into…whatever the hell it is that fills up their craniums.

Edit: why does my highest comment ever have to pertain to this person?! Fml never even seen the show, just read about some of the horrible shit she’s said over the years."
Wendy,Hate what she said about Joaquin Phoenix. Shes trash.
Wendy,There is a way to sobriety for each person who wants it. I hope she finds it. (Over 6 years sober over here. One day at a time.)
Wendy,Because she has dementia. That’s supposedly why she never appeared on the last season of her own show.
Wendy,Hopefully The View is next
Wendy,"Why is it that people like Charlamagne the God and other influencers keep saying she needs her own radio show and all this praise, but elsewhere it’s a completely different tune. Im under the impressions she’s a piece of shit"
Wendy,"She’s scary as fuck looking. https://people.com/thmb/0SNo9Z-Rl3gPCGlSWtKDSRXytIE=/1273x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/Wendy-Williams-steps-out-in-NYC-081022-268ca173f5ab40baaf252b68d835b9cf.jpg"
Wendy,I hear that’s the right attitude. Presidential material right there.
Wendy,Still remember when she revealed to the world that Method Man’s wife had cancer even though she and Meth wanted it to be a secret.
Wendy,LOL! Trying to pull a George Constanza. Just show up to work the next day and pretend nothing happened.
Wendy,"I gotta be honest, this really sucks a lot of the enjoyment out this terrible show being cancelled

Wendy is a terrible person, her show is garbage for garbage people, but she undoubtedly has people who love and care about her.  58 is way too young to be losing your mental faculties."
Wendy,"really she is a relic of trash tv, like tmz"
Wendy,"Vanishing at the drop of a hat? 
Substance abuse issues?
But still getting Hollywoo(d) attention after saying horrible things about people? 

She's like a worse Bojack Horseman."
Wendy,Who?
Wendy,Did she go full Alan Partridge when not offered a new series?
Wendy,at this point i have to believe that the clip of her collapsing in the liberty costume had a little more to it than the lights in the studio were too hot
Wendy,"Never seen her show, but I saw an interview where a famous person was asked about his wife's breast cancer.  He asked how the interviewer knew about it, and he said that Williams was talking about it.  He was pissed because his wife wanted to keep that part of herself private and Williams made it public.  

I removed the name of the person to prevent myself from being a hypocrite I guess."
Wendy,No kidding that woman is so far off of earth. She is on a whole other plain of crazy.
Wendy,“No! I’m going to be on TV forever!”
Wendy,I’m Ron Burgundy?
Wendy,"If she stops talking then the only thing she can listen to is the voice in her head: “this is your conscience, Wendy. You’re a cunt.”"
Wendy,Someone watch her bruh she gonna overdose on some shit
Wendy,"My mother listened to Wendy Williams a lot when she had a radio show. As a kid I thought this woman was a toxic human being and shouldn’t be on TV - this was probably 15 years ago. 

No idea how she made it this long but good riddance. She basically just openly judges other people while pretending she’s the perfect human."
Wendy,I love reading about this bitch’s business because fuck her.
Wendy,Well it's not like she's very bright.
Wendy,Delusional 😛
Wendy,She's the type that shows up to work next morning like nothing happened after getting fired.
Wendy,"She looks like the evil creatures from The Time Machine.

By choice."
Wendy,May we never hear from her again
Wendy,"Well yeah, she a loud mouth bitch. Probably took 10 execs to clamp it shut so she’d listen"
Wendy,FUCK this bitch. Glad to see her shit canceled.
Wendy,I don't know how someone so awful could have a platform so long. She's a horrible horrible human being.
Wendy,I hope she winds up doing it in her living room. But with no cameras. Like when kramer had the Merv Griffin set
Wendy,After watching her TMZ interview I just hope she gets whatever help she is in need of.
Wendy,She’s clearly not well. Even if she is a mean spirited person I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. It’s a terrible thing to witness and her loved ones will suffer.
Wendy,Very sad.. insiders say she spent a weekend with Ray J and was never the same. The same Ray J Whitney Houston was “dating” when she died.
Wendy,Did she think it was stolen?
Wendy,"Also known as working with mental illness, the Wendy Williams story."
Wendy,Couldn’t have happened to a bigger POS
Wendy,SHE’S 58?!
Wendy,"They should prank her by putting her in an empty studio, tell her Covid precautions means no audience today & everything will be done via green screen (set, graphics, etc) and just let her sit in a big empty room by herself doing her little show."
Wendy,I hope she gets the help she needs and that she's never near a TV studio again.
Wendy,She really did a lot of people dirty on her way up the ladder ( look up the Method Man situation with his wife for one) and that’s why there isn’t a whole lot of sympathy for her now 🤷🏽‍♂️.
Wendy,"You hate to see things like this happen to good people and watch their downward spiral in real-time.

But it’s happening to Wendy Williams, so really it’s karma hitting her hard and fast with no signs of relief."
Wendy,She outed that Method Man's wife had cancer live on her show. He said that his wife hadn't even told her family yet.
Wendy,She could always stage a coup.  Seems popular these days.
Wendy,"She was a terrible terrible person, but no one deserves dementia at that age. Very sad."
Wendy,If only they cancelled it before it started…
Wendy,"Who are the bigger pieces of shit, Wendy or the TV executives who kept her trashy ass on TV for nearly 15 years?"
Wendy,">[My] health is very well and I've actually had a few appointments. I'm 57 now, and I have the mind and body of a 25-year-old

Oh honey...."
Wendy,"She’s really sick, I feel sad for her."
Wendy,Used to listen to her radio show back in high school and while it was gossipy back then. It wasn’t as hugely obnoxious (could be nostalgic goggles blinding me) as her eventual show ended up being.
Wendy,Wendy always seemed like one of those people who was awful behind the scenes
Wendy,That’s because she’s a stupid asshole and they don’t do anything but shit all over everything.
Wendy,Wendy Williams didn’t understand something? I’m shocked
Wendy,She’s a monster of a human.
Wendy,Wendy Williams is a total piece of shit and should have been cancelled a decade ago. Sad that people in the article still praise her.
Wendy,"I want you to stay here, and make sure he doesn't leave."
Wendy,it's about time
Wendy,“Changed daytime television”?  This is no Oprah!
Wendy,"“She’s got a point - She’s and icon, she’s a legend and she IS the moment. Come on now” - WW"
Wendy,I would imagine she is getting her lawyers prepped for a lawsuit… based on what I have no clue but she seems the type
Wendy,"Changed daytime talk.  

That’s said at the end of the article.  Wtf did she change?  Am I missing something cuz her show seems just like 20 before her."
Wendy,"If it’s a serious issue, give me her number. I’m happy to call this bitch every day and remind her that her POS shit show is done for and that she sucks (second part is free of charge, of course)."
Wendy,She has the same condition as Bruce Willis and didn’t understand.
Wendy,Is she sick? I remember when she collapsed on the show and not being able to remember things is a huge sign of decline in the health of the brain.
Wendy,I think she should run for president.
Wendy,Pulling the ol' George Costanza
Wendy,Ok who is Wendy Williams and why should I care?
Wendy,You see the recent video of her zonked out talking to fans from her car in NYC? Priceless.
Wendy,The Entertainment Weekly logo at the bottom left is highly appropriate.
Wendy,Pulled a George Costanza huh?
Wendy,"If she has the mind and body of a 25 year old, I wonder where she is keeping it."
Wendy,"Karma for the years of tearing down other celebrities and with false information no less.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen this lady body shame people like lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, and even shade underage celebrities like Taylor swift (underage at the time,) Selena Gomez, and more.

She flat out said Nicki Minaj should never become pregnant because the proportions of her body will be disgusting and insane and even had a weirdly drawn diagram of it. 

I’ve heard wendy say certain celebrities should even consider suicide before.

I can honestly say I have zero empathy for someone who built their career off of tearing others down and spreading misinformation."
Wendy,I’ve never liked her. She seems like a bad person (regardless of her medical issues)
Wendy,"I know she’s a pretty shitty person, but I feel like it’s empathetically worth mentioning that she’s very clearly having serious mental health issues and going through a semi-public mental breakdown. She’s had very little sympathy and empathy for others, but it’s still sad/scary seeing anybody go through a mental decline."
Wendy,"""\[My\] health is very well and I've actually had a few appointments""  whooo child, rest up girl"
Wendy,the world is a better place without her having a mass media platform .. just a    horrible horrible human being
Wendy,What happened?
Wendy,She’s a crazy bitch anyway. Good riddance
Wendy,This is what you get when you make a living off of gossip and putting other people down. You reap what you sow.
Wendy,"It’s disgusting how this lady got a pass for everything she did, and people still feel bad for her. 

Double standards like a motherfucker, if she was a man she would’ve been canceled and her life destroyed for all the foul shit she’s done for YEARS."
Wendy,I’m tired of waiting for Fallon to get kicked tf out. When. When is this going to happen
Wendy,Poor girl has dementia
Wendy,I am happy that Angie Jordan is finally getting her own talk show.
Wendy,Straightup taking the George Costanza route
Wendy,No one cares

Dear White People,"Wonder if AMC will stick it to the fans, and decide to air Better Call Saul's final season in 2 parts. 7 episodes in 2021, 6 in 2022.  
  
I hope I'm wrong."
Dear White People,"No way the Better Call Saul finale airs in 2021. First of all they haven't even started filming yet. Even if they get started in the winter, the quickest turnaround would mean *maybe* a September or October premiere, which neither BCS or Breaking Bad have ever done. Plus it's a 13 episode season I think so even if it does premiere in the fall they'll likely split it like they've done with final seasons in the past. But in all likelihood I'd bet on a February 2022 premiere like most of its previous seasons."
Dear White People,"Superstore was my favorite underrated sitcom of the past few years, I love that stupid show"
Dear White People,I’m gonna miss superstore. There wasn’t anything quite like it on TV and it was such a great escape from the heavier plots of just about every other TV show. I didn’t have to worry about it playing with my little one in the room. It was genuinely funny
Dear White People,Sort of crazy that literally more than half the shows on the list are from Netflix.
Dear White People,Just got into superstore over this holiday break. It’s fantastic (in season 3 right now)
Dear White People,"I’m actually sad about superstore ending. I don’t really get it either. The Amy / Jonah love interest was my least favorite part of that series and I thought it was obvious that Garrett, Dina, Glenn, and Mateo were the characters that actually carried it...


EDIT: I have to agree with all the comments about cheyanne and bo carrying it as well. There are so many great characters it doesn’t make any sense to drop it..."
Dear White People,Shattered about Bosch. It could keep as there is so much source material and it's so good. Titus kills it.
Dear White People,"I’ll miss Superstore. They fell into the trap of solving the will they/won’t they before the series finale, and finding a sufficiently engaging new direction for the couple. There was potential in Jonah and Amy’s daughter bonding, but it wasn’t fully fulfilled, and then Amy’s ambition left them in a bit of a narrative tunnel. A shame for the show and America Ferrera it ended limply for Amy. 

But the saving grace is that it has one of the best character benches in comedy right now. Garrett, Sandra, Mateo, Cheyenne, Justine, Marcus and Carol are all great and the writers and cast have formed great, hilarious dynamics. It’s very funny, sweet, fairly political and diverse."
Dear White People,"BCS has been the best show on tv the last few years. But I kinda hoped we would get a whole season of BCS and ‘gene’. Obviously that isn’t going to happen but I hope we at least get an episode or two exploring the ‘after’ phase fully as we’ve just been teased with little vignettes for the whole show so far. 

Also not looking forward to what is going to happen to Kim. She’s such an awesome character and it’s clear she’s gonna have some real bad shit happen to her."
Dear White People,I didn't know America Ferrara quit Superstore. I thought she was going to return every now and then like other corporate office employees. Unfortunate.
Dear White People,"I’m probably the only person that likes Lost In Space. I don’t love it, but I like it."
Dear White People,Really sad to see Bosch come to end.  It's been such a solid show throughout its run (except maybe that season about the pill mill) it's one of those shows I'd never really follow the progress off too closely during production but then see a new season was out or would be out in a week or two and get excited for each and every time.  Super solid series with really good production value.  I haven't chewed through the Expanse yet but obviously it's been extremely well received too.  Kind of feels like the end of an era for Amazon here with some of their biggest early shows wrapping up here.
Dear White People,I’m glad for these end of year lists. Finally means more shows I can watch from beginning to end without having to wait for a new season to continue.
Dear White People,So sad to see F is for Family take the boot. The last season was incredible.
Dear White People,I thought ozark was splitting into two parts so both parts will debut in 2021?
Dear White People,"Holy shit, we're getting *another* season of Goliath? And I'll probably watch it too, for Billy Bob Thornton and to see what crazy shit they do this season. Season 1 was genuinely good though!"
Dear White People,"Better Call Saul is my most anticipated show next year. The past couple seasons have exceeded Breaking Bad for me with how good they are. 

I love Superstore also but I think its probably time to let that show go. The seasons after Amy became manager were pretty rough for me. It lost that underdog feeling once she became the boss."
Dear White People,wait Lucifer is getting cancelled again? why that show is such a fun guilty pleasure...
Dear White People,Better call Saul is a tv masterpiece. Never thought I would love this show so much.
Dear White People,I was reading something that Better Call Saul might not air til 2022.  COVID has wrecked the production schedule for the final season.  i don' think they've even begun prinicpal photography yet for this next season.
Dear White People,I'm excited to know we're getting one last season of Grace & Frankie!
Dear White People,The Kominsky Method is SO good. It had such a great understanding of its own characters. I'm sorry to see it go. Those people grew on me.
Dear White People,Claws is pretty funny. Doesn’t take itself very seriously and some of the characters are downright hilarious
Dear White People,Lucifer hasn’t even aired the back half of season 5. I doubt we get all of season 6 in 2021
Dear White People,"I like Superstore. Very detailed show that captures the retail life. Love the transitions between scenes of customers doing absurd shit. 

But, It just has way too much corporate influenced writing in it. Executive's are definitely advicing the show creators to incorporate Issues like abortion, religion, sexual preference, and many other hot button issues, that do not come up organically, in the writing, even if I agree with the messages."
Dear White People,(Spoiler below) Expense season 6? There are like 4 more books.
Dear White People,"That’s a shame about superstore. I really enjoyed the first 2-ish seasons of it, but I fell off. Continued to hear good things about it. My mom keeps up with it and has said she really likes it still. 

Is it worth going back to and catching up? My only gripe was the Amy / Jonah love story stuff. It was just *so* weak compared to the rest of the supporting cast."
Dear White People,Say what you will but I LOVE superstore. If you’ve ever worked retail it’s terrifyingly relatable.
Dear White People,"Better call Saul was so slow to begin with however I understand why it was. You can’t help compare the series to pace of breaking bad however due to it being a prequel. 

I’m keen to see how it all wraps up however! Season 5 had that breaking bad pace!"
Dear White People,"I remember watching the first episode of Superstore and thinking ""okay, I could get into this sitcom"" and then never seeing that show again. I honestly thought they cancelled it after the pilot. You're telling me it was running that whole time?"
Dear White People,[removed]
Dear White People,About damn time Shameless ended. That series stopped being remotely interesting after like Season 5.
Dear White People,One time for Superstore 😔👆
Dear White People,I feel like Shameless ran its course a few years ago. I’m surprised it’s still on.
Dear White People,I had no clue BCS was still running. Man I need to get caught up.
Dear White People,"To be replaced with truly terrible TV im sure. I surely dont want BCS, SuperStore, Expanse to end up like How I met your mother - but im getting tired of good shows dying to make way for more medical/crime drama and singing competitions. Additionally, COVID killed the 2020 season for most shows. Those that have aired are mostly limited seasons so it feels like studios are just giving up and hoping to have a clean start in 2021(2022?). Wish i ran a network. Firefly would be back on the air."
Dear White People,"I'll miss Atypical. I really like that show, especially the sisters storyline. A spin off of her would be great in my opinion.

I'll also miss Ozark. It was really good! 

I don't think I've watched anything else from the list."
Dear White People,"The actor Giancarlo Esposito who plays Gus Fringe, wants to do a show that focuses on Gus Fringe. 

I really hope that happens."
Dear White People,I just got into Superstore a week ago. Funny stuff.
Dear White People,[deleted]
Dear White People,Superstore is ending? Damn it.
Dear White People,Where do you even watch tv now?
Dear White People,"Better Call Saul, the Expanse, and Ozark will be greatly missed"
Dear White People,I love Better Call Saul. Probably more than Breaking Bad.
Dear White People,Last season of Dear White People was kinda dry with the secret society stuff but I'm going to be sad to see the show end
Dear White People,"Fans of dear white people would be pleased to learn, if they don’t know already, that the shows creator justin simien has been pegged to develop the new Star Wars lando calrissian show for Disney."
Dear White People,[deleted]
Dear White People,Nobody cares about Dear White People
Dear White People,"Sad that Better Call Saul is ending this year. Are there any other spinoffs?

Also surprised to see Ozark ending as well, I enjoyed that show and glad they will give it a proper ending."
Dear White People,Ozark is ending as well? That should be in the title lmao
Dear White People,Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn are phenomenal in BCS
Dear White People,This is fine
Dear White People,[deleted]
Dear White People,"Lost in Space is the only one I'll miss. The others I'm either not a fan of, or they had a good run. 


Lost in Space is pretty unique. Fantastic quality, interesting story, and it's Sci-fi that anyone can watch. Whether you're 10 or 90 it's family-friendly enough for younger kids and the plot is substantial enough to appeal to older audiences."
Dear White People,"I'm going to definitely miss ""Bosch,""  which I considered  good LA Noir, a sub-genre I like.   I thought it had a couple more seasons in it.

I will sort-of miss ""Superstore"" which I considered ""The Office set at Walmart""

A compliment, by the way.   But Superstore had kind of jumped the shark.

Not an insult!  Almost all successful shows do.  The insult is when they keep going, anyway, like the show which spawned the term."
Dear White People,"A couple of the series I watch, Van Helsing (Syfy) & After Life (Netflix), is also ending in 2021 as well.

It's highly unlikely that Better Call Saul will finish airing all its episodes next year. Either AMC will push the show into 2022 or air it in two parts as they did with some of their other long-running series: Breaking Bad, Mad Men & Hell on Wheels.

Both The Expanse & His Dark Materials have a very lengthy post-production process and neither has started filming yet so I wouldn't bet on seeing either of them air next year. 

Ozark's final season will be releasing in two parts. If the first part isn't out by mid-way through the year the likeliness of the second part airing in 2021 are very slim as Netflix like to spread those out by at least 6 months or so. Same goes for Lucifer, with Season 5 part 2 still to come, Season 6 could potentially sneak in before the end of the year as it's already been filming for over two months but depending on how late S5 pt2 comes out we could see it end in 2022 as well."
Dear White People,I dont want Dead to me to end so soon . The show grew on me and now I really like it and I wanna see more seasons and I adore Grace & Frankie .. oh well .. just like when Disjointed was canceled after 2 seasons.. I was very Disappointed
Dear White People,"Man I’ve really enjoyed Superstore, I knew this was coming. They lost a main character and were takin some risqué shots at the big guys up top regarding the way our country isn’t handling the pandemic."
Dear White People,"Damn,  a lot of these are good shows.. I just recently got into Superstore and have been watching it every now and then.  
The Expanse too! Will be sad to see a lot of these go."
Dear White People,RIP Superstore. Thank you for the cozy viewing and the smiles.
Dear White People,Better call Saul good it’s ending. Perfect and short like breaking bad.
Dear White People,I didn't realize Superstore was still on... funny show
Dear White People,NOOO NOT SUPERSTORE GODDAMNIT!!!
Dear White People,Superstore was great. Lot of the office feeling moments. Gonna be sad to see it go
Dear White People,I think Superstore has just about run its course. (I love the show just think it’s had a good long run and can now end)
Dear White People,"I tried so hard to like Ozark, I got about 1.5 seasons in and had to stop. Same with Dead to Me. I had two episodes of what is left to go and just...had no reason to keep going. I started watching Shameless instead. Might try again, I watched it right around when I watched Santa Clarita Diet and might have been salty about its cancellation. I saw Superstore on an airplane last year and OMG it is hilarious, will have to watch that next (I am a KITH fan from way back, Mark McKinney is the best, but this really is a great ensemble, and it reminds me of Ten Items or Less.)"
Dear White People,"> Not every TV series is lucky enough to be given the time to craft one final chapter.

I think this is a paradigm that is changing forever.  

it used to be that tv shows would air until they were done, and then they'd vanish forever.  The network didn't care if the viewer was left with a satisfying experience because the ads were already sold, and checks cashed.

but that's not the world we live in anymore.  That show that ran for 3 years has future viewing value.  Streaming services will pay for the right to offer it to customers.  If a show shits the bed the last season, gets cancelled on a cliffhanger, or just has an insultingly bad ending...people won't want to watch it, services won't want to pay to license it.

A bad ending damages the monetary value of a show, if its bad enough, it turns an investment into a sunk cost.  Future networks executives will start to understand this and we'll be seeing more ""final seasons"" or even just ""wrap up event"" episodes."
Dear White People,"Superstore kind of already passed multiple natural ending points. And while I think it was bold to include depiction of COVID on retail workers, I probably speak for many when I say that’s not what I want to be reminded of when veging out to sit coms. I’d rather escape into tv land."
Dear White People,“Dear White People” returned to sender.
Dear White People,Damn. Dear white people was actually really good and eye opening for me
Dear White People,"I enjoyed dear white people, but 4 seasons definitely feels like the right amount. Hopefully they bounce back from a so and so season 3 and finish with a bang."
Dear White People,Cue Tim Allen whining his show was cancelled because hollywood hates conservatives.
Dear White People,"""Dear White People"" --- cue largest eye-roll for this decade"
Dear White People,"Dear white people was such a shifty show, sucks about better call saul tho"
Dear White People,Dear White People is a tough watch. Surprised it made it to 4 seasons.
Dear White People,Dear white people? The fuck is that shit
Dear White People,I thought there was talks of Lucifer getting another season
Dear White People,The Expanse is one of the best and most underrated shows ever created. I could see it going to 8 seasons but ending at 6 isn’t horrible. Gonna miss the hell out of this show.
Dear White People,"Can’t wait to see what drivel will be replacing these good shows. AMC, I’m worried about ya."
Dear White People,"This is good news... while it’s never fun to have your favorite show end, it’s better to have an ending than to have it be cancelled and end on a cliffhanger or with more story left to tell..., 

(Maybe not Game of Thrones, they could have just ended at season 6 and said someone finish this if the books ever get finished)"
Dear White People,Boo!! I mean Amy Sosa was the heart of Superstore. Her leaving is probably what did it.
Dear White People,This is more of a list of shows that will end after one more season which may or may not air in 2021.  It's missing The Crown though.
Dear White People,I love love superstore. Time for a rewatch then.
Dear White People,It sucks for superstore. The main person left last year and they were moving forward and bam Covid... now they are just getting canceled.
Dear White People,"I saw Better Call Saul and, well, can you hear me shrieking?"
Dear White People,"How do they end Super girl and Black Lighting? They aren’t going to kill off the characters. BL being in the prime universe opened up so much for the character. I know they are doing spin offs for both shows but I don’t see either . Kinda surprised that legends is staying around . I like that show but I remember that show being near cancellation for a while . 

I can imagine Batwoman being canceled if season 2 doesn’t do well in ratings. Season 1 was barely mediocre with many awful episodes and a few ok to semi good. 

I like the CW verse , even with its cheesy nature."
Dear White People,"Ah mostly Netflix shows... shocker. 

Better Call Saul - While I am disappointed it’s ending I want it to finish on a high note. I honestly didn’t expect it to be as good as it is. But as the seasons progressed it has cemented its place as a television masterpiece. I am excited to see how it ends.

The Expanse - This one breaks my heart. Yet, from what I have heard about the books (I am only on 2) it is a natural ending for story. I will take that and hopefully find something that thrills me week to week in the same way. 

Ozark - I love this show but I found elements in this last season that dragged for me. I do love Bateman and the rest of the cast. And I am happy they will get a chance to conclude it. 

Dead to Me - This got better and better as the episodes progressed. I think this could have actually had a longer run and am sad it’s going.

The Kominsky Method - Good. This show was terrible. 

Superstore - I am on S4E10 and I am really enjoying it. I am so surprised how grounded it is while still having so much heart. The social commentary that is thrown in is on point and very intelligently articulated. And it somehow manages to be so fun and light. Very sad that it’s ending."
Dear White People,"I'm still annoyed at all the good shows Netflix cancelled this year. So many cool shows, yet the kids going through puberty cartoon gets 6 seasons and they're making Kissing Booth 3 lmao"
Dear White People,have to wonder when or if we’ll see a live-action non-reality show get as many seasons as grace and frankie from netflix again
Dear White People,"The Expanse is incredible. Season 1-3 (2 and 3 especially) is some of my favorite sci-fi TV of all time. Season 4 took a bit of a dip, but season 5 so far has been all time! 

Will they get through season 6 or is it over after season 5?"
Dear White People,Anyone else bummed about Lucifer?
Dear White People,I feel like i'm the only one who wants a full length Gus Fring series?
Dear White People,"Is Saul still slated to end 2021? Last I had checked they had to push filming due to Covid back to at least Feb/March. And frankly, wouldn't be shocked if it gets pushed further. Seems to me like it might end up being an early 2022 release."
Dear White People,"I really enjoyed the first two seasons of Dear White People. But the third one just failed to grip me. I was pretty disappointed they dropped the following-one-person-per-episode thing. The self-poking jokes about it being ""the third season of a Netflix show"" also didn't help.

Definitely gonna give season 3 another chance though. I'm glad they're actually finishing the series."
Dear White People,"Little surprised to see Better Call Saul and Ozark on here, I thought those shows had some legs on em. I guess BCS was almost caught up to Breaking Bad anyway, so it had a hard out, but still."
Dear White People,Im gonna miss better call saul.
Dear White People,"Good, Shameless has really gone down the gutter"
Dear White People,"Superstore is ending? Ugh, thanks Sandra!"
Cable Girls,My wife said this show was over? I guess I'll have to let her know there's more coming.
Cable Girls,"It's finishing in 10 episodes. The first 5 are released on Valentine's Day, and the remaining 5 in summer."
Cable Girls,"Starting chapter 2, i really liked chapter one, saw this show in netflix today without knowing what it was about the only thing was the netflix recommendation and that it was a show from Spain."
Cable Girls,"I'm only a few minutes in, and I nearly fell out of my chair [when] (#s ""Carlos tells Alba that he didn't study in school, but not to tell his father that he wasted money on boarding school.  The actors playing Carlos and Alba starred in The Boarding School together.  If you saw El Internado, it's got Easter eggs for days..."")"
Cable Girls,So exited to start watching..i almost died when i saw Yon Gonzales on the trailer!
Cable Girls,"I LUUUV Grand Hotel and dropped everything to binge-watch it over the course of two weeks. The Alicia-Julio ship, the slaps, the clothes, the mystery, the villains, I love them all. I didn't know Cable Girls was a Spanish show, so I wasn't interested. Now I'm super intrigued! I tried Velvet but didn't really like the era. Hope Cable Girls is the one for me!"
Cable Girls,"Aside from all those ""El Internado"" easter eggs... this is Velvet with a more interesting protagonist and worse music."
Cable Girls,"He's reunited with Blanca Suarez and Martino Rivas, so this will be fun."
Cable Girls,"I loved Gran Hotel, but I liked Velvet too.  If you liked Gran Hotel, I also recommend trying El Internado as well.  It's one of the other long arc mystery shows starring members of Cable Girls, including the guy who played Julio."
Cable Girls,"I don't think the framing of ""feminism"" against the progress of telephone technology was very wise, because I couldn't root for the girls jobs as I watch it on my phone almost 100 years later.  It was good for casual watching, but it didn't hit it out of the park for me."
Cable Girls,Is there a list of Easter eggs somewhere?
Cable Girls,"I finished 4 episodes of Cable Girls and found that it shares a lot of similarities with Gran Hotel (identity theft, being in love with your married boss, family business, etc). I haven't watched any other Spanish shows except these two and one episode of Velvet. I wonder if this upper-lower class forbidden love is a standard trope in Spanish drama. 

Btw, I do love Yon Gonzales, but the guy who plays Carlos is very charming too!"
Cable Girls,"The actor playing Carlos is in El Internado with Yon, and they play best friends in the series.  The actress playing Carla was in the show with them too.

The upper/lower class thing is more that these shows are period dramas than it being a particularly Spanish theme. Also, Cable Girls, Gran Hotel and Velvet (among others not on Netflix) have the same producers."
Cable Girls,My wife is watching this right now. 
Cable Girls,Please join us at r/CableGirlsNetflix/
Cable Girls,"I'm in the middle of season 1 and loving it. It's not something I can have on in the background since I need the subtitles, so I'm slowly maki my way through it. Excellent show. "
Cable Girls,"It really requires concentration! But totally worth it. Just so much happening.
Happy watching!"
Cable Girls,"Absolutely agreed, it is great to see so much great tv from outside the US and the UK these days. Does not only showcase different languages, but also people, surroundings and cultures."
Cable Girls,I'm on a KDrama rampage right now.
Cable Girls,"Dont forget Dark (German), Jordskott (Scandinavian), Beau Sejour (Belgian), Les Revenants (French), The Forest (French), and 3% (Brazilian)"
Cable Girls,I personally think the foreign crime shows are leaps and bounds better than the popular ones shown here in America
Cable Girls,"Yup. For me, best thing about TV currently. Like, have u seen Élite season 2!?? 

They got a great brazilian line-up too. I honestly think they should ditch U.S. content and just make ""international"" stuff."
Cable Girls,No I haven't but I do want to see it as I liked season 1. What are the gooz Brazilian shows they have?
Cable Girls,"* Most Beautiful Thing
* 3%
* Sintonia"
Cable Girls,"i loved **most beautiful thing**!  beautifully shot, and featuring women at the center of the story.  i've described as a brazilian **mad men** meets **mrs. maisel** meets **good girls revolt** (with a dash of **vinyl**?  the good parts?)"
Cable Girls,"I honestly feel like people who are bashing this haven't watched early episodes of Boy Meets World in a while. The kids were nearly as ridiculous, the plots cheesy, and it also had a laugh track. 

I thought this pilot was cute, maybe not GOOD, but I definitely laughed once or twice. I'll give this one a few episodes before I decide whether or not I like it."
Cable Girls,That being said it needs one thing. More Eric Mathews. Cough cough. Bring back Eric cough. 
Cable Girls,"It is everything that a show on Disney Channel should be.

Which was my fear when I first learned that it was going to be on Disney Channel. And I was right unfortunately.

Should've been an ABC sitcom. Michael Jacobs really messed up there."
Cable Girls,"The word ""World"" was used way too often during this episode. Felt forced"
Cable Girls,"General thoughts now that I've watched it. The titular girl is a little wooden, though I get why she was cast in that part because she has moments where she captures Ben Savage's manic qualities. Maya's actress is better, I buy her as the Shawn stand-in and probably the most enjoyment I was getting out of it was her interacting with Cory . Farkle... really helped me appreciate the actual leads better. Yikes.

It was okay. It needed to slow down a lot, it felt scattershot and all over the place. That or it needs Jackee Harry sitting around commenting on everything that happens in every scene because that was actually great. I could see kids liking this, which is pretty much what matters."
Cable Girls,"It's trying too hard. BMW was more relaxed and this show is trying to hard to find itself. The opening scene didn't really make sense and didn't explain what they were actually doing.  A lot of what happened seemed like a sped up montage of the issues the boys faced over a few seasons was crammed into 1 episode.  I think they should have had a tighter story to open with.  As a New Yorker, massive facepalms at the inaccuracy of the set-ups and locations."
Cable Girls,"I'm a huge Boy Meets World fan and I've really been looking forward to seeing this.  I know the trailer wasn't very promising, but I've been hopeful.

I'm six minutes in.  It's....awful."
Cable Girls,"I got to see four episodes. I actually went to two live tapings where we got to also see the old pilot. It's a heartfelt show filled with comedy, family values and the trails and tribulations of growing in in the big apple. It's cute and heartfelt and funny.  "
Cable Girls,"DirecTV subscriber here, is there any way for those of us who don't have cable with one of those providers to access this episode (stream/torrent somewhere perhaps)? Would be able to watch this if I hadn't switched from U-Verse a month ago :\"
Cable Girls,"Everyone tends to see the series with rose-tinted glasses. Even the later seasons, while they had a good chunk of serious episodes such as Cory and Topanga learning what marriage is like for people barely out of highschool and Eric attempting to adopt a kid, they still had really really silly moments.

 For example, when we see a possible future where the entire gang breaks up and are all miserable, Eric turns out to be a hermit  named Plays With Squirrels and married to a moose."
Cable Girls,Not bad at all. I laughed and the bit with Feeny at the end got me good. Seemed a bit erratic but it is a pilot so I'll let it slide.
Cable Girls,"All things considered, I enjoyed it for what it was. "
Cable Girls,"I just watched the Boy Meets World pilot after watching the Girl Meets World one and.. uh.. I can't tell if it's nostalgia, but Boy Meets World seemed like a legitimately funny family show with sad/dark moments and life lessons for both kids and adults.  Like the kind of show you could watch with your kid and not feel ashamed. lol 

Girl Meets World made me feel like I wouldn't want to be caught watching it.  The episode was kind of like the episode of Boy Meets World where Corey tries to straighten his hair and has to hang out with Topanga and Minkus.. but for some reason the main storyline seemed to be how she liked this spray tanned makeup wearing model kid who stood out like a sore thumb around the other kids in class. lol

And that Minkus type character seems so over the top.  Minkus was a nerd, but that kid.. holy hell.  How did he even get on Coreys shoulders?  His voice.  It's like Minkus had that voice normally as a kid, but that kid was just trying to be Minkus really hard.

Maybe it'll be different with more episodes, but that just seems like a disney kids show."
Cable Girls,"Yeah, I couldn't finish it. "
Cable Girls,Yeah it is pretty horrible. Any of the other Disney Channel shows are better written than this.
Cable Girls,Care to point out any differences between the two pilots? I'm curious what had to be reshot or changed around. 
Cable Girls,"I'm in the same boat.  Give it a few days, perhaps someone will do a web rip of it and make it available on torrents or newsgroups or something."
Cable Girls,"By the end of the series Ben Savage had decided to start playing Cory as an old Jewish comedian trapped in a college student's body. It was a pretty hammy, ridiculous show."
Cable Girls,"Apparently, that's Minkus' son."
Cable Girls,"Of course! They said they were going to reshoot some things because of changes that happened after they shot the pilot in 2013. For instance they changed Riley's love interests name. A small detail but one they said they where going to change. And the fact that they axed Cory and T's original oldest child, their son. After shooting the pilot they realized that they didn't need the character and that Riley could hold her own. So at the last taping I went to they said they were going to do some reshoots to make it all a bit smoother. Hope this helped! "
Cable Girls,[deleted]
Cable Girls,Thanks. Was Auggie in the original pilot? Im trying to figure out if Riley was intended to to a middle child originally. 
Cable Girls,"Wikipedia says ""Farkle Minkus"", but we'll have to see."
Cable Girls,She absolutely was supposed to be the middle child! They decided she didn't need that similarity to Corey as well. Plus age wise I don't know if they wanted Corey and Topanga to start popping out babies quite yet. They did however add Augie's adorable existential crises with Riley which was new and amazing.  He is hilarious and adorable. 
Cable Girls,"All of us are dead…that much rating? No, it belong to the worst honestly."

Cable Girls,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Cable Girls,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Cable Girls,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Cable Girls,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

Cable Girls,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Cable Girls,Severance show
Cable Girls,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Cable Girls,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Cable Girls,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Cable Girls,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Cable Girls,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Cable Girls,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Cable Girls,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Cable Girls,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Cable Girls,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Cable Girls,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Cable Girls,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Cable Girls,"The lion share of those you’ve mentioned absolutely have been cultural mainstays and still get enjoyed by many. Cheers was your first example yet it’s arguably the single most celebrated sitcom in US history aside from Friends lol, seeing that made me puzzled as to what you mean by ‘no staying power’. Cheers was a global phenomenon that was rerun daily decades after it came off air."
Cable Girls,[deleted]
Cable Girls,Malcolm in the Middle and LOST are not forgotten.
Cable Girls,"I feel like nobody mentions Prison Break anymore. Obviously it dropped off but at the time it was huuuuuuge. Heroes too, but that notably dropped off. But for how popular they were at the time, I don't see them mentioned too much anymore."
Cable Girls,"I think shows like Mad About You, Veronica's Closet (forgot this was a thing until right now), Caroline in the City, and Just Shoot Me got lost among the bigger shows like Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier as far as the ""must-see-tv"" era. Especially Mad About You, which was pretty huge for awhile."
Cable Girls,Empire was the highest rated thing on tv the first few seasons but the ratings fell fast and hard and now no one thinks about it anymore.
Cable Girls,"Seriously I don't know what your talking about? No staying power? Everyone over 30 knows & loves these shows.its just the under 30 crowd who may not have seen them. They're not forgotten. Most are very well known and got high praise from fans and critics when they were on broadcast tv. I and I'm sure most of still rewatch these programs if they're available on the many streaming services during our free time. Some age gracefully, but some do not. That's just how it goes. I do wish with all these services that more would be easily accessible.  There's a whole list of shows, many 1 seasons from the 80's - 2000's that don't seem to get any love on streaming, probably due to music rights or show property rights. It would be great to see Boston Public or Do Over on Hulu since they can't be found on any physical media. Let's be honest, if they had no staying power, they wouldn't be huge now would  they? Most people don't like constantly like talking about the same shows over & over. They move on."
Cable Girls,"Another one which I love and seems forgotten is Scrubs.

I’m Mexican and I must tell you that Malcolm in the Middle is Huuuuuuge in Mexico and Latin America, even today it’s one of the highest ranking shows on Mexican TV and streaming platforms, amazing show!"
Cable Girls,"That 70s Show is definitely not forgotten … That 90s show is premiering soon.  Idk what metrics are being used in calling Grounded for Life a hit in the same breath as Cheers but ok.  I will say that one show that got a ton of critical acclaim, won lots of awards but wasn’t necessarily a ratings hit and almost no one talks about now is Picket Fences."
Cable Girls,"Considering the art medium of current broadcast theatre/television, they are challenged with respect to holding up and not aging. My 20somethings roast most of these shows on 2 levels. First is the technology that hasn’t aged well from cell phones to obvious CGI. Second, the sophistication of dialogue, writing, cultural relevancy also dates itself. Period pieces like Mash has an advantage to holding up because we know going in it is generational. After seeing a Cheers GIF two weeks ago on Reddit that had me laugh outload, I streamed a couple episodes. The interplay with Sam and Diane was old and played out. When the patrons redirected a dialogue it was comedic gold. Nice, but not enough to keep watching."
Cable Girls,"I think Cheers loses some ""talkability"" because it has two very distinct halves, the Sam & Diane v. the later ensemble years. I think it's fair to say that even most of the show's fans have a clear preference for one or the other.

Becker, I think, was a plain time slot hit. Lost its audience when it lost its slot after Raymond, and didn't do much in syndication."
Cable Girls,"Game of Thrones was the biggest show in the entire world at its height, ended three years ago, and is already practically forgotten."
Cable Girls,[deleted]
Cable Girls,That '70s Show was one of the most-watched shows on Netflix prior to it leaving the streaming platform a couple of years ago. Cheers is still being rerun here in the UK. It airs Monday to Friday on Channel 4.
Cable Girls,Saying Buffy and Angel is forgotten so soon after all the Joss Whedon controversy took over the Internet is definitely a choice.
Cable Girls,"I know it was rerun a bunch in the 90s and 2000s but I rarely ever here it mentioned or talked about. Even among Boomers and GenXers. As where Frasier is brought up all of the time.

Even my parents and their friends as well as older coworkers of mine prefer Frasier.

I'm not saying that Cheers is bad or anything. But I think Cheers is the very rare example of a Spin Off being better than the original show.

Also I'm not sure if Cheers is the most celebrated sitcom in US History. I think I Love Lucy, MASH, Happy Days or Seinfeld likely is."
Cable Girls,Ugly Betty is another similar one from around the same time.
Cable Girls,"I loved the first 4-5 seasons of Desperate Housewives but abandoned it not long after Dana Delaney came along. I see it on Hulu but have never had the desire to rewatch. It got a little too out there for me, as happens with a lot of shows that get popular but then overstay their welcome."
Cable Girls,I think my mom watched that one too.
Cable Girls,Especially Lost lol. It is still one of the most popular 2000s shows. This show is mentioned on this subreddit almost everyday.
Cable Girls,Malcolm in the Middle is huge in Latin America. SO great that transcended generations and even born a culture of memes.
Cable Girls,But I don't hear them talked about much in real life. No one gets my Malcolm in the Middle references anymore. If anything I meet a ton of people when I mention it who haven't watched it in over 10 years.
Cable Girls,Yes! I forgot all about Prison Break. I feel like it's first two seasons the show was huge and was everywhere. I think people got tired of the repeating formula.
Cable Girls,"I know my parents watched Mad About You back in the day and my mom liked Just Shoot Me.

I also feel like the 90s gets remembered for it's Sitcoms and Kids Shows but Cop and action dramas were huge too.

I remember shows like Homicide: Life on the Streets, NYPD Blue, Renegade and Diagnosis Murder were popular as well."
Cable Girls,"If you look back at TV eras, the 1990-91 to 2000-2001 period has to be one of the most ""stacked"" in terms of titans. Mad About You, Caroline in the City and Veronica's Closet were on during an era where NBC had Friends, Frasier, Seinfeld, Law & Order, ER, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Law & Order SVU, Will & Grace, The West Wing, Cheers, Wings, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and The Tonight Show. To me it's not surprising that shows like News Radio and the above were ""forgotten"". 

Also crazy to think how much of the popular streaming shows were all on during a similar time-frame (1992-2004)."
Cable Girls,Sitcoms and procedurals I feel are definitely gonna be the big ones here as most are ultimately disposable entertainment put in a field where they really have to STICK OUT to be memorable.
Cable Girls,"Will and Grace would go in this camp. Great show, but watching it now the series doesn't seem to have the punch and edge it did when it originally aired. 

Haven't watched Murphy Brown, but that's one that seemed big at the time but I don't hear of much these days."
Cable Girls,I just remember Grounded for Life being popular in the early 2000s. Reruns were common on FX and later ABC Family into the early 2010s.
Cable Girls,"I feel like Frasier has aged better than Cheers because, Frasier is more cynical and has a more nihilistic tone. Cheers was more grounded.

I think that's one of the reasons a lot of 90s sitcoms are so universally loved. They were just fun. Less heartfelt moments and more crude humor."
Cable Girls,I don't know. I still here a ton of pissed off fans talking about it.
Cable Girls,"So far, based on the response to this thread. I think it's because when you mention a show has been forgotten people seem to think that means you are saying a show is bad.

I'm sure you aren't saying Lost is bad just it has largely become forgotten. I'm saying the samething. I don't think any of the shows I mentioned are bad. They just don't seem to have staying power.

But people get too emotional when they see their favorite show and don't read."
Inspiring Generation,Isn’t Sailor Moon the one were the Americans made the Lesbian couple cousins but forgot to take out most of the flirting?
Inspiring Generation,"As someone who has been watching since the original run in North America, this makes me extremely happy to see. It's such a fantastic series and well worth the watch."
Inspiring Generation,Pretty much the #1 seed cosplay outfit.
Inspiring Generation,"""When you talk to fans about why they're fans and why they stay fans, it's the stories,"" Peter Tatara, founder of Anime NYC, an annual three-day anime fan convention, told Insider. ""And very often what you see in animated manga, it's that they're telling stories that audiences aren't typically finding in American pop culture.""

To me, that quote sums up what makes Sailor Moon so unique and so enduring. It fills a huge hole in the media space where girls/women can be powerful, while still leaning into their femininity, and also showing just how diverse femininity is. From your glamorous Mina/Sailor Venus, to your strong and independent Sailor Uranus, a huge spectrum of personalities are shown, and they are all viewed as positive, feminine, beautiful. Every girl watching Sailor Moon could see herself in these characters. 

Marvel could take a lesson from the Sailor Moon franchise if they want to build their brand with girls and women. They took a big step forward with Wandavision, and I hope Black Widow continues on that path to creating women superheroes who are women at heart also."
Inspiring Generation,I’m absolutely convinced that the glut of absurdly high quality animated shows we’ve been getting in the past decade is thanks to the popularity of anime like sailor moon and dbz when today’s show runners were teens.
Inspiring Generation,I don't know much about this show but there used to be a compilation on youtube about Tuxedo Masks' contributions. It was like 20 minutes of him just throwing the hell out of a rose. One of the funniest comps I've ever watched.
Inspiring Generation,"When i was a kid Sailor Moon was huge, just like DBZ and Pokemon"
Inspiring Generation,"~~This is my girlfriend~~

Cousin...."
Inspiring Generation,That show was a gateway drug for pretty much evert weebo in my high school (I'm old)
Inspiring Generation,"I definitely remember being 4yo, getting ready for Pre-K and Sailor Moon playing on the TV. 

Still fighting evil by moonlight and winning love by daylight. Lol"
Inspiring Generation,I never watched an episode but I’ve been curious to check it out. Is Sailor Moon actually … good? Or is it just nostalgia?
Inspiring Generation,"Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon

'Cause that cartoon has got the boom anime babes

That make me think the wrong thing"
Inspiring Generation,"Sailor Moon was one of the first big anime fandoms in the US, so it's impact is definitely historical. Sailor Moon was the reason that Tokyopop started releasing manga, it's why they briefly had a manga magazine. 

Sailor Moon was one of the big tape trades, because of how popular it was. Fans today will never experience anything like that, but that's also because anime is much more accessible now."
Inspiring Generation,"And tbe gay awakening for many, *many* boys and girls. Probably coalesced some things for trans kids too, with Neptune and all those ambiguously gendered villains"
Inspiring Generation,They’re missing the real story. They were fighting evil by moonlight And winning love by daylight. Sounds like a pretty open and shut child labor case
Inspiring Generation,"Here I am a OG Dragon Ball nerd reeling because it’s suddenly mainstream cool. 

I am not a Sailor Moon fan, but dammit some of my oldest friends are, and they deserve that too."
Inspiring Generation,"This anime honestly changed me when I was growing up. I went from playing games where a male protagonist would take the lead role, to now gravitating with bias towards video games with female protagonists.  Started out Street Fighter The World Warrior playing as Ken, now prefer Chun Li. Swapped out preference from Tekken to Dead or Alive. Skyrim has a myriad female oriented mods. When given a choice, I choose a female. Some people wonder why. To be honest, I just find something beautiful about women having an extraordinary power while sporting a revealing outfit, versus watching some muscular dude flex his .50 caliber rifle dressed like a Siberian winter soldier.  I wonder how I would have turned out had I never seen that anime, which was also my first introduction to watching anime as a past time."
Inspiring Generation,"I never got into Sailor Moon, but it's cool it had such an impact on so many.  For me the 90's anime that stood out was... Dragon Ball Z, Lupin III (part 2), Cowboy Bebop, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing,  Slayers, Robotech, & Neon Genesis Evangelion.

But my exposure to Anime started back in the 80's with Tranzor Z (Mazinger Z) & Voltron."
Inspiring Generation,"Sailor Moon and Dragon ball was unlike anything I saw before as a kid. American cartoons at the time were beginning to getting interesting with comic book adaptions and comedic slapstick while anime being imported was like 10-15 years ahead. I still love the original Sailor Moon, because it still makes me laugh at how cute and silly it can be, but knows when to take it seriously. 

I was pretty bummed when Toonami never aired the final season of Sailor Moon and left it on a weird cliffhanger, but finished it in college when streaming sites were taking hold. Now it's pretty cool seeing people my age make american cartoons with sailor moon influences  (Star vs the Forces of Evil, Steven Universe, and She-Ra)."
Inspiring Generation,My girlfriend is still in love with the show. After she had me sit and watch some episodes of it on Hulu I still hear “Mamoruuuuu” in my head
Inspiring Generation,"Its just so funny that MArs and jupiter are "" cousins"" outside japan, which gives of massive alabama vibes throughout all of sailormoon"
Inspiring Generation,And this is probably part of the reason why we have been waiting years for new Hunter X Hunter chapters.
Inspiring Generation,"I watched on cartoon network and found out about the storyline changes so i have been trying to watch the japanese version on hulu. Almost done. I would be Sailor Saturn which is a badass but only appears once so that makes me a little sad. I lived watching it as a kid in the 90s but as an adult, it kinda weirds me out. I do enjoy the story though."
Inspiring Generation,Toonami introduced me to anime. Gundam warriors. Sailor moon. Dragon ball. Bo bo bo bobobo. Reboot was on there to.
Inspiring Generation,"I remember watching the dubbed version with my wife when it first appeared on TV.   Was pretty much the only anime she was willing to watch, but we found it fun."
Inspiring Generation,Big fan of Sailor Moon!
Inspiring Generation,"I had the VKLL fan subs for the Japanese seasons way before they were released in the US. Fucking expensive, and a shitload of VHS tapes, but so worth it to teenaged me in the early 2000s."
Inspiring Generation,"I really like how the trailer for the latest movie series on Netflix begins with Sailor Moon's ""In the name of the Moon"" speech in different languages. It truly was a global phenomenon. It managed to be a crossover hit here in Portugal despite (or perhaps because) of the horrible dub (which tbf has some great one-liners). I really enjoyed the show as a kid due to sentai aspect, as well as the transformation sequences, but mostly because of how comfy it was."
Inspiring Generation,Each country had a different way to deal with… From keeping the romance all the way from making Sailor Uranus a boy that transforms into a girl (in the Russian dub).
Inspiring Generation,Yup that’s the one. They also never brought over the final season to avoid the new protagonists cross dressing when they transformed. Shame bc I love Stars.
Inspiring Generation,"Technically, the scenes with flirting were taken out for the American television broadcast. Pioneer Entertainment, the company responsible for putting the series on DVD at the time, asked that all the scenes be dubbed so both English and Japanese audio could be provided in a single disc. That's why we ended up with edited dialogue that occasionally contradicted what was being shown on screen."
Inspiring Generation,Alabama accommodations!
Inspiring Generation,"maybe they thought they could get some more southern viewers?

kek"
Inspiring Generation,"Have you watched the non-dubbed version since? It is my understanding that the English dub is quite different (I grew up with the Swedish dub here in Sweden, which seems to have been closer to the original).  
  
The original English dub cut quite a few scenes, edited out Japanese references (like 4Kids also did with Pokémon), changed the gender of Zoisite from male to female to make his relationship with Kunzite non-gay, changed the gender of Tamasaburou and Fish Eye to remove their crossdressing, changed Sailor Neptune and Uranus to be cousins instead of gay lovers, completely recut and partially changed the ending to season one, etc.  
  
I'm just curious if there is any American who grew up with the original English dub and later watched the original only to be surprised by the many differences (or if they didn't notice because they were too young the first time to remember all the details, maybe)."
Inspiring Generation,Same here! It's great being able to watch the show with my daughter and see her get excited about it.
Inspiring Generation,You gotta give it up to Japanese magma artist for being so creatively original. Japan is the perfect example that a small country doesn’t need to steal and copy other countries to be successful. Unlike some other authoritarian countries in the region.
Inspiring Generation,"I watch this when I was young because it was scheduled right next to another show I watched. But something about it just had a charm. The animation, the concept being relatively new to me, and honestly it had a lot of pretty zany comedy. A great primer for anime."
Inspiring Generation,Same. I'm watching the Crystal series on Netflix and it's great. I'm hoping we can see more Sailor Moon content. I believe the Stars arc is the remaining arc that Crystals hasn't adapted yet so maybe that in the future.
Inspiring Generation,"the creator of the franchise, Naoko Takeuchi, also said when it came to creating the 5 main Sailor Senshi, she envisioned girls that she could easily become friends with as well, which is why the characters are so fondly remembered, because she wrote them so well"
Inspiring Generation,"What surprised me about Sailor Moon when I watched it for the first time last summer is that it was like 30% superhero stuff and 70% girls hanging out and being funny together. In American media those numbers are usually reversed, and it was refreshing to see something that wasn’t so worried about feeding you its plot the whole time."
Inspiring Generation,"If you have Disney Plus they have some great cartoons aimed at girls... or me, a 40 year old man who wants to relax with something wholesome. Diverse cast, many body shapes, friendship, teamwork and action. It has ghost spider, ms marvel, America Chavez, Squirrel Girl and then cameos by Iron Heart, Shuri, Captain Marvel."
Inspiring Generation,🙌🏼 exactly 🙌🏼
Inspiring Generation,"100%. Shows like this were some of the first to really take kids (young girls especially) and their ability to follow storylines and get invested in characters seriously rather than just be advertising targets for toys. Obviously there's all kinds of toys and stuff around Sailor Moon as well, but that wasn't the purpose of the show say compared to like, My Little Pony or similar advertisements-as-shows from the time. It had substance. It had consequence. It had *romance*. It had magic. It had depth like almost nothing else targeted at kids at the time. Is it any wonder it stuck in so many peoples' minds?"
Inspiring Generation,"Now that’s a hot take, incredibly popular and profitable shows inspired more like it? You don’t say."
Inspiring Generation,"He's there as moral support, essentially."
Inspiring Generation,"I watched all three every day religiously. Pokémon in the morning before school and basically the entire Toonami lineup after school. Miss those days.

Edit: there was another show I really liked as a kid called Zoids (I think, the one with like robotic tiger vehicles or whatever) but I can’t find anywhere to watch it. Might just have to buy it if I can find it."
Inspiring Generation,"It was dragonball first for me! But they only dubbed something like the first 10 episodes and then would start back at the beginning. Sailor Moon had what felt like an entire first season, so I watched both a ton, but then when dbz came out, it was like mind blowing."
Inspiring Generation,"It really is. You do have to remember that it's a series aimed at young girls for the most part, and it does get a little complicated with things like time travel and future children and stuff, but it's got great messages of friendship, love, and growing up. It's very much a sort of monster-of-the-week thing with a undercurrent of connective tissue, but I'd say it's timeless, personally. For a lot of little girls who grew up when this was on the air, Sailor Moon was our Superman."
Inspiring Generation,Eh it isn't bad but it's not like...pinnacle storytelling. A lot of it is filler and it's very *enemy of the week*. If you watch tv shows for story you're probably not going to get that much out of it but if you watch for aesthetic then you'll love it.
Inspiring Generation,Mostly nostalgia you are better off watching a genre that interests you.
Inspiring Generation,You could watch Sailor Moon Crystal and the new movie that continues the story.
Inspiring Generation,I’m curious also
Inspiring Generation,It's an anime made for kids to sell toys. Don't expect too much
Inspiring Generation,"I remember the online campaign to get more episodes dubbed after the original dub was cancelled right in the middle of a story arc, which ended up being successful. I stayed up to record them in the early hours of the morning when they finally aired those (at the time) final 17 episodes, then a few years later they dubbed more episodes after the show gained more traction on Toonami. A similar thing happened to Dragon Ball Z, it was cut off in the middle of an arc and then suddenly blew up in popularity in the mind-late 90s because of Toonami, which got the rest of the series dubbed."
Inspiring Generation,"Absolutely, as an 11 year old gayby this show with it's (buried via the DICK dub, but still present) queer stories and androgynous beauties really spoke to me.  I was always fascinated by that episode where Zoicite, one of the homosexual male villains who had his gender changed by the DICK dub, dressed up in drag as sailor moon, and the genuine romance/tragic love story between him and Malachite (or Kunzite in Japanese) was very moving.  I never saw the starlights until I could download the episodes online, but seeing them so comfortable in their own skin as they transformed from attractive young men into attractive young female sailor soldiers was also mind-blowing."
Inspiring Generation,sailor moon was the one thing that made me feel ok about being born a girl. and then when i got to stars it made me realize that (even though i didn’t know the term for it) being trans could potentially be a thing for me and i could be a boy. it was such an important show for me. not only did it make me incredibly happy but it helped me mentally too. been in love with it since it first started airing in the u.s. and i don’t think i’ll ever stop loving it.
Inspiring Generation,Can kind of confirm? I'm trans and thought magical girls were amazing.
Inspiring Generation,"Yeah, most definitely. I think it was the first indicator something was a bit off from the norm for me."
Inspiring Generation,"As I've gotten older, I realize that I had a *huge* crush on Ami/Sailor Mercury when I was a kid and just didn't know it."
Inspiring Generation,"It’s so weird to see teenagers AND their parents wearing DBZ stuff. It’s especially prevalent in the black community. It’s great, but weird."
Inspiring Generation,"Uranus and Neptune, Mars was the one who calls Usagi meatball head and Jupiter was the tomboy"
Inspiring Generation,"Wait Mars and Jupiter? Do you mean Neptune and Uranus? I only watched the non English dubbed versions that didn’t censor (can’t stand English dubs due to poor/low quality voice acting, no offense to any of the fans)."
Inspiring Generation,It is hilarious how much it sound incestuous because they wanted to get rid of the gay by making them cousins. https://youtu.be/nHzjXrEiQqQ
Inspiring Generation,Isn't it only in America they are cousins?
Inspiring Generation,"No, the real reason is that the mangaka has health issues. Fromi drawing manga on a weekly basis for decades, his back is fucked and he spends a lot of time in bed as a result."
Inspiring Generation,"American here that grew up with the English cut and rewatched recently. Wasn’t confused. In fact, quite the opposite. It made all the confusing romantic tension “between cousins” make a lot of sense.

EDIT: Feel like the changes were still pretty common knowledge among Americans watching. I knew about them during or shortly after the original running of it."
Inspiring Generation,"The vast majority of Americans who watched the Sailor Moon airings (on Cartoon Network, Fox Kids, UPN, etc.) watched the DiC cut. Same with Cardcaptor Sakura (renamed Cardcaptors).

Yes, things were changed... but that was extremely normal. Almost every anime that managed to air on TV before Toonami got big was Americanized and edited to appeal to a male audience. Everyone talks about Saban and Power Rangers but they'd been splicing and rewriting shows for over a decade by that point. A lot of 70's/80's cartoons were Americanized animes (Starblazers, Battle of the Planets, etc.). 

If you talk to older people, we really didn't mind. First, it was hard to track down accurate subbed VHS tapes in the 90's so we had to rely on the dubs, even if they were butchered. Second, it was anime and it was on TV. It was a great time for anime in general as the internet fandoms grew from what was airing. Discussion boards were the shit. Third, the changes actually did what they set out to do. This is an unpopular opinion but animes on cable/netwoks back then needed to be edited. Look at Digimon. The script added in jokes and puns that kids would understand and enjoy. Dragonball Z added techno and numetal tracks and leaned heavly into a ""professional wrestling"" vibe for character voices. People make fun of 4Kids and the rest all the time, but the shows they Americanized were extremely successful and the edits convinced networks to pick up their shows. At the end of the day, anime had a platform and therefore an audience.

The DiC version of Sailor Moon was simpler, lighter, and leaned into the girl fads of the day (channeling Clueless). The show needed to air on networks and cable (networks having stricter standards) and the romance between the ""cousins"" had to be cut out. They could never air Revolutionary Girl Utena on Toonami in the 90's/early 00's. This might seem unfortunate, but thanks to airing on cable and broadcast networks, Sailor Moon now has a huge audience."
Inspiring Generation,Is she still meatball-head in the Swedish dub?
Inspiring Generation,"I remember blockbuster having random episodes available to rent on dvd in probably the early 2000s. I learned about the changes that way, because for some reason I had the subtitles on and the subtitles were completely different to what the English dub voices were saying. So I fired up my aol dialup and asked jeeves and learned about all the stuff that was changed for the English dub.  Eventually I ended up with dvds that had both the English and the Japanese versions as well as the sailor stars season that never aired in the us, and I wasn't surprised at that point."
Inspiring Generation,"I have, but my main experience with the non-dub version was the fifth season which wasn't adapted into English until Viz Media got around to it in 2019. I don't really like to watch my anime subbed since subtitled anime can sometimes have difficulty adapting comedic lines and what-not.

I was aware of the many changes DiC and CWi made when adapting the series in North America at a young age but it still did take some getting used to when watching Viz Media's redub. I wasn't surprised by the changes so much as intrigued to see the differences between the two versions. Both adaptations are great in their own merit and I enjoy what they both bring to the table. I personally still prefer the original dub as it is what I remember and the voices are what I immediately think of."
Inspiring Generation,"I grew up watching the original American dub on toonami, and I can say that the only thing that shocked me was voices. I mean, the original Sailor Moon voice actor was way too played up and campy. It actually got super annoying.

As for the other things, tbh I wasn't super shocked by gender switches. Sailor moon and Dragon Ball Z were my gateways into anime, so I knew after a couple years that was something the American market did. I really loved revisiting Sailor Moon later on with the better dub with all the cut content and it was amazing but felt complete. Stories were strange then, and they did a terrible job cutting Neptune and Uranus' connection because even then I knew something was amiss lol. The gender swaps weren't all that surprising either but Fish Eye was the one where I was like ""woah"" they really were pressed by the idea of a male character dressing and being feminine."
Inspiring Generation,I knew they seemed like lovers! They seemed a bit more intimate than family or friends lol even in the North American version.
Inspiring Generation,That's mostly because of the added material in the adaptation.
Inspiring Generation,Tuxedo Mask is pretty useless and never grew beyond that.
Inspiring Generation,I get that he didn't do much else. The funny part was how well he could throw a rose.
Inspiring Generation,"I definitely remember waking up at like 5:30am on one of the weekend days to watch sailor moon. I got up, made myself some cereal and would be ready to watch when it came on at 6am, then another show would come on at 6:30am that I would watch. Then the typical morning cartoon would come on and  I wasn't interested in those, so I would go back to sleep or do something else. Then later it started airing on cartoon network/toonami in the afternoons so I could watch after school. I think it aired on weekday mornings too, but I didn't always wake up early enough to watch."
Inspiring Generation,"Zoids was the shit, it's still going, but I think the newest one is much different?"
Inspiring Generation,"The original DBZ run on toonami had everything up until HALFWAY through the Freeza saga. They’d get to the point they’d start fighting him, then just start over to the Radditz saga. It took forever for them to finally finish it off and then start releasing Cell episodes."
Inspiring Generation,Well that description does sound fun
Inspiring Generation,"The issue with Crystal is that the animation sucks. For what should have been a big thing, it was reduced to a net series with potato quality animation, that got fixed for the bluray. 

Said fixed version isn't on Netflix."
Inspiring Generation,"Give it a shot, the original series has a good newer dub, with the same cast dubbing  Crystal, the remake series.

Remake is on Netflix too."
Inspiring Generation,Right!?
Inspiring Generation,"> A similar thing happened to Dragon Ball Z, it was cut off in the middle of an arc and then suddenly blew up in popularity in the mind-late 90s because of Toonami, which got the rest of the series dubbed.

DBZ aired originally on syndication as was common at the time, this was when Funimation was working with Saban to release episodes. Cartoon Network gave them space to release DBZ episodes and see if they'd catch on, when they did, CN ordered more episodes.



That's also what happened to Sailor Moon. Aired on syndication, got popular on Cartoon Network."
Inspiring Generation,"It is definitely weird but yea I still love to see it and have no complaints! 

I thought I was a fan until I learned how much DBZ means to Latin America. Holy crap!"
Inspiring Generation,"No, the Russians changed it too."
Inspiring Generation,"though i believe its rumored heavily that he has notes set up for how he wants to finish Hunter X Hunter so that if his health goes too far south or he passes, his wife has his blessing and the information she needs to finish it for him"
Inspiring Generation,"That is why I put probably part of the reason, having a rich wife and also being rich yourself makes wanting to work difficult."
Inspiring Generation,"The interesting thing about the ""cousins"" thing is that if you watched the edited version that was aired on Toonami, a lot of those oddly suggestive scenes between Amara and Michelle were cut out completely. But during CWi's dubbing process of S and SuperS, Pioneer Entertainment (the company that would distribute the series on DVD) requested that they dub all the scenes so the DVDs could be dual-audio AKA feature both English and Japanese audio. So CWi's solution? Dub all of the scenes with edited dialogue, cut the scenes that wouldn't fly on Toonami afterwards, and market the full episodes as ""uncut"" on the DVDs."
Inspiring Generation,"I watched Utena a few years ago....good series but yeah, that NEVER would have flown in puritanical 90s kids television haha"
Inspiring Generation,"I remember watching Dragonball, Pokemon, and all the anime that 4kids dubbed on TV. Yes, it was edited heavily and we knew what those edits were, but it was near impossible to watch the original versions unless you knew someone from Japan who would send copies to you or at an anime club at school. 

Thankfully anime has a much wider reach today than it did decades ago. Anime conventions and fandoms once seen as ""nerdy"" are now mainstream. We've gone from heavily edited dubs and fansubs to most series being officially released online hours after it airs on TV."
Inspiring Generation,"> Look at Digimon. The script added in jokes and puns that kids would understand and enjoy. 

To be fair here to Digimon, they still kept in the serious moments. Izzy telling his parents he knew he was adopted, but he still loved them nonetheless? Great in Japanese *and* English. 

But that's because the writers fought like hell to not just make it a comedy."
Inspiring Generation,"No, as an older queer fan I definitely did mind that the DICK dub cut out multiple queer relationships, first with Malachite/Zoicite, who were a gay male couple in the first season, and then with Neptune/Uranus.  Further, a lot of the changes wound up being nonsensical rather then 'necessary.'  For instance, the dub for some reason chose to amp up Rei's hostility to the nth degree, and cut out entire episodes (one with Sailor Venus's backstory, another detailing a beach/ghost story) for no good reason, and came up with a million different names for the legendary silver crystal (i.e. the silver moon crystal, empyrion silver crystal, imperium silver crystal etc. etc.)"
Inspiring Generation,"Was so long since I watched it dubbed, I can't really remember... everyone's voices sound at least 10 years older than they are though, and (just like every other Swedish dub) the language used is pretty old-fashioned."
Inspiring Generation,"Early on he's essentially moral support for Usagi, who can't stop whining. 

After that? he's a damsel in distress."
Inspiring Generation,"Yup! It took me forever to watch the rest of it, I even downloaded some clips in Japanese (from a 56.6k connection oof) of what I now know was the android/cell saga but was so confused about Trunks and older Gohan, but at the time had no clue what the hell was going on haha, where was Goku?!"
Inspiring Generation,"If that sounds fun to you, you’ll be probably be into it. I watched it for some 90s cheese and got a little bit of that, but I was surprised at how legitimately great it was.

Just don’t let the first few episodes turn you off. They’re not bad, but the real show starts when the other girls start appearing. Until then the main draw is plot and Luna snark.

I’ve also heard Sailor Moon Crystal is pretty awful and boring for the first two seasons. It definitely had a different focus as it was trying to be a straight adaptation of the manga, whereas the appeal of the OG was partially the standalone episodes IMO. Use caution."
Inspiring Generation,"This also resulted in Dragon Ball getting completely redubbed (although only 13 episodes were dubbed originally) due to the growing popularity of DBZ. That era of the late 90s and early 2000s was a great time to be an anime fan in the West, since before then it was a struggle to find good content, especially for the penniless teens that were being drip fed sub-par and edited to hell dubs that would sometimes air late at night on Sci Fi."
Inspiring Generation,"Funny enough, his wife is Naoko Takeuchi - the creator of Sailor Moon."
Inspiring Generation,Akio would get edited out entirely lmao
Inspiring Generation,Sometimes the dub will air first before the Japanese
President,"Kal Penn worked in the White House for the Obama administration for a couple of years, so he did have an ""in"" to help land this interview.

It's always been funny to me that we live in a timeline where someone could take a leave from a position in a sitting President's administration to go film *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas*."
President,Would love to see Joe on Between two Ferns personally
President,Kal penn is a safe host for biden. I dont imagine theyd want hasan minhaj there asking real questions or marlon wayans there just inevitably making biden say something weird about black people. Kal can just guide him into not saying anything too dumb
President,I enjoyed Kal Penn on Designated Survivor.
President,hope they announce a permanent host soon!
President,And here comes the softball questions.
President,Thank God it isn’t Korn Pop. That dudes bad
President,It’s only comedy show when it is convenient. It’s easy to see the double standard here.
President,Life imitating art
President,Buncha softball BS PR stunt. Not worth watching.
President,"curious to see how Penn does on the daily show...he def has the political knowledge, but his comedy output is def more on the cheesy/corny side (i might also be biased, the only thing ive seen him in recently is that santa clause disney plus show lol, where he is a complete ham)"
President,"Voted for the guy, but I really hope this isn't just Kal sucking up to him. They should take him to task on screwing over the railroad union."
President,Bunch of softball questions with a random impassioned and amazingly ignorant rant about taking away guns.
President,Climate change the hot topic? Not out of control housing costs?  Food costs? CoL in general?
President,Nothing but softball questions and compliments. Not even surprising. I guess you have to get a Republican on there for there to be a real interview.
President,I’m sure some tough questions will be asked
President,I’m sure that only the toughest questions will be asked!
President,What a schmooze fest that’s going to be.
President,I hope they go with Sarah Silverman. She’s already politically inclined. Tried to do a similar thing with that America series. And Fox already hates her.
President,"I kind of like this rotating host system they have going on. That said, if they do make the change to 1 permanent host, it needs to be Hasan Minhaj."
President,So it's more of a reelection campaign commercial with The Daily Show label.
President,“Lands”. As though it wasn’t all strategically planned.
President,pointless to interview any President when the interviewer is a puppet for the administration
President,The one interview for the year. Won’t see him again after this.
President,Great score. Really happy to see this.
President,who wants to take bets on the youtube vote ratio
President,Daily Show ain't what it used to be for sure
President,"So wild to me how much of a big deal it is to get an interview with the President in the USA, in my country (Australia) the Prime Minister has to do an interview everyday, and generally does more than that, and pretty much every question why are you so shit, and they just have to laugh it off every single day"
President,TIL Kal Penn is hosting The Daily Show
President,Didn’t Kal Penn also serve under the Obama Administration?
President,Don’t even need to watch this to know all the questions are going to be softballs.
President,Oh the propaganda channel got the interview? How unexpected
President,Absolutely riveting.  I’m sure it will smash records.
President,I'm shocked a democrat would risk going on this show.
President,"Well, don’t expect any harder hitting question than “what is your morning routine?”"
President,Kal Penn is such a hack. He hasn't been interesting since Harold and Kumar.
President,"“This is a job I want, I want people to know I want this job”

I see you Kal. I was pulling for Hasan but his guest host week didn’t really blow me away. I think he’d need to switch the shows format up a bit more so he can be more dynamic like Patriot Act. Looking forward to what Kal has up his sleeve"
President,He's a friendly.
President,Imagine if we had Hasan Minhaj. He would have went straight for the jugular instead of h to see softball questions. Hope he gets the full time gig.
President,"The whole interview is unwatchable, gladly I only saw a few clips to see how bad it was. Kal Penn sitting there like he's learning something new or amazed at his statements was laughable. 

Kal's job in Obama admin was a joke of a title, look it up."
President,don’t forget he left House M.D. for the White House gig.
President,I watched the first season of Designated Survivor. Pretty cool he actually had real world experience for that role.
President,"> where someone could take a leave from a position in a sitting President's administration to go film *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas*.

And bless them for letting him"
President,"Guy took administrative leave from the white house to get filmed getting his dick stuck to an icy pole

Honestly I just respect the grind."
President,"Wow I did not know he took a leave to go film that. More power to this guy, he’s always been a wholesome dude from what I can tell. Looking forward to the interview."
President,Kumar cutting his pubes with Harold's scissors to making his way all the way to the white house. Kal has an interesting career.
President,"Especially when the person is incredibly well rounded, intelligent, and charismatic, rather than a disgrace lol."
President,A competitor between Zach and Joe to see who can invade the others' personal space the most
President,Hasan really took the Shark Tank guy to task over FTX. I hope they go with him as the new host cause that's a tough act to beat.
President,"Kal Penn worked in the Obama White House, he probably has a hand in setting it up. And how can you call him ‘safe’ when we’ve not even seen him host?"
President,I love Biden and voted for him but he can be too candid at times. Personally I think it is part of his charm but people have used it against him in the past. I'm not sure Kal Penn will 100% prevent that but he couldn't hurt.
President,They're planning on doing this until the fall so I wouldn't expect an announcement until the summer.
President,It’ll be Roy Wood Jr and Mayim Bialik splitting the hosting duties
President,I’m fully expecting Roy Wood Jr. to be the permanent host.
President,"Well, I believe Biden has until 2024 at least."
President,Would want to see more Wanda Sykes tbh.
President,It's the Daily Show are you expecting journalism?
President,[deleted]
President,And why are you expecting hard hitting questions from the Daily Show?!
President,"Softball questions or not, focusing a portion of the interview on LGBT rights was good for the country, good for the program, good for Kal Penn, and good for Biden and Democrats."
President,"Yeah, its only worth watch if they have a Republican on. That's the only time they ask the hard questions."
President,"If it were Jon Stewart’s new show, he’d grill tf out of him. That show is excellent"
President,I don't think Biden knows much about softball... but I wonder if he'd be able to make contact against someone like Jenny Finch.. I'm guessing no. But I guess that's why we ask these questions.
President,they've been playing that game for a long time
President,"Yeah I hope the actor who used to work for Biden when he was VP does a good job taking him to task on the Comedy Central TV show, too"
President,You'll see harder pitches at tee-ball games.
President,It’s the daily show dude. It’s a comedy show.
President,"brave of you to admit that at this point.  most qualify it with an 'i really wanted ______'.  if you say Bernie, you'll get reddit karma btw."
President,"Why lol, it’s basically a comedy show. It will be as tough as Fox “News” questioning a republican.

Both are „entertainment” channels."
President,"I think the Hulu series ended after one season because she didn’t want to continue. I might be wrong. If I’m right, that indicates to me that she doesn’t want to spend most of her time on something like this. 

But I hope I’m wrong; she was great."
President,"She has been my favorite so far. Leslie Jones was great, too. Did not like Marlon Wayans or DL Hughley. Any others would be good imo."
President,"I liked that show, but it was around the time when there was like a dozen political comedy shows, they’re mostly all gone now though"
President,I feel bad because Kal Penn is great and deserving of his own show--but not The Daily Show. I think Hasan comes the closest to Jon Stewart and his energy.
President,People aren't puppets because they disagree with you.
President,This show airs on Comedy Central. It’s not journalism.
President,"Yep as Obama Administration's ""Principal Associate Editor for Public Engagement"" before going on to play a similar role in 2016 on the TV-Drama 'Designated Survivor'

 So really just a soft-ball interview by a familiar friend of the Administration handed to the Daily Show to be spoon fed *erm* I mean aired to their audience."
President,"I think it was rather sudden departure too, was he the character that the writers Unalived himself?"
President,He also helped Lex Luthor try to kill Superman.
President,Holy shit it's thingy form House!!
President,[removed]
President,Same. Seeing him as a host made me remember how good he was on Patriot Act… it’s a shame that got canceled.
President,"Agreed, thought it was awesome too. I actually thought the shark tank guy was pretty impressive too, he rolled with the interview and actually looked like he enjoyed the back and forth. Maybe an act but he did good getting his point across too."
President,"Hasan is 100% John Stewart's spiritual successor. He's great and is only going to improve with age.

John Stewart was 33 when he took over The Daily Show and it took him a while to find his groove.

Hasan is 37 now and very much hitting his stride.

Hasan could bring back The Daily Show in a big way."
President,They won't. The corporate overlords will want someone safe.
President,Yea agreed he’s exactly what the show should be but also a liability to interview biden on a temporary contract
President,"Because to reddit, anyone who isn't an angry, extreme liberal who's going to blatantly attack anything that isn't left enough for them is ""too safe"" while they reframe TDS as a hard hitting liberal circle jerk session instead of.. a comedy show.

Basically they want Hassan Minaj screaming about how Republicans are Nazis and anything less is ""too safe"""
President,"Shot:

>Kal Penn worked in the Obama White House

Chaser:

>And how can you call him 'safe'"
President,How often do you think they call Jon Stewart and offer him more money?
President,Has Al Franken been on yet? He and Silverman were the only 2 I was interested in.
President,"Not OP, but when I watched the daily show with John Stewart, whenever they interviewed politicians, local or otherwise, they usually either gave them awkward questions, or (more likely) edited the interview to make the politician look a little foolish or out of touch.

As you say, people watch the Daily show for entertainment, this feels like little more than pandering and trying to make Biden 'connect' with the younger voters. Not expecting much from the interview and I doubt they do anything that will make Biden look silly."
President,"I wish I could expect it to be non partisan 

Think they would toss a republican softballs?"
President,They seem interested in real journalism when it's something targeting conservatives.
President,"Nahhhh, this sub can’t have it both ways. You all talk about Daily Show and John Oliver being team journalism but then, if any criticism comes up, you immediately revert back to “it’s just a comedy show”.

Edit: downvotes prove I’ve hit a sensitive spot"
President,reddit moment
President,"Before the 24 hour news cycle blew up, news became partisan, and networks needed to play ball to retain access to political figures, journalists would regularly challenge any and all political figures. 

So yeah, back to THOSE good old days when the FCC fairness doctrine was still in place.

EDIT - But to be fair, The Daily Show couldn't exist with the fairness doctrine in place. Or would have to be more directly a parody."
President,When was the last time Biden did an interview with a non allied interviewer?
President,If you’re talking about Trump then I would say that Biden isn’t that much better.
President,"If Daily Show are going to invite politicians they should at least try to ask tough questions rather than kissing their asses.

If not then don’t invite them."
President,[removed]
President,"yeah when it's convenient, it's a comedy show"
Jumping Girl,[deleted]
Jumping Girl,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Jumping Girl,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Jumping Girl,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Jumping Girl,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Jumping Girl,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Jumping Girl,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Jumping Girl,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Jumping Girl,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Jumping Girl,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Jumping Girl,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Jumping Girl,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Jumping Girl,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Jumping Girl,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Jumping Girl,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Jumping Girl,🙂💕
Jumping Girl,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Jumping Girl,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Jumping Girl,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Jumping Girl,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Jumping Girl,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Jumping Girl,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Jumping Girl,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Jumping Girl,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Jumping Girl,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Jumping Girl,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Jumping Girl,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Jumping Girl,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Jumping Girl,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!

Jumping Girl,"Being awful, always and on purpose, is a fun quirk. - Gina Linetti, Brooklyn 99"
Jumping Girl,"These are all comedies that have a history of outlandish moments and stories. I don't think anyone should be looking at these shows for ""good messages"" and if they are, they're the ones who are at fault. Majority of conedies throughout history have fucked up shit, but they're not supposed to be taken seriously.

Finding these ""bad messages"" in more grounded dramas would be a better talking point for you imo. Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay."
Jumping Girl,">It is better for 100 people to regret not having kids than even one person regret having kids.

What the fuck."
Jumping Girl,If you are looking at TV for a “message” you are probably a loser. Fact.
Jumping Girl,"Everyone always talks about how horrible Ted is, but no one calls out Lilly on her problematic behavior, for some ungodly reason."

Jumping Girl,"Why is everything numbered ""1""?"
Jumping Girl,I liked how the author cited the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in a complaint about iCarly
Jumping Girl,"> Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay.

I think this is more a judgment on certain members of the audience than it is the show. In Gilmore Girls, all of the various characters make errors but they still remain protagonists. Nor does the show flinch from showing the negative consequences of their actions.

So when you hear people who are re-evaluating the characters, they're not really making statements about the show so much as their own failure to understand it on first viewing. Even worse, they're re-evaluating on the naive and simplistic premise that good people can't also be flawed people."
Jumping Girl,"Having messed up messages is more problematic when the subject matter at hand is  family/kids shows since kids will actually take the messages to heart many times. While messed up messages in adult programming is still bad because it's meant to be taken more seriously and should have more complex stories and messages, I don't think it's as much of an issue there because adults typically don't carry as many messages from shows as kids do, and they can usually use their own logic to identify when a message is bad and why it is bad. 

Many of these examples are from kids/family shows so I think they're reasonable arguments to be made."
Jumping Girl,People constantly talked about how Lily is literally the worst and Marshall deserves better when it was airing.
Jumping Girl,"I do not think that any of these shows are inherently bad, they are good shows that have bad moments."
Jumping Girl,What are you talking about?
Jumping Girl,"Your list of 10 things are all numbered ""1"", instead of 10, 9, 8..., I assumed it was intentional and had a meaning I was missing, or it was an inside joke on the sub or something."
Jumping Girl,"From my end it looks like they are numbered 1, 2 ,3 ,4 in that order. 

I do not know why it isn't that way on your end."
Jumping Girl,"Huh, that's weird af. Maybe it's because I'm on mobile. Idk."
Jumping Girl,"Artificially creating conflict due to characters acting like idiots is one of the quickest way to turn me off a story.

The worst offender is two characters who could avoid some big conflict or misunderstanding by simply letting each other talk without interrupting them. ""Honey, it's not what it.."" ""No! I don't want to hear it!"" ""But.."" ""Get out!""

Drives me nuts."
Jumping Girl,"My favourite trope to hate is when someone, against all odds, gets back to base to warn of the impending danger for the danger itself to occur seconds after the message was delivered. So what was the point of the last ten minutes?

My other (and it’s a Star Trek staple) is when they have a painstaking decision to sacrifice the few to save the many and before the decision can be made it resolves itself or the decision is taken out of their hands."
Jumping Girl,"sure , in Dawson's Creek, Pacey and Andie were great together and for each other

but the writers wanted her out of they way so Joey and Pacey could start their romance

so they decided Andie woukd cheat on Pacey. and that was totally out of character for her, made zero sense."
Jumping Girl,"I feel like an adjacent trope I hate is when they introduce a new character just so that they can kill them off for a cheap emotional beat. I'm not talking about when a story begins with a characters death and that is the inciting incident for the rest of the narrative, or when a longtime character get killed and it is a very emotional event. It only really bugs me when in a random episode they introduce this new character that is fleshed out and more complex than your average guest character, and the protagonist makes this really strong connection to them because their personalities obviously mesh really well, but they are doing all that just so they can kill them off right away for a quick bit of drama that doesn't end up tying into any greater narrative."
Jumping Girl,I will say that doing something dumb and dying/almost dying because of it is very accurate to how I play the halo games
Jumping Girl,"Drama for the sake of drama and stretching for time is my least favorite trope in storytelling.

It’s half the reason Ted Lasso was such a breath of fresh air, they handled problems like adults and the writers didn’t lean on misunderstandings to fuel episodes of drama."
Jumping Girl,Irl asteroid fields all the big rocks are super far apart
Jumping Girl,"It does bother me, because it means it's not good writing if it's noticeable."
Jumping Girl,it bothers me more why there are normal cars and normal weapons on other planets.
Jumping Girl,"What OP is describing in the title is often described in writing as when plot drives character, instead of character driving plot. It's a very frustrating thing.

But the actual descriptions in the text don't even seem like that necessarily. Just kind of mindless action?"
Jumping Girl,[deleted]
Jumping Girl,"This is particular doesn't bother me. What bothers me is when a writer kills off a character or humiliates them because the truth is that character represents someone the writer doesn't like. 

I think it's really, really weird behavior."
Jumping Girl,"I didn't mind the recklessness of MC, only because it closely represents how I played the Halo games. lol"
Jumping Girl,Burn Gorman (Torchwood)*
Jumping Girl,"Both of the moments you mention are for the sake of character moments for Kwan. She’s from a dustball planet, she’s awestruck by everything. I understand the asteroid complaint, but few shows get space travel right, and Chief is pretty competent so it didn’t bother me."
Jumping Girl,Did anyone else notice how he had to dramatically navigate an asteroid field that basically hides/protects this (I assume) secret base but then when he leaves he just flew out slowly in a straight line with no obstacles? If I’m the enemy I’m coming in that way.
Jumping Girl,"The cable car thing was so odd because it wasn't obvious that the characters would even notice much of anything.

They obviously have artificial gravity in the cable car (for the sake of easy filming, if nothing else), so they wouldn't have any sense of feeling like they were falling.  The wire is overhead, and any mechanism for attaching to the overhead wire would be on the roof, out of sight.  The cut to an external shot to show big dramatic arms swooping into place had to be _an external shot_ because you couldn't see what has happening very well from inside the cabin.  And there's just zero logic to why somebody would engineer those big arms rather than some mechanism on the roof for that application.

The whole moment existed only for the viewer with zero internal logic from the characters' perspective, the story, the universe.  You don't learn anything about the way things work in-general in that setting.  You could cut it out and nobody would notice anything missing.  The show would have just been a bit cheaper to produce because nobody would have needed to make that VFX shot.

Dodging asteroids seemed pretty much the same.  No reason for the sequence within the fictional setting.  It's as if the character was told to just do some dumb shit that looks dangerous to fill some B-Roll that they could cut into a reality TV show.  Just slow down?  Or if the character is confident that they have a calculated flight path so there's no need to slow down, don't portray it as some dangerous moment if it's basically just him reading the paper while the computer flies with plenty of margin or error.  It's like if a character in a contemporary movie ran out into the street to dodge cars in traffic.  You could make a scenario where that could be explained.  But if you just have him run out into traffic for no reason, you'll wonder why he didn't just walk on the sidewalk."
Jumping Girl,"Unlimited budget meets limited writing.  When you have the money it’s easy to punch in a 30 second diversion from the main plot, probably an idea that a producer fell in love with.  Much easier than having to write more dialogue for a scene."
Jumping Girl,"Spartans have incredible reflexes/brain processing speed (their reactions speeds average around 5-10x faster than regular humans - around 20 milliseconds vs 150+ for regular humans). What seems scary to a normal human is not scary to a Spartan. 

Also, stopping and slowing down in an asteroid field has it's own risks. 

I'd agree if it was a normal human doing it, but in Chief's mind he wasn't really taking a huge risk due to his experience/reflexes.

I do agree on your second point though...if it was me I would have noped out of that tram ride yesterday."
Jumping Girl,"Generally very much agree. But to be fair to Halo every one of the games is very much like this too. MC is prepared to die at any minute and so he’s often doing near-suicidal feats because it’s the only way to save xyz group of people or prevent humanity from losing xyz battle, and of course he always pulls it off.

Generally this is one of the worst attributes of modern tv shows but it does seem to make a little more sense for Halo than it does for a show like GoT for instance"
Jumping Girl,Have you watched The Walking Dead?
Jumping Girl,"On the asteroid count I agree,  but with the cable car I think it was easy to overlook they're potentially in a zero-g environment because no one really takes to explain how the artifical gravity works. Otherwise I saw that scene as how ramshackle an unorganised place like that truly was - given they have no government or police (and presumably no health and safety)"
Jumping Girl,"I liked Book of Boba Fett, but the scene where he flies the Firespray into the Sarlacc Pit was the dumbest thing ever. He'd already crawled out of the pit in his armor - why would he go looking inside? Dumb decision to set up a dumb action scene."
Jumping Girl,"When is a risk ever ""necessary"" though? It goes against the definition of the word."
Jumping Girl,"Yeah, like who in real life would run around unprotected from a deadly virus when there's a free, easily administered solution?"
Jumping Girl,"The asteroid thing was weird to you? Because that felt so in character for Master Chief to me. Like straight out of Halo 2 where he decides the nest way to deliver a bomb back to the enemy is to launch himself into space with no planning or means or course correcting once he's out of the ship. Just winging it, adjusting to the circumstances, and making the best of it while being a bit of cheesy action hero. That's Master Chief, baby!"
Jumping Girl,At a certain point you need to realize that it’s entertainment and you need to not look at these things so critically/literally. It doesn’t break anything and provides something cool/fun to look at.
Jumping Girl,"People do risky things in real life so not taking the exact logical option is not bad writing, but the writer needs to do the work to establish the character's personality and setup up the scenario as a risk worth taking for the character. When characters make out of character decisions that just lead to disaster it is very frustrating in general yes."
Jumping Girl,"I don't mind unnecessary risks, some people are addrenaline junkies. Ofc depends on how stupid the risk is still. It's more when people don't act like themselves, or don't seem to think at all, when they clearly have time to think."
Jumping Girl,"I feel like it's common to see it in video games, but doesn't translate well to video"
Jumping Girl,The second example especially made no sense at all. There’s zero chance someone would design a transport method where you’re supposed to basically shoot out into space and *hope* you have something to catch onto afterwards.
Jumping Girl,"I literally roll my eyes every time I see main characters struggling on the edge of a cliff. Especially when its in the middle of an ep. Like, there is half an episode left, who are you kidding. If they were gonna kill you off like that, it'd be at the end of the episode."
Jumping Girl,Just gonna leave [this](https://youtu.be/XqtjKu3GHIw) here
Jumping Girl,I will never understand why they didn't tell the story a fire team living the plot of Halo 1 with Chief as a supporting character.
Jumping Girl,"Stupid decision I thought chief made was walking around like a goober without his helmet on. You’re on an enemy space station, you’re clearly a spartan and you have an ancient alien artifact in your hand, but sure don’t put your helmet on. Just walk around with both handsfull. One hand full of an armour stopping helmet that would probably work better on your damn head. Some insurrectionist could just pop chief in the head and doom humanity before they even found the halo rings."
Jumping Girl,"What do House and the DC movies have in common?

Exposition being interrupted by excitement (House interrupts convos with a code or loss of sight or I can’t feel my legs, DC interrupts exposition with EXPLOSION!!!!)"
Jumping Girl,I like the show for what it is but it is very cliche.
Jumping Girl,Cant wait to see cinemasins talk about this one.
Jumping Girl,Sounde like some of the business decisions by a buddy.
Jumping Girl,No. The vast majority of risk taking is not *necessary*. Why the fuck would that be the standard? The question should instead be: does it bother you when they take *unreasonable* risks? The answer is yes.
Jumping Girl,this is foundation
Jumping Girl,Companies follow the trend of what does well with the general audiences. Expect more shows like these in the future.
Jumping Girl,Yes.
Jumping Girl,"Hey, sometimes you gotta have a cliffhanger.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MwlN1pkxRI"
Jumping Girl,"And in old sitcoms it was usually a little kid in the middle of the situation. Two adults would be arguing about something, and the kid would have information about that thing, which would end the argument. But the adults would just keep telling him to be quiet and not interrupt. Then they'd find out the truth, usually on their own, and ask the kid why he didn't say anything. ""I kept trying to tell you Dad, but you wouldn't listen!"""
Jumping Girl,">two characters who could avoid some big conflict or misunderstanding by simply letting each other talk

That always feels so forced"
Jumping Girl,"In the movie Juliette, Naked there are 2 scenes where a character says “wait, I can explain” and the other person actually waits and gets the explanation and they move on. It actually floored me and made me hate it even more when it doesn’t happen in other things."
Jumping Girl,"> Artificially creating conflict due to characters acting like idiots is one of the quickest way to turn me off a story.

The CW is offended at this statement"
Jumping Girl,"Ted Lasso is so much the opposite of this trope, I love it"
Jumping Girl,I just saw Morbiaus. Really seems like if Morbiaus just explained that he accidently made himself a vampire and thought he could fix ot then most of the conflict would resolve itself. He is dangerous so he would be kept locked up.but they would keep him alive and if not let him.experiment on himself have somebody else do it
Jumping Girl,"the final seasons of game of thrones required everyone to take idiot potions.

it stood out even more because in previous seasons when characters made stupid choices  it actually fit their characters and they often got punished for it"

Birdseye chillies are native to Mexico. Also the article misspells the plural of chilli."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"It was a bad episode, but I hate all this talk about Bake Off being on some sort of downturn. I watch the show for the good vibes, charming bakers, and cool bakes. Why do people insist on stoking a bunch of drama around it?"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Can you imagine if they told them to make dulce de Leche with a can in the technical? That would have been great fucking TV lol.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,The old lady peeling the avocado IS Iconic!!!!!
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I thought for a second it was the Mexican version of the  show but still called ""Great British Bake Off""."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"If anyone has ever tried Mexican food in Europe, this should be no surprise. It is absolutely insane how Mexico has one of the best cuisines ON THE PLANET and it gets botched so thoroughly anywhere outside of the Western Hemisphere. 

Mexico has such fantastic food, PLEASE try it Europe."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"It was dumb to have a technical that doesn't involve any baking, but other than that, I thought it was a good episode."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I’m half Mexican and I didn’t find the show particularly racist or offensive, except to good taste. Matt Lucas’ bad, hacky jokes and the taco challenge were pretty cringe. It’s like they didn’t do any research at all because there are plenty of other Mexican baked goods they could have done for the technical. Heck, even if not baked, I find tamales to be a huge PITA to get the texture right and they take hours to make so perhaps that wouldn’t have been fitting with the show’s limits. Sweet tamales are a big thing in Mexico too. 
My Central American roots think empanadas would have been a pretty good challenge too. Heck, they could have made the episode “Latin American” themed to cover more options. 

I still like the show and will continue watching it but this seems like it was a missed opportunity to highlight some amazing cuisine from Mexico to Argentina."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"There are literally dozens of other baked goods they could have made instead of fucking tacos, that part was delusional. I liked the idea of a Tres Leches Cake but again they were nothing like what you would get at a mexican bakery here in the states.  


It was a decent episode, but they could have at least had a mexican baker as a consult to help them make it reasonably good."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,I will never accept jokes about American cultural ignorance from a Brit ever again.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,This reeks of the same shit that happened after the Japanese episode
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"The dragging on Twitter has been delightful. The perfect thing to fall on Hispanic Heritage month as it gives us all something to laugh at. Episode was mostly harmless, but good god England"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I just took it as a Mexican-themed episode, not a tribute to authentic Mexican cuisine. How could it ever be that with a room full of amateur British pastry chefs? What a bizarre controversy."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,">Beyond being grievously offensive to Mexico, its people, and its culture

Good lord. This English fancy lad should talk to some actual Mexicans or Tejanos. ""Grievously offensive"". A shame he doesn't live in the US, because then he wouldn't have to put out this shlock to pay off the loans for his apparently useless journalism degree!

Part of the fun of watching this show is watching the parochial people on that side of the pond flail comically at some of our food in other places. But young people, often hopelessly rootless and alienated ones, tend to cling desperately to the only cultural signifiers they have, like culinary culture, as fetishes to be jealously possessed rather than a source of joy to be shared and enjoyed. And yes that includes watching hapless brits screw it up!"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"As a Mexican, I could not stop cringing from how corny and fucking stupid the humor was."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Eh. I thought there was a fair amount of ignorance when it comes to Mexican food (not quite sure if Paul is clear of the difference between a taco and a tortilla but whatever). It was a little aggravating to see some of my favorite things get trampled on by people who don’t know what they are doing but that’s just part of these shows. I don’t know how to prepare a lot of dishes from far off countries and I’m in the kitchen cooking 5-6 days a week. My only experience on the UK was a rainy bus ride from Gatwick to Heathrow so I’m not qualified to speak to the number of Mexican restaurants or even Tex-mex, cali-mex or any other local American version of the food available in the country to use for comparison. 

Also amusing, fajitas are technically a Tex-mex dish made by Mexican ranch workers who got paid in meat (usually less desirable parts like the skirt). Not a Mexican one. Similar but not the same."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Where did I put the glocky-molo?
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"This article is ridiculous. It takes small random things and tries to make it out to have had more screen time than a second. These are not professional bakers,  the REASON we watch them is that they are imperfect, they don't know everything.  There are shows with all pro's competing against each other.  People watch this show because the mistakes can be entertaining as well as making the accomplishments delightful. They were NOT disrespectful at all in the show. Geez, everyone has to go after everything these days. It was a show of inexperienced bakers, who were NOT racist in any way, doing the thing we watch the show in the first place for."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,People acting like Mexican week was the worst are ignoring the blatant hate crime that was the pizza signature bake.

The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"""Tack-ohs""  My ears were bleeding."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"If anyone went into that episode expecting anything more than fumbling attempts at Mexican cuisine, well, that’s on you. I grew up in the Southwest steeped in Mexican and native culture which I doubt the average Brit gets to experience short of extensive travel, and still couldn’t make a proper taco or pastry. It just made me want to go to that Mexican bakery the next town over and pick up some Marranitos."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"On a side note - I thought the weirdest thing was the older pink-haired chick staying and Rebs getting the boot instead.

Rebs' cake must have been just terrible, like beyond inedible.  The other lady was was dead last in each of the other challenges."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Who uses the word nadir?
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I think the show has lost it. 

Mel and Sue, and Mary, have been replaced by people really charmless. A guy who dates teenagers, a guy mostly famous for doing blackface and making fun of the poor and disabled. Which would matter less if they managed to be funny but they aren’t- it’s just intensely self satisfied mugging. 

And Prue - who is a massive tory (and her son is literally one of the worst MPs in the Commons). Have disliked her intensely since Great British Menu. Probably the least likeable mainstream TV personality out there. 

The fun of the show should be in seeing amateurs and hobbyists make high-end, complex or classic baked goods, the stuff you might come across but have no idea what would actually go into making it. I have zero interest in ‘make a replica of your nan’s garden out of a [insert cake]’. I think the curveball stuff they’d have saved for the finale in previous years is just every week now. 

I think some shows just end up feeling out of step with the times, Bake off is one."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"For one, why were they making tacos on a baking show…? Two, I’ve never been to a Mexican food place that puts refried beans on a taco. Not even that, refried beans are typically made with pinto beans, but they gave them black beans…???"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Wut. The episode might not have been the best ever, but it was still a decent episode.

The only episode of this show that sucked imo was when that young female finalist a couple seasons ago (sry can't remember her name) had a breakdown over her bakes going badly. That was pretty gloomy to watch."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I mean if it was the 1950s I could see this as them saying ""yep, nothing at all wrong here. "". But one thing I noted in the UK, there aren't Latinos, no Mexican food. But Indian food and Jamaican was readily available. Halal. Just a different part of the world. Contrast that with our ignorance of Indians."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"From the article:

>Why does this show not want to teach people anything?

I would posit that a big part of the appeal of the show is I *don't have to learn anything*. I can put it on, stare at pleasant people making food, and comment that ""that probably tastes amazing"" to my roommate. When I want to learn stuff in my programming, I watch different shows."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,This smacks of an offended person looking for things to get offended about.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"This person obviously hates the show and took this bad episode to try and take them down I guess? There are plenty of shows that can teach you things, this is just a light hearted competition show that has amateurs trying to make things. There is zero nefarious action here."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Being a in a blended family of Mexican Americans, was super damn disappointed. Like seriously, a big mustache on a cake is NOT racist? Uh, not cool, and from a POC too. And then, don't get me talking about the tacos. Tacos are NOT baked, nor do they belong on a baking contest. It shows a sincere lack of engagement with the Mexican culture."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Was the worst 🤣
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,The only thing that really got me was the Taco competition. There was barely any baking. It was all stovetop.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,I remember the “Japan” week lmao
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"""One does not bake a taco."" Yes!!! I kept screaming at my TV during this segment."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Clearly, they need to stick to bakes from cultures Britain has occupied in one point in history. Mexican bakeries have some AMAZING foods in very vibrant colors and flavors this was an awesome opportunity squandered."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"You guys remember the American episode? Where Paul Hollywood spent the entire time bashing pies, they all of them made a tart, not a pie, in the most disgusting flavor combinations you've ever heard of, and then agreed it's because American pies are inherently terrible?"

The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Do people really think the show is not good any more?  I mostly watch it because my wife likes it, but honestly it's the only baking show I can stomach, but I haven't noticed a significant difference in the show now compared to the early days.  I think Noel and Sandi were the best hosts, but I'm not sure the appeal of the show is necessarily the hosts."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"This is all overblown just like the asian week a few seasons ago. Yes it’s cringey british interpretation of mexican cuisine, what do you expect? They’re nowhere near mexico. The show is still all charm, so what if they’re silly and have extremely british takes on food from other places."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"It wasn't a great episode, but this article is ridiculous"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"There was nothing offensive about this episode, stop the bullshit."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,I think you need to be the race or identity that is supposedly offended before you can write about the supposed offense. This being offended on behalf of others is actually offense appropriation. And is NOT ok. *literally shaking intensifies*
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Nadir? So it’s getting better again?
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"All in all it wasn’t as bad as social media made it out to be, there were definitely some terrible stereotypes there’s no getting around that but I wouldn’t call it the downfall of the show. That woman peeling an avocado though…. I wanted to climb through my TV and smack her."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Not seen the episode so only a limited understanding of what went on in the show.

But is this really that offensive? It feels in this overly sensitive age we are giving ammunition to the right. This makes them feel justified in calling us snowflakes and saying the left is ridiculous. 

And that means there is room for genuine racism and other bigotry to slip in which is unacceptable.

Sterotypes can be in poor taste, or sometimes something fun. There are many about the English, bad food, poor food etc yet those who make those are not said to be racist and I am not sure the Mexican stereotypes are either."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"It's pretty gross, though, the number of people who reacted to this trainwreck by saying stuff along the lines of ""white people shouldn't cook Mexican food."" Food is food (and Mexicans be white anyway). Let's stop with food-related racism.

The episode itself may have gone poorly but I like the idea of them branching out. Like, okay, Victorian sponge, jaffa cakes, hobnobs, fraisier cakes, over and over again. It's good to have a little variety. The main problem was there wasn't much *baking* happening. Why did they have to make guacamole?? 

Also the people throwing fucking hissyfits about them not saying stuff like taco correctly?? It's called a regional accent. And there's one person who was like ""They're practically next door to Spain and they can't pronounce these things correctly"" like??? They're pretty far apart from each and also, again, accents. 

If I were in charge I think I would've done an international bread week instead of this. Like for the first round they have to make traditional Irish soda bread, the technical is challah, and the showstopper is Norwegian Skolebrød. All of it involves baking, nobody has to figure out how to open an avocado (but why wouldn't you look up how to do that beforehand? They're told what the challenges for the episode except for the technical are a week ahead of time, wouldn't you figure ""gee it's Mexico week, maybe I should look up how to open an avocado *just in case*""??)"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Huh what a weird article to make
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,They have the fucking worst jokes. Why the hell would you put a little Britain star as a main stake of this show.!??? They have no jokes that are family friendly and sound like a dummy when they deliver
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,So far!
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"So is it an inaccurate stereotype or cultural appropriation? It can't be both.

(edit: I'm well aware that at the very least it's blinkered, ignorant bullshit)"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,People are so sensitive
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"The way people lose their minds over a show about baking cakes astounds me. I've seen about ten threads on Reddit about Mexican week. People need to accept the show for what it is, and get out more."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Honestly enjoying the show as much today as the first season, idk what the hubbub is about. One meh episode a “nadir of downturn” does not make, and there have been PLENTY of less exciting episodes. It’s a feel good, fun show that just doesn’t require this sort of critical eye to me. Honestly, who cares?"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"This whole article is terribly cringe and dramatic. GBBO is far from a “fall from grace”.

The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"It was a poor choice. The contestants had no idea what tacos should taste like. Mexican food is the opposite of English food.

While Asian and Africans from the Old World have brought their food traditions to the New World as well as Europe, Mexican—and Latin American cuisine overall has not made it out, likely due to migration patterns. 

Ingredients have, but not techniques or recipes."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Prue kill another kitten?
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Japan week was pretty bad: pandas and kowai cake. 

Pandas have never lived in Japan, and ""kowai cake"" is ""scary cake"". (They meant ""kawaii cake"", or ""cute cake"".) Great Canadian Baking Show made the same blunder with ""kowai cake""."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,TL;DR: ***Stop liking what I don't like!!!***
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I just couldn’t get over the fact that their “refried beans” were just beans and onions cooked in a pot and then put on the taco. The refried part was non-existent. I was expecting them to get judged on the fact that no one actually did the refried part, but then it wasn’t even mentioned. Churros would have been a way better technical."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"The only thing that was a ""disappointment"" was Rebs not getting voted off earlier, and I didn't have the actual tacos in front of me. It was a weird episode for sure, but I've watched far worse things than an usually charming one show doing something slightly different."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I feel like the hate for this episode was wildly overblown? I watched the episode expecting absolute disaster from what I had heard all week, and it was just fine? Some of the jokes were naïve/ignorant, but I didn't feel like there was anything mean-spirited about anything they did."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,As an American I absolutely loved watching British folk try and mostly fail to cook Mexican food. The show is still great. The contestants last season were better (THE JURGENATOR!!) but the show is fine.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,I mean besides the single joke at the beginning and the fact they made tacos which didn't require baking at all was weird but this is just a silly article
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Nadir is weirdly the word of the week. Covid, GBBO, etc."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,The real hate crime was what they did to my cultures food. They could have made them make so many different things but it got left on the sidelines
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,They were fine
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I stopped watching last series , is it still good… my interest waned, can’t put my finger on it , maybe it’s just run it’s course ? Or are people still loving it ?"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,so far.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I think this is a bit of an exaggeration. Fall from grace? Hardly. Lazy writing and poorly thought out challenges? Absolutely. 

Aside from the horrible pronunciation of some of the bakes and a misunderstanding of the concept of a taco, it feels like the production team didn’t know quite what to do with Mexican week but went on with it anyway. That’s a shame because these assignments were stupid and didn’t send the right people home. Carole should have left weeks ago.

But yes, the stereotyping wasn’t funny and the assignments bad. Just a bad episode and hope they will do better. Dessert week was already lots better so it goes to show: stick with what you know."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I’m Mexican and this was hilarious, I was literally cracking up with my friends. Thank you for making this entertaining shows! ❤️ Made my night 🤣

And of course we Mexicans don’t take offense! Mexican cuisine is designated by UNESCO as a cultural treasure 😋 you’re missing out on all the flavorful dishes that we offer to the world 🌎"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"S'mores technical challenge says ""hold my beer"""
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I was most offended by the lack of hygiene. One lady tastes her product with her finger and goes back to cooking, then right after another one sneezes into the open. There's no way I'd have tried any of it without ample hand washing"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"As a baker, Texan, and Spanish speaker (with a British husband), I was offended on many levels by their lack of understanding of a tres leches cake. And the fact that everyone in the episode kept calling the “tortilla” the “taco”."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Or bread!  Actual loaves of bread.  Pizza, a pastry, and a cake made of sandwiches is not necessary!"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,So many pastries they could have done!
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,Oh the days where contestants were asked to make Farthing Biscuits...
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I'll be honest, this series hasn't grabbed me like previous years have"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"The sketches are annoying, the show works better when it's just the stuff in the tent"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,There was a noticeable dip in quality once Mary Berry left. Also Noel and Matt arent really suited to hosting a baking show.
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"It's been on a downturn ever since they got rid of the cool ~~lesbian~~ extremely funny comedienne hosts and brought on the Mall Goth and Mr Dumbshirt. They're not funny; most of their 'jokes' are making things more difficult for the contestants and then laughing at it. They resort to gimmicks over actual humor.

EDIT because I apparently misremembered how one of them were described."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I've always preferred the Australian, Canadian, & Kiwi versions myself."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I gagged for that entire segment, and I love fish OR cakes."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I’m a Swede and I had to google to find out what a ""Swedish fish cake"" even is. If it is what is essentially a patty but made with fish instead of ground meat I can’t see how that was part of a baking show. The heck."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"Also they still had to use items they had readily available to them in the UK. So even if they wanted to use other ingredients, they likely had to use what they could."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"I was gonna say, I’m no pepper expert but my fancy recipe magazines associate it with Mexico, it’s just often subbed for Thai chilles if you can’t find them"
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"> the article misspells the plural of chilli

""Chiles"" is listed in dictionaries as a legit variant. There are lots of spellings for chillies."
The Great British Baking Show: Masterclass,"All of the contestants collectively disrespected pizza in the previous bread week episode, which was so much more offensive. =p"
Man to Man,"I really hope this is funny. Odenkirk did a great job on BCS, and I’m thankful he’s having such tremendous success in these new roles, but he’s one of the funniest people on the planet. I don’t want him to abandon comedy completely."
Man to Man,"Synopsis:

>Based on the novel Straight Man by Richard Russo, Lucky Hank is a “mid-life crisis tale” that takes place on a fictional college campus in the Pennsylvania Rust Belt. Odenkirk stars as William Henry “Hank” Devereaux Jr., the unlikely chairman of the college’s English department."
Man to Man,Minerals are not the only color..
Man to Man,It’s the Better Call.
Man to Man,"So Jesse got a movie, Saul got a prequel and now Hank gets his own spinoff as well? They'll run out of characters to milk soon!"
Man to Man,I don't like that title. Doesn't roll off the tongue very well.
Man to Man,"Are you telling me that a TV Series just happens to change its title like that? No, Bob orchestrated it."
Man to Man,"I guess I'm confused.

As a gay man, I fear the change is the result of fear of offense/exclusion, is that the case?

Straight Man is an age old theatre term for the simple, basic, normal, somewhat reasonable character being foiled by one or more ridiculous characters"
Man to Man,Hank wasn't so lucky in Breaking Bad.
Man to Man,"Lucky Hank: a parallel universe of Breaking Bad where Hank actually opens up the duffel bag when Walt says “half million in cash”. This leads him to uncover Walt’s secret and bring him to Justice. 

Saul Goodman then orders a vacuum and starts a new life as a tech guru after his cellphone business gains popularity."
Man to Man,"Yeah, we would hate for the people out there that think a word or phrase can only have one meaning getting their panties in a twist."
Man to Man,The story of Cottons second illegitimate son 'Lucky Hank'.
Man to Man,"Should’ve gone the knives out route. 

Straight Man: A Lucky Hank tale"
Man to Man,That’s probably a good call.
Man to Man,Hanks but no hanks
Man to Man,Saw the headline and thought AMC axed the show. Almost gave me a heart attack lol
Man to Man,So the word straight or straight man is offensive now?
Man to Man,Sussy baka
Man to Man,Glad to see Russo's work continue to get adapted. I enjoyed Empire Falls. Odenkirk could be great as Hank.
Man to Man,They filmed part of this on my university campus
Man to Man,I enjoyed the book a few years ago. Bob Odenkirk will make a great lead for this.
Man to Man,"AMC is really struggling to find their next hit. I've always enjoyed most AMC shows but currently, i'm not really into anything they have. they put most of their stock into walking dead spin offs and i'm just not there anymore. Vampire was great but its only gonna be 2 seasons. Haven't watched Mayfair Witches yet but i can't see it being better than Vampire. And i just finished working a show for AMC called Parrish that stars Giancarlo Esposito and I don't think its going to be good at all. hope they get back to basics."
Man to Man,"I mean, honestly, I thought the title meant that this was about a guy who was normally straight exploring his sexuality late in life. That could have been interesting."
Man to Man,Straight man is a better name for the show than lucky Hank tbh but I understand why did they change the name.
Man to Man,"Oh thank god, cause I was about to start a petition to cancel it based on the name, phew! Back to my search online to get angry about something irrelevant"
Man to Man,Should've gone with Good Hank.
Man to Man,Lucky Number Keleven
Man to Man,"Kind of an impact of Cancel Culture, which I guess does not exist!"
Man to Man,Lmao “Straight Man” is problematic.
Man to Man,[removed]
Man to Man,Oh shit this is a backdoor Hank Schrader spinoff!
Man to Man,Anyone know why they changed the title? Article doesn’t say
Man to Man,"Duh, can't have straight men in modern Hollywood."
Man to Man,"TIL straight is now a trigger word, and man has been a trigger word for a while now. 

What did they think was gunna happen? Lets put two of the most offensive words together and make it a movie with a white man lead? Hahahaha, Na, we’ll call it Lucky Hank."
Man to Man,Solid change. I heard the *Joy of Sex* was originally gonna be called *Gay Sex.* But with changing slang they figured it was gonna come to bite them in the ass.
Man to Man,Wow thank goodness. The title was such a trigger. It’s already bad enough that he is a straight white male. That was offensive enough. But the title?? Oh my.
Man to Man,But we can have titles that have gay in it but not straight?
Man to Man,This is already going to be an epic masterpiece I can tell
Man to Man,"Hanks a Nobody that goes Breaking Bad, and after an incident he decides he Better Call Saul to try and cover his tracks."
Man to Man,Pussies
Man to Man,"Amazing new title and a great Breaking Bad reference, bravo Vince!"
Man to Man,"Is this a comedy or another shitty drama piece of shit? Stick to what you’re good at, bro. God made you to be a comedian, not a dramatic fucking actor!!!"
Man to Man,"This is a reference to Lucky Jim, a campus novel by Kingsley Amis"
Man to Man,We just want better call Saul on the amc app like wtf 😂I get that it was on tv each show literally stayed on amc for about a week
Man to Man,Yeah I wanna know who this is helping like honestly
Man to Man,Bi-curious Man?
Man to Man,Also great in “Nobody”
Man to Man,"Sounds too much like ""Sneaky Pete"""
Man to Man,"I'm a simple person. I see a Bob Odenkirk article, I upvote."
Man to Man,The source book is hilarious. I hope they do it justice.
Man to Man,I so want to watch the office on the timeline where odenkirk was cast as Michael Scott.
Man to Man,"So this is going to be a comedy?  The article made it sound like the world's dullest drama

""Follow a guy through his mid-life crisis"""
Man to Man,"I knew he did some voices for American Dad, then I found out about the episode where he did like...  basically every side character, and did not realize they were all him.  He's listed in the credits, but they never specified which ones he did.  [Someone threw together a video of all of them.](https://youtu.be/NiA4zh-ZcsI)"
Man to Man,"BCS is my favorite show ever made, by miles. But I don’t think it got that way because of Odenkirk’s dramatic chops. Not to say that he wasn’t good by any means, but I agree comedy is his strong suit."
Man to Man,The book is a comedy… it would have taken you two seconds to google it
Man to Man,“…who gets involved with a drug cartel and finds that he can’t get himself out.”
Man to Man,"This is the book that turned me onto reading Richard Russo. His book, ""Nobody's Fool"" was turned into a movie starring Paul Newman, Jessica Tandy, Melanie Griffith, and Bruce Willis, and had a young Philip Seymour Hoffman as a bumbling cop. Later, HBO turned ""Empire Falls"" into a mini-series with Paul Newman.

Most of Russo's books are about the dying towns in upstate New York and the tensions between blue collar, shiftless fathers and their bookish sons. But ""Straight Man"" is set in the world of professors in a small college town."
Man to Man,Already sounding suspiciously similar to Netflix’s The Chair…
Man to Man,I love Bob but am I missing something..what’s the hook here? Sounds like a pretty basic plot. Is it a sitcom?
Man to Man,I love this novel! So funny.
Man to Man,"""William Henry 'Hank' Devereaux Jr"" sounds like one of Rogers characters from American Dad!."
Man to Man,Jesus Christ Marie
Man to Man,Damn
Man to Man,Saul that coming.
Man to Man,Tugboat was very excited about the change.
Man to Man,Still waiting for the Better Ring Fring spinoff where we learn how Gustavo Fring develops the recipe for the best damn chicken in the Southwest.
Man to Man,Walter Jr as “The Crippler”. A disabled masked vigilante that goes around crippling woman beaters at night.
Man to Man,I've got nipples. They can milk me.
Man to Man,I'm looking forward to Marie Schrader's Purple Rain!
Man to Man,Or Huell's rules
Man to Man,Not sure if ur joking but it aint about that Hank
Man to Man,Just reminds me of Hank Hill and Lucky Kleinschmidt from King of the Hill.
Man to Man,"Heard an interview with Russo, maybe it was a podcast…. It was years ago. He said that same thing about why he decided against *Lucky Hank* as the book title.  SMH."
Man to Man,Sad that I had to scroll this far down to even find a comment addressing the title change. Even the article itself doesn't mention why they felt a need to change it. Totally glossed-over.
Man to Man,"Reminds me of the title 'Sneaky Pete', also terrible but the show itself is good."
Man to Man,[removed]
Man to Man,"I'm not crazy! I know he switched those titles!

straight man, one after the gay woman, as if I could make such mistake! never, never!"
Man to Man,So? What’s the conspiracy?
Man to Man,"Yeah, that’s what the title is supposed to mean and the titular line is used to humorous effect in the book. Definitely changed it because of the reasons you described, imo. 

The new title sounds like a bad 90s sitcom."
Man to Man,I guess modern audiences aren't bright enough to understand the reference to the straight man in comedic performances.
Man to Man,I took it as straight man just being a boring and forgrttable title. Also it’s harder to google or get trending on twitter or anything as it’s already a term. The new title is more specific
Man to Man,"Good luck telling the wider internet that...

(Please do not attempt to tell the wider internet that, for your own safety.)"
Man to Man,I think it's just a title that's ambiguous in a way they didn't intend being replaced with one that's clearer.
Man to Man,"What about vertical man, upright man, sheer man"
Man to Man,"Or it’s just because a large chunk of viewers don’t understand theater terms, and the potential double meaning ended up being confusing and giving the wrong impression of what the show would be about.

But sure, let’s go with “fear of offense” culture war BS."
Man to Man,"I would guess so. “Lucky Hank” is what someone calls the main character, and I think it’s also an allusion to Amis’s earlier academic novel Lucky Jim."
Man to Man,"Probably just caused some confusion in a focus group and/or the marketing folk advised against the double meaning in the title if the show wasn't going to be also dealing with his sexuality in some way. There's usually a simple explanation for this sort of thing, not everything revolves around the culture wars."
Man to Man,Maybe Google searches were top porn heavy?
Man to Man,If the title had been Gay Man I guarantee they wouldn’t have had to change it.
Man to Man,A... BETTER CALL?
Man to Man,"That would be wild haha. Could you imagine? Like after Better Call Saul and Walking Dead coming to an end, I don’t know what else AMC has. If they Axed this, that would guarantee that AMC has nothing to offer"
Man to Man,"That would be wild haha. Could you imagine? Like after Better Call Saul and Walking Dead coming to an end, I don’t know what else AMC has. If they Axed this, that would guarantee that AMC has nothing to offer"
Man to Man,"Not offensive, just probably misleading to whoever they tested it with. The test groups probably expected it to be like a guy who is the only straight one in his group, or maybe a guy who thought he was straight but rediscovers himself, idk. The book title comes from the straight man in comedy, I'm sure you know, the reasonable man while everyone around him is ridiculous. Since the book isn't massively well-known, the marketing dept will want to attract as many new viewers as possible, and to a random person in 2023, ""Straight Man"" definitely makes you think sexuality before comedy"
Man to Man,Yup.
Man to Man,Does he have an interest in minerals though
Man to Man,"Very similar to how I pictured Hank in the book, especially in mannerisms. I don't think I could think of a better fit. And the book is really carried by Hank, so that bodes well for the show"
Man to Man,"Or it’s literally just because the title has a double meaning they didn’t want, and that confused focus groups….."

Bill Nye Saves the World,The target audience for this I believe is the droid army for the clone wars
Bill Nye Saves the World,So glad I saw this post. The show makes me sad. Me and my bf turned it on and maybe made it through half the episode. The innapropriate clapping and the bad jokes made me feel embarrassed for everyone involved in the production :/
Bill Nye Saves the World,The whole time I watched the show I was just waiting for science that never came
Bill Nye Saves the World,I don't know if anyone mentioned it yet but the production company behind the show is known for and makes reality tv shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians. That explains a lot about the production quality in my opinion. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I think [this video](https://youtu.be/1aD_nVRqUEk) sums up the issues with the show really well. Unclear audience, awkward presentation, condescending tone, and just an overall lack of polish."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"My 5 year old LOVES the old Bill Nye episodes and I had planned to show him these. So happy I previewed first and decided not to. It's a tad early for the ""What's a Fleshlight?"" Conversation."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Being French, I knew Bill Nye only because of Reddit so I watch the show. I never saw a TV show so cringy with 10yo level science and failed jokes."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It also felt very ""ranty"". People who are watching his show know that climate change is a big deal he doesn't have to yell at the chior. He has to try and talk to the people who don't know about it. I was disappointed with the show"
Bill Nye Saves the World,[deleted]
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I teach HS science and was pumped to have this show for off days. Watched 5 episodes myself and most of it was me pushing thru just to see if there was any part of it that was worthwhile. Sadly, no. So, so disappointed. :(

Edit: Thanks for my first gold, kind stranger!"
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Seriously though, who is the target audience? The show comes off as a sort of circle jerk to me. Like he's trying to convince people to accept climate change and trans people and all that, but the people who don't agree with him aren't watching the show. The people who are watching it already know all this and he's not going very in depth with any of the concepts. It's just him bitching about the people who disagree with him and some middle school science. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Man I got to episode 4 and couldn't handle it anymore. How did he think this was a good way to get adults into science and more importantly a different way of looking at the world? 

Fell flat, very sad. Just go watch NDT or Sagan. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,I had to turn it off. Felt more like a game show. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,I think the target is a version of millennials concocted by boomers.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Bill Nye also has several facts wrong... the cooling towers in Johannesburg were from a coal power plant, not a nuclear power plant.

Source: Am South African"
Bill Nye Saves the World,"He has pretty much alienated everybody in my social circle, and these people are very open minded.  There's no harsh judgement but... why?  Why mix silly science with serious current issues? Why have panels if you're not going to have a serious debate?

Just so much why "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I think they were trying for a science focused Daily Show/Real Time with Bill Maher type thing with the skits, panels, and reporters out in the field. The audience being liberal minded millennials who watched Bill Nye growing up and would be excited to watch him now. 

I think what failed for them is that Bill Nye isn't really that great of an entertainer and wasn't really able to articulate his points very well without coming off as smug and condescending. So much so that even if you agreed with what he was saying you were a bit put off by it.  "
Bill Nye Saves the World,I am a Science teacher and could barely finish the 1st episode.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"In the first episode he says that the show isn't for kids, and it appears to support that notion through the way the material is presented. But even after watching more episodes, I still wasn't clear on who the audience should be. 

I too was a bit baffled from the way the show was designed, which was what made me stop watching the show after the 3rd or 4th episode. Setting aside the complete cheesiness of the live studio audience and the ridiculously forced laughter for jokes that really aren't funny at all, even to a 6th grader maybe, I can think of three scenes off the top of my head. The first one was where a writer of the show who's Indian was introduced by Bill to do a segment on a topic. It ended up coming off as an unexpected stand-up comedy bit that was crazy exaggerated, not funny and racist, bringing up something about how white people try to copy Indian symbolic and cultural art and simplify it into cool, rad interior decor. Whether it's true or not, it simply didn't fit into what the show was supposed to be about and came off as stereotyping one group of people in favor of another. Another scene was when the Veritasium guy did a segment on artificial intelligence and reported back to Bill in front of the audience. Earlier in the episode, Bill made a claim about the significance of a particular type of AI, and Veritasium said that he was incorrect - Bill had to awkwardly respond uh ok, now moving on. The last scene I can think of was the panel debate about fuels of the future. There was one panelist who was in favor of nuclear power. Bill (and the rest of the panelists I think) came off too strongly during their disagreement, at times just speaking over him/immediately denouncing him/not asking him for further evidence. I get the point of presenting opposing viewpoints, but this was way too awkward to have been planned imo. The panelist visibly was embarrassed. You'd perhaps have to watch this segment to believe me. Forgive me if I come off as too picky, but if a show is going to be well written and properly presented, you would think that the main monologue (Bill speaking to the audience, doing his experiments) would stay consistent with the correspondent segments and what the correspondents themselves believe and do research on, a form of supporting and applicable evidence to the monologues and the main ideas of the show. 

I doubt I sound coherent enough to make sense, but the take home message is that I agree with OP. The show has indeed been all over the place so far. Not only in terms of some of the immediately visible aspects (forced laughter, live studio audience), but in the very writing and presentation of what messages and ideology the show is trying to convey. I've only watched 3 or 4 episodes, but I heard it gets worse, with Bill and at least one correspondent/panel member openly making fun of people who don't believe what they believe. That's the exact opposite of what the show should be, and the opposite of what science is about. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I really tried to get into it but Rachel Ray meets science isn't really all that fun. Also, those panel segments where they get a couple of guys who disagree is a total joke. It's really just two guys who agree with the host that just attack some poor soul who thinks differently. 

""So you are against vaccines, eh? Well here's a guy who wrote a book saying you're wrong ANNNND we're out of time.""

Seriously, what's the point anymore?

Edit: At least Rachel Ray taught you how to make a frittata instead of...well...ice cream"
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Bill Nye came and spoke at my college a few years back. It was supposed to be a reward event for a high GPA that semester, but I ended up in the fifth row, dead center with 3 hours of sleep the previous night and had to sit through a two hour lecture along the same lines as his show. It was unbearable. I went into that event loving Bill Nye from childhood memories, and I left hating him. Total disappointment. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I'm not sure who's at fault, but I sort of feel like it would have been better had it not all been released at once. They would have been able to course correct and find their footing.

I watched the entire series, and I honestly think I am worse off for having done so. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did.

I also was left wondering who the target audience was, because it was too dumbed down for adults interested in science/Bill Nye, but too condescending for adults not already interested in those things... while being not at all kid friendly.
"
Bill Nye Saves the World,It's like a scientific version of The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore but worse somehow.
Bill Nye Saves the World,It's the most cringeworthy thing. Impossible to watch. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Oh it can't be that bad....

(watches a segment)

Jesus H. Christ he's more condescending than Adam Conover, and his ""Adam Ruins"" persona was intentionally ***written*** as the most condescending asshole ever :\"
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Yeah, the intended audience isn't very clear.  I think edgy middle schoolers will probably like it best.  "
Bill Nye Saves the World,I felt like the studio audience's reactions were so fake. Every mildly amusing thing he says is not loose your shit hilarious. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,This is definitely going to be mocked on south park at some point.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Does anyone remember 'Greenzo' on ""30 Rock""? 


This is Bill Nye nowadays! Someone decided he was 'science' and he took it to his head. 


I'm an undergrad Mechanical Engineer and I practiced for awhile. I would never in my life claim to be a scientist or think I was an AUTHORITY to teach children. Bill Nye is an undergrad Mechanical Engineer from 40 years ago who apparently hasn't done anything but strive to be in show business.


That's probably an unfair assessment but I trust people who get famous for their science (Einstein, Sagan, etc) a lot more than people who use science to get famous. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,[here's when I turned it off](https://giphy.com/gifs/KJoBz4fDzpkTm/html5)
Bill Nye Saves the World,The forced fist bump he was doing was the cringest part of episode 1. After looking at the comments section here im taking it off of my list.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It was described as Bill Nye the Science Guy but for adults, but it's so far away from Bill Nye. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"This show is not going to change any minds. I don't know if that was part of the goal, it's just an echo chamber."
Bill Nye Saves the World,Carl Sagan he is not. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,One of my friends  met Bill Nye in L.A at a grocery store and said he was one of the biggest douche bags he's ever met. I didn't want to believe it but Sex Junk finally convinced me 
Bill Nye Saves the World,The best thing to come to out of this show is what I'm seeing happen in these comments. Both liberals and conservatives are coming together and agreeing that this level of propaganda and politically-motivated science is unacceptable. Maybe that was Bill Nye's plan all along. Maybe he really has saved the world...
Bill Nye Saves the World,Yea I got about 15 mins into the first episode and after the 4th time Bill Nye started talking in another weird voice I was off it.
Bill Nye Saves the World,Yeah I didn't really care for the show too much either. The 30 minute time slot for it also makes everything in the show feel very rushed. I agree with others that the whole thing comes off kind of smug. There are too many low blows about politics in it. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,Honestly one of the worst shows I've ever seen
Bill Nye Saves the World,This is what happens when you write a show with internet arguments as your inspiration. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,I stopped watching after the first episode because the audience annoyed the hell out of me. Seemed like a bunch of brain dead 20 somethings that would laugh after everything he said. At times it even felt like Bill was trying not to roll his eyes and didn't want to be there. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,[deleted]
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I know the people who'll like this. The people who like those ""Fucking science is cool as shit bro"" Facebook pages."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"""My oh, oh, oh...""

Oh, no."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"When he kept changing the subject on the guy who was talking about psychedelics I couldn't finish the show. Bill Nye, you don't have to worry about the FCC, it's a Netflix show. Push the limit. If you don't want to challenge taboo ideas then you should have signed with the Discovery Channel.  "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It doesn't get any better. In fact, it only gets worse. There are a total of about 3 watchable episodes in the entire season."
Bill Nye Saves the World,I thought it was cool to see the dude from veritasium was on there. After watching the show I was quite convince that the YouTube channel Veritasium should of been hosting Bill Nye rather then the other way around. It's not good when a YouTube channel is producing higher quality content than your show. I had hoped for more! 
Bill Nye Saves the World,"After watching two episodes I turned it off. It seems to me that it's sole purpose is to give bill a soap box. I don't disagree with him, but getting Zach Braff to yell at me through my TV about climate change doesn't do anything for me. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I felt the same way.  I was excited by the concept and tried it (I'm 40) and felt the format was silly and hard to watch, even though I like him and the topics.  But it was hard to see kids loving it either.  "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"This show is bad. He came off as completely patronizing. The need to interrupt the serious discussions with AWFUL jokes. The wink wink ""I'm using hip words, right?""  And the constant fist bump explosions. 

I'm Nyed out. 

Edit-I actually want an AMA from someone who was in the audience for this. Did the laugh signs also have guns attached to them pointing at your head? "
Bill Nye Saves the World,Jesus im so gkad other people hated this show. I just finished an episode of the old bill nye show and i think this is the difference: Fucking political agendas. Climate change is real get the fuck over it and give us a highly inteligent show with potential solutions not just bitching about how we fucked the earth up. It is a pop culture bullshit waste of time. I would rather hear a 40 minute lecture by steven hawking on the theory of relativity.
Bill Nye Saves the World,I feel like deep down the line some person wanted to make liberals and science look really dumb and this show was the product capped off by Bill Nye who was once a loved and respected icon. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,"♪ *'Cuz my sex junk, is so oh-oh-oh* ♪

♪ *Much more than either or-or-or* ♪

People called them crazy. They said it couldn't be done. But they actually did it.

They actually made a worse lyric than Gas Pedal. This belongs in a museum. This needs to be preserved for future generations; like, after the bombs fall and everyone's livin' like fallout, people will find copies of this amongst the wreckage, and suddenly things won't seem all that bad for them any more."

Bill Nye Saves the World,"I cringed so hard in the first 5 minutes when the audience was ""oooo'ing"" and ""ahhh'ing"" while Bill was just setting up a bunsen burner. The whole live audience format just wasn't a good idea."
Bill Nye Saves the World,But what about the sex junk??
Bill Nye Saves the World,"While I was watching this show,  I lost some respect for Bill. He acts very immature in a lot of episodes,  especially when he has guests on the show. He brings up a topic for discussion and he will not only continuously interrupt them,  but do it in a childish way.  
It made me think...  Wow, is this how Bill acts on his science committee's in the real world? If so,  he must be so annoying to work with on a professional level.  "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It's horrible.  The production, the content... I don't get it.  He's done TV before and done it well.  How did this get out of the door.  It's like someone put Jerry Springer in a Bill Nye costume.

Bill, if you see this, you're still cool but fire your producer and go back to the drawing board.

Bill Nye Saves the World,My sixth grade teacher used to have a huge lady boner for bill nye. This show killed it.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"
Bill Nye isn't a great guy."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Bill Nye is an actor, not a scientist. He's simply pushing someone else's agenda while desperately trying to stay relevant. That agenda being: depopulation/eugenics (rather dysgenics)/ destruction of the traditional family. 

Fuck Bill Nye "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"some girl at work who i kind of hate  keeps telling me to watch it, saying he makes all the deniers look like idiots.  She is the type of person where if you make a mistake she will go on for hours about it in an angry stern tone, but if she makes one and gets spoken to the world is against her


So what ever demographic that falls under, I guess, ""bitch"""
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Bill Nye is a shitty actor, not a scientist. This is what happens when people forget that."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I almost attended a taping for this out in Culver City where I live, but it was canceled and I never made another effort to go see it. I watched an episode...or like a few minutes of one...and couldn't get through it. The show is cringey..."
Bill Nye Saves the World,It's a political science show which pretty much ruins the science. 
Bill Nye Saves the World,"it blows and makes me sad as shit that I was such a big fan of this guy when I was a kid. 

Now I wonder if it was just that he had good talent behind his original show, and no talent behind this one."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"EPISODE 1: ""We are making climate change, all people just flip the light switch on, without thinking where the electricity comes from and what environmental damage we cause by this"". 

Meanwhile the whole studio setup is blazin' with all sorts of shimmering lights, a glass wall slides up and down, while audience claps at it... (Why da fucking do people clap for a wall?) 

I wonder, how much of that stage is powered by renewable energy? 

"
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Have you ever wondered what the show The West Wing would sound like it was written by smug assholes who don't understand that there is an audience?  Well here it is in all of its glory.  Poor writing, poor delivery, poor research.

The show was basically a self-masturbatory exhibition where Bill shouted down his opponents and basically game them the ""Fox News"" treatment by inviting representatives of alternative views on only to lambaste them and cut them off.  The format and editing really made you appreciate the non-audience format with ""fun"" sounds for bumpers.

It feels like this is Bill Nye's ""George Lucas"" moment.  Where he takes something that was loved and cherished by a generation and made it more ""real and raw"" by removing all of the editor/limiters.  Understandably a lot of the base fans aren't enjoying it."
Bill Nye Saves the World,Today Reddit learned... that Bill Nye isn't actually a scientist and is not an authority on shit.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"meh, Beakman's World was a better show anyway."
Bill Nye Saves the World,This post just single handily restored my faith in both humanity and reddit.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I'm not American so I didn't know Bill Nye until I watched this atrocity the other night. Besides what every else mentioned here, I was also blown away by how narcissistic this guy is. Like textbook narcissistic. It was genuinely embarrassing to watch. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,After watching the sexy junk and ice cream vids... Bill Nye you're fucking dumb.
Bill Nye Saves the World,I'm so glad reddit caught on to how shit shit it is.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I *think* I like Bill Nye.

But I'm wrong. I don't. That's the problem.
I want to like him. I agree with what he stands for, and I love the idea of getting kids exposure to science at a young age, cutting through the bullshit to get to the facts, etc... but every time I try to watch him I just can't.

Remember his debate with Ken Hamm? It was a deeply disappointing non-debate, with no real point and no real result. 

Everytime one of his segments comes on Star Talk, I find myself spacing out or just skipping it.

His old Science Guy show makes us nostalgic but I came across some old YouTube vids and it really was a low-rent, poorly produced shit show.

And now this flaming turd. No real content, just watered-down, spastic segments that aren't thought provoking so much as ""damn he got a Victoria's Secret model to be on his show""- provoking.

Millennial liberals love him because he peddles their party line, but, he's not particularly entertaining, not all that articulate, has questionable taste, and is only marginally engaging as a personality.

 MI have to say... I think I'm done with Bill Nye."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"My sex junk... is so OH OH OH!

God save us all..."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It's geared towards those who don't understand any of the basics of science and those who are drowning in nostalgia.

Did anyone think this was going to be good when, in the first few minutes of the show, you have the audience laughing at how the world is flooding and going crazy over a bunsen burner getting put on a table?

I suppose the main audience is the kids young enough to have watched Bill Nye in school and who still enjoy the humor everyone else grew out of a long time ago."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Quit your whining and give a stranger a handjob, then give yourself props."
Bill Nye Saves the World,They'd have come out better just showing re-runs of Mr. Wizard.
Bill Nye Saves the World,The new show is a nu-liberal globalist shitfest. Sex junk? Really? And people get offended when we say this clown isnt    a scientist.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It's propaganda. What do you expect? He literally *had* to point out during the first episode that it was meant for adults, so you would have that mindset all the way through. I couldn't enjoy it and I stopped after episode 1."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Remember all those Michael Moore ""documentaries"" that changed nobody's mind about anything and were filled with BS but made you feel smart for agreeing with them?"
Bill Nye Saves the World,The average /r/politics user?  Idk.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It's almost like a children's tv show scientist may not be super legit.

EDIT: Mr. Wizard is the shit though"
Bill Nye Saves the World,Bill Nye the pseudoscience guy
Bill Nye Saves the World,The tone is all wrong for any audience. How do kids feel about being shouted at by an angry old man? How will this approach persuade those resistant to science? OP is right to question.
Bill Nye Saves the World,"After watching it and reading through this thread, I get the impression that Bill himself is the target audience."
Bill Nye Saves the World,Hated it 
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I watched the first two episodes and also stopped. The people who need to watch a show like this won't watch it, and if someone who needs to does, they're going to hate it - it's just an angry Bill Nye yelling and calling people idiots for not believing in man made global warming. Science deniers won't watch it and if they do they won't be engaged. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Episode 2 ""Tune Your Quack-O-Meter"" is painful to watch when they get into the 3 on 1 debate. They cut the guy with the opposing view off about 50 times, because they didn't like his argument. They also end the debate segment by cutting him off. Why even invite the guy on the show when you just sit there and make fun of him when you clearly wanted a discussion to take place? "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"it's for what older generations think ""millennials"" like"
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I tried. I loved Bill Nye. I told the kids for years before this show came out how cool science was and there was even a fun show when I was a kid, once in a while you'd see him on TV and he'd be talking about his group of 6th graders that figured out xyz or something on the news.

Then this show came out. Excited I told everyone I was before watching. Everyone hated it. I had to see how wrong everyone was. Nope. Pile of crap. I'm going to go pirate all of his old shows so we can remember him for the man he was not this puppet he has become.

I didn't expect the_donald to like this show, but man, they are spot on. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"This seemed so off when he did the little interview with Tyler, the Creator next to him. When they asked ""why Tyler?"" and he says something baffling generic like ""he's the man! He's the man with the beats!"" It seemed like he had no idea who Tyler was, showing this kind of r/FellowKids type of moment where he didn't know anything about Tyler or his music, just that he was hip with the kids. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,/r/politics probably loves it
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I said the same thing in /r/politics about this. Downvoted to hell.

This was a shit excuse for a show. I was forced to watch the whole lot in order to review it, but omfg. I had never seen Bill Nye before this show, and I hope I never see him again.

He never let people with opposing views speak to him at all."
Bill Nye Saves the World,"It is pretty cocky to name your show ""I Save the World"""
Bill Nye Saves the World,"Good.  Now people will stop worshipping this guy like he's Einstein or Tesla or something.

He's hacky - he's always been hacky.  His old show was hacky, even for a kids show.  I remember watching it as a kid and thinking ""who's this for?  I know all this stuff from school, and my little sisters are too young to understand.""

Bill Nye is a celebrity because of confirmation bias - he says what everyone wants to hear.  "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"I couldn't watch past that first episode with Karlie Kloss. Like really, you don't need to pay a model so that I pay attention to 'science'. The whole thing felt cringy and tacky. I didn't learn anything new about climate change nor it particularly engaged me. I like Bill and his enthusiasm but his brand of scientist is outdated and very stereotypical. "
Bill Nye Saves the World,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sV_W5nFmjA



The new show is political science, IE calling political views science... argument from authority"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"God, that episode with the camgirl and this guy was pure emotional torture. 

They both seemed like genuinely nice people, completely unaware what sort of emotional trainwreck they were heading into. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Granny pornographer is hilarious.

EDIT: Jesus, episode 5 is the most deeply uncomfortable thing I've ever seen on TV. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"First episode finished, super awkward though cause my mom walked in. It's not porn it's on Netflix! "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"The parallels between the way these episodes feel and certain episodes of ""Black Mirror"" feel is creepy.

Has anyone gotten to the episode with Marina who live streamed her friend's rape yet? It was disturbing..mostly because throughout the entire documentary, Marina never acknowledges her friend was raped. She says things like ""I filmed her and some guy having sex"" and ""I've seen a lot worse."" I got the feeling she didn't fully comprehend what rape even is. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,The Erika Lust segment was great. She's got a room full of her movies and they have covers that look like they're in the Criterion Collection.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"In the episode with the girl (Bailey) who was recruiting porn stars: After seeing her, and that other girl from Vegas treat camming like a serious job and a business, and be hard fucking lined about what they would and would not do, it became crystal clear that Bonnie was going to crash and burn. I loved the conversation in the car when Bonnie was talking about how she did a public masturbation scene, and Bailey and the girl from Vegas basically stopped dead in their tracks and started talking about how Bonnie could have gotten in legal trouble if she had been caught.

At one point, Bailey was telling Bonnie some basic things to do to get herself settled and set up, and one of Bonnie's responses was she didn't even have a bank account, and she seemed unsure about whether or not she should even open one. Red flag. After Bonnie started making some money, the *first* thing she was supposed to do as a CAM GIRL was buy a computer. Nope, she blew all that money on drugs. When Bonnie started doing boy-girl scenes (clearly something she probably traipsed into while drunk or high) she decided a mere 30 mins ahead of time to start using her *real* name because it felt more true to herself or whatever. I felt Bailey's sense of disappointment and frustration as the episode went on. 

The episode with the cam girl and the guy from Australia kinda broke my heart. When she was talking to her friend about the pros and cons of going to Australia to meet the guy, I was so on the side of the friend. 

In the episode titled ""Money Shot"", I just started feeling bad for the guy (Jax Slayher?) because the camera guy *continually* kept on asking Jax if he was hard or ready to cum, and would tell him how hard he needed to be for the particular shot. I cannot imagine having to stay aroused for so long, or essentially having to be able to get aroused at the drop of a hat. Just watching Jax struggle to finish so everyone could get paid and go home felt kind of torturous. For the love of god, it's been 20 mins, why haven't I cum yet orgasms (while still orgasms) are not particularly satisfying. 

In the final episode about the girl who live streamed a sexual assault on Periscope, I could not muster a shred of remorse for her. The only thing in her story that made me think was when she said the three of them had been drinking alcohol. I know alcohol affects everyone differently, but you would have to be shit-fucking-faced to to watch your friend being abused, and not have some switch flip in your head to tell you that what's happening is wrong. 

Overall, I have to say I really enjoyed this 6-episode version of the documentary a lot more than the first version. I watched the entire season in one day."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Is this a spin-off of the documentary of the same name?
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,The subject of episode 2 is a fan favorite former Big Brother contestant. Very fascinating to watch a whole 42 minute documentary about his current life!
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Am I the only one who is mortified at all the people texting/calling and driving? Porn? Whatever. Cam girls? power to them, but text and drive and you're ruining your life "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I'm watching episode 3 like, wait I can make money painting with my boobs? I need to pay off student loans too! I'm not done with the episode yet, but I really like Bailey so far. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Well, I know what's gonna start after I finish 13 Reasons why. I totally forgot about this. Hot Girls Wanted was one of my favorite documentaries of 2015."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Does anyone know if that Bonnie girl is ok? I'm genuinely worried 
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,The documentary I felt was a really unnecessarily negative portrayal of the realities of camming. Kind of hammy too if I'm being honest. I'll check out the series but if it keeps the same tone it won't hold me much. 
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I finished that episode and came to reddit to see if anyone else thought that was as upsetting as I did. At first I mostly felt bad for the guy. We can never know how someone is just by seeing a small portion of their life recorded, but he seemed like such a genuinely good person. I'm not saying it in any way makes me better than him, but I just cannot imagine having that much fear of talking to women and accepting from a young age that you probably won't ever find a partner. I never thought she seemed like a bad person at all, but it says a lot about her that she felt so bad for him and acted pretty selflessly towards the end because you could tell that she was beginning to feel a lot of guilt over her relationship with this guy who was so into her and so nice. 

As emotionally taxing as the episode was, I still think the whole experience was worth it for both of them but especially him. It seemed like he was upset at the end of course, but its not like he was just devastated and hopeless. Plus that was probably the best few days of his life even though they basically just hung out. You forget that simple things you are used to bring some people so much pleasure, and while she thought he wanted a private show he was ecstatic just to be walking down the street and seen with a girl he adored. He got happy just because she was using his shower, and it made me happy that he felt that way.

Sorry for the long reply, I didn't mean to get carried away."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,[deleted]
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"For some reason I feel relief that others felt this episode was painful to watch. The guy is so sweet and I think the camgirl just didn't know or understand the extent of their relationship. I was also really happy about what his female friend said to him at the end. (The relationship was real. That she's happy he's willing to move on). 

Also, how human is it to feel unlovable? Most people feel that way at some point in their lives. I'm just sad when I see people who keep that as a piece of their identity. I just wanted to give him a big hug. I hope he does realize he's worthy of love. Maybe he'll end up like the guy in the ""Love me Tinder"" episode after his Big Brother debut, just swimming in options. 
I felt compelled to reach out to him and let him know he is deserving of real love but now that I see these posts I feel better knowing that if he doesn't hear the message from me, I'm sure he's read it from someone else. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Series?

Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,[deleted]
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"> the camera guy continually kept on asking Jax if he was hard or ready to cum

I found the guy with the porn cap so annoying. First he tells him to joke her and you could clearly see from Jax face that he wasn't happy with it. He even said that he doesn't actually like the whole domination stuff. To get back to the porn cap guy: What a freaking idiot. ""I want to be a succesful entrepreneur"". You are starting a freaking porn site and not Space X or Google. I liked that he cares for his mother and the relationship with his girlfriend seemed healthy but the whole porn thing grew over his head."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,bonnie is pretty popular now as kylie page has done a ton of b/g stuff since this was filmed. she probably hasn't changed her behavior but i'm guessing she is being paid pretty well but she'll probably blow all of it and be penny less in a couple years.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Yup.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Episode 2 was the saddest thing I have seen in a long time. Very scary  to see how our society is evolving in a social media driven dating app. Tbh a lot these girls (and probably also guys) are just copying the style and looks (maybe the behaviour) of so many reality tv personalities (like the kardashians?). And they can't make the difference between a marketing product and real lives and real human beings?
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Yeah what a sad depressing empty life
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,[deleted]
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,ya i agree i have no problems with them ruining their own lives and the choices they make but when they do things like texting while driving that's not okay since they could potentially ruin someone else's life. 
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Oh yeah, it's illegal in Australia so I can only focus on that when I see it in American docos. It's one thing to answer a call (though I personally don't allow anyone to do it with me in the car) but texting and searching for contacts etc? Morally reprehensible. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I liked her at first, but man, by the end of the episode she just seemed like a heartless pimp (by the literal definition of the word) to me."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,she changed her name kylie page she's pretty popular actually i'm sure she's probably still partying pretty hard. https://twitter.com/kyliepagexxx?lang=en

Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Series is anti-technology after all, not anti-sex.
"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I more or less binged through the series but after watching this episode I couldn't get into the last one because I this was still in my head. (this was the 5th episode on Netflix, the 6th was the live stream rape)

The moment she tells the camera team that she isn't feeling well and just acts so he is happy was heartbreaking. At least it seemed like she didn't just act after a while.

I am so sorry for him because he seemed like such a nice person. I hope he does way better now and hopefully he will meet someone. It did seem like he gained a lot of confidence and hope through that experience. There are a lot of women who want just that: A genuinly friendly person."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,[deleted]
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Lol I actually found him on Facebook and said I think he's awesome 
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,There's 6 episodes.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Ugh... when he went to see his dad and he was wearing that beyond tacky porn hat, and that shirt that said porn flakes, I wanted to throw things. When his dad pointed out his attire and the guy basically said ""well, this is me"", I had to laugh. We get it, you're in the porn industry, but you're a grown man. Conduct yourself with a modicum of class and maturity, and put on some normal clothes. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Porn cap guy's dad alluded to something that happened previously in dude's life that disqualifies him for some jobs, and there was mention of him having spent time in the military but it ""didn't work out"". It kind of sounds to me like he got a dishonorable discharge or something, that'd make sense with what they said."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Is it just as good?
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,">Very scary to see how our society is evolving in a social media driven dating app.

This show was almost like Black Mirror, except a documentary."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I couldn't help but notice how desolate his flat was, like NOTHING personal there at all."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Even though he hasn't been on the show for over 10 years, he has a reputation in the Big Brother community for hooking up with a contestant from each new season once the season is done."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,My wife and I agree that he's basically Barney Stinson in real life.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"More like incredible, he's banging hot 20 year olds whenever he wants, how is that depressing?"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,He's a 40 year old 20 year old.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"His life seems incredible, he gets to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, he gets to fuck a variety of hot young 20 year old girls, he's got plenty of money, his life seems great. Most people just go to work, then come home, and work the same mediocre grind day in day out, probably fuck their aging boring spouse once a month, fuck that. You can't beat prime pussy on demand. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Well I don't know about cam girling and porn ruining peoples' lives, as long as it's a valid choice (some of the people portrayed obviously didn't have a choice whereas other did), but the texting and driving thing really got me mad"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"To me, it seems like she wanted to help Bonnie but didn't know how. After all, Bonnie is an adult and it's not like Bailey is her mother. It's probably not the first time one of her recruits turned to drugs. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,I'm glad that she's alive then
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I disagree on Bailey. I don't begrudge her making commission off recruiting considering she offers a very ethical mentorship. It sounds like not only does she want to protect the girls but she has a very smart business mind that she's sharing. And the recruits have a choice whether to take her advice and protection or dismiss it, potentially leading to bad situations. She clearly felt bad when Bonnie chose to dismiss her advice, but she can't force her to do anything. 

Even if Bonnie told a teacher, parent or psychologist about her behaviour, they couldn't forbid her from doing it. The most they could do is strongly discourage it.  She's an adult."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I mean it might be shitty, but she does help them, and produce the content, and they seem fine with it."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Yeah just like Black Mirror is anti-technology.

/s"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"it's look like there's another movie with same name and now I found the series, thanks!"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I though the porn flakes shirt was funny but everything else was just terrible. If making shitty porn is his defining character trade he might not be the smartest person to begin with. I mean, you can't wear that stupid head and expect anyone to respect you at all."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I agree, although it was interesting to see his relationship (or lack of) with his father. I get that he wants decent money, but his dad wants to see him sell used cars because it's 'more honorable'. But...money is money, although I guess the son could *at least* look professional."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,It's a *wonderful* series! You won't be sad.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I don't know yet, I'm literally about 10 minutes in."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Yeah indeed! It would have totally fit into that serie. 

What is also very remarkable about the series is that a lot of these people are justifying their choices and neglecting their responsibilities by generalising their behaviour as a normal thing to do or comparing it with other crooked situations. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I feel the same way about the show, Easy.  Also a netflix original.  Highly recommend."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,It was the perfect lonely bussiness man flat for a TV show.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Yeah, if I was a girl and walked into that depressing AF room, with shit on the floor, no sheets, no personality whatsoever I'd nope out."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I don't really see the appeal. 40, living with room mates, gets so offended at someone mentioning his age that he ends all contact. What a catch. He's like a man child.

Are women so easily fooled by a decent body and a leased audi? What a joke."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"No way, Barney Stinson at least has creativity. This guy just swipes right. Didn't mention if he ever met girls in real life"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I was thinking the exact same thing.

I admire that lifestyle to an extent, but it is shallow and gets old quickly."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I agree, I think Bailey's thing is that she tries to help these girls by giving them good advice, but if they don't want to take it then she doesn't want to be involved in picking up those pieces. You can't help someone if they don't want to help themselves, and I'm sure she sees a lot of girls doing it for the wrong reasons and letting the lifestyle get it the way."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Eh, I got the sense she's pretty full of it, at least with the spiel about supporting the girls, etc. I guess it's good promotion for her."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,I got the sense that Bailey is really good at BS'ing.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"in black mirror is almost always people who are making it worse.
in this docu-series it's almost Luddite point of view on technology.
Better rewatch ""sexy baby"", Doctor Who or Documentary Now"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"The other one is the original documentary and this one is the spin-off series by the same producers. The original doc is worth watching, although I found it very depressing. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I'll admit that I laughed when I initially read his shirt, but like you, I sat there wondering how he expected people to take him seriously or show him any respect when that's how he presents himself in public. There was some other hat he was wearing that just said porn on the front as well. I just don't understand how someone who endeavours to become a businessman says ""yup, this hat is appropriate. In fact, it's best that I own multiple hats like this"""
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Not necessarily even professional. Just... not like an immature teenager. Keep the jeans, shirt, and baseball hat. Just carry yourself with some self-respect, and stay away from having those items of clothing have some reference to porn giant bold letters. I have zero issue with his decision to get into porn. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Would you mind writing me back whether it's good or bad?
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I could see how in Vegas, he could get a lot of action from tourist women in town who see that and want a piece. But I totally agree with Alexis, a 40 year old out partying on a Monday is weird."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I'm gonna check it out, thanks!"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I thought you meant the wird gold porn hat to begin with. If someone comes to a business with a ""porn"" hat it's a red flag. If he comes to another business meeting with a different hat that also says porn he isn't the kind of person you want to make business with. I think he doesn't understand that in the end the porn business is a business. While a dumb porn star can be successful the people behind the camera should know what they are doing.

The porn flakes shirt is something you expect a college kid to waer in a bar. "
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"> I have zero issue with his decision to get into porn.

Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Late to the game, but I laughed at them playing beer pong in a garage, on a Monday night. Maybe I'm wrong for that, but I was like come on dude, you're not in college anymore."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Currently watching the first episode. It's good.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,I don't fault him for that. He's a club promoter. That's his job. He is around those people daily. 
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"**Is there any part of you that likes to play with the expectations the audience has for this show? The dark comedy has always been there, but is it more fun to play around with the mixed tones?**

>HADER: Sometimes you get a sequence together that you write as a straight drama or a straight action sequence. The fun comes from going back over it a couple of times and thinking, “What if this happens?” It’s sort of like sitting around and watching something with your friends, commenting on it and making jokes like Mystery Science Theater or something. Instead, we’re writing those things in. One example is the motorcycle chase in episode six. There’s a moment when someone hands off a giant machine gun to the guy on the motorcycle. Initially, the guy took it and started firing it. It was very much a big action set piece. When that moment came, I think I audibly scoffed: “There’s no way he would be able to make that shot!” (Laughs.) [In the final cut, the motorcyclist clumsily drops the gun and veers into a car.] You have to get away from it so then you can comment on how kind of lame your initial idea was."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,I love how much Hader shows he just plain loves **film** through all the little gems he works in the episodes he directs. A real treat he’s going to direct all of next season!
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I didn’t love the new season as much, still enjoyed it. But hank might be my favorite tv character ever"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"He is an amazing actor 
One of the best !!!!!!!"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I don’t understand the negativity in this thread. This show got BETTER this year, sorry it didn’t write itself into the corner you tried to force it into.

There was still plenty of comedy this season, but it had to deal with some darkness otherwise they’re being disingenuous to the titular character— a war vet Assasin with PTSD.

Genuinely am perplexed by the response i think people just be hating to hate. Season 3 was a masterpiece."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul nod in agreement. Both started as dark comedies and switched up (though BCS was far more gradual) to these dark and bleak dramas.

I loved the new season of Barry and found that while it was more dark than the previous two, it was still really funny and confused me so much how people seriously sat around and said it was no longer a comedy. Did I watch a different show??"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,I thought the change from being a retired marine with PTSD turned hitman who seems to lack remorse and empathy turning into an aspiring actor in Hollywood was pretty dark indeed.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,Of course Bill is a r/mst3k fan!
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,You better not cancel this show Discovery 😒
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"Season 3 was a very good thing when viewed by itself but in the context of the series as a whole it kind of ruined the show for me. Obviously in real life Barry would, of course, be a monster. That being said because when watching shows and movies you suspend your disbelief and just roll with it, I accepted how they wrote his character in the first two seasons. After season three I went from finding his character really funny and even *kind of* sympathetic in some ways to absolutely despising him, which is a problem when he's in most of the scenes. At this point I really have no incentive to watch season four because I don't like Barry and I don't care what happens to him."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,I agree and I respect his artistic sensibilities.  But end of day last season was my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong still 8/10  but the first 2 seasons were 10/10.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,How many seasons are they extended for? I need to prepare myself if and when Barry dies.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"The Prestige TV Podcast did recap episodes after every season 3 episode, with Bill Hader. He gave a lot of interesting info about the process and specifically insights into the writing room. If this stuff interests anyone check those episodes out!"
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,This last season was no where near as fun as a watch as the first two. At the end of the day its a dark comedy but you still need some laughs in there.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"All I’d like to say is: Everyone on this show is amazing. 

Hader is what keeps you watching imo, but Hank, Fuchs, Sally, Cousineau, just everyone is doing their best and it just stellar work."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I feel pretty bad for Bill Hader in that he clearly sold his soul to the devil. Barry is just too good. I feel like I watch every episode waiting for the series to diminish. And yet it continues to defy my expectations and keeps getting better. I knew Hader was talented when it came to performance, humor, ear for impressions, etc. I had no idea his writing skills were so strong. But is also more than writing when it comes to plotting out a series. He's also a tactician."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,"I really liked this season, and appreciate that’s they’re doing what they want with it. People have complained that it’s not a comedy anymore.

That said “You have too many dogs.” fucking *killed* me. I was cry laughing at it for like ten minutes. Just how perfect and how insanely stupid that joke was. Absolutely magnificent."
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,New season is boring to me
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,163192
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,IMO the farcical comedy undermines the melodramatic scenes and vice versa.  It just doesn't work for me.  The show comes off as youth adult for me.
Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On,What is gender?
Girlboss,Never heard of this show and just skimmed through the article. Sounds interesting. Worth watching?
Girlboss,"I did enjoy the show, but it also felt very stressful with almost every decision made feeling like a bad one.

I don’t think I’d fully clocked that the English dub is actually still Birgitte, Danes are crazy good at English.

Stand out for me was probably Asger, really liked his calm competence."
Girlboss,"I like this show a lot. It is sort of a sequel to a show that is more than 10 years old. The original series is also very good. A lot of the people on this show have been in some big shows here after the original Borgen series:

* Sidse Babett Knudsen - Westworld
* Pilou Asbæk - Game of Thrones
* Lars Mikkelsen (brother of Mads) - House of Cards
* Birgitte Hjort Sørensen - Game of Thrones (Hardhome episode)"
Girlboss,"If you like this sort of drama about political machinations it's terrific.

And it's anchored by a very fascinating incredibly well played lead.

Not that everyone else is bad, at all, it's just that she's so great she really carries the whole thing. She's not always right, she's not black and white, but it's impossible not to be engaged with her as she tries to navigate this world.

Also, it's just bloody entertaining. Works well for binging."
Girlboss,"There's an English dub?

I'm nor sure why I'm surprised, just didn't thought they bothered with that with all shows, just the biggest ones."
Girlboss,Pretty sure that the English dub isn't done by Knudsen - she doesn't sound like that in English.
Girlboss,Do you recommend I watch the first show before going into this one?
Girlboss,"Yeh, I like it. All the old Borgen series have one too. I guess it’s easy/cheaper with the actual actors reading the lines!"
Girlboss,Oh really? The parts where she was speaking English matched her mouth movements so I assumed!
Girlboss,"The last season probably functions on it own, but if you know where the charachters come from starting in the beginning of the series it is probably more rewarding to follow their arcs than just the endpoint."
Girlboss,Yes.
Girlboss,You just don't like subtitles?
Girlboss,"That's possible, but it's comparatively rare for an actor to dub themselves. It does happen though:

https://deadline.com/2017/05/cannes-danny-devito-daniel-bruhl-dubbing-actors-interview-news-1202091800/"
Girlboss,"I’ve just gotten lazy, watch over dinner etc so it’s easier to have it dubbed"
Girlboss,"Announce the fucking renewal, Apple.   Or tell us that it’s cancelled.  But don’t leave us in limbo wondering what is going on."
Girlboss,no one told me about the empty girlboss culture and now i have the fomo
Girlboss,"The cultural beating drum of ""girlboss"" feels like an over-correction stemming from centuries of putting girls down instead of encouraging them to look beyond the wife/homemaker role. 

Of course, when corporate America wades into the cultural zeitgeist, they simply must suck all the earnestness out of it and turn it into another soulless marketing gimmick to Make More Money. Buy #girlboss t-shirts! See: Pride month and black history month."
Girlboss,I have no idea what girlboss is but it seems to be a concept made up by wine drinking California execs. Or gives that vibe and feeling
Girlboss,"Awful title, literally just Buzzwords"
Girlboss,"This show is empty and soul less, the doc & bean Ep was the best of the series"
Girlboss,2nd season was dreadful. They just dialed it in
Girlboss,"I can't imagine that it won't be renewed. I don't even really think it's much of a question. I don't think they are going to cancel anything that has any sort of following or buzz and Mythic Quest certainly meets that threshold. And it's certainly a lot cheaper than some of their other shows they have renewed. Apple is planning on hemorrhaging money with their tv division right now anyway and they need content. The bar for renewal over there right now is so low, anything that isn't completely reviled or exorbitantly expensive will just get rubber stamped for the next few years."
Girlboss,"Fucking agreed. That finale works well as either a series or season finale, I just need to know which!"
Girlboss,"Finale is called ""TBD."" They knew exactly what they were doing."
Girlboss,"Cancelled isn’t the word I’d use, it ended really well so they could just not continue it.

But I agree, they should confirm whether it’s coming back or not."
Girlboss,"This show and Ted Lasso are it's two best shows, so I can't see why they wouldn't renew."
Girlboss,There' still no word?
Girlboss,I'd actually be pretty happy if life imitated art and Apple let Mythic Quest end and then auto greenlit the next project from the creative team.
Girlboss,I'm retweeting this to @JPMorganChase so we can #fomo and #girlboss with a multi-national corpration.
Girlboss,This is the funniest comment I’ve read all week
Girlboss,More than centuries…”putting girls down…” has been going on for millennia.
Girlboss,"I agree, but it has its moments which makes it all the more frustrating"
Girlboss,"Yeah it is astounding how creatively bankrupt the people making it are, like Rob Mechalenny or whatever just playing a lite version of Mac his IASIP character, or Cricket's actor playing another super pathetic guy, or how despite getting Ubisoft to help them with the show it seems like they have no idea how games are made, who does what or even the most basic understanding of the topics they talk about."
Girlboss,Dialed it in would mean it got better. You mean phoned it in?
Girlboss,"Gonna start Ted Lasso on Monday!

And you should give Dickinson a shot if you havent."
Girlboss,"Nope. It's really strange to have the show end it's season with no  word about the future of the show.  On the upside, they haven't announced it being cancelled."
Girlboss,"No

Generation that grew up with rotary phones"
Girlboss,"""Since phones used to have dials, some people confuse the terms 'dial it   
in' and 'phone it in'. In reality, the phrases have opposite meanings."""
Girlboss,">”generation that grew up with rotary phones”

What are you doing on reddit? 

I’m surprised that the retirement home lets you have access to the internet at all, to be honest."
Girlboss,"Yup so the origins are established, which is why I included the article. Dial it in was the phrase of choice for our rotary phone generation"
Girlboss,"It’s all part of the homes’ effort to keep us mentally alive. Why just the other day the young lady who helps me on the internet machine showed me how to get a picture on the television of Zoe Mozert. Wowzers the sight of her gams almost knocked me out I can tell you.

You remind me of my grandson that never comes to visit, I was saving this hard candy for him but you can have it."
Girlboss,"But to ""dial"" something ""in"" has always meant to hone in on the ideal result from a less ideal result. And this is not phone related. It's referring to a dial on an electronic device. Like a volume knob.

To ""phone it in"" means to lazily do a task without any care about whether it's being done correctly.

These definitions are separate from what kind of phones you used growing up. They're not interchangable."
Girlboss,"""Dial it in"" is a positive though, as in someone dials in it to win a game of golf.

""Phone it in"" is someone not giving a shit and just doing something because they are obligated to be there."
Girlboss,"Saying you would dial in the number is still a phrase used amongst us.
The fact that dial in also refers to mechanical calibration is coincidental not a matter of law."
Girlboss,Dialing a phone was the common phrase applied to rotary phones
Girlboss,"Nobody is debating that.

> Since phones used to have dials, some people confuse the terms 'dial it in' and 'phone it in'. In reality, the phrases have opposite meanings.

You are one of the people the article you linked is talking about."
Girlboss,It’s great to be famous
Girlboss,*obstinate
Girlboss,I'm just dialing it in.
Girlboss,"Ahhh, you finally get it."
Girlboss,"Indeed, lowest effort dialing it in"
Girlboss,"Oh....you lost it again. Don't worry, English is hard."
Girlboss,"No worries, it's my pleasure to teach you it."
Girlboss,"Should probably learn the difference between simple phrase concepts such as ""dialing it in"" and ""phoning it in"" before you put yourself into a mentor role."
Girlboss,"Except there isnt one. 

You see dialing it in refers to rotary phones , which were the thing back in my day , but I digress. There ends lesson number 1."
Girlboss,"Probably trolling, but I love bait.

Phones having rotary dials has nothing to do with your crackpot definition.

Girlboss,Strange headline looks like the show is called One Good Thing
Girlboss,I feel like this headline is doing a disservice to this show. I have never watched it but the headline makes it sound cringe as hell but all the comments here are saying it's hilarious.
Girlboss,"The show they talk about is Mythic Quest, the show is not called One Good Thing, nor Girlboss as I assumed form this fucking horrible title"
Girlboss,"I love this show and I don’t mind Poppy as a character but fuck does she shout her lines a lot. 

Watching at night I have to volume down whenever she’s on screen."
Girlboss,That honestly sounds awful.
Girlboss,Is one good thing the show? never heard of it
Girlboss,Love love love & Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy is the heart & soul of this show 💖
Girlboss,"First up, they're talking about the show Mythic Quest (real good show)

Secondly, there are a few things I just can't agree with... Poppy seems like she's the only one actually making the game? Well that's because they show that there are about 30 developer, but they only show Poppy actually coding, because the rest of the devs aren't really in the show. 

The romance between the two mentioned characters isn't ""good"" it's imo extremely boring. I won't say much more because honestly romance in TV is almost always boring/unrealistic/stupid, so it being boring is as good as it gets.

I love Poppy's character a lot though, especially when she's trying to be funny and no one laughs, because it's something I do a lot too, make any kind of joke and see if it sticks, and if not just repeat it 10 times - DINNER PARTY"
Girlboss,"This show introduced me to the term ""Sex pest"" which I will forever be thankful for."
Girlboss,"Great show, terrible article"
Girlboss,Yeah. I was confused too.
Girlboss,"The headline is awful , but the show is very good."
Girlboss,She’s the weakest character and the worst actor there.
Girlboss,Why would anyone downvote this? Who'd be that insecure?
Girlboss,I honestly dont think whoever wrote that has actually watched the show
Girlboss,"No, one good thing is the name of the column where a Vox staffer recommends one thing they are enjoying."
Girlboss,Hands down the worst character. Every female on the show from the testers on up is better. Poppy seems to speak in an awful fake accent. If that’s her real voice I’d be surprised.
Girlboss,Well I got teased alot as a child so now I downvote alot of posts for no apparent reason.
Girlboss,I'm not against shows with unlikeable characters who do shitty things to other people but I really can't get into this. The main character is so awful and selfish and shallow and the show never punishes her for it. I can't help but think having the real life Sophia be an executive producer hurt the final product.
Girlboss,"I'm around her age, so probably part of the target demographic for this show, and I'm wondering if the show is expecting me to like her, or even identify with her. This is coming off like how an old person would write a stereotypical ""millennial"".

Is her character supposed to be mentally ill? I swear, she keeps doing crazy bug eyes and generally acting like she should be on industrial strength meds. That's on top of being a total kleptomaniac.

The fashion is kind of disappointing, too. I was expecting more stuff that would make me think ""oooh, I want that."" This show isn't even doing very well in the ""fluffy eye candy"" department."
Girlboss,"Just finished it, liked the show in general but also not much of substance to it, after you get to know the main story line. 

I thought the character of annie was very well played but for the character of sophia maybe britt was trying too hard because at times sophia looked superficial to me."
Girlboss,This show has surpringly great cinematography for a sitcom. The camera work is really nice
Girlboss,"I'm only a few episodes in but I really don't seem to like Sophia at all. It's probably intentional but I can't really root for her with the way she acts in general. Entitled, selfish, lazy, snobby, you name it. That's her. 

I'm really enjoying Jim Rash and RuPaul Charles on the show though."
Girlboss,"I'm in the minority here but I absolutely love this. It very much feels like a show built for college aged people that don't know what the fuck to do and are struggling with their lives, and in a way its comforting to see how Sophia deals with this because although she may be unlikeable you are drawn to her. 

Its like a coming to age opportunity for someone who missed their first shot at actual adulthood due to all sorts of fucked up stuff that she herself played a part in. Its strangely enough a redemption story for someone who quite frankly shouldn't deserve one and I think that's why I like it so much, its believable. She is a bitch about going about it but as the show goes on she does grow in a noticeable positive way. "
Girlboss,"I think it's fair to compare this to Girls, as they're both about similar topics (I.e. ""People in their twenties finding their way"").

Girls is one of my favorite shows ever, even though at the beginning of the show I strongly disliked Hannah. But that dislike was more of a ""Jesus, Hannah, grow the fuck up!"". But in a way I still felt connected to her, and I wanted to keep watching because of that.

With this show, she's just so over the top shitty and narcissistic with zero redeeming qualities. I started the second episode and turned it off after she yelled out the window because I realized that *she's not going to change*. She's gonna remain this shitty, narcissistic person with zero redeeming qualities and everything she is will be validated by her success. I just don't have any interest in watching that."
Girlboss,"Honestly, the directing is on point and the soundtrack is pretty cool. Overall, the cinematography is pretty nice, but the script is cheesy and bad. The main character is absolutly hateable, so, connecting with her is an impossible mission. I'm not liking the acting neither.

Is not the worst show in Netflix (since they got The Ranch or Fuller House), but it's pretty bad in general and it really piss me off, because i really liked the trailer and wanted to enjoy it, but well, no chance for me.

I hope at least some of you had some fun!
"
Girlboss,The show seems interesting but these jokes and punch lines are terrible
Girlboss,"This show pretty much sucked - most of the jokes fell flat, the characters were one-dimensional, there were so many cringey moments. And I feel as though we were supposed to like Sophia, but she was so unlikeable for the most part. 

The one good part that I liked was the 'message board' sequences. Those were clever. "
Girlboss,"I absolutely loved the show, and unlike most commenters here, I think there's a great deal of substance to it. Also, I don't think you're really supposed to like Sophia or identify with her. She's just who she is, and the writers probably didn't expect you to cheer for her.

But at the same time, I fail to see how she's completely detestable, even in the first few episodes. Yes, she's selfish, annoying, vulgar and generally not the best person to be around. But she also has a lot of redeeming qualities – she's energetic, honest and passionate. Also, she's only 23 and at that age, many people are self absorbed, especially those who still have no idea where their life is going. I think the writers did a great job showing how this general lack of direction manifests in her relationships with other people, especially Anne and Shane.

Also, it was shown multiple times that she actually values people in her life, she just doesn't express it properly, or in many situations, she puts her needs in front which honestly I can't really blame her for most of the time. She's actually the independent person that she strives to be and that's kind of admirable. Also, by the end of the season, she had already matured a lot and her development is definitely believable.

Now about Shane: [spoiler](#s ""I didn't like him at all. From the moment they introduced him on the show, I thought there was zero chemistry between Sophia and him. I also think Sophia is just an all around better person than him and that she deserves someone better. She actually demonstrated her care for him and wasn't treated that well in return."")

Anne was great, the other supporting characters were also interesting. I'd also like to note how to concept, despite Sophia's character being relatively familiar and [spoiler](#s ""the episode with her mom kind of predictable""), is fresh and free of the usual tropes and clichés. I think the latter is a very important point, considering how shows like 13 Reasons Why are stealing the spotlight right now.

So yeah, I loved the show and I actually think it's the best one on Netflix for 2017. I can't wait to see more of what they have in store this year."
Girlboss,"I always try to finish shows that I started watching but for some reason I don't want to watch Girlboss anymore.

A 90 minutes movie would work though."
Girlboss,"On the contrary - I don't mind that Sophia isn't likeable. She's not meant to be. She's immature but she's entertaining and passionate. I feel like we've seen this character tons before but Britt Robertson is fun and does her justice. 

The guy who plays Shane is adorable, and as the show goes on, it has heart, and it has some pretty hilarious moments. I like it. 

Edit: I think the show really picks up in the third episode. I really like Shane and that episode is him and Sophia just hanging out around San Francisco. 

Also, as the show progresses you get to know Sophia better and she does mature. I think the development in her relationships, especially with Annie, is great. I like the complicated father daughter relationship. 

Edit 2: I actually just finished the series... I think the strong points in the show are not so much about Sophia but about her relationships. Which is really disappointing when the show is supposed to be about her business. The reality is though that she isn't a very good business person and she's not really a good person either - but by the end of the season, she really does improve a bit... 

I think if this show is missing the right balance. I think that had they continued with her progress, instead of having minor regressions, we could really see that Sophia is a girl boss. But it just doesn't really come off that way. I wanted more moments where Sophia proved herself instead of things just kind of *happening* to her. I like that she's strong willed but I want her to be more than that - I want her to actually be a good business woman. I want her to show that she's smart. I feel like the show skimmed over so much of that. 

The reason this show works so well for me is because everyone that isn't Sophia is extremely likeable. Or maybe, just in contrast to her they are. All of the side characters, from her boss to the art student (forgot his name) to Dax... I like how they all usually bring out the good in Sophia that you don't get to see otherwise. I guess maybe this comes at a time when the unlikeable protagonist has become overused, but I think that Sophia has a lot of potential to grow...  

The last two or three episodes were really really strong. It just took a while to get there.

Also this is just my thoughts about further on in the season[spoiler](#s ""the moment where she goes to see her mom was, well, expected and predictable. How did she track her down? Anyways - the point is, I found that Sophia has a lot of self awareness and a willingness to admit to her mistakes. The moment when she sees her mother lash out and do what she does, and sees how her mom runs away from her problems, she has a huge moment of growth. I wish her character would have had that earlier on in the show, and redeemed Sophia from the unlikeable character early on. I also think that the ending was beautiful. I really really genuinely liked Shane but we're told from the third episode that he is a cheater, despite the fact that he comes off as so nice. And I thought it was so powerful how they showed their breakup - after of course, the expected, but this time worth it and totally justifiable freakout on Sophia's part. It showed a lot - the reluctance on her part, the pain, how much she eventually came to care for Shane. You leave both wanting them to be done and wanting them to get back together. It chose to end on a really interesting note."")"
Girlboss,"""Isn't it novel and empowering that a woman runs a business? Girl Power! HUH?! I've never heard of Murphy Brown."" "
Girlboss,"I'm on episode 3, and I've figured out what annoys me most about the show, apart from the vapid, selfish, immoral main character, which wasn't a dealbreaker in Gone with the Wind, but it is now. 

It's the incredibly poor dialogue and unrealistic script-writing.  Conversations are literally like ""I sold a jacket on ebay!"", ""YOU'RE STARTING A BUSINESS?!"".  That jump makes no sense, and it happens all the time.  The characters act like they've read the book and they're clumsily trying to make it happen. :/"
Girlboss,Uncle Hank is alive!
Girlboss,[deleted]
Girlboss,"All of this is wrong. From the post one-night-stand ""Can I crash here?"" line to the layers of stereotype on the black male bartender character. 

I was really looking forward to a less ""oblivious but smiley"" version of Sophia. "
Girlboss,"Just finished the series and I'm on the fence. I am not sure I liked any of the main characters, particularly Sophia. I did not think there was one redeeming factor about her that made me want to root for the success of her company. Sure, you can be a bad ass ""Girlboss,"" but you don't have to be a dick to every person around you. That doesn't make you a badass, that kind of makes you look like a jackass.
I also felt like the girl who played Annie is definitely one of the redeeming factors of the show, even if she is annoying at times. But she does help Sophia off the ledge toward the end of season one, which is nice, but still does not want me to root for Sophia's success over anyone else's.
I don't know. I was ready to give up after episode four, but it did get better. Just not sure I can recommend it to anyone else yet. "
Girlboss,"In like 3 episodes and this just seems like a painfully unfunny, poor man's Kimmy Schmidt. Like I get that it takes place in SF so everyone's an obnoxious douche, but it makes it hard to get into a show when everyone is just so unlikable. "
Girlboss,You don't have to like a character to enjoy a story.
Girlboss,"Very funny in the first episodes. Then an Atlanta level episode (10, ""Vintage Fashion Forum""). For all 13 eps I'd say it was average (enough to not make me stop until I watched all). 
"
Girlboss,Is this show for my demographic. How big of a role is Dean Norris in this show I only watch shows that have him.
Girlboss,why does the camera move around so much? its annoying.
Girlboss,"one of the things i really loved was the scene in episode 4 where they're watching the Season 3 Finally of The O.C. not only did the dialog feel very genuine as someone who was and still is fan of the show, but it was also very telling since after season 3 with the death of Marissa it caused a huge drop in viewership and eventually ended with the show being cancelled one season later. so for me this was a great little scene.

Yona of the Dawn,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Yona of the Dawn,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Yona of the Dawn,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Yona of the Dawn,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Yona of the Dawn,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Yona of the Dawn,Needs more Jojo
Yona of the Dawn,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Yona of the Dawn,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Yona of the Dawn,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Yona of the Dawn,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Yona of the Dawn,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Yona of the Dawn,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Yona of the Dawn,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Yona of the Dawn,Madoka magica ! 
Yona of the Dawn,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Yona of the Dawn,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Yona of the Dawn,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Yona of the Dawn,Awh no your lie about in April 
Yona of the Dawn,This is actually a really decent list
Yona of the Dawn,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list 
Yona of the Dawn,"You're forgetting

Yona of the Dawn,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
Yona of the Dawn,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Yona of the Dawn,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Yona of the Dawn,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Yona of the Dawn,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Yona of the Dawn,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Yona of the Dawn,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Yona of the Dawn,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Yona of the Dawn,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Yona of the Dawn,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Yona of the Dawn,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Yona of the Dawn,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Yona of the Dawn,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Yona of the Dawn,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Yona of the Dawn,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Yona of the Dawn,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Yona of the Dawn,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Yona of the Dawn,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Yona of the Dawn,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Yona of the Dawn,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Yona of the Dawn,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Yona of the Dawn,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Yona of the Dawn,Black Clover?
Yona of the Dawn,.
Yona of the Dawn,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Yona of the Dawn,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Yona of the Dawn,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Yona of the Dawn,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Yona of the Dawn,[deleted]
Yona of the Dawn,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Yona of the Dawn,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Yona of the Dawn,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Yona of the Dawn,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Yona of the Dawn,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Yona of the Dawn,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Yona of the Dawn,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Yona of the Dawn,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Yona of the Dawn,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Yona of the Dawn,[deleted]
Yona of the Dawn,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Yona of the Dawn,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Yona of the Dawn,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Yona of the Dawn,[deleted]
Yona of the Dawn,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Yona of the Dawn,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Yona of the Dawn,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Yona of the Dawn,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Yona of the Dawn,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Yona of the Dawn,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Yona of the Dawn,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Yona of the Dawn,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Yona of the Dawn,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Yona of the Dawn,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Yona of the Dawn,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Yona of the Dawn,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Yona of the Dawn,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Yona of the Dawn,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Yona of the Dawn,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Yona of the Dawn,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Yona of the Dawn,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Yona of the Dawn,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Yona of the Dawn,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Yona of the Dawn,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Yona of the Dawn,This show was hilarious
Yona of the Dawn,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Yona of the Dawn,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Yona of the Dawn,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Yona of the Dawn,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Yona of the Dawn,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Yona of the Dawn,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Yona of the Dawn,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Yona of the Dawn,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Yona of the Dawn,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Same here. My dad passed away unexpectedly two years ago. We always got along, he was always very protective of me, but I didn't realize how little we'd actually *talked* until after he'd died. This show hit me right in the feels and made me miss the times we'd play games together when I was a kid. "
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,God this is the most click-baity outragy-baity headline I've seen about this yet.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I'm just going to point out, the last time a big budget franchise TV fantasy series was applauded for putting a female character into the leadership role, they turned her into a Hitler analogue."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Bad title and you should feel bad
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Yeah because there definitely wasn't a massively successful fantasy TV show that prominently featured women in positions of power that dominated the zeitgeist for the last decade. And it definitely doesn't have a prequel series that's far superior to rings of power.



Fuck off with your half assed astroturfing, rings of power sucks because it's a bad show, not because audiences aren't ready for powerful women in fantasy"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">Yes, a generation of female fantasy fans (including yours truly) essentially imprinted on Eowyn of Rohan at a very early age—and there are few moments in fiction as satisfying as her “I am no man” declaration just before stabbing the Witch King in the face whether on the page or the screen. But she is also the only female character to play a significant role in the story and essentially had to carry the hopes of an entire gender on her back. 

I am not sure how you can acknowledge this series has had women empowerment heavily involved for decades and then still write this article lol. The lead of this series, Galadriel is a key piece of that series. Arwen is a huge focus in that series. Did they even watch the original trilogy lol."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,These articles just turn me off even more from the show. I'm trying to giving it a chance but they should focus more on making a quality show with actually decent writing first

Expect ratings to keep going down."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,I sure hope Galadriel and Elrond survive. I'll be on the edge of my seat everytime they're in danger!
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,FINALLY
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,At the cost of the worlds integrity.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Finally? Galadriel has been a badass leader since movie 1. Go away stupid journalists.

FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Finally.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,I wouldnt mind that if the show was atleast decent but god it sucks so much
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,And it's proving to be an awful idea
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"As a fan of all of Tolkien's work, I actually enjoy this show, especially the dwarves. I know it's an unpopular opinion but I don't go into watching something expecting to hate it and then have to justify that hatred."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,is this like bait? people love to get outraged
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,[deleted]
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,(and here's why that's a good thing!)
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Exactly.  This article really wants the outrage clicks.

It's crazy how many YouTubers dedicate their entire channel to fake outrage."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Oh no! It SURE would be a SHAME if hundreds of angry men shared this article over and over with all of their angry 😠 friends! (Hey women you should share this too we love you or whatever)
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,I assume you're referring to Game of Thrones but Wheel of Time happened since then.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,I mean the book is/was doing that too. It’s not subtle
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"*the Harry Truman analogue.

FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"This has been predictable for the past decade. Creative product is bad, so the creator preemptively says anyone who doesn’t like it is being _____ist, thereby insulating themselves from any criticism and just turning it into another skirmish in the endless culture war."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Yeah I hate this argument while being more sci fi alien and terminator had badass women leads and I don’t recall anyone not liking it when it’s done right people don’t care
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,You mean the strong female protagonist who the writers turned into Hitler when she got jealous of her boyfriend? Or the other strong female antagonist who turned into an alcoholic that just looked out the balcony all day? Or the other strong female side character who turned into a crying mess when her crush hit it and quit it?
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"They probably didn't, which is why these clickbait articles are just trash."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I have to question Galadriel being a key piece.  She gives them all some gifts, some of which become very plot revalent.  But doesn't her agency end as soon as the Fellowship leaves Lothlorien?

Arwen meanwhile had much more agency in the movies, but they basically had to invent a lot of that.  Her role in saving Frodo in particular was originally written for the character Glorfindel, and Fellowship of the Ring got a ton of pushback for that change.  In the books Arwen is basically a background character who's there to later marry Aragorn.

Eowyn I think is the only woman in the trilogy who's really given some character development and agency.  She struggles, she reacts to and has an effect on what's going on around her, she's actually treated as a point of view character. And that was a huge step Tolkien took in doing that, but it's not like Eowyn was given a lot of company."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">Galadriel is a key piece of that series. Arwen is a huge focus in that series.

They have what, a few scenes each in Fellowship?  Arwen has the scene by the river with the Nazgul, which is awesome, but also notably not from the book, but after that she's a pretty minor character.  She basically just exists to give Aragorn some motivation.  Galadriel's appearances are even briefer.  Both characters could have been cut from the story completely without an effect on the plot.  I mean, people have been pointing out that LOTR doesn't have many female characters for decades.  This isn't exactly a new hot take.  And, importantly, you can accept that is true and still like LOTR."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Lol idk why people like you refuse to acknowledge LOTR didn’t include a lot of women. It doesn’t even pass the bechdel test. I mean, it’s a story about brotherhood so it’s not exactly a “criticism.” But it’s still valid to praise this prequel for having more women. 

I guarantee if lotr came out today people like you would complain the “I am no man” line was too “woke” lmao"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I know that's likely /s, but it's weird that so many people believe it given how successful shows like Battlestar Gallactica, Game of Thrones, The Boys, and several other successful shows where powerful women have been leads."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,TV series was destroyed before it even came out.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,yeah you didnt read that
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">so far it's been a massive failure, putting the entire future of Prime video in jeopardy.

Sounds like a success to me."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"So I started watching this during the Hurricane because I...honestly had nothing better to do, to be honest, and fully expected to find it frustrating and boring.

I...somehow became oddly invested and am quite enjoying it."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"It only gets worse from there, don't bother unless you want to have your childhood ruined."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,(And that's ok)
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,The Boys also did this recently
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Women were always in charge in the WoT universe. It's in the books. In that way, it is not the same as LotR which is written to be a patriarchal world."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,What happened in Wheel of Time that this applies to? Haven't watched that series and don't plan to.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Yup. But the book also makes it clear she's an impressionable teenage girl who is quick to rash decisions and has a dangerous mindset, they didn't try to make her a feminist icon because the fans made the character a meme."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Yeah her character didn't really change too much throughout the show. She just got more power.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,how was she a Truman analogue? Truman barely had anything to do with the use of the atomic bombs
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I mean, why not? For the last 10 years, reddit (mostly bots, tbh) would happily shill this company line, to the point of screaming that anyone who didn't like the newest Star Wars or Wheel of Time or shitty CW show was just a vile, subhuman racist troglodyte."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Bingo
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Not defending the writers of the last season, but you could frame literally every major character who didn't get killed off after four episodes in a similarly negative way if you really wanted to. GoT had complicated characters, that's what made it so great and that's what Rings of Power is desperately missing."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,“Equality is men bad and shutting up. Women good no matter what.” Also if you didn’t notice how she was evil by like season 2 you have a problem.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Strong doesn’t need to equal right, as there are plenty of flawed male leads in the series too. You’re also leaving out several strong female characters that don’t have the kind of faults you are highlighting. Both Tyrell women are some of the most competent leaders in the show, and Olenna Tyrell specifically is probably my favorite female character in any show/book. Though most fans weren’t happy with how OP they made her, Arya is a strong female who leaves the handsome male love interest without a second thought. Sansa grows up from a little sniveling girl into a strong female; she is also is a self-righteous asshole, but so are a lot of the male leads. You also have Yara Greyjoy and Meera Reed, who are both strong females with less faults than your average character. Leanna Mormont’s only fault is she’s too strong of a female, given her age, to the point it’s hard to believe. Even some of the whores in Game of Thrones have more character and complexity than female leads on a network drama. Also, Brienne crying over Jaime doesn’t make her weak; writing a strong female doesn’t mean writing a male character with a vagina. Brienne being emotionally vulnerable in a couple scenes does not in any way negate that she is probably the most chivalrous knight (with significant screen time) that we see in the entire series."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"The Bechdel test sets a very low bar; i mean that thing is as based as it gets. 

But, still one that ought to be overcome."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"True, though you could also cut Legolas and Gimli and replace them with two extra sword hands for Aragon that occasionally have some funny banter."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I don't remember people complain about the ""I am no man"" line, but I definitely remember when the original trailer came out that so many people complained about Arwen replacing Glorfindel when Frodo was taken to Rivendell."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Yikes lol, lot of assumptions here. 

>I guarantee if lotr came out today people like you would complain the “I am no man” line was too “woke” 

Explain to me how literally anything I said in my comment lends itself to that without a massive leap on your part? That is not how I feel at all and I think it's very odd you jumped to that. 

>Lol idk why people like you refuse to acknowledge LOTR didn’t include a lot of women. It doesn’t even pass the bechdel test. I mean, it’s a story about brotherhood so it’s not exactly a “criticism” of the original to praise this prequel for having more women. 

It didn't include a lot of women but the women that were main characters are shown as powerful, independent, strong willed, complex and self sufficient women. Just because those women don't interact with each other (due to literally being hundreds of miles apart) and doesn't pass the Bechdel test on a technicality doesn't diminish that. 

I think more representation of women in the series is great, but I also think it's a stretch to say that women were not empowered in the Original Trilogy. They are all just as strong, if not more so then the male characters and never feel like one-dimensional characters. 

I also don't know if you have watched this series, but other than quite a few minor side characters, there is about one more female main character in this series so far than the OT so it's not like there is some massive change in that regard. I don't feel like this article is correct in a few ways and discounts how incredible the women in the OT were."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Yah, you probably would have people with there hackles up over that line but only because of the constant hamfisted ""Women strong"" thing that every section of popular media pushes. It's a dope line but the social climate would probably affect the perception of it at least as a knee-jerk reaction. People with brains would get over it immediately but yeah, people would have a bad reaction to it because of people like you."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I mean, it depends. Is that line coming amid a movie about brotherhood and fellowship in a world dominated by men? Or is it coming in the middle of an astroturfed trainwreck that’s 90% infallible women delivering cheeseball pablum about empowerment with the male characters reduced to quivering, strawman stereotypes about misogyny?

If the latter, yes, people would complain about it, because it’s clearly just meaningless pandering amid the white noise of similar pandering."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">  It doesn’t even pass the bechdel test.

It does. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fshOP7x0GM"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I agree, Arwen’s story in the films is almost entirely centered around her relationship to Aragon. And Galadriel is not in the films enough for me to consider her a female lead."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,You can have a strong female lead without doing it the annoying female empowerment feminism way.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I'm glad you enjoy it! I like the slower pace of the show, I was afraid it was going to be so slow it would become boring but so far I'm enjoying the slow burn."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">**the last time** a big budget franchise TV fantasy series was **applauded for putting a female character into the leadership role**, they turned her into a Hitler analogue.

That.  In your own words"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"The show was flawed, but come on they definitely set that turn up too. She was freakin crucifying people. Her goal the whole time was to sail across the sea with a combo merc and barbarian army to napalm another continent into submission with dragons.

The fans made her into a ""feminist icon"" because they completely missed the point."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"But I feel like that's the point. She was a tale of how impressionable people are to someone they like all the way up until it's too late and you realize they are a dangrous fascist.

Even *I* was largely duped by her and the show. It's what I love the most about it - the meta nature of her arc."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,like an OP isekai character.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"The bechdel test is a measure of female agency in a story. It’s about how they interact with and impact the narrative. 

The women in the original barely impact the story at all. The books are even worse. Eowyns only character trait is having a crush on Aragon and then falling in love with Faramir lol. Galadriel is powerful, but “strong women” != well written women. 

Seriously the women with the most agency is Shelob lol

> explain to me how anything I said …

I don’t need to explain it. It’s self explanatory. The type of people who unironically think LOTR has great female writing (it doesn’t) are the same type of people who would complaint about an article being too woke (you) and are the same type of people who would complain if the “I am no man” line were shown on screen today.  Seriously just imagine the seething you would see on Reddit if a women in this show actually said that line today lmao."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"eh, bad writing isn't always pandering; sometimes amiss or behoven to (or treaded upon by) corporate thing says makes bad writing worse. Ah, but, good writing- good writing can pander so vehemently it gets black listed - black listed for being Red, as is tradition."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"That’s what took me so long to try it! I figured it would move at a glacial pace, but it doesn’t seem to be.  At least not yet anyway."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Oh I was more thinking about the Hitler part and thought you meant that in WoT they had the strong powerful female leader turn into a fascist in that as well.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,You're the only pretend WoT had even 1/100th the audience GoT did. Nobody remembers because few people watched it.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Right??? I called it years ago, and no one believed me. Most of her plot lines were about how people didn't want to be conquered. The sons of the harpy were a preview of westeros. As much of a dickhead as he us, Lord Tarly was completely right. She was an invader"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">Her goal the whole time was to sail across the sea with a combo merc and barbarian army to napalm another continent into submission with dragons.

God forbid women have any fun 🙄"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">The bechdel test is a measure of female agency in a story. It’s about how they interact with and impact the narrative. 

The women in the OT don't interact because they are hundreds of miles apart. It fails the Bechdel on that technicality, but if you judge every single movie with women in it by the Bechdel test sure you can easily convince yourself there is misogyny at play and disappoint yourself. Failing the Bechdel does not always equal bad writing for women, nor does passing it always equal good writing for women. It is not that simplistic. 

>The women in the original barely impact the story at all. The books are even worse. Eowyns only character trait is having a crush on Aragon and then falling in love with Faramir lol. Galadriel is powerful, but “strong women” != well written women. 

This is **wiiiiilllllldddllllly** wrong. To the point that I think we are probably done here, you obviously haven't seen the OT in quite some time and don't have a good memory of it if this was your takeaway. 

>I don’t need to explain it. It’s self explanatory. The type of people who unironically think LOTR has great female writing (it doesn’t) are the same type of people who would complaint about an article being too woke (you) and are the same type of people who would complain if the “I am no man” line were shown on screen today. Seriously just imagine the seething you would see on Reddit if a women in this show actually said that line today lmao. 

Have you looked into the possibility that you're just being an ass? I am not complaining about the article being woke, I am saying this article isn't accurate because LOTR has had strong and empowered women leads for decades now. And I fully disagree the women of the OT were poorly written, and I think you are in a very, very small minority if that's how you feel. Also that's the best line in possibly the whole series IMO. I am sorry that I am not the boogeyman you hoped I was but I am not that person lol, I am one of the ""woke"" people you are saying I would speak out against."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"The bechdel test isn't actually a measure of female agency in a story. It is honestly a pretty odd ""test"" to even create. It has the same effectiveness as checking to see if the female characters wear blue... CAN you test stories this way? Sure! Does it actually mean anything? No... not really. 

Here's a quick in depth explination as to why it's absurd.

https://youtu.be/Meq3CyuKOjM"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Why would someone care if women had no impact on a story? We surely don't watch stuff to hear women talk??
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"If I could go back in time. . . I'd make Hitler sexy (that would change e v e r y t h i n g )   
\-Russel Brand (probably)"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"That's not what was said.  what was said was ""the last big budget franchise TV fantasy series"".  WoT is that.  End of debate."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I’m going to echo what the other guy said. The primary books and the movie series have never had serious female empowerment or well-written. 

Galadriel has a kickass backstory, but she really doesn’t do much in the series. Arwen is barely there. Goldberry is Tom’s wife. Rose is something for Sam to pine for. 

It’s basically Eowyn. And with a funny point the above poster made, Shelob.

It’s okay to acknowledge this."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Motherfucker I read the books last month for the third time and watched the movies like last week. 

They impact the story but only by reacting to the actions of main characters. they do not direct the plot in any significant way. They are not protagonists that move the story forward any way - they are reaction boards for the main characters. They are functionally reduced to devices to stimulate character development for the main cast. 

The bechdel test demonstrates this because it demonstrates how the story is never ABOUT women. And when it is (like eowyn) it’s still overwhelmingly defined by other men or by her gender . I.e her love for Aragon or her being not a man.

None of this is to say LOTR is “bad.” It’s just to express that these prequels do, in one respect, present a pleasant contrast to the original.


Btw saying the women don’t interact because they’re hundreds of miles apart as if the world is somehow outside of the authors control and you can only have so many women per square kilometer or else you’ll run out of strong women juice is deeply funny to me"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,">The women in the OT don't interact because they are hundreds of miles apart

That just highlights the problem that any woman who could be described as an important character would need to travel hundreds of miles to speak to another woman.  Of the 3 women who can possibly be argued as having agency, it was always limited to how they dealt with men.

You are right that failing the Bechdel test doesn't automatically mean it's bad writing for women, but Lord of the Rings does remain a series where women had very limited agency.

>This is wiiiiilllllldddllllly wrong.

He's not wrong, though.  Arwen in particular is treated as a background character, I can't remember if she even had any dialog in the books.  She existed as someone for Aragorn to love and later for Gimli and Eomer to fight over who was the most fair.

Galadriel at least is written as an important leader, and she has some very good dialog with Frodo.  But as a character she's kind of in the same spot as Elrond, where she provides a place of safe haven for the Fellowship and once they pass through, that was it for her storyline.  The one exception to all that was how she resisted the temptation to the ring, for that scene alone she became a more complex and interesting character.  But except for that scene, the only female agency in the books belongs to Eowyn.  And Eowyn in the books is fantastic!  She's just kind of the only woman who's like that in the whole book trilogy.  I can't blame anyone who thinks that issue can be improved upon when writing new material."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"Many people misuse the Bechdel test, as it was never intended to test if a given movie was written well for women.  Instead if was made to show how vast a particular trend has dominated the industry, and how very few movies existed which had the stated criteria concerning women."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,Yes... I linked the youtube video explaining that.
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"And I didn't watch it since it was a video rather than written out.  I'm assuming that if it explains what I said, they conclude that it's a good test which is widely misused?"
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"If you are implying it is a good way to test society and a bad way to test if a movie is feminist, then yes."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I'll give it a watch then, they way you described it before made it sound like it had written off the test altogether."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"I absolutely love this show, Wierd Al makes an appearance each season and it's always fantastic."
FINAL FANTASY XIV Dad of Light,"However, had it happened during the pandemic we would not have been able to have Tim Omundson because of his stroke.  He's doing much better, as seen in the latest Psych movie, but he would not have been able to play the role in his current state.

Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,And Tim DeKay.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"All of the old cast remarked about Comedy Central and (especially) SciFi suits coming in and trying to give them ""notes"" about their scripts and what to do.

Like, that's why the Sci Fi era host sequences were a (relatively) coherent episodic narrative, rather than just sketches. Some network exec said ""Do it because we told you to""."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,I noticed the other day that she still posts regularly to  her YouTube channel… but hardly gets any views. That’s kinda wholesome that she just does it for fun.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Never was
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Honestly, she is fucking terrible on MST3K too. She is too nerdy-cute to be a mad and is just flat out not funny. She is much more suited to be a host but I certainly wouldn't replace Jonah or Emily with her."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"She probably thinks she is. She has lost a lot of fans over the last few years because of how politically correct she is. She does a lot to make people not like her. The thing that made me stop being a fan was her time on the No Pixel GTA V role play server. She got in because of her popularity online but didn't have a good time, which is unfortunate, but instead of just moving on to something else that she actually liked she tried to shame people for playing characters that were different to them...like race and gender wise. It made one of the long time GTA V role players quit because he didn't like the backlash he was getting from her fans for playing a black guy. He didn't do it with any stereotypes or anything like that but he isn't black so she had a problem with it."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"There are ""ads"" done for some sponsors in character during breaks.

Also, you can buy or rent individual episodes."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"It's a recent development. Only people that have seen the live tour and/or followed the latest kickstarter would really know it was a thing. Nate had been around and prominent as a new Crow performer for a while now. He was really funny on various livestream events they did to promote the kickstarter / new batch of episodes last summer, for example.

Lots of backers basically found out last Friday night that he has been replaced with another performer when an episode he was supposed to be on was streamed for kickstarter backers. There was a brief and easy-to-miss mention that Nate was ""off the bus"" a week or 2 before that on the mst3k forum, but I for one don't read that regularly. So the episode having a performer different from what was advertised in the kickstarter was a surprise."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Do you know why he vanished from the show, the tour, the credits, deleted his social media and has become a ghost? Because he has been Crow T Robot awhile and was very active on twitter about it and other things and then he dissipated like a fart in the wind and it makes no sense."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"He became a dad back in November, and took time off from the tour to be present for that. So entirely possible he just did a mental-health social media deletion. 

Or maybe not. No idea!"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Sure, but he was extremely active on twitter all the time about his portfolio and pushing his highlight reels and then he deleted everything at once. His entire career. His livelihood. It doesn’t make sense."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Covid reasons; they had separate East and West coast set-ups, so they needed two lots of cast."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"100% agree. I watched all the season 11 episodes and some episodes were better than others about it, but it was a consistent problem. Rifftrax also has the problem sometimes of including too many riffs, though their hitrate is higher and I don't care as much when it's a movie I've seen before"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"As a person with early access, it sounds much better this season... at least the first episode."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"The new season, or atleast the first three episodes that are out for backers, may be up your alley. The riffs are way more spaced out and everything feels more relaxed. Also all three episodes have been really really good with the riffs.

It does have other problems. Undeniably the worst rendition of the beloved theme song by a country mile. Like its really, really, really bad. The look of the non theatre segments is pretty bad too, not because it's cheap but because its all so flat and plain. None of the warmth or fun of the old sets, the old sets, cheap as they were felt cozy. These feel lifeless.

But, these are relatively minor complaints. We watch mst3k for the riffing and the riffing has been incredible/hysterical."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Same problem with Rifftrax. Its just pillar to post with riffs that mostly fall flat. 

Its all really pointed contemporary pop culture references that rarely have any relevance to the movie itself."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"And 300

“This is Spart-of a complete breakfast”"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Most rifftrax are free on YouTube and twitch
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Oh I know, but Nate has left the show and she ADR'd all of Crow's lines for the new season apparently. 

And it had been bugging me where I knew her name from and it finally clicked."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Yeah she gets less than 1k viewers when she's on twitch as well.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Maybe not queen, but she was certainly one of the biggest “nerdy” internet personalities for a time. There’s no denying the impact on pop culture she had in the late 2000s/ early 2010s. She was in every major “nerdy” show from Eureka to Supernatural, and her company Geek & Sundry is where Critical Role got its start. That’s not to mention The Guild and Dr. Horrible, two of the biggest web-series of the era. She was a pretty, charismatic girl into geeky hobbies in a period when those hobbies were getting more and more mainstream. It’s not all that shocking that she developed the following she did."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,[deleted]
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Exactly this. She has never once been entertaining, just overly annoying. The only reason anyone ever gave a single shit was because they got a woody. Gross."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,“Im a dad now so I’d better stop promoting myself online and showcasing my career talents which make me money”
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Everything but his personal webpage, which links to his linkedin, his youtube page, and his soundcloud, which are still all up, if not recently active."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"They've been honest that some of the set construction was due to Covid restrictions; they initially thought they were going to have to do everything remotely. Greenscreen requires fewer people than full scale set construction.

Emily's first episode dropped for backers on Friday evening and - some complaints about Crow's voice aside - went down a treat. The song in the final segment is up there with ""Every Country Has A Monster""."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,tubi has a ton of them for free
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"I really don't understand how she became the face of ""nerdy"" hobbies. She was in one mediocre show that featured Wil Wheaton of all people, and suddenly she's the queen of the nerds? Made me hate anything fantasy/sci fi related for a while"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"She was the head of Geek and Sundry which was the biggest ""nerdy"" hobby channel on youtube she wasn't just from the guild lol"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,the head of what
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Geek and sundry. Known for Critical role, the guild and Dr horribles sing along blog. 

She was at the forefront of nerd culture going mainstream in 2000-2010 because she embraced an monjtized it early, getting a lot of nerd projects off the ground when no one else cared. Its no surprise she's involved with lots of beloved series now."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"I'm a Kickstarter backer, so I'm interested in hearing more opinions about the new season. I'd say it's an upgrade over the Netflix seasons as the riffs are given more time to breathe. Personally Munchie was my favorite episode of the season. Emily and crew are great, but I wish they were given better movies to work with. I found Emily's crew first movie, Beyond Atlantis, to be boring despite their riffing. I preferred the Sci-Fi era with Mike and episodes like Werewolf, Space Mutiny, and Hobgoblins."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,On Pluto TV
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"In case you're wondering, there are two main hosts and associated bots this season. Emily Marsh did the live tour and resides on the Simulator of Love with her own versions of Crow and Servo. Her Crow is voiced by a woman doing a male voice, but you get used to it."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Is there yet a place to exchange money for the show so I don’t have to watch commercials that wasn’t that crazy ass 135 dollar charge they originally asked for?
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"It's really good, definitely worth watching. Joel's return for Demon Squad was great, more Jonah is good, and it was cool to see Live Show people like Emily and Mega-Cynthia get into the main show. If you want to just give one episode a shot I recommend Gamera vs Jiger."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,I didn’t even know they made another season… sweeeet
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Do they watch any Joe Don Baker movies?
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,I have it on Pluto TV for free!
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"“Currently there are no plans for additional episodes of MST3K... but never say never.”
WRONG.  They already said they’re planning season 14 and it’ll likely be about 2 years.

Also it has already found a home on gizmoplex.com, no need for Pluto."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"I guess that must be Felicia Day in the picture, but damn she really looks like Becca Scott there. Maybe some overdone photoshop?"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,For Free ^^^with ^^^commercials..
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Been watching the reruns on twitch.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Still waiting on my Blu-rays from the last Kickstarter.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Still catching up, but I do agree the riffing feels a lot better in this new season. The delivery in the Netflix episodes feels too early, like they're getting the line out sometimes before the relevant subject of the joke has been on screen long enough to even be properly recognized by the viewer. They've definitely given lines a little more room to breathe this time around so I'm looking forward to finishing up the new episodes"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Big Joel/Mike episode fan here. Kickstarted the first Netflix run, watched a few of those episodes, but hadn't had a chance to check out the new Gizmoplex episodes.

For me, the actual riffing on the Jonah-hosted episodes isn't bad. It's not nearly as sharp as the writing on the original run, but it's passable. I'll agree that the pace of the riffing of the Gizmoplex episodes is much better than that of the Netflix episodes.

On the other hand, the Emily episodes are a hard pass. Her Tom Servo was... OK, but the voice of her Crow was just absolutely nails on chalkboard for me. That alone was enough to take me right out, because it was just SO distracting from both the riffs AND the movie, and it's just omnipresent.

Regardless of whether it's Emily or Jonah, the host segments on any of the new episodes are totally, entirely unwatchable. It just feels like everyone involved are trying WAAAAAAAY too hard, and when you're trying that hard, you inevitably fail.

While I get that they're on a budget, I really, really, REALLY miss the intentionally crappy physical sets from the original run. The chroma-keyed computer generated sets just don't work for me. Like, at all. It feels cheap in a bad way, like ""we didn't have money to do a real set so this is what we're stuck with,"" not the cheap but charming of the physical sets from the original run.

I'm sorry, but Felicia still doesn't work for me as a ""mad."" I still think she's totally miscast. She is just incredibly, incredibly annoying for me on this show. I like her in other stuff, but her on this show is a big nope for me.

Finally, the opening credits make it look like a kids show. Horrible."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Paulll, you is a wurrwilf???"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"The Netflix seasons were the first time I really watched, and I thought this new season was much more enjoyable.

Emily seems like a fantastic host, I think her puppeteering background comes through in her interactions with the bots. Jonah's growing on me as well. 

I thought about buying a channel membership, but it seems like a strange set-up right now. They're offering the previous year's content for $150, with no indication that you'd receive the next year's stuff. 

In any case I'm glad they're successful, but I'd love something more similar to a regular streaming service."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Oof. I felt the exact opposite. Watched 4-5 episodes on Pluto this week and my buddy and I both commented on how rapid fire the jokes were, most of which didn’t even come close to landing. It’s a genuinely bad season."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,I tapped out early during Netflix season one because of constant rapid fire jokes.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"I usually go to bed with the Rifftracks or MST3k channels playing but they also have them on demand. Sure, it has ads but being completely free, I don’t mind that so much."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,I have just about every streaming service but end up watching more Pluto than anything.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Yes! Thank you 🙏
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"It took me about half an episode, but her Crow grew on me. Helps that Emily herself is such a good host, I caught her live in the Time Bubble Tour and it was amazing."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Two main hosts, and Joel does an episode as well as a combined host  riff for the Christmas episode.


No spoilers, but listen closely to the bots for Joel's episode."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Also a kickstarter backer here, but [Gizmoplex](https://www.gizmoplex.com/browse) has them for $4.99 to RENT // $14.99 to OWN 

Looks like the season pass is $149, but that includes a bunch of shorts and live events too"
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"I'm not sure if gizmoplex is selling single episodes yet, but gizmoplex would be the best place."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"It's good too, a step up from the Netflix seasons."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Look like Felecia to me 🤷‍♂️
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Pluto is surprisingly sparse with the commercials.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"For a show with roots in basic cable, it doesn't feel as intrusive as it could."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"The timeline for the blu rays was always going to be at least a few months after the season ended. Since the last short aired Feb. 10, we're not really into a super-delayed zone yet for the physical release.

The other physical rewards are kind of late at this point, however."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,This makes me want to check it out. I really wasn't a fan of the Netflix version due to all this. It felt oddly overproduced and overwritten. Appreciate hearing the new season is an improvement.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Hey man, if it's not for you that's cool too. I get what you're saying with the ""trying too hard thing"". Also how offputting it can be if you find a character annoying. It's why I can't watch any episodes of Bob's Burgers with Megan Mullany's character in it. 

Joel did his whole sleepy eyed thing so it was a totally different vibe. Still he was the dad to the bots. Mike had a very brotherly relationship with the bots. I just think Jonah and Emily's chemistry with the bots will take more time to solidify and tighten.

As for the sets, yeah I miss physical sets, but I feel like that's just the way Hollywood tends to be today with green screens and digital effects. Plus, I could be wrong, but I think a lot of this season was done during the COVID period. So people needed to be staggered and taped at a later times."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,Hey look an ancient beer can! Oh...
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Well, that's why I asked for opinions. I don't think it's as good as the classic series, but that crew had many years working together and the tight chemistry reflected that. However, in comparison to the Netflix seasons I do think it's an improvement."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,My only issue with Pluto is the commercials. Not that there are commercials but that it’s the same three or four over and over again. I’ve never watched Teen Wolf and have no desire to but I can recite the promo for the new made for Tv movie coming out word for word. It plays constantly.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Yeah, much love to the new crow voice. I expect the voice change to be the biggest thing people will complain about because they can."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"Joel does 2 episodes on his own.  ""Demon Squad"" is the one you're referring to, but he also does ""The Bubble"" later in the season."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,"13 shorts, including a second go at the legendary ""Mr B. Natural""."
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,$150 what the actual fuck
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,They are.
Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return,That is SO far from the truth
Rock Lee,[deleted]
Rock Lee,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Rock Lee,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Rock Lee,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.

Rock Lee,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Rock Lee,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Rock Lee,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Rock Lee,🙂💕
Rock Lee,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Rock Lee,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Rock Lee,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Rock Lee,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Rock Lee,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Rock Lee,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Rock Lee,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Rock Lee,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Rock Lee,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Rock Lee,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Rock Lee,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Rock Lee,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Rock Lee,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Rock Lee,And Malik 'Phife Dog' Taylor. 
Rock Lee,"I'm at 167...  Avg age is 76 years.

edit: Decided to add the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19y91wGt5YMeFL1U2iHAfXZWDcGBE5cDxNa_ya2yArfc/edit?usp=sharing) I've been keeping with their date of death, occupation, and age at death.

edit 2: Removed the long list of names.  Just look at the spreadsheet.  If someone isn't on that list, it's because I didn't know of them personally.  I didn't run down a list from Wiki or anything.  So if I'm missing one, just let me know and I'll add them.  ""Celebrity"" is a subjective term.  Thanks for helping me fill it in."
Rock Lee,"Would like to see a similar analysis, but with 2 adjustments:

1) Create a weighting system for the level of ""celebrity"".

2) Have younger deaths weighted higher.

For instance, Abe Vigoda's death was probably not as impactful as Prince's due to their comparative ages and level of celebrity.
"
Rock Lee,"Crackpot theory:

There were a lot fewer famous people in 1930, right? Just fewer media venues by which to become well known (no NFL, no TV, etc...). Since then, we've had more and more ways to get famous, and therefore more famous people. 

Flash forward to now, all those people born in 1930 are getting over the age of 85, which has to be somewhere near the age that just as many people in that cohort will be dead as would be alive...It's not a conspiracy, merely that we're pulling from a much deeper pool of people who have used up all their minutes as time goes by and more and more people become ""famous""."
Rock Lee,"As a note, Christina Grimmie isn't on this list- she was a singer that had been on the Voice. She wasn't extremely famous, but she had a fairly large following on youtube and was touring and doing concerts and the like.

She was 22, and a gunman shot her while she was signing autographs after finishing a concert in Orlando on Jun 10, 2016. http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/voice-alum-christina-grimmie-shot-orlando-concert-critical/story?id=39774979

I would imagine that it would be likely that some people may not be on that list who weren't 'famous enough' but were rising stars- and I remember that Christina Grimmie's death really struck a lot of people- especially as other famous performers were giving their condolences to her on social media. :(

Rock Lee,"This proves it, celebrity warming is real."
Rock Lee,Johan Cruyff? 
Rock Lee,Forgot Elie Wiesel
Rock Lee,"A little sad nobody has mentioned Christina Grimmie. She may not have been that famous, but she had quite a following. And she got shot and killed immediately after one of her own concerts, while in her young 20s."
Rock Lee,by 2025 there might be only 4 famous people left.
Rock Lee,[deleted]
Rock Lee,Why isn't Lemmy on the 2015 list?
Rock Lee,"The entire Red Army Chorus died in a plane crash this past week. The average person may not know them, but in Choral circles they have been iconic for decades. An entire unique culture of music wiped out in an instant. A monumental loss to great music."
Rock Lee,"Maybe it's just me, but the names on the 2016 list strike me a different caliber than many of the names on the 2015 list, and that's why 2016 seems so much worse. I mean... that and recency bias.

Jerry Tarkanian and Billy Casper are pretty deep cuts in the catalog of ""sports celebrities"" compared to, say... Arnold Palmer or Muhammad Ali."
Rock Lee,[Scrooge McDuck](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949241/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm) died this year too.
Rock Lee,"The (relatively) same number of people have died in 2014, 15 and 16. The only difference is the importance we attribute to those people. 

And before the downvote onslaught begins, I do think it's sad that people I like and admire are gone, but I also think 'famous' it a fairly arbitrary measurement. "
Rock Lee,"Honestly, seeing all the names looks like there were more notable passing this year. "
Rock Lee,It's almost as if a generation of famous people who used drugs for decades is having it catch up with them.
Rock Lee,"The UK has had quite a few big deaths this year that are quite specific to us, like Caroline Aherne and Terry Wogan. "
Rock Lee,"It's also notable that the year has been 'bookended' by celebrity deaths. Bowie, Rickman, Lemmy at the start, George Michael and Carrie Fisher recently. This makes it much more memorable as a 'deadly' year, rather than if the deaths had clustered around the middle. We noticed the deaths at a time when we were also particularly aware of the year."
Rock Lee,"As a parent of a toddler, I would like to see Anna Dewdney mentioned on at least one of these lists.  Her books are at least one of the few tolerable ones I've had to read over 100x.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Dewdney"
Rock Lee,[deleted]
Rock Lee,TIL: Humans and celebrities alike are mortal...
Rock Lee,from analyzing the data it looks like 125 will die in 2017.
Rock Lee,"For fuck sake, where's [Leon Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Russell) in any of these lists? He made more of an impact in music in the 60's and '70's than 90% of all musicians. He was Elton John's hero and inspiration."
Rock Lee,"Joan Sebastian and Juan Gabriel also died, they are very famous Mexican music artists."
Rock Lee,Seeing Alan Rickmans name kills me a little each time 
Rock Lee,And Craig Sager
Rock Lee,who decides the level of fame that qualifies?
Rock Lee,"If the list wasn't exclusive for humans, we could add Harambe and my parakeet Commander Spock"
Rock Lee,"And Bernie Worrell, one of the greatest musicians ever. Wrote and played alot of songs for Parliament of Funkadelic"
Rock Lee,"Imagine that, Reddit and increased news coverage making things seem worse than they were in the past...
Edit Spelling"
Rock Lee,"At the same time, the word ""famous"" is subjective to each person so there is no definite number each year. Having said that, this year has been quite fucked up."
Rock Lee,And yet life goes on just fine without them.  They may have been famous but they were just human beings like the rest of us.
Rock Lee,"I wonder if someone has an index of how famous a celebrity is, then we can get the weighted mean of each year. "
Rock Lee,"Been really trying to figure out how to put these deaths into perspective for why it feels like so many famous people are dying...because even these numbers are off.

Wiki has 1000s of people. CNN has ~120 this year, 158 for 2015. If you start weighting them, does it help? Do you weight by being well known- and if so how do we know who is well known? If we go by our own personal knowledge, it could cut out someone who happens to be a gap in what you/I know.

I think there's too many arbitrary things going on here and the real truth is simple: because we are more and more connected, more people are famous, and more people feel as though they're dying because we actually hear about them."
Rock Lee,"Yeah... Every year adds more celebrities to the total pool of celebrities, so over time there will obviously be more celebrity deaths. I really hope each year doesn't become a meme. Celebrities are people, and every person dies.
"
Rock Lee,"Someones post stuck in my brain it said something like ""people are going to be in shock when more famous people continue to die in 2017."""
Rock Lee,How many non-celebrities died? 
Rock Lee,Does that mean that 2017 will claim the lives of 125 famous people?
Rock Lee,"This seems to have a heavy American bias.
Sir Terry Wogan, Ronnie Corbett, Victoria Wood, Liz Smith and Caroline Aherne all died this year and all these deaths were of significance in the UK.

I suspect a list that included people who died, who were also known by tens of millions of people, would be in the thousands.
"
Rock Lee,Should we really be surprised...? A lot of famous people are old. Old people die. It's a fact of life. Go on with yours.
Rock Lee,It's just that society liked these ones better?
Rock Lee,"I liked some of these people, but I never knew them and not a single one of them ever knew me.

Pardon me if I don't cry over a single one of them.


What about the people nobody ever heard of who died anonymous and lonely?"
Rock Lee,"Rust In Peace, Nick Menza. "
Rock Lee,"Every year, people watch more and more TV, so in turn, there are more ""famous"" people.  It just makes sense. There will be more in 2017."
Rock Lee,"I blame aging Baby Boomers (those born in 1946 are now 70), long term drug abuse, and the fact that there are simply more celebrities around due to the population being much larger than it once was.

The number of celebrities dying in one year will therefore continue to increase over time, unless and until geriatric medicine advances further and celebrities find things to do in their spare time other than medicating themselves with things that cause permanent liver, lung, heart and circulatory damage."
Rock Lee,[deleted]
Rock Lee,Where's Harambe? 
Rock Lee,"It's not that famous people are dieing more, it's just that really awesome famous people are dieing. "
Rock Lee,"This is a trend which is likely to continue. Being famous is a fairly recent phenomenon. Ever since the creation of the television, the rise in the music industry, and the birth of the internet, more and more famous people are created every year. This, unfortunately, means more and more famous people will die each year too. This trend is likely to continue rising exponentially for a while than slow down into a gradually upwards trend."
Rock Lee,"Something to keep in mind. 

""It is time to stop being superstitious and pretending a calendar year is killing people. Alcoholism and drug abuse are killing people. Next year it will kill more. Next year it might be your favorite recording artist, or maybe your best friend, or your brother, or maybe even you."" https://medium.com/@justjudyanne/2016-is-not-killing-people-984b583a0ecc#.u8nhx1201"
Rock Lee,"Celebrity deaths are the result of global warming

/r/correlation  "
Rock Lee,But people die. These people just so happened to be famous.
Rock Lee,"Yeah but it seems like we lost more ""icons."" People who paved the way for others, people who were ahead of their time, who progressed us."
Rock Lee,Why is a murderous dictator on a list with beloved celebrities?
Rock Lee,There is obviously a direct correlation between climate change and celebrity deaths.
Rock Lee,Am I the only one who doesn't give a shit about celebrity deaths? Why is everyone so obsessed with celebrity deaths? 
Rock Lee,"Define ""famous"". There were much bigger names in 2016 than the other years. "
Rock Lee,George Michael died?!? 
Rock Lee,"Good. Keep this up and in a few years all the famous people will be dead.

It's a massive win/win."
Rock Lee,"It's inevitable that every person on earth will experience the people they love passing away before them, or as they say ""only the good die young."" The first noble truth."
Rock Lee,Omg it's an epidemic
Rock Lee,I know about 5 people from 2015. About 30 from the 2016 list
Rock Lee,"Meanwhile, I'm over here still trying to get over Michael Jackson."
Rock Lee,"My roommates and I went through this exercise the day carrie fisher died. We went back 8 years. Weighted the deaths by age and celebrity. We put all the impactful deaths to us on a white board by year and then rated each year. In ages, we range from 50-19. We found that 2009, 2014 and 2016 were the most impactful based on the people who died. 

Then we put in our predictions for 2017. We're going to hell for sure, but looks like we will be in good company. "
Rock Lee,You forgot Glen and Abraham
Rock Lee,"Isn't this just going to increase as the amount of media increases? There are more channels (or media ""types"" if you include things like youtube / facebook / whatever) so there are more avenues for people to become ""famous"" within.  "
Rock Lee,"Missing from this list is Varsity Blues star Ron Lester who died June 17, 2016.  "
My Secret Diary,The Secret Diary of DP is one of those lost media shows.  It's sitting somewhere in a Paramount vault.  Insane show but it needs to see the light of day.
My Secret Diary,This is still one of my favorite references in the Clerks cartoon. Classic Pfeiffer.
My Secret Diary,The only reason I knew the show existed was because Clerks the Animated Series referenced it.  And that show was also too good to last.
My Secret Diary,I love that the production company is called Bad Wolf.
My Secret Diary,Well this is one I'll be keeping an eye out for
My Secret Diary,Season one of Succession was great. Haven't seen any of series two yet though.
My Secret Diary,Source say she is starring in this show Because She Wants To.
My Secret Diary,Still want her to make another appearance on Doctor Who again. Even if it's only for 1 episode lol
My Secret Diary,"Sorry, there are a lot of TV show names in this title that I'm getting confused.

So is the show called 'I Hate Suzy'? Also what is a sky drama?"
My Secret Diary,It’s even better so far. Episode 2 was one of the best in the series.
My Secret Diary,"I just got into this show and yeah, it's great so far. I didn't think that I was going to like a show about wealthy people being wealthy and running a company. I thought it was going to be kind of self serious and boring but that's not the case. It's actually really funny and goofy. It's like if Arrested Development disguised itself as a drama."
My Secret Diary,Nice
My Secret Diary,"She came back for the 50th, and she's doing Big Finish audio dramas."
My Secret Diary,"Yes, the show is called ""I hate Suzy"". And Sky is a telecommunication company where said show will air."
My Secret Diary,I hate Suzy is the name of the show. It's from the same writer as Secret Diary of a Call Girl and Seccession. Sky is a UK distributor and that's where Billie Piper's new show will air
My Secret Diary,Got it! Thanks. I think the title of the article was worded weird and I was reading it all wrong.
My Secret Diary,Never Have I Ever gets great though.
My Secret Diary,Does anyone remember ***Kyle XY***
My Secret Diary,"Of the shows you want to see, I think Friday Night Lights is the best and I don't even like football.  There is a rough patch (I think S2?) usually faulted because of the writer's strike but don't worry, it swings back to being a damn good show for rest of its run."
My Secret Diary,"Sex Education is very good.

While it’s not one of my all time favorites, Adam Groff is one of my all time favorite tv characters."
My Secret Diary,"I have never listed list Friday Night Lights as Teenage drama, but if it is categorized as such. It is that one. 

It is one of the greatest shows ever. FNL is on the short list with The Wire, MASH, Breaking Bad, GOT."
My Secret Diary,"favorite: the 100
least favorite: reign"
My Secret Diary,"Favorite: Euphoria Season 1

Least Favorite: Euphoria Season 2

Showrunner lost his damn mind."
My Secret Diary,"I have quite a few favourite teen-dramas... some great ones (judging from your list) that you haven't seen yet and I'd like to recommend. Though some might only *sort of* be considered as such (*I'll make not of those*):

* **Skins**
* **Skam**
* **Euphoria** (*though not to be considered ""young adult"" since it's very explicit*)
* **Looking For Alaska** (*not your traditional teen setting or story, but they are teenagers so it should count*)
* **L'amica geniale** (My Brilliant Friend) [*more of a ""coming-of-age"" than a ""teen-drama"" tbh, but for a majority of seasons 1 & 2 the characters are teenagers*]
* **Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo** (We Children From Bahnhof Zoo) [*another one for mature audiences like Euphoria*]
* **Dance Academy** (*this one is set in a school of dance, but is very much a teen drama*)"
My Secret Diary,"**Least favorite:**

Popular (after the first season)

Glee


**Favorite, western shows:**

Freaks and Geeks

Degrassi (original)

Buffy the Vampire Slayer

Party of Five

Heartstopper


**Favorite, Asian shows:**

Extracurricular (stars teens, so I'm counting it.)

Detention

Not Me

Solomon's Perjury

Girl From Nowhere

Daughters

Candy Online

The Underclass

49 Days With a Merman (silly, but fun)

Nightmare High

School Tales"
My Secret Diary,Cruel Summer had no right to be as good as it was.
My Secret Diary,Can't really say I have a favorite. Maybe HeartBreak high at the moment
My Secret Diary,"I am severely disappointed that Smallville is in the ""not crazy about"" category as it is one of my all time faves, otherwise the list is pretty good.

Friday Night Lights is insanely good though, kinda gives a little OC vibes (on season 3 ep 25 of the OC currently)

Season 2 of Outer Banks is really good too.

I really liked The Wilds, unfortunately it got cancelled, so no season 3.

90210 is on my list but I haven't seen it yet, do you not want to watch it or just haven't heard of it?

The Sex Lives of College Girls is good too, better than I thought it would be.

Fresh Meat is a decent show, I stopped watching around season 2 though, was getting a bit stale.

My favorite has to be Blue Mountain State tho, not exactly sure though if it fits the teen/YA category. But it is a college show."
My Secret Diary,You named most of the major ones. Though I also liked some of what you listed in the don't like category. Buffy is the quintessential fantasy teen show in my opinion. Veronica Mars is the best in the murder mystery category. I'd maybe say One Tree Hill for just normal teen dramas. The first couple seasons of Skins (UK) is worth watching. But it gets more and more ridiculous with each new set of teens.
My Secret Diary,"[The Secret Circle](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1837654/)

>16 year old Cassie Blake moves to Chance Harbor, Washington to live with her grandmother after her mother mysteriously dies. She discovers she's a witch along with 5 other teens.

>Nikita, an assassin and spy goes rogue and works to bring down Division, the secret government agency that trained her. Meanwhile, Division is training its next crop of young killers."
My Secret Diary,"I am a teen drama aficionado! haha this is my genre! My favorites are admittedly: 

Degrassi: I just grew up with this. watch every season once a year, including the 80s version of the show!

Dance Academy: UNDERATED! I first saw it because it was premeiring on Teen Nick after Degrassi, and now I rewatch quite a bit. Sooo good. The dancing is incredible, and the drama is realistic and they cover some heavy topics. (Honorable mention: The Next Step is also good, but that one is definitely made for kids. haha)

Sex Lives of College Girls: definitely an older demographic, but soooo good! The new season just came out today, so I'm definitely gonna watch that when I get off work, but season 1 quickly shot up to one of my favorite shows of all time!"
My Secret Diary,"Oh, does it? That's good to know! I only watched the first season. Maybe I'll give it another shot. Thank you!"
My Secret Diary,"Yeah, that strike was unfortunate for a bunch of shows. (But necessary, so I'm ultimately glad it happened.) I'm still super bummed the third season of Supernatural got cut short because of the strike.

The only reason I've avoided FNL is I don't care about (or, to be completely transparent, understand the rules of) football. But. I've heard (from others and now you) that you don't need to be a football fan to get into the show. People always say the characters, acting, and writing are amazing. I need to hop on the bandwagon ASAP."
My Secret Diary,"I forgot about this one! I watched the first season when it dropped and really liked it. I need to get caught up. Thanks for the reminder!! (Also, am I crazy, or did it recently get cancelled?)"
My Secret Diary,I've watched the pilot of The Wire a few times but I haven't been able to get into it. I really want to love it because everyone else on the planet seems to be obsessed with it. Does it just take a couple of episodes to get into it?
My Secret Diary,"I think I've only seen the pilot of Reign, so I don't really know or remember anything about it. Without spoiling anything in case I end up watching it one day, do you mind telling me what you didn't like about it? Just curious. Thanks! :)"
My Secret Diary,"I've heard from peers that he is, to say the least, very difficult to work for. I don't want to spread rumors, though. I've never worked with him. But I've heard a lot of stuff about him from people who also work in (pardon me for being gross) ""the biz."""
My Secret Diary,"Also -- while I will absolutely admit that Season 2 isn't as good as Season 1, there are two episodes I absolutely love. As a certified gay, I love the ""Holding Out for a Hero"" scene. It's just so fun. I also love the episode where Rue is trying to escape from from the scary drug dealer lady's house. The rest of the season? I thought it was fine. Just not solid like Season 1 was. But I didn't dislike Apple Tattoo Singer Guy -- I know a lot of people did. Maybe I just thought he was cute. I dunno.

And while I almost always am okay with nudity if it's somehow relevant and/or important for the story being told... *Euphoria* goes way too hard. (Somehow even harder than *Game of Thrones?* Like, how is that even possible?) The show's use of nudity pretty much always feels so gratuitous, unnecessary, porny, and gross. It just makes you feel bad for the cast. The only time I understood why they did ""all the nudity"" was the locker room scene in 1x02. I thought that scene was pretty brilliant. I love how it really deep-dived into Nate's fuckeduppedness."
My Secret Diary,"Looking For Alaska - YA with an ending that is, both, YA to the point and the obvious ending to the story).


L'amica geniale - I doubt this would be classed as YA (given it's book origin) but it covers that period of life supremely well. Achingly poignant series, setting and acting.  


Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo - haven't seen the series but did, decades ago, see the film of the book it is based on (Christiane F.) I take it the series isn't as bleak (though it probably is given the subject matter)."
My Secret Diary,I'm shocked -- I've never even heard of this one! Where can I watch it? What's it about?
My Secret Diary,"Also -- and I'm being genuine, not an ass -- your use of ""severely"" made me chuckle. Haha."
My Secret Diary,"I loved *Smallville* as a kid, though! The shirtless picture of Tom Welling on the front of the Season 1 DVD box(ed?) set was an ***essential*** part of my gay awakening. And **\*\*\*PILOT SPOILER\*\*\*** I'll always love the scene in the pilot where Lana's parents get hit by the meteor. I know it's not supposed to be funny. And it shouldn't be. And yet... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3T4Z0Mq8bU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3T4Z0Mq8bU)"
My Secret Diary,If you didn’t like season one you probably won’t like the rest of it. It stays consistent in quality and tone to that
My Secret Diary,"Yeah, the football theme kept me from watching the show until long after it had aired.  I think the real strength of the show is in the performances, especially Kyle Chandler and Connie Britton who play the Taylors.  You really don't need to understand or enjoy football to love FNL because it is the relationships formed that make everything so interesting."
My Secret Diary,No. A new season is about to start but it may be the final season.
My Secret Diary,"> Does it just take a couple of episodes to get into it?

It didn't for me."
My Secret Diary,"it is pretty much the epitome of what people consider a “CW” show you know, extremely cringey, anticlimactic, love triangles (personally not my thing), and characters dont do anything that makes sense, ive only seen the first season but thats what i remember"
My Secret Diary,"Can't speak to how he is as a boss, but the show gave every indication of being poorly run/going off the rails. Characters were abruptly written in and out of the narrative, plot lines underdeveloped or dropped out of nowhere, and the ending was outrageously thin and retroactively damaged the prior season. Given Levinson's history it stood to reason that the one character remaining getting good writing and good storylines, Rue, was his self-insert."
My Secret Diary,"Its on Netflix and its a remake of an old Australian 90s show. Its kinda like a mix of degrassi and sex education. The premise is that the main character, Amerie and her best friend Harper made a sex map of who slept with who in their class and it gets discovered and a bunch of drama comes from it. I'm not really good at explaining things, lol, so here's there [trailer ](https://youtu.be/dXpa5PrtuP0)

Its also very queer and has amazing representation if that's something you're into"
My Secret Diary,"Oh yeah! The new Heartbreak High is sooo good. Highly recommend! It was already renewed for season two, so it got good reception!"
My Secret Diary,"Yeah sorry I changed it to ""quite"" to not sound as harsh lol"
My Secret Diary,"Holy shit I totally forgot that happened, I definitely laughed at that though, cause it was just so corny I guess."
My Secret Diary,"Oh! Good to know. I'll get caught up, then. Thank you!"
My Secret Diary,"It did for me. Like 4 or 5 episodes. I think it's the best show ever and have watched it twice since, but I still think it starts slowly."
My Secret Diary,I wish you hadn't. I truly loved it. Haha.
My Secret Diary,The casual looks on her parents' faces are just priceless. Haha.
My Secret Diary,Ok I can change it back
My Secret Diary,"Also, I totally forgot about Sex Lives of College Girls! I've heard it's really good. Adding to my to-watch list. Thanks!"
My Secret Diary,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
My Secret Diary,[deleted]
My Secret Diary,"I’m not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor’s ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That’s still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It’s kind of hard to get into movies when you’ve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
My Secret Diary,"I’m not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
My Secret Diary,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and Noël Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kieślowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
My Secret Diary,Times change.
My Secret Diary,[deleted]
My Secret Diary,"The movies traditionally held higher prestige. But around the year 2000 CGI was just getting cheap and easy enough that it could be in any movie. That's why the era of superhero movies began around that time. Once CGI got cheap and easy, we were inevitably going to be given lazy movies about people with superpowers that took the form of CGI. We've always had lazy movies, but ubiquitous CGI shifted the balance. 

So cinema got shallower, lost its prestige, and lost its status as being above television. Television filled the vacuum of substantive storytelling."
My Secret Diary,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn’t get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn’t until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton’s James Bond but also couldn’t take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn’t require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."
My Secret Diary,I love when I come across Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood in their early days.  Redford was the best Angel of Death Ever (Twilight Zone).
My Secret Diary,"> I kind of feel that the perspective that The Sopranos invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens

100%. It irks me every time I hear it."
My Secret Diary,"Just watch it, alone or with friends. Don't go online for any commentary until you've watched it all, make your own mind up about what's going on."
My Secret Diary,"Well the owls are not what they seem to start with...

But no seriously just watch it, your order is good (I've actually never listened to the audio diaries or deleted scenes), just watch and let the weirdness run over you. There is literally nothing else like Twin Peaks and I doubt there ever will be so it is a very unique piece of media to watch. I wouldn't look up any theories until you've finished everything.

There is only one episode I will say you should 'prepare' for. Once you get to Twin Peaks, The Return Episode 8, make sure you are in a dark room, with the best TV and sound system you can manage, with zero distractions and be ready for anything.

I love media (film/tv/games/books) that make me say 'What the fuck?' and Twin Peaks does it in spades. Enjoy the ride.

Edit: One more thing. If you've never seen David Lynch's other works, you need to realize almost all his work deals in extreme surrealism. The best way I describe his work is to take a basic plotline and add 'but what if it was like a dream'. Once you are in that headspace Lynch's work becomes much more approachable and enjoyable. Don't try to logic through a Lynch piece of media... unless that logic is dream logic."
My Secret Diary,Make sure you really crank up the sound. You want to Laura Palmer's theme to just wash over you.
My Secret Diary,"I love Twin Peaks for the most part, but it peters out. If at a certain point in season 2 you wonder ""why the fuck am I still watching this shit?"", feel free to skip to the last couple episodes."
My Secret Diary,"Hard to think of any specific advice beyond the top comment, which is do not seek out commentary or interpretations, as these are all very speculative and some quite silly. Lynch's work is something you have to interpret for yourself - if it grabs you at all. It may not, and that's OK if it doesn't.

The two original network seasons are a bit shaky in places as some of the episodes are handled by traditional ""teevee"" directors and they go off on some old-school television tangents. If you get caught up in the whole vibe you will want to watch them all, but I wouldn't force yourself.

Fire Walk with Me and Season 3 are like the pure distilled essence of the show. Both these things seemed to upset fans of the more cozier and quaint elements of the original show. FWWM is a straight up horror film, possibly the most quotable one ever though.

I think season 3 may be the single greatest season of television ever, and far surpasses the original but it will not deliver what you would expect from a follow-up series. It's also straight up hilarious at times.

Just consider yourself lucky you weren't waiting the whole 25+ years between seasons 2 and 3, but then again that wait added a lot of gravitas to it when it finally came.

And if you do get into the whole thing, there's some great Lynch films that play in the same kind of sandbox. Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet etc."
My Secret Diary,Turn the lights out. Don't binge it. Let each episode simmer in your brain a little bit after it's done.
My Secret Diary,"Some people have touched on it but it really cannot be emphasized enough how bad it gets in Season 2.  David Lynch and Mark Frost both left the show about 1/3 of the way in.  Lynch eventually came back and directed the finale (which is great), then did FWWM (which is transcendent).  Finally Lynch and Frost did season 3/The Return (also transcendent).

So the slog of season 2 is worth it.  Theoretically you could skip some of it, but there is some good stuff so I wouldn't do that.  In some ways it's a fascinating time capsule showing the type of bad network tv that we don't have to watch anymore (and at times it even becomes the very thing Lynch and Frost were satirizing and rejecting).  Just be prepared for that."
My Secret Diary,I rewatched it years after it first aired and forgot that a lot of it is just a strange take on soap operas and teen dramas. I think that was even more of the point of the show than anything all the Lynchian weirdness that people mostly remember the show for. It’s a bit of a jolt when you watch it as most of it is about teenagers and love triangles
My Secret Diary,Sure. Watching it without consulting the internet may help.
My Secret Diary,Any time James is on screen in season 2 feel free to fast forward
My Secret Diary,"Twin Peaks is about high highs and low lows. When it’s good it’s like nothing you’ve ever seen, when it’s bad it’s reaaaaaally bad. If you like what you initially see, stick with it through the end."
My Secret Diary,"Theres also some crazy Japanese coffee commercials starring Agent Cooper. Theyre non-canonical, so id just watch em after. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3acm7j9k\_1w

I guess theres other stuff you could immediately follow it up with... are you a fan of the show *Psych* at all? After you finish, watch the episode ""Dual Spires"".

Theres also a SyFy Channel Original Movie (yes, one of those) *Wyvern* (2009), thats still a cheesy SyFy channel monster movie, but also equal parts love letter to *Twin Peaks*, love letter to another show, *Northern Exposure*.

And then watch *The X-files*. We wouldnt have *The X-files* without *Twin Peaks*."
My Secret Diary,Don’t forget to read Secret History of Twin Peaks before season 3 (The Return) and read Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier after you finish The Return.
My Secret Diary,Watch it all and don't ask questions till the end
My Secret Diary,"Also could add the Secret Diary of Laura Palmer in between S1 & 2.

If you can find them or got the physical disks, I highly recommend the log lady intros."
My Secret Diary,"I watched the damn European cut of the pilot and ended up being confused as hell, and spoiled completely. I still hate that happened to me, although obviously it isn't that serious in the grand scheme of things.

Just give yourself over to the vibe of the show, would be my advice."
My Secret Diary,"“I am the arm” doesn’t mean anything, it’s like “I am groot”.  And yes, Big Ed Hurley is the same guy that played Stilgar."
My Secret Diary,"Watch ""Fire Walk With Me"" after season 2."
My Secret Diary,"I was a hardcore Twin Peaks fan back in the day. I watched the original network airing. I found season 3 to be unsatisfying except for one episode, but many fans enjoyed season 3 a lot."
My Secret Diary,Just watch season 1 and stop there
My Secret Diary,"I love David Lynch, but even for me, Season 3 was just too much. 8 had to bail about halfway through.

I definitely would try to binge as much of S1, S2, and FWWM as you can. For me, watching them in close proximity definitely kept my interest engaged."
My Secret Diary,I’d bail now and go with something else. David Lynch is a kook and ridiculously overrated. Elephant Man was great. Straight Story was decent. Nothing else he made is worth the film it was printed on.
My Secret Diary,"I'm assuming the ""Lost Audio Diaries"" is The Autobiography FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes and Diane: The Twin Peaks Tapes of Dale Cooper? Personally, I found that I got the most out of those listening to them after season 2.

There are also book that add to the experience. The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer is a good post-FWWM read. The Secret History of Twin Peaks is good for post-FWWM, pre-The Return, and The Final Dossier is good for wrapping the whole thing up after The Return."
My Secret Diary,"Make sure you have some cherry pie on hand. And coffee. 

Damn good coffee."
My Secret Diary,"The main thing is the tone. I feel like it was kind of meant as a soap opera for prime time (you’ll notice that a certain soap opera appears within the show). That is to say that there’s a fair bit of melodrama, especially in the early episodes.  But one thing you need to know about Lynch is that he feels that the small-town American nuclear family with its manicured lawns is all a façade and there’s evil shit going on just beyond those freshly-painted white picket fences. Also, this was on network television in the early ‘90s, so it’s pre-NYPD Blue and Sipowicz’s ass and television was relatively tame compared to now. But it was also aired less than a decade after the satanic panic, so I’m willing to bet it was pretty controversial for the time. I was like 9 when it first aired and I remember the promos but I was not allowed to stay up to watch it lol."
My Secret Diary,"Stay off your phone during, bone up on Jungian theory."
My Secret Diary,I made it a couple seasons in and I just couldn’t take it anymore. Might have been worth while it was out and the hype was there.
My Secret Diary,"Watch it all and don't Google shit. And then Google everything. And then rewatch everything. And THEN write all of your questions down, and lastly and most importantly, write down the most creative answers you have because those are the only real answers."
My Secret Diary,"Yeah, I agree with this for the most part. I mean, if you can find people online who are also watching it for the same time and are watching it at roughly the same speed as you are, then that could be fun to have people to talk to about it. But you're probably not going to find that."
My Secret Diary,Is there only like two songs the whole show cause that's the way it seems so far...
My Secret Diary,"Yeah, season 2 has some really weird middle episodes that go nowhere as far as I can remember."
Yowamushi Pedal,"Since Season 4 was in 2018, figured a little extra notice might be nice. :)  

[Crunchyroll link for Yowamushi Pedal](https://www.crunchyroll.com/yowamushi-pedal).

I will also mention that I recently found S1 (*Yowamushi Pedal)* and S2 (*Yowamushi Pedal: Grande Road)* [on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80061943), should you prefer re-bingeing there to Crunchyroll."
Yowamushi Pedal,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Yowamushi Pedal,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Yowamushi Pedal,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Yowamushi Pedal,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Yowamushi Pedal,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Yowamushi Pedal,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

Yowamushi Pedal,"Tbh heard some bad things about Prince of Tennis especially with the super powers on display, tried to aim more towards the grounded shows."

Yowamushi Pedal,[removed]
Yowamushi Pedal,"Dude. You get what I’m saying. These aren’t aligning demographics. 

People aren’t raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime."
Yowamushi Pedal,">People aren’t raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime.

I am, am I not people? It's often the stress reliever I need after watching a stressful match, unless I'm watching down the pub where a few pints does the same job. 

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."
Yowamushi Pedal," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I'm kinda tempted to start it, even if I'm not interested, because I want it to do well so that Netflix may consider adapting other stuffs from Jonathan Stroud (yes, this is about Bartimaeus. I want it as a TV show)."
Saga of Tanya the Evil, I love Joe Cornish so I’ll jump in with no second season renewal parachute
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Another fantasy YA!

Netflix is literally a mash up of The CW, Hallmark and Lifetime"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,STEPHEN!
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"All the reviews I've seen so far are pretty positive.

As a fan of the series and of the movie work Joe Cornish has done (as well as all the Adam and Joe stuff), I am really looking forward to this."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,And will get cancelled and left on a cliffhanger after season 2.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I am a fan of Joe Cornish's previous films, Attack the Block and The Kid Who Would Be King, so I'll take a chance and check this out even though Netflix has burned me so, so many times before."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Honestly the trailer doesn't convince me, it seems to have the usual Netflix's decent cgi and teen leads acting cool. But I'll be watching since it's Joe Cornish."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I love the books so I hope this series turns out to be a good adaptation
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Feb 8th 2023: Lockwood & Co. has less viewers than Stranger Things, canceled."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Can’t wait for this to be cancelled! It’ll be right after I start watching it too.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Ah the girl from As Dusk Falls,

Sounds cool too, I hope it's enjoyable and can last on its own term"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Really excited for this. It looks like the makers have tried to keep it real close to the source material too. Also, if this is a hit, we can expect some Bartimaeus stuff soon!"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I ll wait2 or 3 seasons before starting it
Saga of Tanya the Evil,STEVEN?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Didn't know Joe Cornish was involved with this, will have to give it a watch."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"You this show is great and has good ratings  

Netflix: Awesome, cancel it."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Positive critic reviews, people seem to enjoy it, annnnnnnd it's canceled by Netflix (soon, probably)."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Unless they are absolute must watch, hear about them everywhere shows, I refuse to invest anymore into Netflix"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,The next news of it will be cancelled after one season.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Netflix cancels most shows before the end of a third season in order to avoid having to negotiate new contracts with all creatives and talent involved. Most upfront deals are for three seasons, with pre-negotiated pay scaling. So small “hits” that in prestreaming times might have lasted four or more seasons get canned, since Netflix will have to pay a LOT more to keep EVERYONE. Only truly massive breakout shows are worth them backing up the truck and dumping money. 

Also there’s a presumed Netflix tax, similar to the Disney or Star Wars tax, where everyone assumes they have infinite money so everyone demands more money to work for them. Which forces budgets up for things. Which means they have less money to extend middling or struggling shows.

Also? They just don’t have enough execs to cover their shows. So quality is wobbly as fuck except for their big big spend shows. Which means, shows don’t have someone helping with quality control AND don’t have advocates INSIDE Netflix who can love that wobbly show enough to fight for it to stay around."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Has it been cancelled though?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"What *IS* it about UK casting that is so good? When I watch UK TV, the characters seem like real people. When you watch US produced shows, the characters seems incredibly surreal a lot of the time."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Odds on it getting cancelled after 1 season?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"i just keep giving up on these Netflix YA shows like Locke and Key, First Kill, The Order (latter two were cancelled afterwards)"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Have seen 0 advertisements, or marketing, it’s got a young cast and its Sci-fi YA. Do I even watch if it’s just going to get cancelled?"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I’m thinking wait until five seasons as I’m concerned they will just cancel it just as I get into it
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Ah another good show? Sounds like it will get canceled by Netflix here soon.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Waiting to hear about it getting cancelled.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"First I’ve heard of it, so I assume it has already been cancelled?"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I would watch this but I'm afraid it will be canceled without a conclusion like everything else on Netflix.  Feels like they are in a bit of a death spiral that they caused.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Netflix sucks
Saga of Tanya the Evil,No more
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Non ya person here but what’s with the swords? Seems kinda hokey, like swashbuckling Ghostbusters."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,What does YA mean here?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Why can’t we just get an adaptation of the Pepperwood Chronicles
Saga of Tanya the Evil,important is to know does this season have a cliffhanger yes or no? i read it covers 2 books. but never read the books. so is it a complete story. or will it be very open ended?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Here's a lesson in Economics 101: If there's enough demand for something, smart business minds will find a way to make money off of it. That simple. But the execs at Netflix are just too stupid and unimaginative so they cancel everything."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Netflix's YA adaptation will not get enough season and end with one or two seasons.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Bartimaeus is my favorite book series ever. Could translate well to TV, would need a good budget for sure though."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Netflix bases cancellations in large part on what percentage of people finish a show that they started.  If you're starting it for this sake, finish it."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I love the Bartimeaus trilogy so bad but I don’t want them to butcher it as a tv series
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"> yes, this is about Bartimaeus

Holy shit you got me excited for a second there thinking this series was somehow related to the Bartimaeus books. I loved those when I was younger. The Bartimaeus series along with Garth Nix Old Kingdom are my dream series to get adapted well."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"There’s no point in starting it, Netflix will just cancel it. They have this self-perpetuating cancelation loop going and it’s super frustrating. They cancel great shows and then no one wants to watch their shows because they know they’ll just get canceled, leading to low watch numbers and canceled shows. I’m still salty about Midnight Club."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I would really recommend watching it, it was an amazing show! I didn't even read the books but I loved it."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I wish Joe Cornish had more stuff out since Attack the Block, one of my all time favorites. I need more movies like that from him."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I understand why people say this, but if you don’t watch it then they *definitely* won’t renew it"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Man, there was like a brief eighteen month period a few years back where Netflix was aiming to be high brow."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Just coming!
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Good ol Cornballs!
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I prefer books as a medium but I usually don't read ones aimed at a younger audience, so if you don't mind, could I get a little rundown on why you like it?"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Based on the trailer, it looks to follow the first two books. While there is an arc that goes over all 5 books, these first two books in particular have self-contained stories."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Bold of you to assume there will be a season 2 👀
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Which is why we are probably canceling Netflix this month. Nothing worth watching since it all gets canceled.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,The Netflix way
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Very optimistic. I will probably be canceled while I type this.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,That long?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,THAT'S where she's from! I liked that game.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,....Just coming!
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"> Netflix cancels most shows before the end of a third season in order to avoid having to negotiate new contracts with all creatives and talent involved. Most upfront deals are for three seasons, with pre-negotiated pay scaling.

How many of their new shows have 3-season deals up front?"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"I would say with this, it looks like they are straight up adapting the books, there is maybe 3 seasons worth of content. There are five books (and one novella). Season 1 looks to cover books 1 and 2. The later books are slightly longer, but not massively. 

Say season 2 covered books 3 and 4 and then maybe a shorter final season for book 5."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,That’s not true. Netflix pays higher rates in lieu of residuals.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,We will know when the opening week viewership ratings come in a week from today.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I would say that this one was much better than the ones you mentioned
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"There are only 5 novels in the series and the first season of the show uses 2 of those so unless Stroud or the writers are extending the stories further, we'll probably only need 3 seasons to finish the story from the books."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"So.... everyone will go to a Marvel movie opening weekend to see how bad it is.

But the same everyone will wait to see if a show they're actually interested in gets canceled before they'll watch it.

You do realize, going to the movie you don't like tells networks, make more of this. And not watching the show you might like tells them; don't make this.  

If you watch it, it is less likely to get canceled."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"It's based on a series of books. Season 1 looks to cover books 1 and 2. While there is an ongoing arc, these two books are pretty light on that (at least in the books) and each book is a self-contained plot."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"In the universe where the stories are set silver and iron help dispel and weaken the ghosts so the ghost hunters use rapiers made from these metals as their main form of offence & defence against ghosts. I'm a fan of the novels and really looking forward to this series, hoping Joe Cornish has done it justice, I'm sure he will have!"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"It's based on real-world lore, according to which ghosts and other supernatural entities can be harmed by certain materials - iron, silver, salt, etc. So the weapons used by ghost hunters include rapiers and salt bombs and steel chains and silver lined glass jars for containment."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Young Adult. It's one of the age classifications for books. Around age 12 and up.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"The season ends on a minor cliffhanger, but it’s not related to any major plot points (and you can Google the answer to the question if you’re interested and get the answer from the books). But overall, the season covers the first two books which are self contained stories. There are some threads that link to later plot points but you mostly won’t notice them unless you’ve read the books."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"The first two books are rather self contained but hint at an overarching plot that really gets going from the third book on. Going of the books, there could be a bit of a cliffhanger, but that won’t necessarily lead to the story of the season feeling unresolved. And honestly, even if the series gets hit by the Netflix cancellation bus, the books are right there, and they are definitely worth a read."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Well, the snarky footnotes are one of my favorite ongoing joke mechanisms, but I’m not sure how they could capture the creative side-note nature of it

Like a voiceover can do it, but it may overlap with the ongoing action or dialogue. And there was always the extra fun of finishing a paragraph and finding what Bartimaeus really thought or a funny tidbit of magician history, which I’m not sure how they could capture the Easter egg nature of it.

I’m all for it but adapting it would take a good creative hand"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,The Bartimaeus Trilogy wa great. I really liked the magic system in that series.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"If they have to butcher I don't want it either ofc. I'm just hoping that they could do it right, it's a pretty straightforward story too. I can totally see it becoming a hit, but it would need a competent screenwriter."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,[deleted]
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"> They cancel great shows

Such as?"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Cornish has been unlucky. Cornish Snow Crash adaption fell through and he missed out on a few studio directing gigs.

Cornish is working on the Attack The Block sequel"
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Have you tried The Kid who would be King? 

It's not as good as Attack the Block and I was a little disappointed first time around, but I gave it a re-watch when it came to D+ and I enjoyed it. Maybe a tiny bit too long and definitely aimed at a younger audience, but still entertaining."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,They are appealing to their majority audience now - young teens and middle aged housewives
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Obviously, it is YA or maybe even younger. It's aimed at teenagers and not 40-something-year-old men. It's a world in which young people have the upper hand because they are the ones who can see the ghosts and have to deal with them. 

It's hard to say why I enjoyed it. On the surface, it ticks boxes of stuff I like. Ghost stories, investigation, mystery, and action. It's well-written; it has some mildly scary stuff and some great world building. The characters, while typical of YA tropes, are fun and it is light on the awkward teen romance plots that often appear in works for this audience. 

They were just really fun reads. I originally read the first one to see if it was suitable for my son, but ended up reading the whole series."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Not the original commenter you’re asking but I can tell you why I enjoyed the books. I started the series in my mid 20s, but I’m mid 30s now and still enjoy them! 

It’s honestly Stroud’s writing style. He could tell any story IMO, and the way he’d write it would make me a fan. He has a wonderful command of writing imperfect characters and the kids in Lockwood are no exception to this, and I am here for it. Often, kids are given characters to aspire to be, and that can make them difficult to empathize with if not handled correctly. 

That’s not the case in this series: Lucy is wonderful at what she does, but struggles hard with people; she’s recovering from a massive event in her life that is relatable to folks of all ages (I mean, not the event itself, but the themes) and I think that makes for a broad audience. She’s not the only one with struggles, either, and it’s a lot of fun watching them grow and navigate situations and complex emotions. 

I’ve not finished the series yet (life got in the way) but I keep trying; I have a habit of starting from the beginning every time and never making it to the last book! But that means I’ve read first few books both in text and in audiobook format a few times. The narrator they have for book one is fantastic; her delivery and stroud’s writing is so good. I’d give that a go if you’re unsure about picking up the series."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I was feeling optimistic this morning.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Based off the trailer it reminded me of The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself, and that didn't get a season 2. I doubt this will."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Yes! So glad you didn't leave me hanging 😄
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Most players involved in a show have a three year deal in place, HOWEVER, that does not include a guarantee to perform. So Netflix can cancel a show at any point. They may have to pay out a deal if it was canceled after a commitment to produce. This is to keep their costs down. If they want three years, they know lots of fixed costs up front and can control those."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"You are very wrong. 

They pay less than network tv. They do a buy out in lieu of residuals. The buyout does not affect weekly rates or per-ep rates."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Joe Cornish has being saying that in his interviews. There is an end. It isn't something that will go on for a couple of seasons and then get cancelled without a resolution. 

Season 1 covers books 1 and 2, Season 2 will do books 3 and 4 and maybe a shorter season 3 to cover the final book (which if memory serves isn't substantially longer than the previous books). 

There was The Dagger in the Desk short story as well which I guess they could use as a filler episode."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Thanks for the info. Trailer looked pretty good.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I like it so far but they haven’t really explained “The Problem” and I don’t understand why they have to go at night to fight the ghost when the whole goal is just to destroy or neutralize a source object.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,thank you for the answer. it is a safe to watch then in case netflix cancels it.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"thanks for the answer. i do not like reading. it is to boring to me, letters always stay the same just in scrambled order. that is why i prefer watching series or movies."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"It would have to be Bartimeaus narrating the story but even though I agree it doesn't have good odds of coming across well.

One advantage is the first book is a very well contained story on its own. You'd be able to focus on how to adapt and not have to worry about setting up the trilogy nearly as much."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,I've never read those. Has a Pratchette sound to it.
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"They did it with A Series of Unfortunate Events. I have kind of mixed feelings about Patrick Warburton's role in that, but I think overall it was okay."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Kind of, yeah. I was a big Christopher Pike (the author, not the doomed Star Fleet captain) reader as a kid and there’s much more to the story. It certainly wasn’t finished."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Archive 81

Daredevil

Midnight Club

1889

Just to list a few."
Saga of Tanya the Evil,Holy shit I forgot we’re getting a sequel!!
Saga of Tanya the Evil,OH FFS THAT GOT CANCELLED TOO?
Saga of Tanya the Evil,"Sorry, pedant. Netflix pays higher *tariffs*."
The Laughing Salesman,"I mean this is a fairly pragmatic view point for the good of the many, but the entire point of the finale is to confront pragmatism and idealism. Joel would rather the Fireflies fail than Ellie die. His reasons are personal, but it makes no difference to him, he wouldn't sacrifice Ellie in the same way that I probably wouldn't have the strength of will to sacrifice my child, even if it was for a greater good.

It is a controversial story beat and the debate is great! Entirely intended. I don't see a problem with it."
The Laughing Salesman,"Are we talking about the season ending ep’s dilemma between the life of Ellie for the cure and Joel’s choosing to protect her over saving the world, supposedly?? 

I ask, because what struck me as so needless in this dilemma and portrayed disingenuously is…..no research doc worth their salt would go with an experimental cure and plan for it, and kill the only living patient they got their hands on if they were WRONG. 

They would absolutely be wanting to keep her alive if their first best estimate failed."
The Laughing Salesman,"I'm having a hard time understanding the point of your argument. This nuance to the trolley problem has been a moral dilemma that folks struggle with since ancient times. 

Are you just saying you don't enjoy philosophy that much? Or are frustrated that people don't agree with your world view? I think, as a species, we enjoy finding hyper specific situations and then wondering if we would have done the same, or if actions taken in those moments were justified. I would go so far as to say this isn't a problem in fiction, debates like this happen all the time over history. See: The dropping of the atomic bombs for one easy example.

It's just a very human question, and there's no right or wrong answer. So we have fun talking about the situations where it comes into play"
The Laughing Salesman,"Well, yeah, that's the idea, Joel loves Ellie and sees her as the daughter he lost. People felt that emotional connection and put them in the ""good"" category cause it's a nice trait that they want to have, and there can't be flaws in a role model.

Never.

So, yeah, AJ was a fucking dick, no discussion there.

Also unrelated but the ""arguments"" about the doctors not knowing what they were doing is dumb af. The show itself states that's the only possible way, a doctor in the show dies trying to keep Ellie on the operation table. But suddenly everyone is a neurologist and can refute the science of a fictional show that was surrounded by the infected for 20 years

That's, again, people rationalizing Joel's decision to absolve him from any wrongdoing so he can be the good guy again, and therefore the perfect role model"
The Laughing Salesman,">If the finale had been about the Fireflies needing to dissect Sam, and Joel still went on his rampage, you would not see the moralizing ""Joel the hero!"" posting you consistently see on this sub, you would see the constant ""sacrifices need to be made and sheltered Hollywood writers can't make hard choices"" posting you see everywhere on Reddit.

Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

>If Game of Thrones presented the option that the Long Night had a chance of being averted if they burnt Olly at the stake, then everyone would want Olly burnt. 

Depends - is this before or after *he became the chief figure in a mutiny that got a beloved character and, in-universe, a competent leader killed*? If he had never become ""Fuck Olly"", then people wouldn't want to see him punished. Stannis' daughter was in the exact position you're talking about and the fanbase went fucking apeshit over her death.

>If the Sopranos presented the option that the gangs *might* leave Tony alone if he drowned AJ in the pool, everyone would want AJ drowned.

WTF? This is just wrong. Nobody has ever wanted Tony Soprano to be an even *bigger* asshole to his kids.

>This is why I think the creators got the exact reaction they wanted: When it is *demonstrably true* that fanbases will jump to immediate moralizing to defend a character they're attached to, then they're effectively in the exact same mindset as Joel. This is why I have issues with even engaging with fiction as I get older (especially in an age of anti-heroes), because at the core, the nature of media is an appeal to charisma and entertainment value.

You're talking as if the only reason people ever support anything is some kind of shallow popularity contest that they jump through hoops to justify. I wanted Joel to kill the Fireflies because they were liars who were about to do something apocalyptically stupid (kill the only known immune person on Earth) to someone without their full, informed consent. If Ellie had been told exactly what she was volunteering for and went ahead with it anyway, then it'd suck, but I wouldn't want Joel to gun down a whole hospital because it'd be objectively wrong. Hell, even the way he went about it was wrong because he didn't give Marlene the chance to wake Ellie up & come clean."
The Laughing Salesman,"Are you talking about the doctor, who had no problem killing a kid when neither he nor Firefly had any idea about the cure, into a saint that in the sequel rescues animal just to show how evil Joel is? They've made zero progress while investigating previous infected people. They apparently lost personnel at a previous research base when some idiot let infected monkeys out of the cage instead of destroying them, and the purpose of killing Ellie seems to be nothing more than getting better access to her infection on the assumption that something is different about the infection itself. 

That being a rather dubious line of reasoning they seem to have rushed into. You have the only immune human and instead of starting with things like blood tests, transfusions, they just go right to cutting out her brain. No extracting of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, plasma, nothing, except a scan. Just carve up her brain growth and see what's up. Then the group rushes the experiment even before waking her up, not even letting Joel see her for the last time, or attempt at persuading Joel into see things from their perspective. [Watch Joseph Anderson's analysis to see how incompetent the Fireflies were.](https://youtu.be/ma4DJbvO84I?t=11151)

In retrospect, The Last of Us failed to convey two sides of hypothetical morality. The game presents an utterly incompetent group that is written like a bunch of assholes, yet it wants us to feel conflicted and bad about you going against them in the hosptial. *""Hey, we made you walk across the entire country with this girl that you'd inevitably grow close with, we didn't tell you that she was going to be disected at the end, nor are we planning on telling her. Instead we're basically gonna drug her, drug you and then cut her open and hope that we might get a functional cure... Also, we're not paying you and there's about a 60% chance that we're just gonna shoot you in the back once you leave.""* Like, how is this a conflicting choice. They are best described as untrustworthy and incapable, so even though Joel is acting for emotional reasons, the rational thing to do if you want to kill Ellie to develop a cure is to kill the Fireflies and take her elsewhere like FEDRA. There's not much of a dilemma.

The Fireflies is a shallowly written organization in terms of writing. They are not fleshed out or explored. Are you asking me to sympathize with the group because they are fighting FEDRA--the government we don't even see if they are tyrannical or not? No part of the story makes me think that maybe they’re good people forced to do morally questionable things for the betterment of humanity, especially when we barely get to know who even Marlene is. Compare this to Lady Eboshi and the Irontown from Princess Mononoke, which actually explored those two sides. Even if the story ultimately judges them to be in the wrong, it is not confused by what each side is trying to convey, how it's conveying that, and the pros and cons of each side's method.

And I had hoped they execute this part better in the show. Instead, they made them even dumber."
The Laughing Salesman,"I’m not defending Joel when I say people shouldn’t scoop a kids brains out without telling the kid and with no guarantee of success.

I probably wouldn’t go mass shooter since I wouldn’t know how, but one can easily side with the moral dilemma and not think Joel is a hero for the tough choice."
The Laughing Salesman,[removed]
The Laughing Salesman,"He was ultimately selfish, which makes him a realistic character. He has done bad things before sometimes to survive and perhaps even sometimes just for benefitting from it when he could have walked away, that's his character. he chose to save Elie because she gave him a reason to live beyond just survival.

He made the selfish choice to kill all of those people, and potentially humanity, over losing his ""daughter"" for his own benefit more so than for Ellies.. 

but pragmatically speaking the fireflies should have been impregnating women and getting them infected to recreate multiple Ellies rather than wait 14-16 years. Kind of bleak and morbid and evil to do, but pragmatically speaking it would have yielded better outcomes as I assume the virus being in a baby or a teenager would not matter. Again i know morbid and evil."
The Laughing Salesman,Well also you wouldn’t need to kill the patient to get the T cells needed for a vaccine
The Laughing Salesman,"Yeah, the Last of Us is not written super well at points. I said this when I was 14 and I still say this at age 24. But there's a difference between narrative execution and narrative intent. The idea presented within was supposed to be that Joel sacrificed a potential chance at a cure for (selfish) love, and for the audience to debate who they sympathize with in the scenario. Instead, the fanbase just debates semantics and moves goalposts. The line of defense in 2013 was

>oh, well, they're extremely vague about their methods of cure, so it won't work

And then the series explains the chemical messenger thing and the debate then shifts to

>well the Fireflies don't have access to infrastructure to build a cure so the whole thing's a bust"
The Laughing Salesman,"It's not about the show, it's about the repetitive nature of the debate and the double standards applied over the course of an entire decade. I genuinely don't like engaging with it because I really get the sense that human beings only care about characters insomuch as they find them entertaining and charming, which is nihlistic in my view."
The Laughing Salesman,"Oh my god I’m so glad someone said this. People critiquing the fireflies really bend over backwards and are suddenly medically trained professionals while ignoring that the information WE know from watching, is not what the world knows…. 

WE may know the cure probably wouldn’t have worked because WE saw the mycologist in episode 2 explain there is no vaccine for fungus. One lady in Jakarta who was bombed shortly after and didn’t get the chance to speak with anyone. Not to mention that so many of the medical breakthroughs of the last 20 years we know they went without. Time and knowledge stopped for them in 2003! Stop judging them by 2023 science!! 

THEN the fact that people think it was pointless because of the medical infrastructure. I’d hate to be in the apocalypse with those people because nothing would be good enough or worth trying since we don’t have creature comforts we’re used to anymore."
The Laughing Salesman,"> Uh... bullshit? Sam is just as innocent as Ellie. We may not cheer Joel on as hard, but swapping them out doesn't change the nature of the problem to any appreciable degree.

My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

Note how you didn't have a response to the Ben/Clem thing, because I feel like it outright proves my point."
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"Yeah, I enjoyed the show, but I think the game benefitted from its limitations. Less is more, sometimes."
The Laughing Salesman,"They were never planning to wait 14 years. Joel kills their research scientist less than 9 months after anyone realizes Ellie is immune, no one knew she was until the Riley incident. For all we know, they were impregnating women and planning to do this, and decided to use Ellie because she was there before any baby and they weren’t sure infecting pregnant women would work — who knows what the time window has to be, after all? They don’t even know that’s the cause of Ellie’s immunity — Marlene was told Anna has already cut the umbilical cord before being bitten, so all they’ve got is a theory about what *maybe* happened, and if it happened *maybe* caused the immunity, and which *might* be reproducible, and no idea of how long they’d have to wait to cut the cord to get that effect. From a researcher’s POV it’s still definitely worth getting your hands on Ellie, who’s confirmed immune and can be examined right now."
The Laughing Salesman,"They weren’t looking for T cells tho. They are thinking the fungus primarily grows in the brain so to get it from her and synthesize they’d have to kill her to harvest her brain

But medically, this doesn’t hold up. and obviously being untried they’d wanna keep her alive to find another way if the first way didn’t pan out

Sry for typos. I have lost my reading glasses nd can’t replace them till tomorrow"
The Laughing Salesman,"Also, I didn’t take it Joel acted out of selfish love only. He has remarked with sadness she’s never had the chance to have a life. That’s thinking of her and what it’s like for her"
The Laughing Salesman,"It's not characters, it's how people engage with the world in general. It's only natural for people to favor who they have emotional bonds with. We don't care about strangers or the harm that comes to them nearly as much. And of course there are double standards, humans are full of contradictions. Not just in fiction, but in life. We're not robots, everything we do is subjective and varies based on our feelings at any given moment. Sure, we try to be consistent, but often fall short of doing so. 

I guess I don't understand your comment and point further than ""I dislike prevalent human nature"""
The Laughing Salesman,"I didn't have a response to Ben/Clem because I never played that far in those games, so I'm responding to the rest of the points you made because I'm familiar with them and wouldn't have to guess or be talking out of my ass.

Your overall point seems to be ""if anyone isn't completely in love with a character, they will act like total sociopaths towards them"" and that's horrifying.

>My point is that it absolutely would to 90% of the audience because they would sympathize with the Fireflies if you put Sam in Ellie's place and still had Joel do the same thing. You're making my argument for me by pointing out that it's the same scenario.

You're saying that the audience would support child murder simply because it's a different innocent kid with less character development. I know there's a subset of every fandom that is, shall we say, *more than amenable* to swapping a black boy for a white girl when the situation is life-threatening, but they're by no means a majority, especially not ""90%"".

>My argument with Olly can be substituted with Sweetrobin or Hot Pie, and I didn't use Shireen as an example because there was an entire subplot dedicated to making you attached to her.

Again, you're saying that we will be okay with *child murder* simply based on whether or not we have spent an arbitrary amount of time with the character and like them. You're stripping away and & all context except for whatever you need to twist to make your argument.

>Also literally look at any clip of Tony and AJ and it's nothing but people wanting Tony to kick the shit out of him.

There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him."
The Laughing Salesman,"There would be no reason to flesh it out imo.

It’s where they are at. 

The story is not meant to make our issues with the morality any easier. Nearly every big scene or conversation was in one way or another foreshadowing the fireflies, Joel, or Ellie.

I thought it was brilliant in how it made me remember other discussions."
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"They could have set it up better. They needed at least an episode where the fireflies were being nice and running tests. They figure something out but determine she won’t survive the procedure. They lie to Joel and Ellie, but Joel figures it out and rescues her."
The Laughing Salesman,"I guess it's ""I dislike a debate that is by its very nature a personal one that wouldn't be had about anyone besides this highly charismatic character being passed off as if it's a logical and/or moral one""."
The Laughing Salesman,">There is a big difference between us wanting a father to make his son not be an insufferable asshole and us wanting him to literally kill him.

lol check out the comments on this vid

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-zd9Srk3y4"
The Laughing Salesman,"I agree. I think people are unintentionally remembering the mycologist and how she said there is no cure for their arguments for Joel without realizing that’s only something WE the audience and her knew. That wasn’t common information to the world because they bombed her country shortly after. 

Saying “they should’ve known it wouldn’t work” makes no sense because they WOULDNT know. They were not privy to that discussion."
The Laughing Salesman,"In the cutscenes, dude. And I'm not saying that all video games are like this, just the Naughty Dog style of mission-based games. Also, the caveat is made for the talking head scenes of Joel and Ellie, which is the game's strength. I'm simply saying that actual *cutscenes* are by their nature quick and need to get exposition out ASAP."
The Laughing Salesman,"But it's not about putting different characters in Jole and Ellie's shoes. It's about if you were Joel, would you sacrafice or save Ellie l given the information you had. The debate is not about whether you would go on a rampage to save any old kid. The specifics of the situation matter. They're the only thing that matters. Change the situation, you have a different moral dilemma on your hands.

It's the personal nature that makes it worth investigating."
The Laughing Salesman,"I see a lot of people making fun of him for pretending to be a tough guy and then crying & pissing his pants when actually confronted with danger, but not a whole lot of ""I wish the bear woulda ate him!"" Are you getting this from somehow sorting your whole life by Controversial?"
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"I *know*, reread my OP post, it's not about the game, it's about what the debate around it has effectively devolved into after a decade. You are preaching to the choir."
The Laughing Salesman,"Discussing limitations of a medium in which art is presented is not necessarily looking down upon said medium at all. I am a 24 year old zoomer, you don't need to tell me that video games are art, I can give you a whole dissertation. I'm generalizing for the sake of trying to explain why the scene of Joel being given the escort job is 2 minutes in the game vs 12 in the show (I highly prefer the game, btw).

I will edit my initial post, though."
The Laughing Salesman,"Your dislike for what the debate as devolved into reads like ""But if we change key elements of this problem, people's choice would be different, therefore there is no merit in the debate"" which seems nonsensical to me. It reads that your point is people are discussing their personal choice, but because there is no objective right choice, any discussion around it is pointless.

There is value in knowing where people's morals stand situationally. This is why we as a species talk about it when these moral grey areas come up. And if, on a wildly extrapolated, primal instinctual level, we view someone's personal choice to be a threat to the community, it makes sense to debate and try to get them to change their opinion. 

Maybe I'm still missing it, but my ultimate thought is it makes sense to debate personal choices, they're arguably the only thing worth debating about."
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"I think that there's value in pointing out that, when a debate turns into moralizing, saying ""you would not have this debate about someone else"" effectively torpedos the supposed objectivity of the debate. When people consistently say ""Oh, well the Fireflies' plan wouldn't have worked cause yada yada yada"", I genuinely just don't believe they'd go through the effort of making the debate if it wasn't about someone they're emotionally attached to, which *removes the stance of objectivity that side is taking* and renders their point moot."
The Laughing Salesman,"No, I'm...speaking generally. You can *choose* to take my point as clearly intended, which is ""cutscene-based games with single mission campaigns often don't have time to have talking head segments explaining every little detail like HBO shows do"", but instead you're choosing to hyperfixate on my exact wording so you can pretend I'm looking down on video games."
The Laughing Salesman,"Just to make sure we keep on that same page, what I'm understanding is: 

People claim saving Ellie objectively the right thing to do. But that objectivity is contradictory because they would not do the same thing for another less liked character?

If that's your point...ok? People are really bad at terms and use ""objective truth"" to gain some sort of advantage in arguments all they time. They can squak about objective truth all they want, it doesn't make their pov objective. I dunno, my comment there is don't let poor use of terms ruin your fun debating, assuming you enjoy debating"
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,"It's not just use of terms, it's the existence of the debate in the first place and hyperfixation on details that wouldn't happen otherwise. I don't wanna keep explaining it, because I feel like you get my point, but you understand why 10 years of the same cyclical debate gets tiresome."
The Laughing Salesman,"Sure dude. Whatever you wanna believe I believe about video games. Please send me whatever ""It's Just a Game"" youtube video playlist you have that lets you feel like a victim."
The Laughing Salesman,"The frustration with the fixation on details is the part I don't get, and haven't gotten since the beginning. 

I feel there's a disconnect between what is actually being debated. Your stance is that fixating on these details is irrelevant or unjustified when they're actually **key**. The details define the situation. People aren't talking about the trolley problem, they're talking about in this specific circumstance, with this specific relationship, and this specific world, what would you do. 

It doesn't matter if people would make different choices if Ellie was a different character, or if the fireflies were more or less believable, or wouldn't care about x or y thing if she was less charismatic...that's not what people are talking about"
The Laughing Salesman,[deleted]
The Laughing Salesman,You are pushing me for answers over and over in a way that makes it seem like you feel insecure for liking video games while simultaneously feeling like I'm misrepresenting them when the reality is I *slightly* misspoke in a way that was trivial to my point.
The Laughing Salesman,Renewed for season six and they are discussing spinoffs.
The Laughing Salesman,"The show is so much fun. They don't take themselves seriously and neither should the audience. Hell yeah it goes off the rails. The scene when Johnny discovers the internet will never get old. 

I'm hoping Daniel's wife kicks some ass in the final season."
The Laughing Salesman,"show has always been a LA manga and that final episode was shounen to the max, they even put the ""hero dying til he has a vision and regains his strenght for the last time"". Love it"
The Laughing Salesman,"I really enjoy the show, and the ridiculousness is part of the charm, but my one complaint is that the show pivoted away from Johnny being the main character over to Daniel."
The Laughing Salesman,Season 5 was actually my favorite. Hilariously over the top and resolved a lot of silly teen drama that had been weighing down  the show.
The Laughing Salesman,">""Just watch the first season and skip the rest, then it goes off the rails""

I'm glad you didn't listen to those people because that's a dumb take. CK is one of the few shows that manages to evolve and introduce new aspects that keep the show fresh.

There's a lot to pull from with the movies and the series does it well. If Hilary Swank doesn't show up in S6 I'll be pissed."
The Laughing Salesman,"If you're a slowpoke, I must be a sloth as I would have never picked up on that if you hadn't pointed it out. Pretty funny though."
The Laughing Salesman,"Cobra Kai caught me by surprise.

I cringed when I first saw the trailer for it because I was worried it was going to be lame.

I watched it after the 3rd season premiered because I was like ""okay, this can't be that bad if it got a 3rd season."" And I was shocked how good it was.

Such a fun show."
The Laughing Salesman,I just want a spin-off of johnny figuring out technology. The moments when they highlight that are great.
The Laughing Salesman,">I thought the last episode was a bit too ""didn't tie up any knots at all, almost.""

That was by design.  They weren't sure if the show would be picked up again, so they closed as many loops as they could, while leaving just a little bit open for another/final season.

If the show had ended there, fans would always want more, but they at least got a cohesive ending, which is unfortunately more than a lot of popular shows get."
The Laughing Salesman,"OP...  You haven't seen the dope as shit trailer for [Season 6?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVYAh0MQtiI)  No new footage, but it hyped me the fuck up.  Cannot wait to see this.  
  
Also keep an eye out for Obliterated.  Its a new action/comedy show by the Cobra Kai people.  They say its Die Hard meets The Hangover meets 24.  Stars Nick Zano from Legends of Tomorrow."
The Laughing Salesman,"Hey, that's great. I hope they invite a bunch of guest martial artists who can show off their form."
The Laughing Salesman,"I’m going to absolutely despise any spin-off not focused on original characters.

Edit: by “original” I mean from the movies"
The Laughing Salesman,Isn’t the 6th season the last? The trailer/teaser seems to imply it is.
The Laughing Salesman,Never heard that expressed before. Did the showrunners themselves admit to being inspired by manga? Nothing on the wiki about it.
The Laughing Salesman,"The Japanese angle did take a lot of ground, indeed, but I liked >!the turnaround when Johnny found a second wind after seeing the image of the sonogram. Typical eagle throwing its fangs around.!<"
The Laughing Salesman,"This shames me a bit as a cineast but I've seen neither KK3 or KK4. And definitely not the Jayden one.

Now I have a motivation to watch 3 and 4, thanks for reminding me!

Yes, I do think the show evolves, because it can manage to stay on the absolute lowest rung of the ladder with silly humor like ""penis breath"" and I still take it seriously when I see Kreese at the halfway house and I feel bad for him.

So yeah, stoked about S6."
The Laughing Salesman,"You should check out the other great Youtube Original.  Its on Amazon now, called ""Wayne"".  It's very important that you don't watch a trailer, the big trailer that Amazon put out ruins the entire show and the smaller trailers seem to have vanished.  Basically its about the crazy kid in town you don't fuck with.  Its written by the guys behind Deadpool. It should have got a second season, but nothing on youtube got watched and Amazon couldn't get viewers with their shitty trailer so it died.  It's fucking fantastic though.  
  
Its not about Batman."
The Laughing Salesman,Same. It started out on YouTube TV and that just didn’t get me interested. Wasn’t until it hit Netflix that I decided to give it a go and glad I did.
The Laughing Salesman,Sounds reasonable.
The Laughing Salesman,"Tasty video. Also, will look for Obliterated, sounds up my alley."
The Laughing Salesman,"Personally, I am hoping for a Chozen spinoff set in Okinawa"
The Laughing Salesman,"I don't know but as someone who's been reading and loving them since the late 80s, especially shounen, the similarities and typical plot progression, which are very very simple in that genre, struck me almost immediately"
The Laughing Salesman,"The 4th isn’t related to the rest but it does star a young Jennifer Garner.

Edit: This comment is almost completely wrong. I’m leaving it up as a monument to my hubris."
The Laughing Salesman,"I don't doubt it. I could totally see this whole thing shot as an anime, with Johnny being a blond and slightly dumb hero that just attracts trouble."
The Laughing Salesman,"It has Mr Miyagi in it, plus it's a young Hilary Swank :)"
The Laughing Salesman,Edited without changing the information
The Laughing Salesman,"Ah Norm, everytime I hear him I'm reminded of that tragedy."
The Laughing Salesman,"I haven’t seen much of Season 3, but he was a wonderful addition to the cast and I really enjoyed his mini-arcs. I’m going to miss Norm, not just as the character but as the person themselves. They were truly a good egg."
The Laughing Salesman,I didn't even know he was sick.
The Laughing Salesman,"https://mobile.twitter.com/TheOrville/status/1555682561304760321

I’ll save you a click."
The Laughing Salesman,"According to an Interview with his producer, Norm actually recorded some of the last voice overs in the hospital.. 

Miss you Norm"
The Laughing Salesman,I love how the Orville went from sci-fi spoof to legitimate and progressive sci-fi show.
The Laughing Salesman,Reminds me of that tragedy
The Laughing Salesman,Where's the video? Every time they promise a video so I follow the link and scroll down...no video.
The Laughing Salesman,Seth Macfarlane is no longer just The Family Guy

The Laughing Salesman,The world is absolutely a darker place after losing Trevor Moore and Norm.
The Laughing Salesman,"Man, I liked the first two seasons, but season 3 hit different. Even if they take some short cuts classic star trek never did, it is legit some of the best star fleet I've ever seen."
The Laughing Salesman,There is a major spoiler in the article. If I haven’t watched S03Ep09 last night I would have been pissed.
The Laughing Salesman,"For those who don't know: Season Four is effectively in limbo and has potential to not happen. Disney is essentially going to wait and see how it does. If you want more Orville, share the show with everyone you know who MIGHT like it even a little. Please, I love this show."
The Laughing Salesman,Reminds me of that tragedy…
The Laughing Salesman,If you haven’t seen the Orville yet. Wait until next week when it’s on Disney+ without ad breaks.
The Laughing Salesman,"This man was Deeply Closeted, Deeply"
The Laughing Salesman,I didn't realize Cassidy Yates was in *The Orville*. Sweet!
The Laughing Salesman,"Wait, this is a series Norm was a regular on?"
The Laughing Salesman,Never seen this before. Love norm though. BBBY
The Laughing Salesman,"Norm is who Seth will age into, if his painting allows."
The Laughing Salesman,Best part of that mess of a show.
The Laughing Salesman,What’s with the dumb clickbait pics?
The Laughing Salesman,He was one of the best parts of the show.

Edit - I mixed up the names. I like Alara, I love Talla but I dislike Charly Burke"
The Laughing Salesman,Why is the Mucinex man’s mouth the picture on the left?
The Laughing Salesman,"I swear to God you all only remember the season finale and forgot season 3 wasn't fucking funny at all. The praise here is blowing my mind and has me concerned for all of your cognitive capacities. At least the finale reminded me how good it used to be.

Seriously was it the suicide theme lead in or the back to back ""steal their happiest life"" episodes for Gordon and Issac? Maybe Mercers abandoned pet child or torturing the sex change kid? Nah having her parent disown her was more fun than the torture. Lol

Super fun season.... Lol... It was trash.

Season finale was great though reminded me why I started watching. Rest was shit.

Establish the parody to spin into the drama... Not vice versa. They lost the formula."
The Laughing Salesman,"Does anyone actually like the Orville? I watch it, but it's painful to sit through"
Prison School,"I have seen qhite a lot of popular anime, but i have to tell you, attack on titan is by far superior. That show is just 10/10"
Prison School,"While we're on the topic of anime, I started rewatching Fullmetal Alchemist (the 2003 series) and I just got to the Nina episode and I'm not mentally prepared for it... This is one of the few times I actually have a hard time getting myself to watch an episode of a fantastic series because of how tragic the episode is."
Prison School,"Thanks for the recommendation! I’m surprised you gave My Hero Academia such a low score. What I liked about it is that side characters had a chance to shine, unlike some other popular animes  where the side characters disappear. But I see where the main storyline can be repetitive !"
Prison School,"great recommendations. 
You should probably check out the great pretender on netflix, its really good!"
Prison School,If you love sports anime also check out Run in the Wind. Its more of a drama show with Sports as a backdrop than a sports show. But it is surely worth a watch.
Prison School,"If you have time to check it out, try these three sports anime. HAIKYU, Kurokos basketball, and Chihayafuru. That last one, is probably my fave anime at the moment."
Prison School,"You'd love Assassination Classroom on Hulu. The English dub is actually really good.

My only issue with NHK is the whole Manic Pixy Dream Girl shit."
Prison School,will definitely check out 1 or 2 of those when i get the time. admittedly i've never seen a sports anine before.
Prison School,"Very feel good, but unrealistic at the same time. It's generally for a teenage demographic, I feel, but I still love them; this is coming from someone who doesn't even play sports in real life."
Prison School,[deleted]
Prison School,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Prison School,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Prison School,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Prison School,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Prison School,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Prison School,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Prison School,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Prison School,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Prison School,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Prison School,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Prison School,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Prison School,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Prison School,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Prison School,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Prison School,🙂💕
Prison School,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Prison School,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Prison School,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Prison School,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Prison School,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Prison School,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Prison School,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Prison School,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Prison School,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Prison School,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Prison School,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Prison School,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Prison School,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Prison School,"Doctor Who is probably the most extreme example both in terms of overall length of show and gap in between revival. I think it's pretty easily worth it- the revival can be pretty shit at times of course, but so could the original. IMO the revival has overall reached higher peaks than the original.

Arrested Development S1-S3 is like the peak of the sitcom niche it occupies, but S4 and especially S5 are quite disappointing to me. The remix of S4 was even worse imo."
Prison School,[removed]
Prison School,"I was terribly disappointed with the Murphy Brown revival. The original was a workplace comedy with some political commentary. The revival was just heavy political commentary and jokes about getting older. Plus making Murphy's smug son exactly the same politically killed any chance of them having friction.

I liked the Mad About You revival because I thought it had the same feel, but the daughter wasn't very likable."
Prison School,New Beavis and Butthead and Kids in the Hall are great.
Prison School,"Of your list that I've seen, Girl Meets World, Dexter, Doctor Who, and The Twilight Zone were all worthwhile.  There are some others on the wikipedia list I've seen that were mostly okay, no other big hits.

Not a series continuation, but the Psych movies have been good and better than anything listed above.  Lucifer and Cobra Kai were both saved by Netflix and were good, but they were continued pretty quickly.  Same with Stargirl on The CW.

What I've seen:

Girl Meets World - okay and nice to see the original cast, but doesn't live up to the original.  I enjoyed it well enough even though I wish it were better.

Dexter - New Blood was pretty good other than the finale.  Best season of the show after 4 of the original, but not close to the best seasons.

Doctor Who - Haven't seen more than a few clips from the original but the reboot seems better.

Family Guy - I generally am not a fan of this but the continuation seemed to be more of the same.  If it's your humor I'd imagine it's a big hit.

Futurama - I haven't liked what I've seen of the continuations, they lost something for me.

MST3K - It wasn't the same with the different guy.

The Conners - I was young for Roseanne and hadn't seen it consistently when it was first on.  The continuation is okay but not funny enough for a comedy or good enough drama for a drama.  It doesn't live up to my limited memory of Roseanne.

The Twilight Zone - like the original, there were some hits and some misses.  It's easy to remember the hits on the original but there were a lot that weren't.  The continuation lived up to that history.

X-Files - Not good, but the show hadn't been good for awhile before it left the air.  Definitely not needed."
Prison School,"Enjoyed Veronica Mars! I think any invested fan will enjoy but may feel some type of way about the ending.

I think the Futurama reboots are fine, not as consistently good as the original stuff though and I feel like I’m lower on the movies than most.

I think the Arrested Development reboot is kind of a disaster In comparison to the original. Gob and Tobias have really fun storylines but past that it’s pretty skippable.

I thought when Harmon rejoined Community after the gas leak season he did a great job of retooling the show… not as consistently good as before the gas leak but you have some really great ones here and there like the Ass Crack Bandit and the really bizarre one where the app redefines the schools social hierarchy.. it goes into some really weird directions that are worth checking out even though it’s maybe not as good as the show when Donald and Chevy were on it."
Prison School,"Dexter New Blood was a good one. Dexter S8 was the worst thing I've ever watched. New Blood wasn't amazing, but it was way better than S8 for sure."
Prison School,I love the Futurama movies but outside of a half dozen really neat memes I don’t think we got anything good out of the Comedy Central episodes.
Prison School,"Amazing Stories (2020) - Not totally sure if this counts since it's an anthology series that was resurrected, but since OP included The Twilight Zone in their list, I'll count this one. The first episode is legitimately good. No complaints. And I thought episode 3 was okay. Not great, but fine. The rest of the episodes were a bit too silly or predictable for me.

Animaniacs (2020) - It's still a lot of fun, irreverent, and basically what you would want the Animaniacs to be in a revival. The only issue is how few different skits are available. It's almost entirely the Warners and Pinky and the Brain. And the few sketches that deviate from those two are rarely up to the same quality (though some do get there). It's worth watching if you know what you're getting into.

Arrested Development - It has some good laughs throughout the new seasons, and the Season 5 finale is almost the perfect series finale if you cut it off before the final mystery is revealed, but there's so much baggage and not-so-great moments, not to mention the actual final moment of Season 5, that I typically think the show is best with Season 3 as its ending.

Boy Meets World/Girl Meets World - This is maybe worth it if you have a fairly young child that you watch TV with so they can get the majority of enjoyment out of the show and you can enjoy the plot lines and characters from the original show, but of all the episodes I watched, I would not say that this ended up being worth it in the long run because the show really does cater to the younger audience than the older one.

Futurama - Yes, despite a few rough episodes being included in the new runs, the new runs still produce some of the best episodes in the series, progress the overall story of the show in interesting ways, and are still quite funny overall.

Heroes/Heroes: Reborn - Heroes: Reborn is perfectly middle-of-the-road Heroes. It doesn't reach the original show's highs, but it doesn't fall to the original show's lows either. If you liked or were okay with Heroes Season 2, you'll probably enjoy Reborn as it's a similar quality but ultimately better story. But it's not Heroes Season 1 no matter how much it wishes it was.

How I Met Your Father - It originally didn't have to be a continuation, but they have seeded a couple of plot lines from the original show into this one, officially making this a continuation of sorts. While those continued plot lines are fairly fun/interesting, they're such a small part of an otherwise mediocre-at-best show. So while this may one day be worth it as it continues, right now I don't think it is. You could argue that this is closer to a spin-off rather than a continuation/revival though.

Kevin (Probably) Saves the World - This is a weird one because the show itself isn't a continuation to another show. However, there is one episode that acts as a continuation of the show Reaper. And while it was awesome to see the characters from Reaper back and hear a little bit about what's going on in their lives, especially given Reaper's tragic early cancellation, there wasn't quite enough meat on those reveals to make it worth it, particularly when the main Kevin show is so-so itself.

Parks and Recreation - The resurrection for the COVID episode I thought was really well done. I recommend it.

Timeless - The show had gone off the rails in quite a big way, so the fact that the movie resurrection not only managed to tie up loose ends, serve as a satisfying conclusion, and be a fairly consistent an entertaining story was nothing short of impressive. If you liked the first two seasons, it's a must-watch. If you thought those first two seasons were mediocre, it's worth watching to see if it addresses your issues. If you couldn't stand the first two seasons, it's a better version of more of the same. But overall I'd say it was worth it.

The Twilight Zone (2019) - Because it's more or less an anthology series, it has good and bad. If you're convinced you have to watch every episode, I would say it's not worth it. There is far more bad than good in this series. But if you are okay just hitting the highlights, I'd recommend Nightmare at 30,000 Feet, Six Degrees of Freedom, Blurryman (if you're okay with a cool concept that doesn't get its full payoff), Meet in the Middle (if you're okay with an episode that feels like Black Mirror instead of The Twilight Zone), The Who Of You, Among the Untrodden, and A Small Town.

Veronica Mars - I haven't seen the movie, but I quite enjoyed Season 4. I liked it better than Season 3, at least. However, your mileage for this one will vary entirely on how you feel about a certain character because that character is done dirty in the finale. So if you're not the biggest fan of that character OR if the show eventually returns once more to give that ending a little more conclusiveness, then it's worth a watch for fans of the show. Otherwise, it's skippable."
Prison School,"My fiancé *loves* Will & Grace and she absolutely hated the revival, same with Gilmore Girls."
Prison School,"Leverage got revived somewhat recently.

Personally, I think the new episodes are still worth watching, even if I miss the older team dynamics."
Prison School,"Will & Grace (And ""And Just Like That"" the SATC reboot) proved that some things are just better off left in the past."
Prison School,"Ignore list: The X-Files, The Twilight Zone, and Heroes: Reborn.

Good: Dexter: New Blood (Except for the finale)"
Prison School,Warrior about to top the list; if it counts?
Prison School,"Gossip Girl - awful.

Melrose Place - awful, but pleasantly surprised by Ashlee Simpson.

The Connors - needs Roseanne. Sorry, not sorry."
Prison School,Seasons 1-7 of Doctor Who were great other than that none
Prison School,Dr Who for me and then the Equalizer are both great and were a long time coming.
Prison School,"Twin Peaks is the one I would call a fine sequel, reboot, whatever it was, because it kept the vibe. The X-Files now, boy what absolute garbage"
Prison School,Mad About You reboot stunk. It just ignores the original season finale. Has none of the energy of the OG series.
Prison School,Ugh I keep meaning to finish it. I’ve enjoyed what I’ve seen so far.
Prison School,**EPISODE 8**
Prison School,The new Beavis and Butthead is utterly fantastic.  It might be better than it was originally.  Mike Judge fucking rules.  I cannot wait for King of the Hill to return.
Prison School,">Girl Meets World - okay and nice to see the original cast, but doesn't live up to the original.  I enjoyed it well enough even though I wish it were better.

In *Girl*'s defense, it only ran for three seasons, whereas *Boy Meets World* was fortunate enough to get seven, and many of *Boy*'s best episodes were in its fourth and fifth seasons. If we compare *Girl* to only the first three seasons of *Boy*, it's a much closer comparison (although *Boy* still edges it out for sure). I'd like to think *Girl* could have reached even higher heights than it did if it kept going."
Prison School,"I didn't include Community since it never really stopped.

They did six seasons in six years across two networks, with a showrunner blip in Season 4."
Prison School,"I understand it's all opinions, but off the top of my head I'd put ""Lethal Inspection"", ""The Late Philip J. Fry"", ""Game of Tones"", ""Meanwhile"" up against anything from the Fox seasons."
Prison School,The Late Philip J. Fry
Prison School,I dunno. The X-Files continuation wrapped up nicely.
Prison School,8 9 and 10 are light years ahead of 2 6 and 7
Prison School,Yeah definitely not a reboot technically but a show that went through a lot of transformation.
Prison School,"Lethal Inspection is one of the first I’d list for why I don’t think the Comedy Central episodes are good. I can hear an executive at Comedy Central saying “I don’t care if it feels forced and unearned, the audience likes the dead dog episode, make us another dead dog episode!”  Maybe it’s some sort of Andy Kaufman joke that I didn’t get, and they intentionally made a shitty episode and then slapped a sad song on to the end as a middle finger to that executive.  In that case I might have a little respect for it.  Otherwise, no.  Gross."
Prison School,"Is easily the best Comedy Central episode, and slightly better than a mediocre Fox episode.  The average Comedy Central episode is a lot closer in quality to That Darn Katz, which makes A Leela of Her Own look pretty good in comparison."
Prison School,"Also the Jordan Peele ""Twilight Zone"" was largely very good. People who think it was ""too political"" are ridiculous. The original TZ was incredibly political."
Prison School,"Except for Darin Morgan's episode 'Mulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster', most episodes of season 10 & 11 were boring and meandering, with none of the thrillers and mysteries of the original X-Files."
Prison School,Didn't it end on a cliffhanger though?
Prison School,"I thought it was pretty good.  Uneven, a few really good episodes.  The original was uneven too, but it lasted a long time and there were several really good/great episodes that are most remembered.  I thought it lived up to what the original did but couldn't live up to people's memories of the best half dozen episodes."
Prison School,It did.
Prison School,Well put. I’ve seen a lot of twilight zone and love it but I do think people don’t really remember a lot of episodes cause they just aren’t memorable. I will say I always saw Black Mirror as the updated Twilight Zone.
Prison School,"Yeah, I agree. I think the show got/gets **way** too much hate. It was definitely the best 'reboot' since the days of Serling. If it were given more time to breath, I think it would have gone down as an unquestionably terrific show in and of its own right."
Prison School,"All of us are dead…that much rating? No, it belong to the worst honestly."
Prison School,"lmao that garbage korean zombie show is a 9.3 and severance only a 8.8, very questionable ratings"

It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Prison School,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Prison School,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Prison School,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

rating: 6.7 out of 10"
Prison School,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Prison School,Severance show
Prison School,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Prison School,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Prison School,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Prison School,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Prison School,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Prison School,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Prison School,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Prison School,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Prison School,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Prison School,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Prison School,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Prison School,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt’s destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Prison School,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Prison School,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn’t get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Mob Psycho 100,fuck yes
Mob Psycho 100,"so hyped, love this show"
Mob Psycho 100,fuck Crunchyroll and their anti union BS
Mob Psycho 100,"Favourite anime ever, so excited for this!"
Mob Psycho 100,ohhhhh fuck yeah. The animation in the last season alone was enough to make an all-timer- the fact that the great story actually had real-shit to say about depression and personal growth is just the cherry on the cake.
Mob Psycho 100,Oh shit oh fuck. Cannot wait.
Mob Psycho 100,"give me more, I cannot wait"
Mob Psycho 100,"I still need to see the first seasons but it looks vaguely one punch man like which has me intrigued

Is the same studio as previous seasons?"
Mob Psycho 100,Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!
Mob Psycho 100,"I always enjoy the first halves of these seasons but lose interest once it turns into characters fighting for the last 5 episodes.

Hopefully this final season gives us some great Reigen, school and Body Improvement Club adventures before it turns into fighting time"
Mob Psycho 100,So what's the synopsis for this season? I didn't think there was still a story to tell since I thought Mob ran out of enemies that can pose any real threat to him.
Mob Psycho 100,**INJECT THAT OP TO MY VEINS!!!**
Mob Psycho 100,"I can't wait, shame about the Crunchyroll situation tho"
Mob Psycho 100,"My body is ready. 

What did it say at the end? Was there a date next to prime video?"
Mob Psycho 100,>~~fuck yes~~ fight on
Mob Psycho 100,"Crunchyroll has always been shitty. When they were first coming up, they stole fansubs and profited off of it. Years later they go legit and can't bother to pay translators.


All that was asked for was a *meeting*, not a commitment to use union talent, or anything. Just a meeting and they couldn't be bothered. Netflix and Sentai have no problem with it, but CR if course does."
Mob Psycho 100,Another reason to only watch subs.
Mob Psycho 100,">it looks vaguely one punch man like

It is based on a web comic from the same author that made One Punch Man, so it does have some similar vibes.

>Is the same studio as previous seasons? 

Yeah, all 3 seasons are made by Bones."
Mob Psycho 100,"Spoilers if you don’t want to know, but the series doesn’t end in a fight like the first two seasons."
Mob Psycho 100,"people don't need to pose a threat to Mob though for the series to be fantastic. Nobody in season 1 was ever a threat to him and that didn't change anything. 

The series knows how to work situations where whether mob is the strongest or weakest person in the room the themes and messages of the series will be conveyed extremely strongly and powerfully."
Mob Psycho 100,"People at the end of S1 were basically part of a bigger organisation.

The kid that was there was far more powerful than the rest but didn't fight Mob. You'll see more of him and his dad in this season. I'm assuming this'll be finishing the story as I don't remember the Manga going on for very long but maybe they could stretch to 3."
Mob Psycho 100,I believe from previous announcements I saw October 1st?
Mob Psycho 100,Oh okay nice
Mob Psycho 100,"Sounds great, thanks."
Mob Psycho 100,Yep it’s the same as one punch man. No one will ever beat satima but the series is still so fun to read for the characters
Mob Psycho 100,"You missed a season, bud. That was season 2 in 2019. It's great, if you haven't seen it."
Mob Psycho 100,You must have missed season 2 coming out a few years ago. This is for season 3
Mob Psycho 100,From October 5th every Wednesday on Prime video
Mob Psycho 100,"This is the type of good news to start my day. As always, animation looks CRISP af."
Mob Psycho 100,"Pshhhh, I won’t be happy till i get my Body Improvement Club spin-off series."
Mob Psycho 100,"Finally, one of my favorite anime will have a COMPLETE series... it feels unreal."
Mob Psycho 100,"I already forgot nearly everything from the first couple of seasons, but the [season 2 opening credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epZaT8B31-g) is one of my favorite anime openings ever."
Mob Psycho 100,Hell yeah. Now let's year it for One Punch Man fans. Season 3 when?
Mob Psycho 100,Anime of the year already
Mob Psycho 100,I thought the manga ended with the end of season 2. A pleasant surprise!
Mob Psycho 100,"Oh buddy, the better anime compared to OPM. An actual story and characters to follow with amazing animation. Can't wait and am so glad they're continuing MOB"
Mob Psycho 100,"Holy shit, I thought it ended. Awesome"
Mob Psycho 100,"Looks like a big step up on animation. 
This is definitely one of the better shows running right now. It’s got charm, a nice mix of slice of life and some action. Not to forget the comedy is actually pretty good. 

The main reason I watch this though is the emotional connections it puts forward. I’m not sure why but whenever Mob learns something about his emotions I also feel like I learn this lesson as well. It makes me laugh because I’m 28 and I get emotional with the show."
Mob Psycho 100,This is literally my favorite anime. I am so hype.
Mob Psycho 100,"Eric Trump won't be happy about this

https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1303288007357796353"
Mob Psycho 100,T_T so happy
Mob Psycho 100,I can't wait to see this!
Mob Psycho 100,"I wonder how the season will be adapted. I believe someone did the math, and the remaining material isn’t enough for a full season."
Mob Psycho 100,Yes!! It’s been years!
Mob Psycho 100,That one guy looks like a human version of Mr. Poopy pants at 0:56
Mob Psycho 100,"When I first saw clips of this show I did not care for it. 

But I gave it a try during the lockdown and it's such a good humble show. I love it."
Mob Psycho 100,AYOOOO finally. Now if the studio can go back and make OPM season 3
Mob Psycho 100,LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Mob Psycho 100,Isn't there just like 10 or so chapters left in the manga to adapt? Are they actually gonna pad it out to a 12 episode season?
Mob Psycho 100,"Wait where’s season 2. I watched season 1 on HBO. 


Also does Netflix have any good anime that’s not a “Netflix” series as those seem to suck."
Mob Psycho 100,"I really strongly dislike most anime but go through phases every couple years where I'm like ok I'll try it out again and to see what everyone's talking about. 

So I tried mob psycho 100 and enjoyed it a bit and was like ok maybe I like anime. Then I tried another anime and absolutely hated it and realized that I just like good storytelling regardless if its anime or not

I'll check out season 3!

I am getting a bunch of downvotes which I really don't understand but I did make a list of ones I've watched on MyAnimeList if anyone wants to see the ones I tried out https://myanimelist.net/animelist/jaypeedaylee?status=7&order=4&order2=0"
Mob Psycho 100,Make a crossover with him and one punch
Mob Psycho 100,"With how well S1 went, I was so hyped for S2 only to find it quite meh. Here's hoping S3's better."
Mob Psycho 100,"I watched through all of One-Punch, even the OVAs and extramaterial, loved it.

But I watched the first four episodes of Mob Psycho and it was such a slog. And the ""incompetent master"" trope lost its taste faster than a Juicy Fruit."
Mob Psycho 100,I've thought about watching this because some youtube person started a series on it.
Mob Psycho 100,Never heard of this show what is it?
Mob Psycho 100,"This is great, season 2 ended pretty definitively, so i didn't think they would continue to adapt the rest."
Mob Psycho 100,Greatness.
Mob Psycho 100,"I absolutely loved the 2nd season, can't wait for this."
Mob Psycho 100,I thought Season 2 was weaker than Season 1 but it was still pretty good. I can't wait for this season.
Mob Psycho 100,"sweet. I JUST started this last night. right now it's okayish, nothing super exciting yet. but I'm only on the 3rd episode"
Mob Psycho 100,I hope they top that teleporter fight from last season. That was some of the best action I've seen in any medium.
Mob Psycho 100,"Studio Bones is great.  They've struggled a bit with many of their homegrown stories lately, but the animation is always top notch.  

They're in the same league as Madhouse.  They've been great quality for a long time now.

edit: fixed which ""they're"" that I used."
Mob Psycho 100,I want it to be a legitimate workout tutorial series but the background has a bunch of gags and a whole storyline happening.
Mob Psycho 100,"lol everytime I get my lazy ass out to work out I joke with my SO saying ""BODY IMPROVEMENT CLUB"" and doing a flex

they really give me inspiration to want to work out haha"
Mob Psycho 100,"For real, all of my favorites have been getting postponed indefinitely or only do 1 season every two years or something"
Mob Psycho 100,I'm really happy the whole thing is getting adapted. I jumped into the manga after loving season 2 and goddamn it's such a beautifully well rounded and satisfying story. Very excited to see it come to life.
Mob Psycho 100,"Conversely, a series that I felt was perfectly complete with its first series (FLCL) just keeps coming back, in addition to the 2 new series they added to it a few years ago, there are an additional 2 series for it on the way."
Mob Psycho 100,Hope they return to season 1 form
Mob Psycho 100,"""Spy X Family"" and ""Love and War"" are delivering hard already. And ""Chainsaw man"", ""Made in Abyss"" also come out this year. 

Its actually a really great year for Anime."
Mob Psycho 100,"Golden Kamuy, Made in abyss, Uzumaki, Overlord, bleach and Jojo stone ocean etc all are coming this year. Tough competition.

2022 is one hell of a year for anime fans."
Mob Psycho 100,This season should finish the manga
Mob Psycho 100,"I originally liked OPM more, but after season 2 of both shows came out, MOB is definitely the winner. I'm pretty indifferent about season 3 of OPM, but I'm excited for season 3 of MOB."
Mob Psycho 100,Why the need for comparison at all?
Mob Psycho 100,"Nah I prefer One Punch Man. I love the Mob fights, but most of the emotional stuff falls flat for me. Like, that two-parter in s2 that tried to get me to cry about Reigen did nothing.


Still, if s3 has insane action again I'll be more than happy. Bones at their best is on another level."
Mob Psycho 100,OPM doesn't even have the amazing animation for s2
Mob Psycho 100,"We should fix that with images of the mob that stormed the capitol, that will surely please him."
Mob Psycho 100,Netflix has become one of the bigger heavy hitters in anime. They have a lot of pull in the industry and have some real good ones such as violet evergarden or march comes in like a lion
Mob Psycho 100,"Black Lagoon.

It's kinda like if Cowboy Bebop was about a group of pirates/smugglers in and around Thailand during the 90s.

Studio Madhouse too. Also, like Cowboy Bebop it is best watched in English."
Mob Psycho 100,BNA brand new animal is quite good
Mob Psycho 100,"Season 2 is really, really good. I like it more then season 1. I'm wondering how season 3 can live up to it."
Mob Psycho 100,Crunchyroll and funimation both have it
Mob Psycho 100,"> Also does Netflix have any good anime that’s not a “Netflix” series as those seem to suck.

I would check out Castlevania, which is a Netflix series, if you haven't already. I really enjoyed it. Alucard's Season 3 arc is poor and the deus ex machina of Season 4 is eye-rollingly bad, but otherwise I was really engaged in the story and fight sequence animations.

The same studio did Blood of Zeus, another Netflix series, which really looks like Castlevania, but didn't quite catch my interest after the first episode. Maybe I need to watch a couple more episodes to catch on."
Mob Psycho 100,I really like your MAL! Specially the shows you have as “watched: 0 episodes. Rating: 2/10.”
Mob Psycho 100,"If you like good storytelling, then I have to recommend the anime Monster. You will likely have to pirate it, but it is very good. A nice serious story and none of the shitty tropes that, unfortunately, anime is known for."
Mob Psycho 100,"Have you watched Demon Slayer? The animation quality, art style and soundtrack make it one of the most enjoyable anime ever made IMO."
Mob Psycho 100,"Ghost in the Shell is missing from your list but damn you watched a lot more anime than me and I don't consider myself an anime hater.  

Ghost in the Shell has great storytelling and great visual, though I recommend switching to the show (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) if one of the movies starts annoying you."
Mob Psycho 100,"If you want something that's less fantasy and more ""mature"" I'd recommend March Comes In like a Lion and Run with the Wind.

Both are absolutely amazing."
Mob Psycho 100,I preferred S2's emotional beats a lot more than S1 personally.
Mob Psycho 100,Oh man I loved S02
Mob Psycho 100,"then you should adjust your expectations, cuz if you didn't like the mogami and reigen arcs, there's no way you'll like ss3."
Mob Psycho 100,What? S2 was way better then S1
Mob Psycho 100,"The best episode of season 2 was the first episode, which set my expectations too high as everything else was kinda hit or miss. The race episode would’ve been up there as well if it wasn’t for that cliffhanger ending that got 100% reversed the very next episode."
Mob Psycho 100,"Reigen becomes the star of the show. Mob is a seriously dangerous kid, like we're talking world ending calamity level and Reigen is his emotional support and fully understands what he's dealing with. Their relationship gets heavily fleshed out and it's not just a gag relationship they depend on each other. 

Here's their first meeting. https://youtu.be/9OU_tFXCvwA"
Mob Psycho 100,"I can imagine the group jogging, giving tips on how to run better while mob is fighting toichiro in the background."
Mob Psycho 100,*cries in a certain magical index*
Mob Psycho 100,I don’t think we’ll ever see that quality of animation again. It was a dream combination of some of the most talented freelance animators in the world.
Mob Psycho 100,You say that but I freaking loved season 2. Never understood the hate for it other than the lower quality in animation.
Mob Psycho 100,"not trying to start a dub vs sub war here but kaguya-sama love is war is one of the best dubs I've ever seen, like you can tell each voice actor actually puts a lot of effort, plus the translations nail all the mannerisms and the use modern slang. the narrator seriously has no business being as good as he is. stuff like breaking out into valley girl accent *""like omg he totally didnt""* when he's mocking someone, it's like they just didn't translate 1:1 but put effort in making actually match how people would actually speak in english

like the way he says ""damn what man can deny an invite like that"" in this clip

https://v.redd.it/ky1nx6fohmi51

he goes from a krunk in emperor's new groove yelling type voice to a smooth duke nukem type voice with that ""damn"". if theres a voice actor of the year he should win it lol"
Mob Psycho 100,"Screw those, all my homies are watching My Dress-Up Darling"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Hawkeye having a better post finale numbers than any of the Marvel D+ shows, it seems people were sleeping on it at the beginning but it rebounded."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Best season of Cobra Kai yet. Can't wait until the next. Bring on Teen Witch and Bad Boy Mike Barnes
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Cobra Kai is so damn good, happy for it"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,How much did Netflix pay YouTube for Cobra Kai again? Because that was a hell of a steal.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,The metrics are weird.  They go by minutes viewed over the entire series.  Cobra Kai is no 1 but they only have 1.9 million viewer as opposed to boba Fett which had 10 millions viewers.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Cobra Kai blows all the “revival” and “30 years later” movies and tv shows out of the water. They outdid Star Wars IMO.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Idk but that last boba was amazeballs. Ironic, considering he wasn’t even in it"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I think boba fett has a good chance of winning the all all valley this year, if he manages to take down Robbie, I don’t see any strong competition between him and the title"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Seeing the weekly numbers for Emily In Paris, it makes sense why that show got a double season renewal."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,“400 million minutes of viewing” sounds a whole lot better than “60% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.”
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I couldn't make it through 5 minutes on cobra kai this season.  Maybe it got good.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,All those Bobba Fett minutes are inflated.  Viewers fall asleep and don’t switch to another program.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"That’s roughly 760 years of play time, in a week.."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Or people waited for the show to finish and binged it all at once.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Have to say that I really genuinely enjoyed Hawkeye
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I had literally no interest until I heard >!Kingpin was in it!<
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Being more lighthearted, easy viewing for more casual fans and Christmas themed helped.

While I don't think it was any better than the other Marvel shows, anyone could watch Hawkeye and not need to have more than basic knowledge. Good luck following Loki or Wandavision as a casual."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Doesn’t surprise me as Loki and wandavision had terribly weak second halves
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Yeah I'm glad Netflix got it's head out of it's ass and picked it up like they always should have.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I really enjoyed Season 1. Season 2 and 3 were good, not great. SEASON 4 WAS AMAZING.  This show needed Terry Silver."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Do I have to watch the movies before watching the show?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I thought youtube cancelled it cause they stopped making shows. At that point netflix would just pay whoever produces the show. (sony maybe).
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Ahh I found it. Looks like they had to out-bid Hulu

[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/cobra-kai-moves-netflix-1299581/](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/cobra-kai-moves-netflix-1299581/)

No one seems to know how much though https://www.reddit.com/r/cobrakai/comments/ru39yv/how\_much\_did\_netflix\_pay\_to\_get\_cobra\_kai/"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Cobra kai has 5x more episodes might be including all series.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Not even sure how there even able to know the real actual numbers as now these streaming services are worldwide.

And this article is using a American audience numbers to say X did this well. 
Considering there are more netflix subscribers outside of North America now 

It means no one bar the actual streaming services know the true numbers and we all know how they like to keep them secret."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I agree it's a weird metric, but if Nielsen has no way to distinguish between episodes then I guess this is the best they can do. But the article dividing the the minutes by the entire series is even dumber. Most people watching Cobra Kai probably weren't watching it from the beginning. And S4 was only out for 3 day of that week I think, so not everyone binged the entire season those 3 days (for instance I think I watched only two of the 10 eps in that span). But there's no way to split all that up I guess.

Obviously with Boba it's more straightforward since there was only 1 episode. Some people maybe didn't finish it but there's only one ep to divide by. Probably even a little bigger since D+ credits are super long."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,They keep inventing the stupidest metrics. Anything that sounds great like X million minutes. Might as well multiply that by the viewers number and get something like X billion viewer minutes and we're done.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Perfect blend of nostalgia, cheese and comedy/drama."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Who would have guessed respecting the fans and not shitting on their childhoods would pay off
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Yeah, it was really good of Disney to transplant episode 1 of series 3 of The Mandalorian instead of whatever utterly uninspiring ep of Book of Boba Fett was meant to be there."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Can I skip the rest of the show and just watch that episode? Or would it not make sense out of context?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I watched the first couple episodes and thought it’s the worst season of Cobra Kai yet I keep hearing how good the new season is
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,If you watched the last 3 seasons and this was the one to turn you off. I'm not sure what to tell you. It's been roughly the same quality post season 1.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I wasn't digging it, so stopped watching about episode 3, then just finished them off for MCU continuity"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I mean yes but I'm comparing it with the same Marvel show with the same release schedule.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Yeah the titular character wasn't even the best part of the show imo.  It had a good cast and then there was the last episode...
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Same. Haven't watched it yet, but it sounds appealing to me now."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Which could explain why the numbers got better later on.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I would recommend it. You'll get more enjoyment out of Cobra Kai if you know things from the first three KK movies. There are lots of references.

You don't need to watch The Next Karate Kid or the Jaden Smith Karate Kid though."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"it may help, but I watched them only once barely remembering anything more than 30 years ago so..it's all good if you dont, I believe"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Definitely the first movie I'd say is a must for the first couple of seasons. But don't see it as a problem, the movie was great back then and it still is great.  The sequels? not so much."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,They do constantly recap and remind of you of what happened in the movies. So you’ll never really be lost as to who anyone is or what’s going on
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Youtube never cancelled Cobra Kai.  They renewed it for Season 3 and I believe already paid for it.  But then they opted to cancel all the other scripted shows.  Rather than let this die on the vine, the owner, Sony, worked with Youtube to shop the show around.  The details of what was spent are behind closed doors, but I'd imagine Youtube got back their investment on Season 3 along with getting to keep the rights to the first two seasons for dvd distribution and as now a non-exclusive streaming source."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,That's what I thought too. YouTube canned the whole thing long before Netflix grabbed them
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"They article identifies major issues with the numbers.

> Nielsen’s streaming ratings cover viewing on TV sets only and don’t include minutes watched on computers or mobile devices. The ratings only measure U.S. audiences, not those in other countries, and currently only include Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Netflix and Prime Video."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,For real. They really nail the corny 80’s montages! Haha
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Best episode so far lol. I'd like to imagine there's someone who has Disney+ and decided to watch this show, but without having ever watched the mandalorian, and was super confused by 99% of the episode having no connection to Boba - and yet still was thinking ""damn this show got really good!"""
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Right I’m sure that wasn’t totally the plan all along.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"You could and it would make complete sense as long as you’re caught up on the mandalorian. With that said, I’d still give the rest of a show a try. I enjoy it. Maybe you will, maybe you won’t. But you won’t know unless you check it out yourself."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,It's basically dovtailed in as  Mandalorian 2 mid-season so you can see when it lines up with the two story arcs during the assasination attempt and the razercrest repair scene
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,It is almost completely separate from Boba Fett. So much so that it works better as an episode of the Mandolorian than an episode of Boba Fett.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I thought it was better than season 3 which was tough to make it through with all the teen drama.  It felt like season 4 at least put a little more focus on the adults.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I tried.  I enjoyed the show enough in previous seasons.  it was just way too corny for me.  it  also reminds of Sons of Anarchy in that they have these massive fights in a small area and there is no law enforcement.   these are basically gangs in a turf war.   the only thing different is that instead of selling guns they are selling a very situationally useful way to fight and a good exercise.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I guess then I had my fill of corn and lifetime quality plots.  Nostalgia can only go so far I guess.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Yeah exactly. I don't see much of difference Honestly even season 1 was heavy nostalgia as well, it just was simpler with less moving pieces. A karate soap opera that is based on 80's nostalgia and an old franchise isn't going to be for everyone, but for what it wants to be it pretty much nails it."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I did that with what if
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Is it good?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,It came out during the holidays when people have other focuses
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Yeah but by S4 they're pretty deep into the lore of the entire trilogy. It's probably not *completely* necessary but I don't think I would have enjoyed this season as much if I didn't know who Terry Silver was.

And I would put money down on them bringing stuff in from The Next Karate Kid at some point. This show's too popular not to be able to make Hillary Swank a good offer."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Karate Kid 2 is pretty important to season 3 >!and will be going forward!< . KK3 introduces Terry Silver, who joined the show in Season 4."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,The Johnny Lawrence training sequence where he fights waves should win an Emmy
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I’m sure that it wasn’t but I’m yet to see one professional critic give anything but a *mixed* review of BoBF to date. It entirely behoves Disney/Lucasfilm to do everything that they can on the face of it to rescue things for the future of their upcoming series’ and **especially** subscription numbers.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I watched the pilot. It didn’t do much for me. Boba isn’t a very compelling protagonist and I’m so exhausted by desert planet stories.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,100% agree
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I didn't even bother with what if, after the first 5 minutes of that first episode, lol"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Yeah this was me.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"So you think that they produced a whole season of Book of Boba Fett, thought it was boring, and then decided to shoehorn in an episode of the Mandalorian to rescue things?"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,That’s fair. Definitely check out that new episode tho. Feels nothing like the previous ones. It will be essential watching before the new mando season.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Only episode worth watching is the Dr Strange one. Just goddamn, what a ride."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Yeah, that sounds like enough time to judge if a show is good or not. /s"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Zombies and the last 3 episodes are worth while. Rest is blah.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Yes, I believe that it hasn’t been received in quite the rapturous way that they expected- because it **is** shit. I mean, it’s **bad**- and there’s an awful lot riding on the ‘now’ regarding the future so it *does* actually make sense. It’s entirely about numbers, man. Did you look at how high the production values are in this episode, how little refers to BoBF, how it has zero to do with the overarcing story, how if this *was* E1 S3 of Mandalorian it would be a completely perfect reintroduction and birth a series-long storyline, how the writing style is utterly different from BoBF (apart from the last couple of minutes when it gains that bare bones soapy scripting feel of BoBF)? 

It’s come from a different, trusted, successful and lucrative series and not the entirely stillborn poor quality melange that hosts it and it really shows up the Book of Boba Fett for how weak it is on almost every level."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,You mean you don’t love bitch-made Thanos?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"This makes absolutely no sense. We’ve known since before it premiered that there were going to be seven episodes, one of which would be directed by Bryce Dallas Howard. 

Are you suggesting that, based on reception, they scrapped an entire episode, reworked the plot of the second half of the season to include Mando, filmed new scenes for this episode to work it into BOBF, and replaced BDH’s episode with the Mandalorian premiere (which also happened to be directed by BDH)… all in 4 weeks?"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"If the Mandalorian ep was ready to go and would take reshoots that amounted to about two minutes of screen time then, yes, I actually completely believe it."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,So you’re saying they just completely erased an episode of Boba Fett?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Yes. Because they are not dumb and can see which way the wind is blowing. It’s not that outré a concept
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Alright, whatever you say. Brilliant theory."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,So do you now think they erased TWO episodes of BOBF?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Thank you.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I think that they’ve edited part of S3 E2 into the BoBF episode, yes.

Why, do you not?"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Lol no I don’t, because it makes no sense.

Din’s plot was clearly part of the initial plan. He meets with Fennic and Cobb Vanth as part of building their team. These two episodes both fit as part of that continuation. We also knew ahead of time that Filoni would be writing and directing episode 6, and this was a Filoni episode. 

So what makes more sense - that they threw all this together in a couple weeks, but still got lucky that it lined up with everything we knew going into the season, and then threw away two episodes worth of work, without it affecting BOBF’s story…

Or that maybe this was all planned ahead of time?"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"It surprises me that they have so many returning characters from the Mando series plus new ones for BoBF in the same episode, though. And I can’t see in any way how the trip to visit Grogu in any way works in with the BoBF main story. It just seems like a mightily expensive 15 minutes or however long it was to inject for a bit of fan service.

But look, quite honestly, I’m not that fussed to argue about it. Last week was the best episode by a country mile of BoBF and this one has a lot of elements related to last week but that aren’t really related to the Boba Fett story. Planned or otherwise, I’m glad that last week and the bits and pieces featured this week are there as I was about to give up on the show"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"This is around when the quality of the show starts to dip followed by a horrible final season 5. 

You’ll start to see more sillier plot ideas, dumb anime cliches/trends and they’ll start to focus less on the food (by season 5 they’ll stop explaining or showing what dish they cooked). 

The author/artist clearly didn’t expect the show to pick up steam and had no clue how to continue or finish the series. Such a disappointment."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"This is one of those animes I think would translate well into a live-action adaptation. There are too many reality cooking shows, but strangely almost no food-porn style scripted drama. Just regular drama interspersed with lots of highly stylised cooking scenes and ASMR cooking sounds. Sadly I only know of a few movies like that."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I thought this released a ways back? I guess it just didn't air on AS? Need 5th plate to get dubbed now.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"My money's on Ian with the pink frosted donut to win, I wonder what Anthony will come up with this year to try and beat him"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,The culinary consultant that the author used went on maternity leave and so they apparently just opted not to have one anymore. The manga also dropped in ranking so the ending was straight up rushed to hell unfortunately.
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I thought that Season 5 felt more like a decade-later revival season. You've got a villain who isn't set up or earned in the slightest and an entire cabal of evil chefs that really should have been mentioned before that. 

To me, that feels like someone is revisiting a franchise after several years and wants to end it with a bang without hewing too closely to the previous seasons. To go right from 4 (which would have been a perfectly fine end to the show) to 5 is incredible whiplash, there's hardly connective tissue. 

That said, I dunno, I thought it was fine."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,first 2 seasons are so good
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,I take it you aren’t a fan of Hannibal or Servant ;)
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"it would be a cool setup, not sure about how long the big o's would last compared to the anime"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Like *The God of Cookery*?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Not to mention STUPID gimmick tools. Seasoning claws, seasoning chainsaw?! 

Out of the endless amount of techniques and dishes in cuisine you come up with shonen battle power weapons and the “you only have to see the technique once” troupe and an SAO villain tier of creepiness."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I thought the wacky tool stuff was within acceptable boundaries. This IS a show where good food makes clothes fly off. 

That said, and I know this was before season 5, but it's when I kinda soured on the show a bit: I hated when they canonized the ""clothes flying off is actually your Bloodline Ability (tm) that runs in our family"". I was with it when it appeared to just be abstract surrealism, but making it an actual thing, having peoples clothes ACTUALLY be coming off? Comes with allllll sorts of problems."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Season 4 would’ve been a proper end to it despite what problems I had with the plot. But Season 5 after was a train wreck. 

The wacky tools was the breaking point for me because it gave an incredibly lazy way to present a dish. No longer do they show a real cooking technique used, regional ingredient that explains the dish and it’s culture or real old/modern equipment used to process the ingredients. 

It even stripped away the identity of the cook/chef, where it didn’t matter what your personality is like, anyone can be a chef. Now it’s goofy uniformed goons with silly weapons and powers and put as little focus on the food as possible. It turned into Fighting Foodons with HunterXHunter."
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,">HBO Max Adds Death Note, ~~Hunter x Hunter~~Hiatus X Hiatus, Food Wars!, Tower of God Anime

Ftfy :P"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,Are they going to have all of HxH or just stop at seemingly random points like Netflix and Hulu?
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"Is Tower of God any good?

Edit: well I’m definitely going to watch it now"
Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma,"I love that a ton of shows are getting more exposure left and right, but you're doing fans a dis-service by constantly cutting the episodes half way through the entire show.

I know it has to do with streaming/dub rights, and it isn't their fault, but Netflix has Hunter x Hunter up to episode 80. HBO has the show up to episode 99. Netflix doesn't even have the entire One Piece dub up-to-par, and are advertising it like crazy. It literally encourages fans to find it through illegal means on the internet to finish the show, and that usually means fans stick to that website they found the show on to watch other shows, and they eventually un-subscribe."
Gate,Jonathan Frakes directed.  He knows the characters and the actors and knows how to get great performances from them.
Gate,Gates McFadden looks amazing for 70+. AMAZING.
Gate,"I’m a guy who likes his Trek for the ships and aliens and anomalies but this one scene of two estranged friends and lovers speaking for the first time in 2 decades might be one of my favorite moments in Trek. 

It’s just a great two hander with both actors giving a hell of a performance. 

They both come into the scene with opposing views and at the end, you see both of their sides. 

And that line Crusher gives about not being sure if she could protect Jean-Luc Picard’s son was gutting."
Gate,"Their scene in Med Bay was phenomenal. Patrick Stewart has felt very present in seasons 1 and 2, but this and the last episode, I've forgotten about him. It was only Picard."
Gate,"The scene in episode 2 where they meet each other for the first time in 20+ years and all the regret, shame?, pleading, realisation and then urgency that play out wordlessly across the faces of Picard and Crusher is one of my favourite character moments in all of Star Trek."
Gate,Wait up - Picard is actually good now??
Gate,"Honorable Mentions:

* David Eigenberg - Chicago Fire
* Harrison Ford - Shrinking
* David Giuntoli - A Million Little Things"
Gate,should have been Bella Ramsey and Storm Reid
Gate,"Aww, man, does this mean I need to finish terrible S2 so I can watch S3?"
Gate,Are they together? I used to ship them when I watched TNG but don't have Paramount Plus atm.
Gate,"You know, I guess it's POSSIBLE for someone to write a good reason why Beverly would ignore her closest friends for 20 years..... But this writing team sure failed at that task. 

I'm sorry, but you can't convince me Beverly would just ghost Picard (and especially Diana, her BEST FRIEND) for 20 years because of some abstract danger her son was in due to who his father is. It's just stupid. Especially because Picard was about to become an Admiral, which is a notoriously boring job in Starfleet. 

There's no way the character we knew in TNG would do something so malicious. Writing bad."
Gate,"Uh, oh. The characters didn't die did they? If someone's being named ""Performer of the Week"" it feels like it's a 50% chance the characters met their end."
Gate,"I'm sorry, I don't know what y'all are watching.  Patrick Stewart at 82(!) is showing all 82 of those years.  He is absolutely GEEZING his way through his lines, shambling across the screen.  There is no vitality.  The others are holding their own in comparison.  But PS is not.  He is present and that's about it.

The bridge scene was accomplished in editing."
Gate,Star Trek: The Walking Dead Generation
Gate,Prichard watchable now ?  It was awful before
Gate,Two-Takes Frakes!
Gate,"

>Nimoy: Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. When I directed Star Trek IV I got a magnificent performance out of Bill because I respected him so much.
>
>Shatner: And when I directed Star Trek V I got a magnificent performance out of me, because I respected me so much!"
Gate,"Yeah, her line about how ""The stars took my husband, my son, my partner... how could I protect Jack from them?"" was so powerful.  

It was such a good scene, you really understand both their points of view, and I don't think it would have had as much weight if we didn't understand what Jean-Luc had been through with his parents in the previous season."
Gate,"The best thing about the episode was, you got these gutting, magnifiently acted character moments... but you also got a tense ship-to-ship battle, and a weird anomaly, and a mysterious plot, and Worf being awesome — the whole episode was just overstuffed with everything we love about Star Trek, and yet it never felt rushed and the shifts in tone were never jarring. Frakes directed the hell out of this one (and had his own terrific moment acting against Stewart)."
Gate,Nice touch to have them standing far apart with some medbeds between them.
Gate,"> And that line Crusher gives about not being sure if she could protect Jean-Luc Picard’s son was gutting.

It's still weird she then proceeds to take her son from warzone to warzone and end up with him having a large criminal record."
Gate,"I don’t hate the first two seasons the way a lot of trek fans seem to but >!when he confronts her about taking away his choice, the pain of locutus is still there and that wave of realization hits Beverly…!< that scene is as good as anything from TNG."
Gate,"So far: three good episodes in a row. But let's see how it goes. 

My personal favourite so far is >!Worf, Son of Mogh, champion of one-liners!<. He's so good that he even >!lifts up ~~Raffi~~ Raffaela who so far had been the worst written main character in Star Trek. But the scenes those two had together were so good that even she became bearable. Quite a feat!<"
Gate,"Yeah, kind of.

Season 3 is essentially a reboot with a new showrunners, the guy who ran 12 Monkeys. Half the cast from seasons 1 and 2 are gone. It's basically the show it should have been the whole time now."
Gate,I'm always a little wary. Seasons of Picard and Discovery have had strong beginning only to end horribly but this one really looks good. Picard acts like Picard.
Gate,surprisingly yes.
Gate,"Don't believe it.  You will still cry out ""GOD THIS SUCKS,"" but just not with the same frequency as before."
Gate,"more like mediocre, with story beats seen a bajillion times and dialogue as lively and exciting as a congress of mummies. Mediocre is still several aeons better than s1 or 2, though"
Gate,I don't care its too late now.
Gate,Lol oh no. This is how you know TVLine gets paid for these articles. This season is a bad ripoff of Wrath of Khan.
Gate,"The first few episodes of each season is usually good because it is mostly spent setting up a mystery. And mysteries are exciting.

The issue comes afterwards, when the show starts revealing answers that are often unsatisfactory. 

Even in this third episode, there's a reveal that's supposed to be very shocking. One of the greatest enemies Starfleet has ever faced has returned! Except, when you think about it and listen carefully to what was said, you realize the threat is not as great as the show is hyping it up to be."
Gate,Harrison Ford is killing it in Shrinking. Really enjoying the show
Gate,David Eigenberg was fantastic in Chicago Fire. Cool that he is getting some attention since a show like that isn't really considered a lot for the times for these things.
Gate,"Whether or not you think the episode was good, they did a spectacular job. Bella has adorable wonderment, feral rage, unrequited love frustration, and lovestruck gazing down pat. Seriously, her range in that episode was the best it's been so far. 

Storm was more than believable as a idealistic rebellious teen, and her wit and delivery were perfectly matched to Bella. ""wE're gETtiNg mArRied""

The TLOU cast winning every week seems unfair, but I think a mention would've been reasonable.

I also can't compare their performances to these other shows, since I don't watch them. I just wanted to praise Storm and Bella."
Gate,"Nope, it's basically a reboot. You don't even need to have watched season 1, it's only briefly referenced.

HOWEVER, it is now a lot more relevant that you've seen..... Enterprise, DS9, Voyager....there is a big plot twist in the most recent episode that isn't explained if you haven't watched a certain one of those, to be as vague as possible. I haven't even seen all of.....certain show and I'm only going by what I've absorbed about it."
Gate,"Honestly, don’t bother. S2 hasn’t even been mentioned, even though they’re happy pulling references to S1."
Gate,Nah. Completely skippable.
Gate,"Off the top of my head, nothing vital has come up yet. There’s been a few references to how they dealt with Picard’s illness story, but that’s basically it, and it’s not been plot changing. Just off hand comments.

It really feels like they wanted it to be as clean a starting point for people who just want a nostalgia run, and it’s been amazing as a result."
Gate,"Worst case if they do actually mention S2; just watch redlettermedia's videos on it, it'll give you all you need to know and is actually entertaining to boot."
Gate,"I'll keep the spoilers very minor, because this show is definitely worth seeing. 

>!Part of the main thrust of the scene is that they WERE together 20 years earlier, shortly before Picard got involved in the Romulan rescue effort, and they broke it off for what's described as ""the fifth time."" So apparently they were an on-and-off thing for awhile.!<"
Gate,"clearly not a popular opinion, but I agree. First its a crap thing to do, second I find it hard to believe Beverly would keep a son from Picard. I find it strange so many people seem to think it makes sense.  Bad writing doing a disservice to the actors and the audience"
Gate,[deleted]
Gate,[deleted]
Gate,Star Trek: Geriatrics
Gate,"A bunch of stuff from the earlier seasons that a lot of us groaned about has become resonant.

We complained that Picard didn’t have his voice, and that Seven didn’t have hers, and within 3 episodes both of them are so much more of who we expect them to be, with a bunch of that baggage from s1 and s2 mixed in.

Patrick Stewart brought some serious ice to that scene that we haven’t seen in decades from Picard, and Seven butting up against Shaw is so much more in line with her making sense of her place rather than just being bored in car chases and corn mazes with a bunch of other bickering characters.

Even Raffi shone with Worf, and like I said in another post; I can’t wait for the spin-off where they start a private detective agency in New Orleans."
Gate,"The music Worf was listening to was a piece by Berlioz, that Picard was listening to before the Battle of Sector 001, at the beginning of First Contact.  I daresay that Matalas and his crew are just as good at deep cut Easter eggs as Mike McMahan."
Gate,"I find it weird that she would NEVER tell Picard he has a son at any possible point ever, as the first Season shows him as a recluse who hasn't had any influence on galactic events for at least a decade prior. So her whole ""The galaxy is out to kill him"" spiel doesn't make sense in the face of his solitude for 20 years."
Gate,Just the look he gives her before either of them start talking was a better acting moment than we got anywhere in the first two seasons.
Gate,"Hell, it's better than TNG.  (Though I might need to rewatch Attached from S7 to confirm.)"
Gate,Do I have to force myself through season 2 to understand season 3?
Gate,I want there to be some references to a federation aligned Borg Queen in the show. They created a fairly awesome new character at the end of Season 2 and I want there to be some impact on the larger storyline.
Gate,Or you could just watch the show instead of watching content from somebody who hates it.
Gate,"The ONLY way to protect her kid was to completely abandon her closest friends, all of whom would die for her and/or her kid? Lol ok dude."
Gate,Honestly McFadden carried that scene. Stewart just kind of stands there and mumbles.
Gate,Thanks. I've now read the article. My pc was just a joke about these PotW posts.
Gate,"As someone who recognised this instantly, I wonder why *Worf* is listening to it when he isn't even on the Enterprise when this scene takes place in First Contact."
Gate,"They're so good at deep cut Easter eggs, but they forgot that changelings can move a lot faster than a slug when they're in liquid form. Lol ok."
Gate,"Especially if Jack attended school in London he's just a cursory glance at Beverly Crusher's status by any of her former senior crew colleagues away from being found. It's a bit contrived but whatever.

Think it's clear she was being irrational in the whole situation due to the collected emotional pressure of losing her husband, Wesley (Really man, you can travel through dimensions but can't visit your mom?) and then the whole Picard/Jack situation."
Gate,"Yeah, and that wider shot of the distance between them spoke volumes."
Gate,"Well, for sure it’s the best thing gates McFadden has done since Sub Rosa. 

Lol"
Gate,What.
Gate,"Absolutely not. There's one character there that's new and not introduced, but you really don't need to know about her background. It's essentially a stand-alone season. So far, anyways."
Gate,"Honestly, I would skip both season 1 and 2 and you’ll be fine. This season works more as a direct following of the TNG movie Nemesis, besides a couple of characters and minor things."
Gate,"Eh, there's some backstory about Picard's family in S2 that would help deepen the understanding of this scene, but you could live without it. 

That said, I've found each season to be good so far, although 3 has been by far the best. 3 > 1 > 2."
Gate,Didn't the actress pass away a few months ago?
Gate,Worf has a love of Klingon opera. Maybe his horizons have broadened since then to Berlioz.
Gate,"Well, it's about the Trojan War. Perhaps both he and Picard recognized something thematic in it that resonated with their feelings about an upcoming conflict."
Gate,This was a severely weakened Changeling though.
Gate,"He was supposed to be so exhausted he could barely hold his humanoid shape. Per DS9, changelings can actually hold their form until it kills them."
Gate,The original queen died in the show and was replaced by the new and improved version who was a federation scientist played by Alison Pill.
Gate,"Spoilers obviously, >!the Borg Queen sort of did transfer of power to a second Borg Queen in season 2. The actress for the first Borg Queen died. The actress for the Borg Queen who took over is still well and alive.!<"
Gate,And what about the Borg is symbolic of the Trojan war? The sphere supposed to be the giant Horse?
Gate,"The lyrics of that particular part of the opera allude to a memory of a happier time and a more peaceful place. It's the calm before the storm, so to speak."
Gate,So the Picard moment is literally reusing the same symbolism?
Gate,"Kind of. I think for fans it hearkens back to First Contact, but for both Picard and Worf in the moment it's about the calm before the battle.

In fact, this isn't the [first time ](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/etvmze/strangely_meta_moment_with_picard_stewart_and_the/) the show has played with a little double meaning."
Gate,"Watched for Milo, but it is a background show, even with the con aspect there isn’t much surprise. Needs that TNT crime drama edge."
Gate,Agree. I watched the first 10 mins then went away. It seemed pretty predictable.
Gate,I recorded it thinking it was the new show with the con man and the FBI agent. I was surprised to see Milo. I'll watch it later this week.
Gate,I’m shocked that American Idol is still pulling 5+ million

Gate,"It was better than the average show on network television these days, not a very high bar but here we are. Those ratings are abysmal, it's pretty bad when the only way to survive the ax on network television is to make a spin off of a spin off. They better hope they do amazing in delayed viewing."
Gate,"I feel like if, near the end of the, when Milo's character goes to the female leads house, he just straight up tells her that when he told her he was a criminal, he wasn't lying, and she reciprocates and tells him that she wasn't lying when she said she was in the CIA, and then, from there, they build a pretty open and honest relationship, it'd have lead to something more interesting than what they have going on now.

I think that'd be a way better angle for the show than another ""will they/won't they find out"" angle."
Gate,"I'm enjoying it. It's kinda predcictable but I am watching it for Milo. Also!! So funny that actress who (spoiler) stole the crypto is a bad guy here (Should have guessed Rose-JTV-would habe been. I wished they made her do a pun!), wonder if she'll return. I hope the show isn't cancelled."
Gate,TNT actually had a show about a female con artist called Good Behavior with Michelle Dockery. It was quite good.
Gate,Why?
Gate,"That’s exactly the show I was thinking of, lol! The first season was so good."
Gate,I loved that show so much!
Gate,"If you want a great con artist show, ""The Riches"" is the best."
Gate,And a teaser for something that’s got to do with the number 47 and might involve Ben
Gate,"hilarious, yeah. side splitting"
Gate,Not even an ok show.
Gate,"Is this a good series? I actually forgot that this was a thing but I loved the first NT movie (second one was meh) and in general I love ""treasure hunter"" types of shows."
Gate,"Turned it off after 2 minutes. That flashback just screamed low budget, zero effort. Will try to give it another go."
Gate,"There is absolutely 0 way you even watched a little bit of it lol. 

The show was fine, and good for its target audience."
Gate,"It's not very good, to be honest. But the actual treasure hunt is interesting and the connections to National Treasure are fun. If you can look past some of the cringy dialogue and writing, you can probably enjoy it for what it is. It's a 6/10, just go in knowing it's not great.

/u/thndrstrk, it might be worth a watch with your daughter."
Gate,Id give it a try if I were you. It's not great but if you like that genre then it's worth trying.
Gate,Nope
Gate,"It's fine, no better or worse than the movies."
Gate,Nope
Gate,"That's right up her alley. Thanks for the response, gonna check it out. Even if it's not for me, still might be fun to check out."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,This is the final set of episodes for Stone Ocean (Ep. 25-38)
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"SO has the craziest finale, jealous of those who are about to experience it"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Well at least we won’t have to wait almost a full year, like the gap between part 1 and part 2. Too bad Dec 1st is finals week. I know what I’m watching when the semester ends though!"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,[deleted]
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Excited, but I miss the weekly releases. The hype isn’t really the same when it’s just all there all at once."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"""You get no bitches"""
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,So why was there such a long wait between part 1 and 2
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Fuck yes thank you Jesus I love this current jojo season

I watch them really slow so I always have more to look forward too"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Part 7 hype
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Goddamn this release style, it took away my deserved memes."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I just want Golden Wind
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Can’t wait!
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Jooojoooo..
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I fully expect they are going to censor or cut out some of the finale due to possible copyright issues. Bohemian rhapsody.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,It's Dec 1st and nothing on any of my Netflix accounts nor is the dlc available for asbr 😕
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I didn't even know that part 6 was over. I missed looking forward to jojo fridays. it just doesn't feel the same. dropping all the episodes at once was a terrible idea. steel ball run is my favorite part, so I hope they go back to normal weekly broadcasts next time."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I’m jealous of anyone who is an anime only jojo fan who somehow wasn’t spoiled.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Yeah the ending is insane. I look forward to seeing it animated. Also we are one step closer to a steel ball run anime.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"If they don't license ""What a wonderful world"" for it, I'll be sorely dissapointed"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I really didn't enjoy the first season and gave up after 5 or so episodes but at the same time I don't want to watch the future seasons until I eventully finish the first season
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,It makes as much sense as anything else
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I hope so, because to me it's the most boring season so far :/"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Idk what region you’re in but im in the us and we have every episode rn
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,In the UK we don't even have Diamond is Unbreakable. It's ridiculous.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Germany only has part 1, 2, 3 and 6"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Golden Wind is on Crunchyroll, at least here in Portugal."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"In Canada, we have Phantom Blood, Battle Tendency,  Stardust Crusaders, Diamond is Unbreakable, Golden Wind, and Stone Ocean."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"The lack of weekly releases and the bulk drop on Netflix really killed the popularity of this series

Jojo is still popular but it used to be everywhere when I was airing and now it’s just “oh there are new episodes…ok”

I never see people talking about it on Twitter, r/anime or other subs, discords, etc they all just don’t care"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Probably because David Production was working on Urusei Yatsura.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,You have way more patience than I. I try to watch one or two. And then something awesome happens and I binge it all in a night... Oh well I can rewatch it again in 3 weeks!
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,NYO HO HO!
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Did they recently get rid of Golden Wind?
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I can’t wait. Just hanging on for the dubs now:)
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Me, I’m currently too broke for the whole manga series, once I finish college, I’ll buy the whole series."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Be jealous of me. Yes.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"SBR cranks the esoteric fights to the max, I don't envy those animators heh"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I'm honestly worried about the Steel Ball Run anime. I feel like A LOT of people are going to be disappointed by it. Not because of any Netflix or production fuckery, but so many people put it on such a high pedestal and it's not really *that* much different from the other parts to the point where it could live up to the hype."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,[deleted]
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"When I read the manga, I do also remember finding a lot of the fights inside the prison kinda boring, but most of the best fights ended up being in the final third for me and it has maybe my favorite final fight of the whole series."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,[deleted]
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Same in Canada
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,no golden wind in NZ
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Sad, here in Canada we got the whole series"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I didn't even realize part 2 of part 6 was out until like a week ago because I stumbled into it on Netflix.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,My motivation to watch part 6 was kinda killed by this style of release as it just turns into added to pile of things I’ll watch eventually.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Yeah for a part which should be incredibly hype for long time watchers it just feels dead. I agree that I haven’t seen anyone talking about it nearly as much as before. 

Dunno why netflix would bother buying the license to host it if they aren’t gonna even do anything with it (apart from, ya know, collect the streaming money). The marketing has been so garbage I don’t think most people know part 2 dropped."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Netflix's binge model is terrible for keeping the hype. To my knowledge they drop some series as weekly affairs, and other in the usual bulk drop. The inconsistency makes it worse."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I'm sure it has nothing to do with it running for 10 years at this point. Nothing at all.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Yeah, this last 1 year wait for new episodes was rough, so was glad to see this is dropping very soon after the last bunch of episodes.

I do sometimes binge a few but I really try to watch one a day at most haha"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,not on netflix in many countries
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,It’s not even all published in English yet
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,See you in 8 years.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Yeah, SBR was so hyped up for me I actually found it kinda underwhelming when I got round to it, and in contrast I actually loved Stone Ocean so much (since it's a bit divisive) that it became my favourite part. I can't wait for these new episodes because the wild shit Jolyne pulls in them is what made her my favourite JoJo and made me love Stone Ocean so much."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"It's not perfect, but I do think it's the best part of the series. There's a couple of boring stand fights near the beginning, but I feel like from Mandom onwards, almost every fight is really good and I think the characters are more interesting than in previous parts."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Part 2 is an absolute gem, you don't deserve the rest"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Its not there for us yet sadly, but if you want to watch stuff on Netflix that's not available in Iceland just get a vpn for your browser and swap regions. It might be a little slower then what you're used to but its the best choice apart from moving here."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I dunno about the US, but it’s not here in Canada"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I didn't realize it was out until someone was using it as an example of how the Netflix distribution system doesn't work.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Knowing what's coming next... That's gonna be real difficult. Normally a JoJo arc tries to push it from 10 to 11... This one goes to 24
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Before they got a actual translation, I remember hearing about how memorable the ghetto translation was (it was done by students or something)."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I thought most of it was, but very poorly"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Netflix is so, so BAD at letting you know a show you watched has a new season coming."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I think it's a better example of how abruptly shifting from weekly output to large drops hurts communities used to the former, as opposed to larger bingeable drops not working in general.  It doesn't help that *something* clearly happened behind the scenes to delay part 2 by an unprecedented amount, instead of having it air three months after the first like it should have."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,the unofficial part 4 translation back in the day was legendarily awful yeah. the unofficial translations are much better now though
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Are you fucking kidding me? That means Stone Ocean won’t be done until late 2023.

This better not happen when they adapt Steel Ball Run or it will take like five years."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"They really botched this thing huh? Almost a year to release another 12 episodes. With at least another part to go. If it wasn’t ready to air close together maybe they should have held part one for April if they’re committed to this stupid “batch release” idea.  

The silver lining is it’s awesome so far."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,That's a long wait... Oh no  i will have to rewatch it before Part2 /s
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Gee thanks for waiting to let us know.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Jesus
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I can't say I really cared much for this season. There's something missing from the show that i haven't had since Stardust crusaders but it's hard to put my finger on what it is.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I wish Netflix would just die already. They are such shit.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Now. How long until season 2 of Demon Slayer hits Netflix?
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,patient watchers stay winning
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,YAAAAASSSSSSS is there going to be another part or is this it? Seasons are usually 30+ episodes.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,where did the first part end at?
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"So many people getting salty that animation takes time, on top of the fact that it's an animation of a Manga that they could straight up read if they need to know what happens next that badly. Go out and live life and come back to it in the fall. A small wait in life isn't anything to be upset over, and patience is a good character trait to have."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Oi oi oi
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I can't wait for it to air
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Does this mean there will be a part 3?
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"This is what you get with Netflix, small episode orders and they might just forget about the show at any time. (honestly they need networks or something, they have so many projects to manage)"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,i must be too old or something- i just don’t understand this anime.  2 episodes in and i quit…
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Leave it to the Hollywood establishment to fuck up an anime franchise that otherwise just prints money. Next time leave it to Japan exclusively 

It doesn’t help that stone ocean is the worst JoJo part, but the key is to get through it until you get to the amazing steel ball run"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Grabs a beer.""Oh no! Somebody stop me!"""
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,Might as well never come. They have dropped so many animes after one season.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I would imagine based on the content left in the manga that they would need at least three ""parts"". They would have to skip large parts or rush things otherwise."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,[deleted]
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,It rained frogs.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"It is not the end of the world no, but I do think it is worth noting that they just started a weekly translation of part 6 which only has 16/158 chapters officially translated into English.

If you want to enjoy the story through an official source you don't have any options unless you can read it in a language that it was already released in. For those who go this route it does kind of suck they have to risk being spoiled for quite a bit longer than expected."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I don't know if that was ever made official but it's basically guaranteed based on how much they have left to adapt.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Unless they’re going to cut a good deal of content and just botch the pacing, there has to be a part 3."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"This isn’t a Netflix problem, it’s a Japanese animation studio problem. This kind of release schedule has just become the norm. Just look at how they’ve been handling AOT and demon slayer for examples. They just release short seasons then work on other projects before continuing. The only influence Netflix has is that they get it on their platform and can label it a “Netflix Original”"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,If you started with this one then no wonder. This is Part 6 of the story. If you started with Part 1 then I understand. It’s quite Bizarre.
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,So do you think Netflix is holding David Productions hostage stopping them from going into work animating the show in order to delay it?
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I'm saying; is there only going to be 2 parts? If it's 12 episode, seasons are usually 36 episodes, so we'd only have 24. Unless they're dropped 20+ episodes in this one."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I see, thanks. Yep still a loong way to go"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Correct the Japanese release has been slower if anything, and the new episodes aren't made.

They are putting a TON of effort into SO, the animation quality is top notch."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"Demon Slayer isn't particularly slow. S1 ran for 6 months in 2019, then we got the movie in 2020, then S2 ran for 3 months in 2021-2022. That's pretty standard as far as TV shows go. And this kind of schedule is much healthier than what the big popular shounen shows used to have (which was an episode every week every year, heavily reliant on filler content, half-baked animation and bad pacing to make it work).

AoT is notably stranger but it also has had production issues since S1 and continues to have them to this day. This season of JoJo is strange because at first glance it feels like it's supposed to just be another season of an already established TV show with established release rhythms, but it's being released in this weird way instead."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,">short seasons

12 episodes is NORMAL season. Short season are 6 episodes."
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,"I know, I meant short when compared to animes that have 24 episodes or more"
JoJos Bizarre Adventure,I'm going through Golden Wind now. It's batshit crazy as ususl
Kingdom,Trailer does not include anyone yelling “SHIELD [long pause] WALL!!”. Deeply concerned.
Kingdom,"Uthred son of Uthred is a great character. 

I am really looking forward to this. In my opinion, this was the best show dealing with Viking theme."
Kingdom,So hyped for more Uhtred son of Uhtred
Kingdom,I am Uhtred son of Uhtred
Kingdom,"Fuck yes.  I finally got around to watching the final season of The Last Kingdom over the past couple of weeks, so it must be... *destiny* that this is coming soon."
Kingdom,"One of my favorite shows of all time, really looking forward to this. Destiny is all!"
Kingdom,Anybody misread the title as Stephen King must die?
Kingdom,"Trailer needed more Finan, but excited nonetheless."
Kingdom,The modern day James Bond. Every season begins or ends with his previous missus dying and him immediately shacking up with a new lady. Be hard pressed to fit that cycle into a 2 hour movie.
Kingdom,"well, that's a lot of kings to assassinate"
Kingdom,"Uthred the Ageless - outlived young Edward.

Pretty hyped tho, ngl"
Kingdom,Best Viking show/movie I’ve ever seen
Kingdom,I was disappointed with the final season but I’m excited to see this
Kingdom,"Also astonishing how many can't read 

Maybe not so surprising in a tv sub tho"
Kingdom,Used to be one of my favorite shows till season 3. But season 4 made me lose all interest and killed my love for it. Did it get any better afterwards?
Kingdom,"Anyone else read the title at first glance as, ""Steven King Must Die""?"
Kingdom,"Anybody else misread the title as ""Buttvirgins #24""?"
Kingdom,"Another one of  the ""everyone in medieval time wore brown or black, even the noble´s, it,s dark and  muddy and whitewash for walls surely is a 21th century invention"" style movies.

This one with a unique new angle of "" i may be wearing a bearskin cloak and a warriors haircut and still can´t afford any nicely made clothes but i just REALLY like expressive eye make up."""
Kingdom,Yes! One of my all time favorites Shows! Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"I read this as Steve King’s Must Die — The Last Kingdom sequel — and was simultaneously confused and excited. I’m a bit let down, but still excited to see Uhtred son of Uhtred."
Kingdom,It is my destiny to watch this.
Kingdom,"I know it's good but I just don't have the time to watch The Last Kingdom. So my question is, do you guys think I can watch this without watching the series? Can the story stand alone?"
Kingdom,"Ahh. 

Was hoping it wouldn't be him vs uthred after rewatch recently..but of course"
Kingdom,"At first very brief glance I thought it said 'Steven King Must Die' and was like hm, what's all this? 
(Yes I know it's Stephen, that's just what my brain initially did)"
Kingdom,"It''s not cinema movie, right?"
Kingdom,Thought this said Stephen King Must Die
Kingdom,"Uthred son of Uthred son of Uthred son of Uthred!

Destiny is all"
Kingdom,Wyrd bið ful aræd.
Kingdom,How was thr final season? I got rather bored 4 episodes in to the last season. Did it get better
Kingdom,"I can't help but think of the railway station in London. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven\_Kings"
Kingdom,"
No but I’d watch that too"
Kingdom,"Not really, it sort of just found its level and stayed around that for the most part."
Kingdom,I did!
Kingdom,The show doesn't make any claims to be historically accurate
Kingdom,Probably but you’ll regret it.
Kingdom,Fate is inexorable
Kingdom,Uthred of Bababba
Kingdom,Yes the nostalgia!
Kingdom,You forgot Uhtred brother of Uhtred.
Kingdom,[deleted]
Kingdom,"same, last thing i remember is there being a huge plague plotline right in the beginning of covid lol"
Kingdom,I see. That's a shame. Was one of the best shows around in its first three seasons.
Kingdom,"Im not really criticising that. Even if it looks like , i will give you that.

It´s just lazy filmmaking. Apparently film people think this drab boring costume and prop stuff has been conditioned onto the audience and they can get away with it. Probably way cheaper than paying some guys to design and make some nice looking stuff.

Any basic bbc history documentation has better looking costumes and set."
Kingdom,Did 5 get better? I watched 4 episodes and was bored. The original magic seemed gone
Kingdom,"The action felt better than GoT at times. Writing and acting was obviously a long way distant, but as a show I preferred it to GoT S4+"
Kingdom,Who knows why Hollywood decides to do what it does. My theory is the producers think it looks cooler haha
Kingdom,"I am ready for some I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred, father of Uhtred, grandfather of Uhtred, great grandfather of Uhtred.

also if Uhtred gets with Eadith in the movie, then RIP.  

you had a good run Eadith."
Kingdom,Can't wait for this. Destiny is all!
Kingdom,Maybe Uhtred will finally get a grey hair
Kingdom,"Can’t wait. The finale to s5 was an incredible closing to the story, but I’m really excited to see where this movie goes. One of my favorite series ever"
Kingdom,"I watched all five seasons in about three weeks few weeks back. What a ride, amazing show overall. Can't wait for the movie, but sad it will be the last thing made from it."
Kingdom,Uhtred son of Uhtred!
Kingdom,Awesome!
Kingdom,If you like the show then I 💯recommend reading the Books if you haven’t already!
Kingdom,"Fuck you, now I'm remembering >!Aethelflaed's death!< and how it emotionally destroyed me."
Kingdom,"Let me guess, he wants to retake Bebebbanbnburhg

Some new evil guy shows up that has a new schtick

His wife dies

Just when he's about to set off on his quest, he gets pulled into the King's politics and he has to either do him a favour, or avoid making him an enemy."
Kingdom,Destiny is all!
Kingdom,Awesome though shame to see it ending.  Best show on Netflix.
Kingdom,"Such a great show, and stayed strong till the end, I hope, unlike some others."
Kingdom,"hah love this show, it ain't no big masterpiece but surprisingly solid all the way, which is far more than many so called *prestige shows* can say since they turn to shit after the third episode. Also, Uthred and Young Uthred always made me think about Blackadder's Pitt The Younger and Pitt the Even Younger"
Kingdom,Probably the best show Netflix has ever put out.  Although I think it was a bbc show initially
Kingdom,"would you recommend this show? How would you describe it? (ex: thrones meets the sopranos)


Also if you recommend this show can you tell me some other shows you like"
Kingdom,That's some good news for once
Kingdom,Now do an adaption of the warlord chronicles
Kingdom,I had no idea this was coming. Can't wait now!
Kingdom,I need to watch this. I have read most of the books. No idea what I am waiting for.
Kingdom,SHIELD WALL
Kingdom,"Love the bit were he jumps over the shield wall and cuts them all from behind, bad ass af"
Kingdom,The series that just won't die. Strange it's on Netflix.
Kingdom,Last season blood CGI was so ugly. Please stop using bad blood CGI. Ruins it for me.
Kingdom,"Friendly reminder, nothing made by Netflix requires a Netflix account to access."
Kingdom,"Shit, keep forgetting to pick this back up."
Kingdom,Cant wait!!!
Kingdom,Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"NGL Alexander Dreymon was a bit of an acquired taste for me. Not sure why but am glad I saw it through. 

Will be looking forward to this even if half the movie is just him reading a genesis for all the Uhtreds."
Kingdom,"Funny, I was just talking about this the other day."
Kingdom,I swear the beginning of each episode with the recap and he always said that. Lmao.  That got planted in my head that if he didn't say that on the next episode. I would be disappointed lol
Kingdom,">	Also if Uhtred gets with Eadith in the movie, then RIP. 

I used to watch a show called Chicago fire with a character named Kelly Severide. For drama purposes they’d kill a character every season. I realized you could predict who it would be by whoever started dating Severide. If a character started dating him you knew they wouldn’t be around by the end of the season. They’d unintentionally made him the most tragic character in history."
Kingdom,*Loud lamenting singing begins*
Kingdom,I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg and password sharing will no longer be tolerated!
Kingdom,DESTINY IS ALL
Kingdom,"I really, really hate that translation. In the books, it’s translated as “Fate is inexorable.” Which is a slightly shortened quote from the Old English poem “The Wanderer.” It has a very different meaning."
Kingdom,How dare you! Uhtred will never show glimpse of age
Kingdom,"For real, it's been a while since I watched but doesn't the series cover like 40 something years?"
Kingdom,Wait … there’s a fifth season?! How did I miss that!?
Kingdom,"I agree! What I loved about the finale to S05 is that honestly, it could pickup for a season 6 or end right there. The Last Kingdom is, to me, a perfect show."
Kingdom,Wait a fucking minute....S5 came out ?!?!
Kingdom,Amazing finale
Kingdom,"And the the Warlord Trilogy, and the Archers tale. And Azincourt, etc. but especially the Warlord Trilogy."
Kingdom,"I recommend the books even if you don’t like the show! I couldn’t get into the show at all, it just wasn’t the same world as the one in my head from the books. Was still cool to see that there was enough interest to turn it into such a long running show!"
Kingdom,"lol, I enjoyed the show but this is pretty accurate."
Kingdom,"I hope, yeah."
Kingdom,What happened to Bebbanburg?  The show ends with him taking it.
Kingdom,"The Last Kingdom kind of ruined Vikings for me because TLK is so much richer and more detailed. There is a pattern of rug-pulling in the storylines that does become annoying, but it is a phenomenal series and easily one of the best things on Netflix."
Kingdom,Show is so good. The only show that I’ve watched through beginning to end several times. Highly recommended
Kingdom,"Absolutely. It's historical fiction, compared to GoT fantasy but both have that gritty element so if you liked that about GoT...

I think of it as Adventure television, like Robin of Sherwood, Uhtred is heroic but not always likable 

The closest comparison is probably Sharpe (which I've never seen) because Bernard Cornwell wrote both series. It's also synonymous in my mind with Poldark but that's because it was always shown about the same time of year.

What I appreciate about the show is the secondary characters, especially King Alfred and his family. There's good story arcs and relationships develop in interesting ways."
Kingdom,"It goes downhill after season 3 (after a certain character exits the show), , but overall still enjoyable with a conclusive ending."
Kingdom,"I’m also curious.  The books were great fun, and I’m a bit hesitant to watch the show in case it doesn’t live up."
Kingdom,"Shockingly good for what's a pseudo-historic swords drama. The writing is hovers around above average, and is mostly consistent. The directing is good, and the performances are generally solid. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something in the genre."
Kingdom,"I've only really watched the first season, so I can't speak too much about the rest (though I'm continuing to watch as I enjoyed the first season) but it felt... kind of like watching a playthrough of Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, which makes sense given the subject material.

It feels a little less graphic than Game of Thrones in terms of sex, though in terms of violence probably similar to it. There are a few times where the character just makes... really dumb choices, even though you can tell it's supposed to be because they're hotheaded or whatever, so it sometimes has that Shameless feel to it where the characters are doing something because plot as opposed to it feeling as organic as it could. (I'm thinking of one specific event in a church toward the end of the first season.)"
Princess Hours,"I mean yes. Most of the shows you listed are pretty average to bad and I don’t see any of the excellent TV listed from this past year:

Succession

The White Lotus

Black Bird

The Old Man

Slow Horses

Severance 

Bad Sisters

Five Days at Memorial

The Offer

Try those out, you won’t be disappointed."
Princess Hours,I'm rewatching The Deuce in the absence of anything good that's new.
Princess Hours,"This is or... *was* suppose to be the update for my [winter-spring compilation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).   
  
I think I'm gonna go back to making single posts for each review, because I've realized writing a review right after I watch a show might've given me motivation to watch a lot of these shows in the first place.  
  
Anyways, recommendations are welcome as to what 2022 show I should watch and review next, cuz I don't even know what the fuck is happening anymore (*don't be obvious tho lol*)."
Princess Hours,I've already lost it years ago. [In the late 00s](https://i.imgur.com/yv9nc8Q.png) used to watch close to 30 series a week [now I barely watch 2-3.](https://i.imgur.com/rb3Ab80.png)
Princess Hours,"Recently watched Slow Horses and Severance, both slapped."
Princess Hours,goddamn. how's the new season of Archer tho?
Princess Hours,Still decent. Not as good as the early seasons though.
Princess Hours,"Glad to see Spartacus at #1. One of the most entertaining shows I've ever watched. Andy Whitfield was fantastic. Liam McIntyre did a very nice job trying to fill in his shoes though, and the show had some great side characters and villains."
Princess Hours,"Don't get me wrong, I fucking loved Spartacus but Black Sails is hands down a better show. It's on a completely different level. "
Princess Hours,Black Sails
Princess Hours,Great review. I love Spartacus and Black Sails. Now I'm gonna have to give Outlander a try.
Princess Hours,Now who in the hell put Black Sails at 8?
Princess Hours,"The thing about Spartacus that is so underrated is the unique dialogue it had.  I guess it's not for everyone, but I loved it.  The mixing of quasi-Shakespearean rhythm with the vulgarity was just so damn amazing.

> Words fall from mouth as shit from ass."
Princess Hours,"The Girlfriend Experience introduced me to Riley Keough, and for that it's one of my favourite shows ever. I love Black Sails and Ash vs Evil Dead, and Party Down is really funny and personal too, but nothing can top The Girlfriend Experience for me."
Princess Hours,"Party Down's other downfall was losing Jane Lynch to ""Glee"" and Adam Scott to ""Parks and Rec"".  
  
I fucking love it, though. Rob Thomas did amazing things with Veronica Mars, and it was great to see so many people involved with that show involved in something completely different. "
Princess Hours,"I love *American Gods* and *Party Down*.

I still really want to check out *Black Sails* too. Maybe I should check out some of these other series though. *Outlander* sounds interesting. Thanks for the write-up."
Princess Hours,Just came to throw my support behind Spartacus. It was an extraordinary show indeed. Definitely within my top three favorite shows ever. Your appraisal does justice to the show so I won't bother adding my two cents. Starz really has some high quality shows that get criminally overlooked at the Emmys and other award events.
Princess Hours,"I'm glad to see Spartacus get some respect. It really doesn't the attention it deserves, and I'd put it at the 2nd best action show of all time, behind Buffy (with Banshee being 3rd, marred by a budget-starved final season.)

Black Sails, though... it's a show that does period politics and action better than Game of Thrones, arguably, and gets a 10th of the buzz. The naval battles look real to the point where I was left wondering how they did them. The characters were *all* complex and interesting. It's a rock-solid work of art."
Princess Hours,"I was getting upset that I didn't see Spartacus then I got to number 1 and I grinned :)

That was John Hannah's best role. It was an amazing ride and sad that Andy Whitfield lost his battle."
Princess Hours,I can't wait to see where Power goes for S4
Princess Hours,Nice write up. Appreciate the love for Flesh and Bone. Awesome show
Princess Hours,But they ruined Torchwood.
Princess Hours,"Don't shit on Survivor's Remorse. It's not winning an Emmy, but it's pretty entertaining, if you like sports. Especially in recent years as NBA and NFL prospects are getting younger and younger."
Princess Hours,I respect your write up but your list is rubbish. Differing opinions I suppose.
Princess Hours,"Black Sails is my favourite, but I've only seen half of these shows (only Outlander, The Girlfriend Experience, Flesh and Bone and Ash). I'd put it something like this:

1. Black Sails 2. The Girlfriend Experience 3. Outlander 4. Ash 5. Flesh and Bone"
Princess Hours,"I was about to say ""How the fuck did you leave out Banshee?"" but then I remembered that was Cinemax.

Nice list."
Princess Hours,"Man, Pillars of the Earth was really good. As a big fan of Follet's book (it's really, really good and you should read it if you're at all into medieval based fiction) I really had no complaints at all about Starz's adaptation... But unfortunately, the follow up miniseries, World Without End, was *terrible*.  Did Starz do that as well? I have to assume they did because (IIRC) it was all the same actors. 

I've only watched the first episode of the White Princess and thought it was only okay, roughly on par with the White Queen. A little mediocre, but I'll take it because it's set in a period I find interesting. "
Princess Hours,"1) Outlander
2) Black Sails
3) Spartacus"
Princess Hours,"As someone who has seen most of the shows on this list, Black Sails is #1 and it's not even really close at all."
Princess Hours,Great article!
Princess Hours,"Spartacus wasn't the same for me without Andy Whitfield and John Hanna, and I kind of trailed off some time in the second season.

Outlander is very good, but the violence in it is very disturbing to me, and the constant threat of violence and rape to Claire just made me stop watching (whereas the cartoonish violence of Spartacus didn't bother me). 

Ash is fine. Bruce Campbell is great. But it's kind of a bubble show for me and I never finished the first season.

I liked Girlfriend Experience and will be glad to see another season. Flesh and Bone was pretty addictive in a melodramatic way. If I were in the business, it'd be totally cringey, though.

I'm warming up to American Gods. Like Hannibal, AG gets  indulgent. At least with Hannibal, most people are familiar with the character and the show at least started out as more or less a police procedural. AG gives you very little to grasp on to for the first few episodes beside style and good performances (I did not read the book). But it's definitely not boring and I'm watching the rest. "
Princess Hours,"okay, **Survivor's Remorse** is dope and was much better than the completely ridic Flesh & Bone. (and this is coming from someone who *loves* dark & broody dance suspense...) definitely deserved a spot in the Top 10. 

"
Princess Hours,It's either going to be Outlander or American Gods.
Princess Hours,"Boss:  I thought the two seasons made where outstanding - I wish it would have lasted longer.

I am really enjoying Black Sails, Outlander, Power, and Survivor's Remorse.  "
Princess Hours,I loved Boss. I also worked near where they filmed a lot of it and Kelsey Grammer was excellent.
Princess Hours,"I love **American Gods** and **Ash vs Evil Dead**.

I tried the first couple **Black Sails** and couldn't get into it. I'll have to give it another go soon."
Princess Hours,"Of the ones I have seen, Ash vs Evil Dead is far and away their best show, adhering both to the spirit of the source material, and remaining campy and fun. It remains to be seen how long this will remain fresh and fun, but so far it's held its own. The first season is clearly better than the second, however. Though, it is fair to note I feel they've done a fantastic job so far with American Gods. But as it is only halfway through its run, it's a little early to crown it.

Black Sails is a distant runner up. I don't feel like it had the legs.  The final season was a slog, as the writing and performances just couldn't hold up under the demands of a more serious story. Ray Stevenson's screen presence and charm was entirely wasted as Blackbeard, to the point of him almost being a nonentity as the show meandered about with painfully uninteresting side plots and manufactured romances. The giddy excitement of seeing the promotional images of Stevenson as Blackbeard were entirely destroyed by how clumsily he was used. But he's not the only one. The show never manages to establish any good European antagonists once the pirates stop fighting one another. The show even abandons most of what made the first two seasons watchable and fun: the treasure hunting and sex. Watch Seasons 1 & 2, then stop.  If you're curious to see how it ends, watch *Muppet Treasure Island*.

Spartacus was good in its first season, and its prequel season, as shameless bits of excess and fun. But it's basically HBO's *Rome* with a lobotomy and an erection. The show hits a downward spiral once the gladiators are on the loose, and the show's glaring weaknesses are exposed over and over, mostly being dialog (everyone talks like a flustered, angry Yoda as the show has the actors speaking English dialog in a clumsy attempt at reproducing Latin syntax) and characters (they're mostly stupid, or unlikable, or both). The final nail in the coffin is the way the series spoiled its own decent chance at a three dimensional antagonist in Crassus.  Didn't help that the action scenes were repetitive and boring after a while, the Romans so comically inept that it became difficult to take them seriously as enemies, and the show seriously... period. At least, unlike Black Sails, they didn't abandon their cornerstones of sex and violence in the final seasons.  Watch *Blood & Sand* and *Gods of the Arena*, then skip to the last two or three episodes of the final season. It's a bonus because if you skip all the terrible slogging in the middle, you'll still care about the characters when they all die, and the battle scenes won't feel like you've seen them a dozen times already. 

The White Queen is a sad reduction of one of history's most captivating civil wars (The Wars of the Roses), distilling the story down to a flimsy soap opera, and, most unforgivably, stepping into that world (1461) *after* most of the time period's most intriguing characters have already been killed and/or driven into exile. The White Queen even chose the wrong queen to focus on, reducing the fascinating Margaret of Anjou to a Discount Cersei Lannister. I blame most of TWQ's faults on the BBC though, since this was their baby (choosing to adapt Phillipa Gregory's historical bodice rippers instead of a broader scope source material) and Starz really only said ""Add some tits for our version!"" and bought in for US distribution rights. There's really no way to make TWQ watchable. Hopefully at some point, the Wars of the Roses gets the television adaptation it deserves. "
Princess Hours,I just came here to make sure Spartacus was #1. You may live.
Princess Hours,Nice post but I still think they still yet to produce their signature show closest is the legendary show Spartacus.
Princess Hours,"Nice to see Spartacus at #1, I do think Black Sails is a tad overrated but it is far, far better than #8"
Princess Hours,"*  ash vs evil dead
*  blacksails 
*  spartacus

american gods, im not sure yet.

"
Princess Hours,Are we having fun yet?
Princess Hours,"Season 1 of Boss was a masterpiece! Kelsey Grammer even won a Golden Globe for his role. Season 2 wasn't as spectacular, but still watchable. "
Princess Hours,"I think Starz is gradually catching up with Cinemax when it comes to show quality.

Magic City was a good, and good looking show. Come to think of it. I miss it.

The Girlfriend Experience, I thought, was quietly gripping. That story was told in such a intense way that it stayed with me for days after I binged watched it. I can't wait for the new season

The first season of Spartacus was unlike anything I've ever seen. So sexy. So violent. It was amazing.

Flesh and Bone never held my attention. I tried to watch the entire season, but couldn't. The acting was great. I was pulled in by the story taking place in the ballet world. But, in the end, the episodes moved way too slow.

I have a love/hate relationship with Power. I keep watching because I'm curious to see what happens with these characters, but yet there's a certain something missing with this show. It doesn't feel high quality to me.

Thank you for this post. I hadn't really thought about, nor fully appreciated, the hidden gems that have come from Starz.
"
Princess Hours,How the hell did you forget to mention Boss? It was short lived but for a political series it was on another level than House Of Cards.
Princess Hours,American Gods deserves to be up there 
Princess Hours,American Gods is prob my favorite show on tv right now
Princess Hours,Gratitude for putting Spartacus #1....
Princess Hours,"Great write-up. I'm currently going through Black Sails and just started season 2, really liking it so far. I have to admit that I'm completely obsessed with Outlander though. That show is probably my favorite on tv, besides GoT. I love how it follows the books very closely. I'm also really enjoying The White Princess, though I don't like how it actually skips the War of the Roses. I'm also sad that it'll end before Henry the 8th becomes king, but I guess I'll just have to rewatch The Tudors for that piece of history."
Princess Hours,Magic City was an amazing show with amazing talent.  Glad to see it got some love.  Spartacus was great.  Deserves to be number one.
Princess Hours,"Starz has some great shows but, since they lost their contract with Disney for movies, their movie selection has been shit and the Lionsgate deal does not seem to have improved the situation. I'm really only keeping the channel for ""American Gods"" and ""Outlander""."
Princess Hours,"Magic City was fuckin awesome.  Still boggles my mind why the hell they cancelled it, makes no damn sensr"
Princess Hours,"Kinda ironic you wrote this, I remember reading this a few weeks ago! "
Princess Hours,Surprised you didn't mention Torchwood:Miracle Day at all.
Princess Hours,"Surprised you didn't mention Olga Kurylenko; she looked absolutely stunning in Magic City. I really liked the first season, but season 2 focused more on the parts that I didn't really care for, so I'd probably put it a bit lower and Black Sails higher. "
Princess Hours,Thanks for putting this together! I've only watched Ash vs. Evil Dead and American Gods and I've been meaning to get into Flesh & Bones and recently I've been wondering what else the network has to offer. When I need a new show to watch I'll look back at this list and pick one up!
Princess Hours,I'm surprised that none of y'all mentioned Da Vinci's Demons. It was an impressive show
Princess Hours,"I'd like to see you do one for HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax as well"
Princess Hours,"Wish more people watched this, at least the first season. It was kind of ""bad"" and hard to get through the first episode but I'm so glad I stuck through that episode. First season was one of the most satisfying contained seasons I've seen."
Princess Hours,"I loved it also, to me John Hannah and the political stories and backstabbing is what really made it special. Even on the very low budget the first season had (13 million for the first season IIRC), which was almost the same amount as a single episode of Rome the people were comparing it to at the time. 
While the differences were obvious with most of Spartacus being shot on a sound stage and rome building massive sets, it was the engrossing story that kept us coming back.

[Jupiter's Cock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5MS7MCHRjM)"
Princess Hours,I would love a Spartacus style Genghis Khan show.
Princess Hours,Black Sails is #2 behind Spartacus for me.
Princess Hours,"It would seem that for some, sex and nudity are more important to telling a good story than an actual good story."
Princess Hours,"I've only seen through season 2 (spoilers up to that point to follow)    
...    
but the things it does wrong is a great reverse example of why game of thrones is so good. [spoiler](#s ""because people generally don't die, the danger is less exciting.  But even more importantly, the plots start getting twisted and incestuous.  Sometimes people seem to align for no other reason beyond ""well, without permanent consequences, there are so many different ways to align the same group of characters, and this combination is next"" "")    
     
Additionally, I don't know if it's for budget reasons or what, but at times the pacing is quite slow."
Princess Hours,"Every aspect of Spartacus felt uniquely fitting to its identity. I don't think any other show has felt as defined before. The special effects that started out criticized as low-quality eventually evolved into its own iconic style. You could post any frame of it and recognize it.

Likewise, as you mentioned, every line of dialog would be equally recognizable. The only other show I can think of with such distinct dialog is ""Justified."""
Princess Hours,"I thought Megan Mullaly was a more than adequate replacement, and almost liked her character more. Doing a season without Adam Scott as Henry would have been pointless and infuriating though. Unless they somehow got Paul Rudd in the cast like originally planned (he was supposed to be Henry) "
Princess Hours,I thought it was already cancelled for quite awhile before Adam Scott even joined Parks and Rec...
Princess Hours,"Black Sails is great, just know that the first season is fairly slow until the back half of the episodes. After season one is where it really gets going though."
Princess Hours,you're welcome. I actually wrote this 2 weeks before American Gods premiered. It'd definitely be at least top 5 on this list the show has been fantastic so far and if it continues down this path might be the next hit series for starz. 
Princess Hours,I love a lot f the other shows but I'm about to tap out on American Gods. Taking one of the least interesting and most unlikable minor characters and stretching her into the second lead was a terrible idea.
Princess Hours,"To be fair, it would have been impossible to top Children of Earth. Still...Miracle Day. Yikes."
Princess Hours,"Agreed, but even without the caveats. It's just a good show. *Survivor's Remorse* should definitely be on this list."
Princess Hours,how would u do it? 
Princess Hours,"He is right about Spartacus at number one, but the rest would just appear completely randomly ordered."
Princess Hours,I thought Pillars of the Earth was awful and a poor adaptation of the book. It felt rushed and was nothing like I'd imagine it when I originally read. 
Princess Hours,"World Without End had completely different actors, actually."
Princess Hours,"Yeah, I don't see how black sails can draw people in within a couple episodes. Usually people start liking it at the end of season 1 or definitely the beginning of s2. But, it's definitely worth it since s1 doesn't have that many episodes."
Princess Hours,Spartacus is a far more intelligent show than Rome. 
Princess Hours,"Yes, but it does look like American Gods is preparing to step into that role."
Princess Hours,"> I think Starz is gradually catching up with Cinemax when it comes to show quality.

Honestly, I think they're past Showtime at this point. They probably have the second-most subscriptions behind HBO so I guess it shouldn't be all that surprising, should one agree."
Princess Hours,"on tvserieshub blog site? yea, I wrote it. "
Princess Hours,How is that ironic?
Princess Hours,"That wouldn't be on the ""best of"" list though... "
Princess Hours,With showtime they would all just be #5.
Princess Hours,"Spartacus is easily one of the best TV shows I've ever seen, even with the comically over done splashing blood. They nail two things so, so right - the characters and the fights. And both of those elevate that series into the greats. "
Princess Hours,"Episode 4 of the first season is probably the best example of ""WTF?! Did this show just get GOOD?"" that I've ever seen.

I had been rinsing it out to everyone I knew for months, but I'd always read about ""Just stick with it until eps 4 or 5 and you'll be in"".

And yeah, that was how it was."
Princess Hours,Then Pits is where the series took a turn for the better.
Princess Hours,"Watch the film Mongol, it's brilliant although not as over the top as Spartacus."
Princess Hours,Netflix's Marcopolo is essentially that. I think the ruler in that is Genghis's grandson.
Princess Hours,but Black Sails has sex/nudity AND a good story
Princess Hours,No idea what show you watched but the only safe character were Billy Biceps and Silver really. Almost everyone else was fair game and plenty of them actually died.
Princess Hours,"You've inadvertently explained why Game of Thrones is soapy fluff: Literally all it is is the pornography of ""event"" television popularised by and now cut'n'pasted into this 'prestige' series.

The writers had no idea where their story was going from the beginning, and so they've come out with a product that is gigantic portions of raw plot table-setting for events that may or may never come, a drizzling of tits and most importantly, a big ultra-violence set piece every 4 or 5 episodes to keep the plot ticking along - exactly like soaps do every season. Characters never have any real arcs because they're either always killed before they can be resolved (or more likely because killing the character is the only way they could be resolved - just like in soaps). The next helping of plot is then created by having other characters react to that violence - and so it continues, forever. And the sparseness of the setting means that groups of characters are isolated in bubbles in disparate locations across the map to pursue their individual stories (just like in soaps).

Black Sails by contrast is an exemplar of tightness and focus. The writers knew exactly where the story would end up from episode one - so the pacing throughout is deliberate and serves the needs of the story, not the titillation of the audience always hunting for the next cool death or awesome explosion. The story itself is as much the tale of one community as it is the personal arcs of the characters, so the fact that no one character's actions can happen without consequences for every other character is something that is very real in each episode (where it is very abstract and uncertain in GoT). Thus conflict is born in a natural and organic way, from character's beliefs and their consequent actions - and not from fantastical external causes like ice zombies or ill-defined and childish desires to be the king for the sake of being powerful.

Game of Thrones should be cautionary tale for any writer: A great writer knows how to put his characters through the wringer and bring them out the other side; changed, but alive. A great writer writes because they have a point to make, not because they enjoy genre tropes and thought ""I could do something with that"". And great stories end. That's how you know they're a story. Now I can give GoT the benefit of the doubt with this one, but the source material doesn't really give a good impression. If George Martin knew what he was doing, it would be three books, not six and counting."
Princess Hours,"> The only other show I can think of with such distinct dialog is ""Justified.""

Deadwood.  And Firefly.  I love how all of those shows use language in such creative ways."
Princess Hours,"The first half of season 3 is also very slow, but still worth sailing through."
Princess Hours,black sails as 8th is simply absurd
Princess Hours,lolno
Princess Hours,It might but it will take a while to find its footing.
Princess Hours,That's cool!
Princess Hours,"Good point but the poster seemed interested in talking about successful and failed shows, Torchwood just has an interesting background for Starz."
Princess Hours,"I love Spartacus. My all time fave of favorite shows.

i honestly would love another Roman epic shot in a similar vein.

Also it should star Lucy Lawless and Jon Hannah again, lewd, rude and shrewd.

I'd like to see Starz take on I Claidius or the end of the republic and rise of the Empire.

Theres so much potential."
Hoff the Record,Has anyone seen The Hoff in Piranha 3DD? He plays himself and it was seriously funny. Then again I was pretty high. Not sure what that has to do with this...but there you go.
Hoff the Record,"Which begs the question, “how bored were 900,000 people?”"
Hoff the Record,"Funny after years of people moaning BCS never won an award, it won a bunch and barely anyone on the internet even cares."
Hoff the Record,These awards show were already on a decline but Covid absolutely killed any lingering positivity they might have had. Literally no one except industry people would care if they were gone altogether. Yea you can still handle them out and do like report of who won but viewership will continue to decline
Hoff the Record,Nobody cares about award shows!  When you gonna figure this out. It’s just a giant party where everybody pats themselves on the back for 3 hours and we’re not invited.
Hoff the Record,That's more than almost all their shows usually get. I expected a 5 figure number.
Hoff the Record,"I mean, at the end of the day televised awards shows are in some ways artifacts of a culture where there was way less available for you to distract yourself with, and now we're in a culture where there's almost too much. Record low ratings is the norm, nothing new here. I think they should be aired somewhere, though, and I guess it might as well be the least-important broadcast network."
Hoff the Record,"> The Critics Choice Awards aired Sunday night without much fanfare. **The CW’s broadcast of the 28th annual ceremony drew just 900,000 viewers**, according to early Nielsen numbers.


> That’s a slight dip from last year, when the broadcast took home an audience of 1.1M, which falls in line with **every other awards show telecast losing viewers over the past few years. On Tuesday, NBC’s broadcast of the Golden Globes brought in the lowest ratings ever for the ceremony.**"
Hoff the Record,Which proves that the majority of viewers are sick of this self-aggrandizing kind of TV awards show BS across the board.
Hoff the Record,I forgot the CCA even existed.
Hoff the Record,Maybe they shouldn't have put it on the CW.
Hoff the Record,"Repeat this for every awards show for the past few years, and for the next few as well until they go to streaming or change something else. The one exception might be the Oscars this year, but only while they perform Naatu Naatu."

Hoff the Record,"He was a real piece of shit with how he treated his 6 kids, his girlfriend 

Glad he s dead"
Hoff the Record,Coolio was still alive?! Futurama is still on the air?!
Hoff the Record,Worlds colliding
Hoff the Record,RIP kwanza bot
Hoff the Record,Kwanza-bot right?
Hoff the Record,Kwanzaabot's power switch went from ON to OFF. Rest well.
Hoff the Record,If not for him who’s going to pass out these books; What The Hell is Kwanzaa?
Hoff the Record,"There's another season? But that's... good news, everyone!"
Hoff the Record,Rest In Peace coolio
Hoff the Record,YESSSSS
Hoff the Record,that shows still going..?
Hoff the Record,"Wait, Futurama is back again!?"
Hoff the Record,He old ? How’d this happen?
Hoff the Record,I figured this would be the case and was just waiting for the announcement. Glad to know my hunch was right.
Hoff the Record,"Damn, I didn’t even know he died."
Hoff the Record,"He crafted the theme of Kenan and Kel, the hook of that song still holds up today. RIP the legend"
Hoff the Record,"As if Futurama didn’t see your future self upset that our brother robot had such an obvious cameo.

We need Black Dynabot and all will be complete."
Hoff the Record,Idk if I’m ready to have my heart ripped out Jurassic Bark style over Kwanzabot man.
Hoff the Record,The news we need to see
Hoff the Record,Kwa-zang!
Hoff the Record,Ok all I’m hearing is new futurama which is some damn good news to me
Hoff the Record,Yes the new Futurama will be on Hulu☺️! I so didn’t want to get another Netflix subscription.
Hoff the Record,Oh man
Legend of the Prince,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
Legend of the Prince,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
Legend of the Prince,Anime Watchers: What gap??
Legend of the Prince,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
Legend of the Prince,Undone was the shit
Legend of the Prince,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
Legend of the Prince,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
Legend of the Prince,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
Legend of the Prince,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
Legend of the Prince,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
Legend of the Prince,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
Legend of the Prince,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
Legend of the Prince,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
Legend of the Prince,Huge gap??
Legend of the Prince,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
Legend of the Prince,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
Legend of the Prince,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
Legend of the Prince,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
Legend of the Prince,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
Legend of the Prince,This show is so amazing
Legend of the Prince,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
Legend of the Prince,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
Legend of the Prince,What gap ?
Legend of the Prince,So many better shows than vox.
Legend of the Prince,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
Legend of the Prince,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
Legend of the Prince,Second season is even better than the first one.
Legend of the Prince,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

Legend of the Prince,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
Legend of the Prince,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
Legend of the Prince,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
Legend of the Prince,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
Legend of the Prince,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
Legend of the Prince,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
Legend of the Prince,Best show of the year so far
Legend of the Prince,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
Legend of the Prince,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."
Legend of the Prince,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
Legend of the Prince,Arcane is amazing.
Legend of the Prince,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
Legend of the Prince,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens.

Legend of the Prince,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
Legend of the Prince,What’s the show about?
Legend of the Prince,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
Legend of the Prince,Primal was fucking great too
Legend of the Prince,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
Legend of the Prince,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
Legend of the Prince,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
Legend of the Prince,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
Legend of the Prince,[deleted]
Legend of the Prince,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
Legend of the Prince,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
Legend of the Prince,RIP Pantheon.
Legend of the Prince,Arcane?
Legend of the Prince,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
Legend of the Prince,Don’t forget King of the Hill
Legend of the Prince,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
Legend of the Prince,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
Legend of the Prince,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
Legend of the Prince,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
Legend of the Prince,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
Legend of the Prince,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
Legend of the Prince,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
Legend of the Prince,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are “hundred year old demons” or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end “but it was a boy in a girls body.” Fucking pervs."
Legend of the Prince,Shows that don’t have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show’s total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
Legend of the Prince,Cartoons
Legend of the Prince,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
Legend of the Prince,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
Legend of the Prince,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge…"
Legend of the Prince,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
Legend of the Prince,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
Legend of the Prince,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren’t corpo shills telling them, “no, we can’t have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.” They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
Legend of the Prince,"See I’ve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn’t expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that’s exactly what it delivered."
Legend of the Prince,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero’s moving through still shots? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
Legend of the Prince,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
Legend of the Prince,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
Legend of the Prince,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
Legend of the Prince,This is true the animation isnt great
Legend of the Prince,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
Legend of the Prince,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
Legend of the Prince,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
Legend of the Prince,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
Legend of the Prince,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
Legend of the Prince,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
Legend of the Prince,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
Legend of the Prince,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
Legend of the Prince,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
Legend of the Prince,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
Legend of the Prince,"Let’s be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it’s the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn’t The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it’s a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they’ve made flop, so they aren’t even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
Legend of the Prince,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
Legend of the Prince,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
Legend of the Prince,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
Legend of the Prince,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
Legend of the Prince,I know who critical role are but I've never seen anything from them. I loved the show.
The Night Shift,You can stream it on stod2.is (you need a subscription) but there are also icelandic torrents sonewhere
The Night Shift,"In other news, ""The Night Shift"" was on the air for 4 seasons"
The Night Shift,I watched almost two seasons on Netflix as background noise and it wasn’t even good background noise. I ended up just dropping it.
The Night Shift,"Awww man, I liked that show 😔"
The Night Shift,What's the night shift?
The Night Shift,"It's ""Cut-price 'Code Black'"", but still watchable. Too many changes of potentially decent characters, while some boring ones were kept around."
The Night Shift,Seriously! The what shift? never heard of it!
The Night Shift,A show on NBC which was cancelled after 4 seasons.
The Night Shift,It's a shift in which people work at night.
The Night Shift,"I've been looking at watching this. I have an odd interest in network medical dramas and was wondering how this holds up against Grey's, Chicago Med and Code Black.

Anyone watching this?"
The Night Shift,"This was the show with the cast photo with the motorcycle in the hallway, right?"
The Night Shift,"I really enjoy it, it's alot more like Er and house but it's really good. Some of the storylines are a bit far fetched but overall it's worth a watch "
The Night Shift,"Like you, I'm a sucker for medical dramas. It's no more cheesy than Grey's or Chicago Med. I've been watching The Night Shift since season 1. It is what it is - overly soapy and cliche, but the characters are likable and it's a fun show that's easy to enjoy if you don't go scratching the surface too hard. You've got your main ""bad boy"" doc that doesn't play by the rules, the standard love triangle stuff - things you'd expect to see in a summer doctor show. I realize this isn't exactly a ""ringing"" endorsement, but for what it's worth, it's kept me hooked through three seasons and this is one of my shows that I watch when it airs and not later."
The Night Shift,"Yeah, the one when it was launched that was on everyone's list of terrible shows that would get cancelled quickly. "
The Night Shift,"IIRC, it was one of those shows that was announced as ""midseason"" but kept getting pushed back, so it looked like NBC wasn't expecting it to survive, either. They've had a few surprise hits that way,

IIRC, that was the summer Undatable was treated similarly and it did well enough until NBC decided to air it in the fall."
The Night Shift,So when does it become funny?
The Night Shift,The actor that plays Georg(The Lenin looking fella) was the mayor of Reykjavík(capital of Iceland) for four years.
The Night Shift,Meh what did I expect
The Night Shift,"I watched this series on BBC 4 a couple of years ago and have finally found someone who has uploaded the series with english subtitles. Also seems like the two other series have been uploaded as well.

I really recommend everyone check this out! "
The Night Shift,"Humour is subjective....

But the 3rd sentance of the opening scene is;
*Whilst on the phone to a cleaning contractor complaining about the current cleaner*
""Urine covers the walls and stool stains in the toilet bowls!""
""You know full well what 'stool stains' are, Kjartan!""

I was hooked within the first minute.
"
The Night Shift,"Wow, thanks OP!

I've only watched the first 3'min (before the credits) but I had to stop to say, ""thanks."" This looks like a hidden gem.

P.S. Let me know if you ever run across the complete *Sto Para Pente* with subtitles."
The Night Shift,"I've downloaded it a few times via torrents, but they never have it in english subtitles.  I heard that it was shown in the UK with subtitles though.  I'd love to watch this series too if there is a version out there with subtitles."
The Night Shift,"Right here[http://nammi.is/nturvaktin-dvd-p-873.html?zenid=c8f8ea04ee83af7c68ab4555ca654520] they also have the other two series, and the movie Bjarnfreðarson.

If you like Icelandic humour, you might also want to check out this[http://nammi.is/sdma-reykjavk-p-1219.html?zenid=c8f8ea04ee83af7c68ab4555ca654520] movie, which is hailed by many as the best Icelandic comedy of all time."
The Night Shift,"The BBC showed it at the end of last year, I think it was. I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately they didn't show the second or third series, possibly due to low ratings. It was never advertised as far as I could see. A real shame."
The Night Shift,"Hi, I'm curious, what's the movie you are referring to? the second link is dead  
(also, the first link is also dead. Is there another way to watch the show?)"
The Night Shift,Just curious - have you been able to find Næturvaktin with English subtitles?
The Night Shift,"Nope. I have abandoned search a long time ago. If you do happen to stumble upon it somewhere, do send a link"
The Night Shift,"Will do.

I found that Amazon UK used to sell a DVD version. I wish someone who has a copy could rip it and put on YouTube for posterity."
The Night Shift,"I hope I'm wrong.....but I belive the first season had no English subtitles on the dvd, but the second and 3rd did"
The Night Shift,Good to know. Thank you.
The Night Shift,"It has averaged a 1.0 18-49 for the 11 episodes we have ratings for in season 3. For a summer show (meaning much lower ratings expectations) that is more than acceptable for at least another season or 2. 

Hell, half of NBC's FALL line up last season barely beat a 1.0. Many shows didn't. 

I would say nothing to worry about here."
The Night Shift,NBC gets a lot of shit but they have a lot of these shows that slip under the radar (whether you like them or not). They've found a decent niche with procedurals.
The Night Shift,"The only Monday-Thursday show on NBC's fall line-up last season that fell below a 1.0 was The Player. Even the other canceled fall shows- Heroes Reborn, Mysteries of Laura, NPH's live show- never fell below a 1.0. This isn't Fox. NBC has actually become pretty respectable."
The Night Shift,"I may have misspoke when I referred to Fall only and did not include mid-season. But I am not completely wrong.

Truth Be Told - 0.59 average - Fall

But yes, if I had included mid-season shows, that number would jump significantly.

EDIT: Forgot that was a Friday show, but I think my point still stands. Look at the averages for the shows you mentioned and most were barely above a 1.0 (as in less than a 0.5 above).

Good catch though, appreciate the correction.



 "
The Night Shift,Very bad indeed lol. It'll be cancelled soon enough.
The Night Shift,"Sony reportedly bundled The Blacklist, a show NBC really wanted, with The Night Shift, Welcome to the Family and season 5 of Community."
The Night Shift,"I saw a clip from the pilot and it was enough for me. I really, really want a drama set in a hospital but I could tell this was terrible when the scene they showed off was Mr. Money Guy arguing with Heroic Doctor about how much a life-saving treatment cost the hospital. The conversation of course ended with Heroic Doctor punching Money Guy in the face."
The Night Shift,We've had House and we've had Scrubs. We need another scripted hospital show like we need another cop show.
The Night Shift,The ACLS video I have to watch every 2 years has better acting than this show.
The Night Shift,You are spot on. Every cliche in the book was featured in the first 20 mins. Now David E Kelly has lost his way as far as I'm concerned but he could still shit a better script than this
The Night Shift,So like [this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlxUmrPH2d4)
The Night Shift,But those were great shows. You're assuming another great hospital show can't be done because they've all been done already?
The Night Shift,"And ER, Chicago Hope, General Hospital, Grey's Anatomy, etc...  


Enough already. "
The Night Shift,"Exactly. Imagine a show like Scrubs, where an actual doctor spaces out and talks to himself, where a janitor harasses consistently a member of the medical staff, where a horny surgeon keeps on sexually assaulting everyone he meets- and there are no consequences... but done in a completely straight faced manner instead as a comedy. That's this show.

But the best part here is a doctor who practices MMA. Because, apparently, hand damage is not that big of a problem for somebody who works with their hands. And it's not a comedy. Gold. "
The Night Shift,"At least that moment had a lot building up to it. This was just the first episode, and I guess viewers are expected to believe nothing will happen because he's the cool doctor and they cant just get rid of him."
The Night Shift,"Pretty much. There's little to no room for innovation. It would really surprise me to see a good different hospital show within the next 10 years, unless it contains a pretty big twist."
The Night Shift,Also how many football games have they played? Cancel the NFL already for crying out loud.
The Night Shift,I actually agree a bit. They were great shows but there has been a ton of other good and bad hospital shows. It's a theme that has been played out. The only way a hospital show will find a foot hold on TV is if the whole genre died out for awhile then made a resurgence. 
The Night Shift,You think House or Scrubs were innovative? That's kind of weird. There were hospital and other thematically similar shows before them too. I mean... House is based on Sherlock Holmes... it's not innovate to exchange crimes scenes and bad guys for hospitals and diseases.
The Night Shift,"Believe: meh, no idea where it's going.

Crisis: plot holes, bad CGI, might watch ep 2. 

The Night Shift: didn't watch it, looked boring. "
The Night Shift,"Plan on checking out Crisis (Gillian Anderson, of coz...)   The others didnt really interest me at first glance.

*edit* watched it.  Very meh.  Might watch another ep, might not, but stupidity level was high."
The Night Shift,"Believe: Pilot was decent, no idea where they're gonna go for a season arc. Also they changed the showrunner like 3 times, which doesn't bode well.

The Night Shift: hospital ensemble drama #23452. Might be worth watching in summer when there's nothing good on.

Crisis: meh."
The Night Shift,"Belief could be good depends on which direction they take it. I could see it getting very boring if the kid goes from town to town making people happy, preventing errors from being done. It would just get really sappy and repititious. Could go another route though. We'll see.

Crisis. so-so. Might be okay, but there are plot holes galore. Just one, are to believe that the US only has 1 ""unhackable"" drone? Send several more where the one was shut down.

Haven't seen the medical drama yet. Or rather haven't seen this particular medical drama before. Have seen several before of course. Highly doubt this one will go the others haven't already gone"
The Night Shift,"Update: Watched Believe. It's pretty good, better than Crisis and I really like the main male protagonist. It's kind of like the Fox drama Touch, except if Kiefer Sutherland's character was replaced by Sawyer from Lost. Fun watch though. "
The Night Shift,"I was delightfully surprised by the pilot.  Seriously, I see the cheese, but I like it! I'm not saying I won't hate this by episode 9, but I can't wait for episode two.  "
The Night Shift,"> Crisis. so-so. Might be okay, but there are plot holes galore. Just one, are to believe that the US only has 1 ""unhackable"" drone? Send several more where the one was shut down.

And why does it drop like a brick and not glide for a bit?"
The Night Shift,Fun crossover with New Girl. Liked it.
The Night Shift,[deleted]
The Night Shift,[deleted]
The Night Shift,It was like way too cringeworthy.
The Night Shift,How does this compare to other hospital shows? What does it compare to - Greys or ER? 
The Night Shift,"I think it's definitely more light-hearted than ER and Grey's, but it's not a comedy like Scrubs. It's a drama, but there have been some pretty funny moments.

Edit: I guess the closest show I can think of is another that Jill Flint was on: Royal Pains. Not necessarily a hospital show, but it has a similar tone."
The Night Shift,"> It's a drama, but there have been some pretty funny moments.  
  
The show would be a little more tolerable if it didn't violently whiplash between comedy and drama every thirty seconds. The Mary Sue protagonist doesn't exactly help either."
The Night Shift,I find it sufficiently entertaining for this time of year in spite of the cheese. I love Freddy Rodriguez and Brendan Fehr so they're easily my favorite on the show. And my problems with Jill Flint's character are the same problems I had with her on Royal Pains so...
The Night Shift,"Title should be ""The Ninth Seat""."
The Night Shift,... I thought this series ended?
The Night Shift,It was not very good last season. Here's hoping they learned from they're mistakes.
The Night Shift,The epic return of Motorcycle Doctor!
The Night Shift,I honestly don't see how that's a problem.
The Night Shift,"ehmergerde Becky they don't have a perfect face, never even gonna give it chance"
The Night Shift,"Honest opinion on *The Player* tidbit? :)

> The Player (formerly Endgame) hails from the John Fox and John Davis' Davis Entertainment and Sony Pictures Television. Set in the high-stakes world of Las Vegas, a the drama revolves around a former sniper-turned-security expert (Strike Back's Philip Winchester) who is drawn into a mysterious conspiracy that forces him to complete a series of heroic challenges in order to save innocent lives. Wesley Snipes co-stars in the drama that was considered a lock heading into this week and had been already staffing. John Rogers (The Librarians) penned the script and exec produces the drama, which has been earning rave reviews for star Winchester.

Also, what say you about *Game of Silence*?

> Game of Silence, considered a dark cable-type drama, marks CSI alum Carol Mendelsohn's first drama series under her new overall deal with Sony Pictures Television, with Universal Television boarding the series as a co-production. The show, which sources say is a 10-episode commitment, is based on the Turkish format Suskunlar and centers on a rising attorney (Revolution's David Lyons) on the brink of success who could lose his perfectly crafted life when his long-lost childhood friends unexpectedly reappear after 25 years. When a dark secret resurfaces, the brotherhood bands together to right the wrongs of their shared past, pushing the limits of their loyalty and quenching their thirst for revenge. Larenz Tate and Michael Raymond-James co-star in the drama penned by David Hudgins (Parenthood, Friday Night Lights). Mendelsohn, Julie Weitz and director Niels Arden Oplev exec produce. "
The Night Shift,"I'd like to think that after the series finale James and Miles travelled from small town to small town hunting ghosts, conning cons, and buddy-copping their way to success.

Call it ""Bonjour LaFleur""."
The Night Shift,"Damn. I would have watched that in a heartbeat. Miles and Sawyer were some of my favorite characters in the show. 

And Leung is so underrated as an actor."
The Night Shift,"I'll see you in another life, brothah."
The Night Shift,His character’s argument with Hurley about time travel was my favourite part of the whole series.
The Night Shift,"I’m honestly a little shocked that they left that franchise alone. No spin-offs, no prequels, no sequels. Just one classic series standing on its own."
The Night Shift,"I would have watched the shit out of that. 


Still would"
The Night Shift,"It amazes me that even to this day, every LOST thread will have people claiming ""they were dead and in purgatory"" the whole time. Not only do people say this, but they say it with such confidence.

It's not even like it's a matter of whether or not you understand the ending. This idea was directly refuted with a line of dialogue in the finale...in the most important scene! I guess these people just weren't paying attention...to the most important scene of the finale?!?!?!

Seriously, WTF people?"
The Night Shift,Always remember him from Rush Hour
The Night Shift,This reminds me of the comedy drama about two retired spies/assassins that we almost got starring Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson. Still wish that could've been a thing
The Night Shift,"Horseshit, but I would have watched the crap out of that show.

And he's right about the Asian stereotyping.

Unfortunately, he'll have to wait until the boomers start dying for the Calgon horseshit to truly end.

The boys had a pretty good joke about it. 

""Soldier Boy: Where's the Chop Socky Oriental sauce?   
  
Hughie: They don't have that anymore  
  
Soldier Boy: Why the fuck not?   
  
Hughie: Uh, many... many good reasons""

It was just casual and accepted, ""haha, hollywood is racist!""

The Hawaii 5-0 shit was jaw dropping. Treating them like half a person. As if stupid vampire show man and nepotism hire were actually worth more than the two people who carried the show.   


Poor Grace Park had to sell bing like her life depended on it."
The Night Shift,Wonder how this show holds up on a rewatch. Blew me away when it aired.
The Night Shift,LOST SEQUEL WHEN!? Come on D+ give us what we want!
The Night Shift,Why are his characters always pissed off?
The Night Shift,###Maybe include Sayid.
The Night Shift,That would have been awesome.
The Night Shift,Love a good lost moment brotha
The Night Shift,I haven't watched this show in 10 years and have a really bad memory. Can someone remind me what connection their 2 characters had?
The Night Shift,"It's probably not as impactful now, with so much foreign TV at our fingertips on streaming.  But back in 2004 it was pretty wild to have a main character on an major American TV show who didn't speak any English."
The Night Shift,"I am re-watching the Mission Impossible franchise, and when I got to Ghost Protocol, I'd totally forgotten that the film opens up with Josh Holloway as an IMF agent that gets killed. It made me want to see more of that character and of Josh Holloway in good roles.

Also, I really enjoyed Ken Leung in Person of Interest."
The Night Shift,"Nobody can replicate true detective 

Not even true detective"
The Night Shift,"In the book Under The Dome Stephen King writes about the characters watching a l
LOST spin-off called The Hunted Ones. I wonder if he had an inside scoop on this project before it was canceled."
The Night Shift,Would love. That guy was so entertaining in the sopranos
The Night Shift,They should have made it even if it wasnt connected to lost
The Night Shift,That would have been awesome. Dudes a great actor who deserves more chances.
The Night Shift,Just make a true detective season 3 name them sawyer and miles and just never acknowledge it.
The Night Shift,Been awhile since I've seen such a toxic comment section.  Do people really feel the need to hurl personal insults and belittle people they don't even know?  Are people really so insecure that someone not liking a TV show they like is an excuse to be so bitter?
The Night Shift,"My wife and I are about to finish a rewatch of the series and when that episode of Sawyer and Miles came on I made a crack similar to this article. While a spin off wouldn’t work, I think a show with those two would of been interesting to watch. Ken and Josh have good chemistry and it fit very well in police drama setting.

Along with those two I would of loved to see Terry O’Quinn (Locke) and Michael Emerson (Ben) in another show together. They also had amazing chemistry and seemed to bring the best out of each other on screen."
The Night Shift,I would've watched it. Miles had one of the best storylines for being a secondary character.
The Night Shift,"His character is probably one of my favorite lowkey LOST characters.  He never really seems to break into the main LOST stars, but he's got such a full character history and it's interesting with his ties to Dharma and the island and the superpower he has.

He's also pretty unique as a character because you usually have characters that are smartasses (like Sawyer) or comic relief (like Hurley) or serious/tragic (like a lot of them), and his character is impossible to pin down as a particular thing.  He's likeable and good but also unlikeable and bad at the same time.  It makes him one of the more realistic characters on the show too (despite talking to the dead)."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,as a long time fan of chris rock that special was absolute dog water until the last 10 minutes. its even funnier when you can see from the look on his face when he realized he was losing the audience half the time lmao

Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Getting slapped is the best thing to happen to him financially in a long time.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,His special about his divorce sucked too. Love Rick but yeah these aren't great
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Netflix hooked him up with the same promotion as Chappelles canceled tour. Enough people tuned in for that one so I'm sure they'll give him a few more and maybe he can do some touch up.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"He opens with that tired, boomer shit of not being able to say anything anymore, triggering folks & “words don’t hurt”. The dude is literally saying whatever he wants on his own Netflix special. He can clearly say whatever he wants."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,It was unfortunately a really weak special.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Those two tables tell you everything you need about why Netflix subscriber counts are tanking.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I am pretty tired of hearing rich people on stage complain that they're being silenced.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,This comment tell you everything you need about how out of touch with reality reditors are.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Your account got hacked bruh
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"My grandfather was a member of the easy company. He joined as a replacement just before they got to Bastogne. He wrote in a journal through the entire experience and I have memories of him typing up all of his handwritten journal entries onto a computer in the early 90’s. 

Stephen Ambrose used a lot of his personal reflections as reference material for his books. Unfortunately, he passed in 1996 but when the mini series premiered in 2001, HBO flew my grandmother, mother, and her sisters out to Paris to join for the premiere in Normandy. 

I am so extremely proud to be his granddaughter and wish I had more time with him to ask questions as I was only 6 when he passed. My husband and I took a trip to Bastogne and the Jacques Woods/Ardenne Forest in 2016 and it was incredibly emotional and surreal! The fox holes are still there and the energy is hard to describe. 

The series is so well done and I feel so lucky to have something I can watch whenever I want to remind me of everything he and his peers went through at such young ages."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Band of brothers is one of the few series I’ve watched multiple times. I absolutely love everything about it.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The moment that sealed it for me was after the Bastogne campaign, where they’re all sitting in the church and listening to the choir. As the names of the dead and injured are read out, they start to slowly fade away one by one…"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Want to see me cry like a baby? Play the interviews at the end of the last episode, ending with Major Winters “… but I served in a company of heroes.” 😭"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"I rewatch it every year, absolute masterpiece!"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"“Masters of the Air” about the strategic bombing campaign is airing on Apple TV+ this year. It’s the third in the trilogy produced by Spielberg/Hanks: BoB, the Pacific, and Masters of the Air."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Sobel may have been the asshole he was portrayed as in the show (though fwiw his family have come out and very publicly claimed he was not) but he did not deserve what happened to him in real life, suoer tragic"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"It was a great example of something only HBO could make. Some stories are better told as mini-series as well, but they are so expensive to make that we just avoid making them in the US.

Netflix burned a lot of bridges the last 4 years when cancelling many of their series. It has become such an issue many folks won't give Netflix series a try as they don't want to get invested only to be left with no closure. They should move to doing mini-series for a while to regain trust and tell the stories other networks won't invest in telling because of no multi-season/franchise potential."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Just thinking of the Bastogne episode makes me cold.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Watch Generation War next.  It's from the German perspective and hits even harder.  

Don't sleep on The Pacific either, obviously.  All three give their own unique perspective of the war."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"I'm almost 100% sure that this is the case, but I can't believe this hasn't been mentioned: 

If you're a BoB fan, the podcast that came out at the 20th anniversary, is absolutely incredible. It enriches the experience for both new and old fans by an insurmountable amount.

I've been rewatching the show almost yearly since it came out but rewatching it with the podcast as a companion was a new level of appreciation.

Absolutely everyone of importance and nostalgia is interviewed, the host is sneakily good and intelligent and warm, he is able to facilitate such good conversations with cast and collaborator.

I CANNOT. Recommend it enough:

https://open.spotify.com/show/4kPks2or9xa26GdMRRu2lK?si=PvRdPyLoTJSsPQXbW8QvIA"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Generation Kill is equally as good but in a completely different way
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The thing that got me was the pre-episode commentaries by the actual people being portrayed in the show. It really shows the accuracy and perfection of the acting and the show production value.

I really need to watch BoB again. What a ride it was."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"We need /r/television version of this:

After many years I finally decided to watch [insanely popular, well-reviewed film] and I just want to say that it definitely holds up after all these years! What really stood out was the amazing directing by [Academy Award Winning Director] spot-on acting decisions by some of the legendary cast including [Academy Award Winner], [r/Movies fan favorite], and [actor identified as ""underrated""]. The story makes a grand arc with clever plot twists and a satisfying classic finish, back at the start never to be the same. If you're a fan of [Top 10 IMDB Film], or [Other Top 10 IMDB Film], or any [insert genre] films in general, I cannot recommend this movie enough."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Really going out on a limb here
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The opening sequence of Episode 2, with hundreds of airplanes in the sky at once, really made me understand the concept of ‘nations at war’ at a deeper level, the sheer scale of the conflict and resources involved"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,It probably *is* the most incredible piece of tv ever made
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"most shows & movies have the disclaimer: ""Based on a true story""

BoB's disclaimer: ""This is a true story""

""The Pacific"" is just as incredible.  it doesn't follow the same characters throughout, but it does show the literal hell these extraordinary marines went through ( I salute ALL my Devil Dog shipmates!)

& I'm writing to Tom Hanks at least once a month to finish the trilogy, tell the stories of my shipmates in WW2.

plenty of source material: Pearl Harbor, Midway, Leyte Gulf, USS Indianapolis, Doolittle's Raid, the formal surrender on USS Missouri"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"^^^this^^^^

I’ve been saying this since I first watched it.  I’ll take shit for this, but I truly believe that Band of Brothers should be required watching in high school.  We all take our freedoms for granted.  And to think that many of these brave young men even faked their age to be eligible for service."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I just watched it recently and it was absolutely incredible. Although i’ve heard that it may not be as accurate as it’s portrayed and maybe Winters wasn’t the all around great guy he’s portrayed as.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"I hadn't watched it either until recently and echo your sentiment. I liked that they also weaved in some uplifting sentiments and the cameos from the actual soldiers which was touching. ""Uplifting"" framing in I watched it right after *Come and See* in the WWII binge, which was pretty brutal."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,This is not an exaggeration.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"It never stops being good, it’s one of the few shows that is consistent over every single episode"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Move to Generation Kill next
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The episode “Bastogne” always has me like “f-ck that shit!” Frozen trees exploding from artillery impacts left and right, dude in the foxhole next to you getting a wood splinter though his throat dying choking on his own blood. Id’a noped outta there like a coward."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"It is the best miniseries I've ever seen. And easily one of the best TV shows of all time. I think every American should watch it at some point in their lives, even if they have no interest in history."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"It's truly special, one of the perfect examples of right people, right time, right medium, right network.

Basically all of those ducks had to get in a row, they did and it created magic. I'd have to think on it a bit, but if you argued it's the best television series ever, I wouldn't tell you your wrong as a gut reaction."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,First time I watched it I was on a mini R&R break in a random palace on the Green Zone in Iraq as a member of the 101st Airborne Division. I was hyped to say the least.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"So fucking good.  I have watched it countless times.  I always remember the DVD being expensive for a long, long, long time.  One of the very few things media, movies, TV, whatever, which brings me to tears.  Especially when they come across the concentration camp.  Everybody's acting is top notch.  Whoever cast David Schwimmer as their lieutenant, wow.  It still surprises me to this day how good he was at being so unlikeable.  Now I want to watch it again."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Band Of Brothers is one I can watch over and over and over again.  Never gets old.  Wish there was more WW2 films that was filmed like this.  Even though Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg both did Saving Private Ryan, this just takes the cake."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"I'm going to give the heads up that Pacific is not the same. It's really good and you will enjoy it, but it's not band of brothers and I think it's something to do with the source content being multiple books rather than 1 as in the case of band of brothers. 

Highly recommend the book, some subtle things in the show that are highlighted in the book (hinkel,eat ze armpit ya!)"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,One of the best ever. Check out Catch 22 on Hulu if you haven’t already.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,The book is also great.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Thanks for posting. I've never seen it, but I'm going to give it a go."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Was thinking about picking up the vhs box set. Never seen it before.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Just started  a “The Pacific” rewatch. If you haven’t caught it, it’s worth a watch."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"I Treasure a remark to my grandson who asked, ""Grandpa were you a hero in the war?""

Grandpa said, ""No.... but I served in a company of heroes”.

By Mike Ranney

I have watched this scene more times then I can say and it always makes me tear up.."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,The pacific is a must watch for you then
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The YouTube algorithm randomly suggested an interview with Major Winters a few days ago - turns out Albert Blythe didn't succumb to his wounds from Normandy but rather he recovered fully and then went on to serve as a paratrooper in Korea.

Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,We watched the entire series every Christmas season.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Your weekend pass has been revoked!
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I’ve always said it’s the greatest single season of any show ever. It just can’t be topped.

Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"If you like band of brothers, try “Generation Kill”. Also excellent television, and I think a great counterpoint to BOB."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Oh def. It's saving private Ryan as a series but like full quality throughout. Great choice to watch.

Edit: not to say SPR isn't quality throughout, just that doing it as a series is a lot of time to be quality and they do it."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,From the Earth to the Moon
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The Pacific is just as good, though more miserable. But it should be. The pacific theatre was hell on earth. 
Fully realized with Fat Man and Little Boy. 

Though I’ve heard it put that war is worse than hell. The people in hell deserve it, but in war innocent people are killed and brutalized wholesale."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,it really truly is a cinematic masterpiece <3
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Watch the Pacific too then. You’ll love it. Although I watched pacific then BoB, and found myself catching things I learnt from Pacific, which made some scenes a bit less realistic in BoB.  

Also, just saw “all quiet on the western front.” Wow. Def watch that too"

Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"I loved the series as well. Back then, I had no interest in war movies or shows. I always viewed them as just action movies that were all about shooting people with nothing much happening. When I gave Band of Brothers a chance, I immediately understood the gravity of war from their points of view. I then branched out to other war stories and games and I learned that there's a lot of very interesting stories to learn about in them."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I loved Damien Lewis (Lt Winters) in it. BoB made me watch Billions and Homeland.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Not one of, The One!"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Salute the rank, not the man."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I will never ever forget the medic episode.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"One of the best shows ever. I rewatch it every year. 

I live in Zell am See, the place where they go to relax in the last episode... Always makes me smile to know they were here at the end."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Band of brothers is something I take the time to watch every year. 

It is that good."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Yeeeeah man absolutely fantastic show
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Friend recommended it about 3 years ago, one of my comfort shows. Along with The Sopranos you cant go wrong.

War is Hell"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Episode 9 is one of the best and most hard hitting bits of TV ever
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,You'll be watching it again in a week. It's one of those
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Band of Brothers shows the totality of war. The training, the preparation, the fact that soldiers don't like being left in the dark. The lengths they will go to to survive, and how respect is earned and lost in the field. 

There are few other movies that show this. Saving Private Ryan is one of those few. War should never be shown as pretty or noble, war shows the worst of mankind, and also humanity at it's best.

If you want to see another series similar to BoB, check out The Pacific. Also, a Swedish band named Sabaton does a lot of songs based on history and warfare. Check them out, as they have taught me a lot more about European history than my high school history ever did."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,This post reminds me that I'm long overdue for a rewatch of Band of Brothers as well as The Pacific. It has to be years at this point.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Bastogne was the best episode
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,They show clips from BoB in some Army schools as examples of good leadership and it’s assigned as homework to watch the entire series. It’s an inspiring and moving show.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The Pacific is equally good and made to the same impeccable standard, its about the US war in the Pacific Islands and conveys the same weight of human cruelty and perseverance. Band of brothers will always be the GOAT of these types of shows but I must say I think i prefer the Pacific"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,Chernobyl is right up there with it and is by the same people both are amazing
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Now watch The Pacific, it's even better."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I want to enjoy military tv series or movies but i cant... Because all the soldiers wear the same uniform and i cant tell who is who.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,I cry everything when I watch episode 9 why we fight
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"A great series that has visually stood the test of time. Is it a perfect historical depiction? No, but its very close, and certainly much closer than a lot of what we get today.

What always floors me is that the musical and visual presentation of the series still fits and doesn't look dated at all. The washed-out, high contrast, gritty style combined with the lower framerates during action sequences really works well to keep the series in the same ring as modern CG movies and shows. Hell, it even sometimes surpasses modern film and TV by being primarily in-camera effects, and leans on CG very sparingly. It doesn't show its age because of that, and the style really embodies the ""1940's WWII"" feeling so it never feels out of place.

The same argument can be said about Saving Private Ryan, though I do feel it's visual timelessness is just slightly second place to Band of Brothers. Still incredible, but just not quite the same.

Again, it's not perfect. But it's pretty damn close!"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"The top of my bucket list is to visit Bastogne to honour the memory of the men depicted in this mind blowing series that always hits me really hard when I watch it

To the men of easy company - thank you ALL for your service."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,We all experienced this the first time we watched it.  After you’re done you’re almost exhausted by the emotional rollercoaster and wonder if you can ever watch another show.  Very few others are as immersive as this series.
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"In my opinion, there are two mini-series' that exist that are perfect, and couldn't be improved upon in any way.  Band of Brothers, and Lonesome Dove.  Just gimme a bottle of bourbon and a blu-ray of either one, and you've made my weekend!"
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Yes, it really is excellent."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,We have  watched it every memorial day for the last 15 years
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"Amazing mini-series, I rewatch it every now and then. You should watch The Pacific now! Just like Band of Brothers but a bigger focus on the horrors of war rather than brotherhood."
Special Forces: Ultimate Hell Week,"It was great Jimmy Fallon was really believable.

As I’ve gotten older, and as the unfiltered stupidity of war comes out of places like syria and now ukraine, I have a hard time understanding the fascination people have with war media. It’s almost all moonshine."

Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I think one of the things that give Seinfeld an edge is that the characters are never presented as good people. They're all shitty and that's part of it. So things that might have been considered benign at the time, but don't  age well are easier to shrug off. Friends continually tries to tell you they're good people and good friends when they're all actually terrible so they just become worse over time."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld just seemed to have so many things that relate to life in general. Odd given the nature of the show, but I'm always using ""like on Seinfeld"". Double dip, man hands, not that there's anything wrong with it, regifter, opposite George, etc. 

Cripes, just yesterday I saw a dumpster diver eating a donut from the trash and thought of George."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"“We’re not gay! …Not that there’s anything wrong with that.” 

So many lines were ahead of their time and hold up well."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld by far. To me the cynicism holds up better than the corny sentimentality where everybody hugs and learns a lesson.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld, it’s indisputable"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Now start watching Curb your Enthusiasm
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld and it's not close. Seinfeld has always been a better show imo.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld has aged better because a lot of the stories are based on every day real life situations. How many times has something happened in your life that made you think of a Seinfeld episode vs how many times has something made you think of Friends?
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,[removed]
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"One is the greatest network comedy ever.

the other is Friends.

IMO the writing on Seinfeld was so far ahead of the game people are still catching up."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I still love both these shows, and I think they both hold up. 

Friends hit its stride at the end of season 3, when Ross and Rachel really broke up. It seems the writers shifted all the characters into quirky, weird characteristics besides Ross being the lovelorn mopey guy, Monica being the straight woman, Chandler being just a comic relief, etc. This ended up giving the show refreshing storylines to feed off of as opposed to the cookie cutter sitcom it started as.

Seinfeld is similar in that it hit its real stride a few seasons in. All of the characters were gloriously unlikeable yet lovable, but I think Elaine was the real gem in the bunch. I always thought it was pretty brave for JLD to play such a brash character, for a woman comedian it was really refreshing to see her be just as bad as the guys as opposed to being the straight woman trying to keep them in check. Sweet Dee on Sunny is directly influenced by her portrayal. 

Each of these shows have catch phrases that are a part of pop culture, each show is still funny despite knowing what that joke is that you heard for the 20th time. Both are classics, but different types of shows that went against the grain and ended up becoming classics."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Ngl. Its interesting seeing some of the replies here as a person from the UK. Seinfeld barely got much of a chance to get going here (dont blame the people, blame the channels over here messing up schedules MAJOR at the time), whereas Friends was and is still HUGE here. Like there's legit a small chain of central perk replica coffee shops here within one of the biggest fashion stores here and you can find friends merch anywhere. 

Like due to that Seinfeld has always felt like this weird hipster show for friends haters to me. ""Oh, you like friends? That's so basic and mainstream. Seinfeld is way better."" and I know elsewhere in the world ESPECIALLY in the US it isn't true. But yeah... its just the way it feels and looks from this side if the planet. 😅"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,The funny one.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Lot of Friends hate one here. But honestly, They’re both really great shows that have aged pretty brilliantly. 

One took the sitcom formula and pretty much perfected it. The other took the sitcom formula and found hilarious ways to subvert it. Both shows were exceptionally cast.

I feel like Reddit seems to look at Friends as being hokey and sentimental, but it’s no worse than Parks and Reck and The Office US in that regard and the writing in those early seasons especially was really fresh and clever."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"People on here have such a huge hate boner for Friends lol

There's a reason it's as popular as it is"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Asking reddit to choose between Friends and Seinfeld is a forgone conclusion, the reddit demo will always favor Seinfeld. But if you were to ask randoms on the street, Friends will win out 8 times out of 10.

I like them both but Friends is my comfort show and the one I have rewatched more often."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Have 30 somethings at my work place that watch Friends over and over.  One says she has seen every episode at least 15 times.  Seinfeld was smarter and has more memorable lines, but younger generations have not discovered it like they have discovered Friends.  Both funny as hell."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"It’s highly subjective. 

Growing up with friends felt a lot more digestible and easier to follow. The narcissism of Seinfeld didn’t become clear to me until i was older and able to understand the situation the characters were placed in.

Friends storylines felt a lot more simplified. Universal storytelling vs situational experiences.

Both hold space where needed. 

Overall, for me - Friends aged well as a comfort watch and Seinfeld aged best with personal experiences."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld ages better because it fused one of the greatest comedy writers ever (Larry David) with three of the greatest performers of their time (Alexander, Richards, Dreyfuss)
No, I didn’t leave out any names here."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I don’t even see how the two can compare - friends is a good sitcom, but very low hanging fruit comedy that comes together with likable characters and typical “will they, won’t they” tropes, where as Seinfeld is legit great writing, had timeless jokes, unique characters, and paved the way for shows with terrible characters that have little to no development while still maintaining audience interest.  Just one man’s opinion."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"My vote is for Seinfeld. But Im going to selfishly take this opportunity to stick up for Friends and fight back against the the online hate that show brings in. 

I am old enough to have appreciated the later seasons live as they aired and to be aware of what a massive phenomenon it was in its day. It was everyone’s favorite show (if I may generalize). I watched all the reruns at 6 and 6:30 every day. By the time the show finished I probably saw the whole series 2 or 3 times over. then I got older and went through the phase of thinking it was uncool, unfunny, and out dated. Then I got even older and it was released on HBO Max and I decided to get nostalgic and start from episode 1. The show is a monumental achievement in entertainment. They created SIX ICONIC characters over 10 seasons with a joke-a-minute prime time sitcom. The actors delivered every time. The roles they played were not easy. If you can’t laugh at Friends then that’s on purpose and you’re just trying to be a contrarian hipster who just won’t like any multicam sitcom. But if you can appreciate the format at all, let go of ego, Friends is funny. 

Seinfeld is better tho 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I realize I am really going to cut against the grain here, but I have to answer this question truthfully:

Friends, and it is not even close.

I’m not saying it’s better than Seinfeld because it totally is NOT. But OP said “aged better.” 

I live in NYC and I work in tourism. The number of people I’ve met who are desperate to see the Friends apartment, Friends locations real and fake (no, Central Perk is not a real coffee shop), extends into the hundreds.

I’ve not met a single person who asks me about Seinfeld.

All those Friends fanatics? They are all 20 or younger.

Friends is MASSIVELY popular among Gen Z kids, who find it alternately relatable (because stories are simple and the characters are very archetypal) and exotic (no smartphones or social media, and the characters on Friends not-so-coincidentally seem to have much richer relationships with each other).

Friends has resonated in a major, major way a generation later. Seinfeld has not. Seinfeld is much more specific in its humor and more rooted in 90s history (don’t know who George Steinbrenner and Johnnie Cochran were? Too bad for you!), and I don’t think its very white/Jewish-centric vision of New York, where other ethnicities are typically encountered in service industries or as exotic Others, has aged well for 2020s sensibilities. Does Friends have the white-centric problem, too? Hell yes, even more so, but its edges so sanded and its humor so seemingly benign that I can see why people give it more of a pass.

TL, DR: Friends has a huge Gen Z fanbase, Seinfeld does not. Ergo, Friends has “aged better”, though I agree Seinfeld was a much, much better show."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I like both shows, but objectively speaking, I think Seinfeld is far superior.

It just has way more creativity and unique premises and I think writing is superior. Friends is a good sitcom, but I don’t think it necessarily has anything that sets it apart from most other sitcoms as its own thing besides the fountain dancing intro titles and music. I too watched Friends first and thought it was one of the greatest shows ever, but then started seeing Seinfeld and newer shows like Community and Parks and Rex and saw how superior they are.

Seinfeld didn’t need a famous guest star every week, but I think Friends purposely went that route in the latter half largely because I think they knew the writing and characters weren’t strong enough to succeed on its own and triedmto overcompensate with big name guest stars like Willis, Pitt, DeVito, Penn and, Kathleen Turner and Goldblum, among others.

Friends was and is a very ordinary - but entertaining- sitcom with a flashy exterior and good jokes, but didn’t have the substance the way Seinfeld or Parks and Rec or Community or Frasier and many others do. It was always a fun show but I don’t think much more than that."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Friends is 100x more popular and gets more views. So depends what you want to take into account. This is kinda like avatar where reddit thinks avatar/friends suck but the majority of the world loves avatar/friends.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld is more farcical and Friends has a bit more heart. Maybe I’m getting softer as I get older but I gravitate more towards Friends.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"*Seinfeld* influenced modern comedy more than *Friends* - Larry David shaped a generation of White guys' sense of humor.
  
*Friends* benefits from having some post-9/11 seasons and just *feels* more modern. Rachel also influenced a whole generation of White girls' wardrobe."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Controversial certainly reading the rest of this thread, but I regularly still rewatch Friends, while very little of the humor in Seinfeld does anything for me. (I also love always sunny, which people often compare Seinfeld to).

I think Friends holds up not because of the humor, but in spite of it, it's a very feel good show, it always works out for them and a lot of the struggles are relatable to a 20-30 year old trying to be a grown-up for the first time. When I'm in a bad mood and am ""stuck in second gear"", then it kind of cheers me up, but Seinfeld doesn't do that, and I'd rather watch Always Sunny for the fun hijinks with the absurd stories and bonkers characters, when I'm in the mood for that."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seems a lot people here aren’t answering the question. They’re just answering what do they prefer. As for me, I think Friends has aged better. Seinfeld is a 90s show in its references. Which makes sense obviously as it was almost solely set in the 90s. As someone else said, I think Friends benefits in relation to this question from having some of it set past 9/11, when the world was a different place."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Never liked Seinfeld, might be an American thing I never understood. 

Friends was funny at times and woudn't be suprised if some channels sti air episodes. Just like married with children stil airs -.-"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"This is such a weird argument. One show is a literal milestone of television comedy, the other is a show lots of people seem to enjoy. 

Apples and oranges."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Reddit leans Seinfeld. But they’re both great
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld is funnier to me now as I’m at the age of the characters. Friends was never funny to me regardless of age.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld and it's not particularly close. Seinfeld vs Frasier is a better question.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Whichever people choose, I’d say they’re both white."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Everything in this thread saying Friends isn’t funny to seem smarter than they are 🙄. Seinfeld is the better show, but the Friends writers room wasn’t slacking and the cast was also great."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"One invented No Nut November, the other still gets people to clap along to a theme song"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Also Kevin Bright who made Friends is a huge asshole. He was an alumni of my school and came around all the time. He always introduced himself as “the guy who made Friends,”… he complained that he didn’t work on sets anymore because everyone was too Pc and wouldn’t let him give them unsolicited massages… and when he would come as a guest for our annual awards show, there had to be a special student assigned to him to make sure he didn’t act creepy to any women."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld. Friends is just white Living Single
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"For the average person probably friends, for redditors, its always seinfeld"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Contrary to everyone here, Friends. Seinfeld has far too many pop culture references that someone not from that era wouldnt understand. I was born in the 90s and I don't even get some of the people/references they say. There's no damn way a person born now would get a lot of the jokes. Don't get me wrong, Seinfeld is far better written but it's humor also has a long set up, whereas Friends is that cheap easy humor. You'd actually need to watch a whole episode of Seinfeld and pay attention to it in order to get the payoff, whereas Friends you could leave on the background and still enjoy it."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld is the obvious answer. Friends is a relic of that old hokey manufactured sitcom vibe. While definitely a more modern take, it has more in common with Cheers than with modern TV.

Seinfeld was so innovative in its style that people literally referred to it as a show about nothing. When you really think about that, it is bizarre. At that time, people needed each episode wrapped in a convenient storyline that taught a lesson to actually perceive storytelling. Seinfeld blew up that notion and allowed characters to exist as morally ambiguous without being ""punished"" (and then when they did get ""punished"" in the finale, the audience felt betrayed). Storylines were less cliched and more based on the small minutia of everyday life and poking holes in the absurdity of modern society -- basically the default tone of most social media platforms these days. It isn't that crazy to draw a line from Seinfeld's take on character to the beginning of prestige TV like The Sopranos and The Wire, when TV audiences finally accepted that it is far more interesting to not be force fed whether a character is a hero or a villain."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld, always. The show is/was brilliant and could never be replicated."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld. Although I would say Curb is the one that will age like a fine wine.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends is what Seinfeld would have been if the network had been calling all the development shots: get a couple more girls, make everyone younger and pretty, include a Sam and Diane couple. Given that, Friends was executed very well."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Well I've never liked Friends in the first place. 

But Seinfeld is immortal. It's a much more human show."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Mulva > Unagi
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,I always found Seinfeld to be more relatable.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"One good way is to compare similar episodes. The classic Seinfeld episode about masturbation famously used “master of my domain” as a euphemism to get around network censors. The episode humorously explored the central role that it plays in our lives and differences between men and women, cleverly couched in a friendly contest. A masterpiece of sitcom writing.

The Friends episode “The one about whacking off” is much cruder. The scene where Ross and Chandler are racing to see who finishes on Joey first lacks the nuances of the Seinfeld contest. And the lack of a comparable scene with the girls smacks of early 90s sexism.

Overall it’s very clear which was the greater comedy."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends has some very dated jokes. Seinfeld has some dated situations (the speed dial episode for example), but the humor is timeless."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"In my mind there doesn’t need to be a debate as to which is better. I like both shows.

There’s a lot of dislike for Friends here. I don’t know. I think it’s very funny."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"A lot of Seinfeld was dealing with issues that wouldn't happen anymore, like waiting at a land line for a call or misunderstandings that we instantly solve with a smartphone. Friends was a bunch of people trying to fuck. I think Seinfeld is a way better show but it hasn't aged as well"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld, without question.

Even though it's a 90s show about 30 somethings, it's still so applicable today and to a broad audience.

I've watched it over and over again throughout the years since I was 12 years old. I'm now approaching 30 and I know all the lines by now, and I'm still laughing and hollering at every episode. It's not like it even had just a few good episodes or seasons, there's so many classics! Heck the festivus episode was in the final season! 

It's just the all-time best comedy show and will always be my all-time favorite TV show. 

FRIENDS is probably only better to a certain demographic."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld.

The premise of Friends was created by an 8 year old girl. Me and my friends are all going to live in the same place and we can play everyday. Our boyfriends will live in the same building and we can all date when we want too. And everything is going to be really really fun."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Friends is for the undateable.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,It’s Seinfeld by a mile. Haven’t watched Friends in quite a while but it doesn’t strike me as the type of show that would’ve aged well. Seinfeld is still funny as shit. And relevant.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"As a HUGE Seinfeld fan, I was pretty pissed when people started comparing these two shows a little while back. In my mind it was even close.

My wife started watching friends again, and I have to admit, it was way better then I remembered. Definitely, not as good as Seinfeld, but it was closer then I thought.

Seinfeld 10/10

Friends 9/10"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,There are rarely days that go by that are not relatable to Seinfeld. It is infinitely more quotable. Seinfeld has a timeless quality that is not matched by Friends. Seinfeld and The Office is a better comparison.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld. Better jokes.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,I watched Friends and loved it for years and then found Seinfeld in 2020 and there simply isn't any comparison for me - Seinfeld is far superior and I love it dearly and watch it every day. I'm bonkos about Seinfeld 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld was more realistic in their living situation, such as not being able to afford these huge apartments on minimal salary etc. 

Oh and Seinfeld had actual comedy ..."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"ITT, Seinfeld good, Friends bad."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld, by far.  It's always relatable and always hilarious.  Friends was good too but the characters are just so.........likeable.  The UN-likability of Seinfeld's characters makes it timeless."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Friends is really unfunny. It tries too hard and falls flat; the humour is so forced. It also feels dated. Seinfeld is timeless. Far superior on every front.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld and the Episode in the Hampton’s — have not seen anything better in comedy after that — Seinfeld is the GOAT 😊

Please, you have to see the baaaabbbyyyy 😅"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld embraced being terrible people and that was part of the appeal (IASIP does this well, too). Friends characters didn’t seem horrible at the time but in retrospect they’re unbearable."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"how is this even a question? seinfeld by faaaarrr

friends is a show set in new york fucking city and it features ONLY white people. wtf is that?"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld is the Goat!!
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,I think both are for different crowds. You probably won't ever get an unbiased answer. Not that there's anyone wrong with that!
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends was never funny, All the actors are now washed up and trying to stay relevant. Didnt the show try to reboot and flop? I dont think I've ever met anyone who actually liked the show and wasnt above the age of 40. And that was a long time ago.

everyone I know who has seen sienfeld still loves it, and my family and I watch it together sometimes. Even though it can be mundane and dated at times, it still holds up really well"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld by far. I used to be a staunch friends stan when I was a teenager but damn it's near unwatchable now.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends =  characters have redeeming values.

Seinfeld = no one has any redeeming values. 

Seinfeld all day."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld. Friends has always been trash.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Since Seinfeld was WAY better while it aired, it’s also better now. That’s my crazy take."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"You’re asking this on the internet, my friend. The overwhelming consensus is going to be Seinfeld. By a wide margin."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"friends comes off super fake now. they also seem much older then they are. 
its bizarre to me that ""a show about nothing"" was an unheard of concept and i suppose at the time ahead of its time. even though i thought seinfeld was lame (i didnt get it) as a kid its aged better. 
although it was hilarious that teens thought friends was a new netflix show. then target ruined everything by merchandising it to DEATH"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends turned into a bunch of Adults acting like dumb teens living in conditions they can't effort with their incomes in a New York that doesn't exist as they present it while handling unrelatable shit in unrealistic ways. I never liked friends and personally find it one of the most overrated shows in the history of television. Seinfeld however is very relatable and realistic which besides the set feeling outdated (yet good for the time they made it) making it sort of a timeless show, the jokes and situations still work."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I like them both. Friends is too nostalgic for me. But Seinfeld probably ages the best as it is a show about nothing. :D

Also, my fav sitcom from the ""old days"" is probably Fraiser. Seen it first time few years back and it is amazing."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld is still relevant. Everyone has had a bad parking experience or been ""Happy New Year""'ed in Feb."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld. By miles
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Sinefield.  Curb is still a great show with a similar concept.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld is timeless and still holds up. Friends is almost unwatchable now.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Friends was shit when it came out
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends, but it’s not necessarily because it’s a better show. So many shows have taken what Seinfeld did and built on it or downright stolen from it.

As a person who has watched both, I laugh more at Friends. When I watch Seinfeld, I understand that it is funny, but I’m able to predict where it’s going because modern sitcoms have been shaped by it to the point that my thought process is able to jump to the punchline before it happens on screen. 

This is so common that there’s a whole page on TV Tropes about it: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld, 100%"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Seinfeld. The jokes are actually still funny. Friends..... not so much.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,I don't find Seinfeld even remotely funny.  Maybe it's because I'm British?
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,I never cared for Seinfeld.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld’s characters are not sympathetic. We like them in spite of who they are. Friends’s characters are by comparison very sympathetic. We like them in spite of what they *do*.

I think the easiest comparison is how each show handles the rampant homophobia of the 90s. Friends leans fully into it, with all the characters unabashedly making gay jokes. When Seinfeld did the same topic, they added ‘not that there’s anything wrong with it.’ The characters are aware they’re in the wrong on Seinfeld and on Friends they are not aware they are."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Friends is living single for white people. Seinfeld is very good but dated and doesnt resonate with gen z like friends does. The real GOAT 90s sitcom will always be Frasier.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends. When was the last time you saw Seinfeld bath salts for sale?

Friends is the ultimate American style sitcom, while Seinfeld is a B+ approximation of a British style sitcom (which is why it never had an impact there). Friends is a huge global property and I guarantee at least one episode is screening on TV somewhere as you read this. Seinfeld not so much. What’s up with that? Could it *be* any clearer?"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Jerry this is frank, mr steinberger is here, George is dead, call me back.

This line alone is better than friends"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Friends has a better looking cast and is a brighter show. Those things always age better as comfort watches.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Sienfield is much better.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,From reading the comments it looks like I’ll be binge watching Seinfeld . 😊
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Workaholics… I said what I said.
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Seinfeld is 10000x better than Friends. Even when Friends was on tv it wasn’t very funny. Seinfeld works because it deals with very real everyday themes but through the experiences of intentionally unlikeable characters. It’s about the discomfort of social interaction, the perpetual adolescence encouraged by urban life, the mundaneness of most work, the sheer amount of luck involved in finding jobs, family relationships… Friends characters tried to be likeable but were totally unbelievable because of it. They’re all beautiful and fashionable, whereas the cast of Seinfeld is fairly average looking (well Elaine is gorgeous but she dresses in a very particular way and has naturally curly hair and her real nose etc). Friends characters had mostly low paying jobs but rarely talked about money, whereas Seinfeld had entire episodes about finding good deals on rent. George had to move in with his parents when he was unemployed. It just feels more relatable. The fat Monica jokes on friends are really tasteless and cruel. Jokes about George Constanza being portly and bald feel very human—his value is not fully attributed to his attractiveness, he still dates and gets laid, and when women reject him it typically has more to do with his personality and poor behavior than his appearance. Friends was accused of being too white for NYC but I don’t think ever responded to that. Seinfeld, with the same accusation, made a hilarious episode about George trying to find a Black friend to prove he wasn’t racist. The writing in Seinfeld is just…excellent. I could go on and on about it, but I think it’s no contest at all. Friends was a blah sitcom that aged poorly. Seinfeld was an excellent sitcom with great writing, and while some jokes don’t make sense with current technology (eg stealing answering machine tapes), it doesn’t really matter."
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"I feel like FRIENDS has aged a tiny bit better. Let me explain.


FRIENDS is a show about a group of friends going through life, from early 20s to real adulthood with complicated relationships, kids, etc. A ton of the writing still holds up IMO. The negative of the show is that its VERY typical sitcom. A bit formulaic, especially in later seasons. But we do get to see the characters grow, develop, without compromising TOO much on what made them funny. Joey and Feebie are probably the only 2 characters that suffered a ton of Flanderisation.

SEINFELD on the other hand has MUCH sharper writing and the humor is a lot more nuanced. Where SEINFELD drops the ball is that its very much a product of its time. Half of the show would not work if the characters had smartphones. Simple as that. I mean, come on dudes, there is a whole episode revolving around swapping the cassette of an answering machine. 

This is all objective in my opinion tho. I personally enjoyed Seinfeld humor a lot more. Some of the jokes take a whole episode to be set up, with a payoff as the last line of the episode. That's not easy to pull off. And this is from a guy who grew up on Friends when it was airing. I only caught SEINFELD on Netflix. Also, George Costanza is a spirit animal and one of the most glorious characters to ever grace a TV screen"
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,Always sunny in Philadelphia
Maggie and Bianca: Fashion Friends,"Friends, simply because I never really cared for Seinfeld."
13 Reasons Why,"the parent can blame netflix all they want but a tv show isnt the reason their kid committed suicide.

and i doubt the algorithm intentionally targeted unstable people, 13 reason why was one of the most popular shows once it came out, It was def one of the most controversial ones. 

most users probably saw it on the ""recommended"" ""trending"" etc whatever feed at some point."
13 Reasons Why,"I think most agree that a show about a teenage girl killing herself as part of a complicated revenge plan probably isn't gonna help any suicidal teenage girls. 

But to blame this suicide epidemic on Netflix algorithms and demand they pay you billions is insane. 

The world is dying. The elder generations have failed their children. Everything is fucked up and depressing. Everywhere they look is misery and confusion and anger and a complete absence of hope. 

Any young person with genes that predispose them to depression or anxiety basically get it 100% in our world. If its in there its coming out."
13 Reasons Why,Was this why Netflix now have suicide warnings for some of their shows?
13 Reasons Why,"Just adding some worthless anecdotal bullshit, but I never wanted to harm myself or ever even thought I had depression. Then I watched girl, interrupted at a young age and wanted to kill myself. I still think “this would be a good song to drown in my tub to” sometimes when I’m taking a bubble bath and listening to music. Art is impactful for young minds."
13 Reasons Why,“Gangster rap made me do it”
13 Reasons Why,"I found AFSP funds high quality research on the causes of suicide and pushes that into policy guidelines and training. https://afsp.org/reporting-on-suicide-prevention

The show was controversial because it didn't follow the guidelines very much, but it did open the dialog a bit more to help reduce the stigma.

Mental health is stigmatized in many cultures, which prevents those in crisis from seeking help. As a society we need to de-stigmatize the topic, make help easy to access, and recognize warning signs."
13 Reasons Why,">Netflix cautioned in court filings that restrictions on content would lead to censorship of creative works, noting movies depicting teen suicide such as The Perks of Being a Wallflower, 

Was suicide actually shown in Perks? I thought >!it was insinuated that he was about to, but he never actually does it.!<


>Netflix has removed the original, nearly three-minute-long suicide scene in the season one finale.

Huh, I didn't know they did that. Seems to be admittance that they made a mistake?"
13 Reasons Why,"There's actually plenty of data that shows depicting suicide or mentioning real life suicides increases suicide.

Every expert that was consulted on this show explicitly told them not to show it.  But they did anyway."
13 Reasons Why,This was a really tough scene to watch. I hate that they removed it.
13 Reasons Why,"Im suing Showtime! Haven't stopped killing people since I watched ""Dexter"""
13 Reasons Why,"Art is not responsible for real life acts. People need to understand that. And honestly, it's a lot of the people that claim to be really into TV and movies that do this type of thing. Can't handle when they see something that goes against their fragile concept of morality."
13 Reasons Why,"I had a friend who absolutely loved this show, posted it on social media, always talked about it with friends, and would rewatch it almost everyday. He didn’t come from the most stable house, and he seemed a bit on a spectrum, though functioned very normally. He was one of my best friends.


One day, I find out he has died: his father found him in his room dead. He was a relatively healthy person. There was no explanation, no obituary, and no funeral. I have no idea how my friend died and I was never going to see him again. I’m afraid he may have killed himself.


I won’t say this show made him kill himself, but it glorified suicide as a noble way of going out and I won’t sing it’s praises."
13 Reasons Why,"Definitely hard to watch but the entire season leading up to it and the second season (haven't watched the third) is watching how her suicide destroys the lives of everyone she actually did care about.

Her family and friends all have varying degrees of mental breakdowns and paranoia, several try to kill themselves, her parents store is vandalized, her parents divorce, and the cherry on top is her rapist gets off scott free and a clean record at another school specifically because she made the revenge diary the way she did."
13 Reasons Why,Wait till they read the book…
13 Reasons Why,"The show also dealt with an (almost) school shooting. It was thwarted. It deals with rape. Are we going to claim people were raped or school shootings were caused because they happened on this show? Always looking for something to blame it on, rather than taking responsibility for being a piece of shit person."
13 Reasons Why,I would argue that they did have adequate warnings. Check up on your kid more often
13 Reasons Why,"pretty sure if someone's gonna commit suicide, that a tv show won't be the breaking point"
13 Reasons Why,Not paying attention for his child and blame it on others.
13 Reasons Why,"Iirc, there was an uptick in Teen suicide rates after this show aired."
13 Reasons Why,"Suicide scene or not, this show was terrible"
13 Reasons Why,"To think TV has no effect on real life is naive. People emulate all kinds of shit they see on TV. It depends on the person as to how much influence it has. It doesn't mean we should limit free speech but it does mean companies will exploit this for profit with no eye toward humanities well being. I had a teenager that was at risk for self harm when this came out and I wasn't thinking ""I'm not worried at all because people never do what they see on TV, durrrr"
13 Reasons Why,"I’m personally more offended they removed the scene. If Netflix thought it was ok to air before the executives watched it, why would they remove it now?"
13 Reasons Why,Child was clearly not in the right state of mine even if the show “triggered” a reaction
13 Reasons Why,The blame society
13 Reasons Why,"I understand why the lawsuit was dismissed, but I can still appreciate and agree with the stance of the parents here. 13RW is a dangerous show because it was geared towards an impressionable age group, and it romanticized suicide.   
People project themselves onto onscreen protagonists all the time. That's actually the reason why protagonists are usually the most boring characters in a story. All the side characters have all the interesting quirks and dialog, and the protagonist is often times a blank slate for the viewer to project themselves onto. It makes it easier for the viewer to feel a part of the story that way. So when a protagonist does something in a show or movie, there are people out there who try to mimic it.   


Is is likely for someone to commit suicide after watching 13RW? no. Is it possible? yes.   


Legally, it does come down to free speech, and no the law should not prevent such shows or movies to be made. But aside from the legal issue is a moral one. Sometimes movies that are meant to show the dark side of something in hopes of dissuading people from it, actually push them towards it. I believe it was mentioned that the Euphoria director saw Requiem for a Dream and decided to shoot heroine after watching it. I believe there are similar cases with the film ""the Basketball Diaries"" starring Leonardo Decaprio. As an artist, one must understand the power they have, and shedding light onto a dark topic might not do exactly what you intended to do, but rather the opposite."
13 Reasons Why,Im pretty sure this case was over as soon as you start the episode and the warnings of suicide and graphic violence pop up on the screen.
13 Reasons Why,I only need one these days
13 Reasons Why,"Because if you don’t talk about, it’s not a thing?"
13 Reasons Why,I know multiple kids who got FUCKED UP because of this scene and still physically cringe when razors or self harm are brought up
13 Reasons Why,People who have a moral panic over this show need to learn to take responsibility for themselves and get fucked.
13 Reasons Why,"I’m kinda worried we’re still in the “art is bad - censor art” stage.

I thought we fucked that shit off 10 years ago, but it’s making a come back."
13 Reasons Why,Lmfao what? Trying to sue a tv show for your own kids suicide. This show did more to prevent it than probably any other movie/tv/book ever. Fucks sake.
13 Reasons Why,i fucking swear up next they’re gonna sue a newspaper for just reporting a suicide
13 Reasons Why,"If anything, I felt the scene did a good job in not glorifying suicide. It was uncomfortable to watch, it wasn’t “pretty”.. it was done in a way (I felt) might show people that it’s an incredibly sad and graphic situation.

All of this being said, parents can’t blame a show for the death of their child. Its a heartbreaking situation but finding fault here is a waste of time and resources"
13 Reasons Why,13 Reasons Why is definitely an irresponsible show and the writers and show runners should be ashamed of themselves.
13 Reasons Why,Buncha incel males in this sub just rearing for some self hate. I can sense it with my virgin super powers. s/
13 Reasons Why,"SO wanted me to watch with her, First season was decent and intriguing, after that was terrible. Told the SO midway through second season I couldn't be forced to watch with her anymore. 

pushing for a greater nanny state to watch over your kids is not the answer."
13 Reasons Why,"As distasteful as I think the scene was, it did NOT cause anyone to commit suicide. Actually I have not watched the show, but I have seen the scene and as someone who was kind of suicidal at the time it made me think ""oh hell no I ain't doing that"". And in fact, saying this kind of shit and censoring anything with uncomfortable themes is how you make sure no kid who needs help is never going to get any. Blaming media for social issues has never, EVER helped. It's time we all move on from the satanic panic and start addressing social and political issues where it matters: in social and political contexts."
13 Reasons Why,"Suicide needs to be addressed and although the pain is very real and hurts like hell, people need to know the triggers and why someone may do it. 

Those who are considering it…..YOU ARE WORTH IT please do not, there is help. There is hope, we can get through this. 

Those who are survivors…..YOU ARE LOVED more than you know!!"
13 Reasons Why,The only person to blame is the person who took their own life. No one is accountable for their own actions other than themselves
13 Reasons Why,"Maybe Netflix should just stop recommending shows and movies. I log on (or he’ll usually pay for the subscription) with one specific thing in mind then let it lapse until I think of something else.

The 13 reasons why suicide and rape scenes should have been edited. They aren’t even realistic. Hannah would have bled a lot, probably needed a blood bag but been otherwise fine. Alex would be dead, Tyler would be brain damaged and in a colostomy bag, Clay and anyone else involved in trying to stop Tyler would be dead, and fat kid who’s name I forget would have went missing waaayyyy sooner than season 3.

Clay should have been institutionalized as soon as he started having hallucinations"
13 Reasons Why,The show was 99% teenage melodrama and then a incredibly graphic suicide scene.
13 Reasons Why,is this why there are “suicide” warnings before content now? jfc
13 Reasons Why,Theat show missed the entire point of the book and became about  promoting suicide to punish people. Its a horrible show.
13 Reasons Why,Blaming a fictional TV show for their kids suicide is just a way to hide from the truth that the kid was probably dealing with a lot and their parents did not do anything until it was too later.
13 Reasons Why,">most popular shows once it came out, It was def one of the most controversial ones.  
>  
>most users probably saw it on the ""recommended"" ""trending"" etc whatever feed at some point.

Exactly. On top of that, people were talking about it *everywhere*. I heard about it at work, and an entire floor was talking about it and most of those folks were 28-mid 50s. I overheard people talking about it at a restaurant having lunch. It was all over Bookface."
13 Reasons Why,"I don’t know, suicides tend to have a chain reaction. When someone commits suicide, people who know them’s likelihood of killing themselves increases When a celebrity commits suicide, there is often a notable increase in suicides. This can best be seen in Korea, with their frequent celebrity suicides. 

It’s not impossible to think that already fairly unstable teens who relate to the moody tortured teens in 13 Reasons Why might react in the same way to the fictional suicide as people do to real suicides.

That’s not to say we shouldn’t be able to depict suicide in media, but maybe we shouldn’t glorify it in media targeted at teens."
13 Reasons Why,"There was a lot of fucked up bullshit in that show that’s definitely bad as they made suicide look like a good way for revenge.

BUT this isn’t something that should be a lawsuit, this should be an example of why suicide is NOT the answer and why we need more talk about it."
13 Reasons Why,"It's just another version of the ""violent shows/games cause violence"" excuse"
13 Reasons Why,"Correct me if I’m wrong. Didn’t the beginning or end of every single episode have information on getting help if you are suicidal? When I was a tween this book was banned from our library and book fairs (but I happened to get my hand on a copy) and to be fair, it *does* glamorize suicide. Especially to a suicidal 13 year old, or at least I remember feeling that way. However, I’ve only seen maybe one episode of the show and I think all they can really do is help kids start that difficult conversation. I can absolutely confirm that this show is NOT the reason, but of course the parents need something to blame.

Edit- forgot a very important word"
13 Reasons Why,"Actually, media tries to downplay celebrity suicides as it literally causes an increase in suicide. There's been research into this. The show glorifies suicide which will increase suicide. However, in no way can you blame the show for a single persons death. It's similar to how we can't blame a single devastating weather event on climate change, just the overall increase. Netflix and the show is responsible for deaths. Legally speaking, it's complicated though. 

The book was far better anyway."
13 Reasons Why,"Was extremely depressed and had suicidal thoughts and remember watching that show, don’t think it made me any more so when I watched it."
13 Reasons Why,"If I had a dollar for every time Netflix told me I should commit suicide… well, that’s why I have an actual job."
13 Reasons Why,"Agreed, it’s like excusing murderers because they played doom when they were 16 years old. Never bothered to watch this particular show but I’m sure if I did I wouldn’t kill John Lennon or suddenly feel an urge to throw my head in a lawnmower. Concepts that are put into film most likely already exists in most people’s heads, motion pictures rarely introduce novel concepts such as ending it all or stroking kittens."
13 Reasons Why,"That’s true but it’s still a show glorifying teen suicide under the guise of being some prevention show.

She literally kills herself as part of a twisted revenge plot by leaving a treasure hunt behind for her classmates.

The number of young immature minds who are struggling, and then watched this show and thought about how they could be cool like Hannah, is definitely more than 0."
13 Reasons Why,"People get in trouble all the time for even talking about it, let alone suggesting it, if someone acts out on it.  I don't see why a TV show gets a pass.  They knew what they were making.

I don't see how that translates to suing Netflix, though.  Just take it off the air or put some kind of parental warning or consent on it."
13 Reasons Why,"Interesting comment from the subreddit that brought you ""This show is dangerous because it glorifies suicide"""
13 Reasons Why,"I always saw the problem with the show the feeling of impermanence about her death… she was still a main character after she killed herself.  I think in young minds who are biologically incapable of truly comprehending permanence, this toyed with the idea that you somehow get to live on after death, still enjoy your friends, and get revenge.  Still… it is a parent’s responsibility to be there for their kid’s mental health, not Netflix’s responsibility."
13 Reasons Why,"It may not help the girl directly, but it brings a lot of light to the issue to otherwise ignorant folks, and the more we as a society talk about it and realize this show is touching on a lot of real world problems, the more likely change will come."
13 Reasons Why,">The world is dying. The elder generations have failed their children. Everything is fucked up and depressing. Everywhere they look is misery and confusion and anger and a complete absence of hope.

Jesus dude. The world isn’t as bad as you make it seem. In fact, it’s literally the greatest time to ever be human in history.

Maybe turn off the TV every once in a while. Find a new perspective. Life is nowhere near as bad as you make it seem."
13 Reasons Why,"This show didn't fucking help. It wasn't just teens, there was a 10-year-old who killed themselves over this trashy show. 10. Because the greenlit this show that experts told them was problematic. And the showrunners ignored it."
13 Reasons Why,"> demand they pay you billions

Where are you getting ""billions"" from?"
13 Reasons Why,Pretty sure 13rw also had trigger warnings before episodes and specifically the ones that included the gore. It’s not like it was a jump scare and no one knew she was gonna commit
13 Reasons Why,"I was so annoyed that they added a trigger warning for every single episode of legend of Korra. ""Self Harm"" the guy just blew himself up in an explosion one episode. I really don't think that warrants the trigger warning for every single episode."
13 Reasons Why,"13 Reasons Why had full screen LONG warnings before almost every episode describing exactly why it was triggering and exactly who shouldn't be watching it. Those were included on day 1 for all viewers.   


They didn't add those because of 13 Reasons Why - they already had them for when they first released 13 Reasons Why. I remember the rape episode starting with a very ominous warning of ""This episode has graphic and violent displays of rape and sexual assault. Seriously, do not watch this if you are triggered by these things"". Same thing for the suicide episode and various other episodes."
13 Reasons Why,"To add my own, I was working as a crisis counselor when this series came out. It drove so much additional traffic to us that we literally had to make a resources entry for it to help people who hadn’t watched the show help people. I don’t know if it made people who were already on the brink more willing to talk about it or if it made people who were not previously suicidal think that was glamorous, but one way or another we saw a lot of at risk teens for months. It was genuinely a really harrowing time for me."
13 Reasons Why,"Sam Levinson, the creator of Euphoria, talks about this in this interview:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZv1Gc9DleY&t=38m13s

A mom in the audience asks if her daughter should watch Euphoria given the subject matter of the show. Sam, who was a drug addict when he was young, responds by pointing out how after he saw Requiem For A Dream, his first thought was that he should start shooting heroin.

Media definitely can have serious real world impact on people. Especially young people who may be dealing with mental health issues.

That of course doesn't mean film should be censored, but people should be careful what they're about to watch if they're not prepared for it."
13 Reasons Why,"exactly. suicidal ideation is something that should be met with concern and love, and not everyone has those resources. Maybe we should be more concerned about the people who took their own lives away because of the environment they could not stand, than the people still here making up excuses for why “they could take it”. you’re not stronger because you’re still here and they aren’t. you’re just able to come up with more excuses."
13 Reasons Why,"I think it is too. People forget how impressionable and distant from reality teenagers are. One suicide can cause another in a school, as happened in Wales once. Something like 20 died in a row. 

I don’t believe art is dangerous btw, I just think teenagers are prone to latching on to things. Maybe some subjects aren’t meant to be entertaining and need to be handled sensitively. 

I thought the suicide in that show was treated in a self righteous and inappropriate  way."
13 Reasons Why,The artist is not responsible for your emotional reaction to their art.
13 Reasons Why,"Yeah. This idea that media doesn't impact people at all is very popular online (especially concerning violent video games) but simply not true. That said, it isn't the *only* thing that impacts people. It may be a relatively small variable in how a person decides to act eventually. 

*Bowling for Columbine* had an interesting conclusion about why there is more spree shootings in the US. It wasn't because of gun violence on fictional TV. Instead the idea was that it was tied to how US Foreign Policy involves more military conflict compared to a country like Canada (which isn't tos say some of that conflict might not be necessary). And that conflict is covered extensively in the media."
13 Reasons Why,"Wait a minute, who commited suicide in Perks? I thought he was just very depressed, and was thinking about it, and that's when he called his sister?"
13 Reasons Why,"There is an article on the ""removed"" line at the bottom.

tldr is they wanted more seasons and spoke with experts and was advised to edit the scene"
13 Reasons Why,Could we not say the same thing about drug usage? This is kinda the reason shows have disclaimers.
13 Reasons Why,"> Every expert that was consulted on this show explicitly told them not to show it

I think that's the most important part to me. It's difficult to tell whether there really were suicides connected to the show, but even if there aren't, that was a risk they were willing to take?"
13 Reasons Why,"Attaching this to combat all of the “nuh uh” replies/other comments I see

https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2019/release-of-13-reasons-why-associated-with-increase-in-youth-suicide-rates"
13 Reasons Why,Idk. You are saying that showing it vs heavily implying it makes a difference? Seems kinda silly to me to think that one scene made all the difference.
13 Reasons Why,Good. Art should never compromise.
13 Reasons Why,"They’re zero chance that data could be directly correlational, and the only thing I could find was a temporary increase in teenage suicide in late 2019 with the debut of 13 Reasons. Even those researchers admitted “Researchers warn that their study could not prove causation.”

I’m would guess that Social Media has WAY more to do with teenage suicide than television. But I don’t claim I can prove that."
13 Reasons Why,Please... people don't kill themselves because of a tv series
13 Reasons Why,"I kind of don’t care what the experts say, Art is art no?"
13 Reasons Why,"They aren't legally culpable for someone's suicide, but they absolutely failed a moral duty of care by broadcasting that shit."
13 Reasons Why,"As always, the actual suicide is treated as the main problem, not the mental state that made them want to die.

Nobody would hesitate to show depressed or otherwise mentally ill people in shows. It's the *suicide*."
13 Reasons Why,"Isn't it also true that merely reporting on a suicide in the news (especially a celebrity/known person) increases suicide?

It reminds me of that expression: there's no such thing as an antiwar film."
13 Reasons Why,I thought it would be a deterrent.
13 Reasons Why,Have one of your kids be negatively influenced by it and you may feel differently. That was a rough time for my family.
13 Reasons Why,[deleted]
13 Reasons Why,And I became a lumberjack.
13 Reasons Why,They have to fit the code.
13 Reasons Why,Seriously. What an idiotic lawsuit. How are people seriously like this now?
13 Reasons Why,"You must not have known any suicidal people in your life, or read any of the studies or articles about how there actually was a correlation (yeah I know that's not causation, but come on) between this show and a rise in suicides."
13 Reasons Why,"Idk dude, reading the Catcher and the Rye might make you want to suddenly assassinate people…"
13 Reasons Why,"People who suffer from mental illness are susceptible to these sorts of issue no matter what gets out put in the media. If it wasn’t for this show it wild have been something else.   As you said it’s no the arts fault, it’s our lack of mental health awareness and treatment.  It’s getting better but still has a long way to go."
13 Reasons Why,It’s also in the book it’s based on so like 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
13 Reasons Why,This main reason why I didn't believed celebrity bullshit when they said Joker will start Incel riots.
13 Reasons Why,Guess you have never been moved by Art.
13 Reasons Why,"I haven't seen the show, how does suicide look noble in it?"
13 Reasons Why,"You would think this would be helpful with letting suicidal people know that suicide isn't practical or useful, but it can have the opposite effect. It can make it appear to them that their death will be significant and consequential in a way their lives aren't."
13 Reasons Why,Good don’t watch the third or fourth it turns into a murder mystery it’s fucking Disgusting
13 Reasons Why,"It's always the phone fault, computer fault and social media fault."
Bordertown,Kari is one of my favorite characters. Great show
Bordertown,"Wow, that's high praise. Wire in the Blood is one of the best shows I've ever seen."
Bordertown,At first read I thought this was talking about the 2015 comedy series that honestly might’ve done better DURING or AFTER 2020.
Bordertown,Bud Buckwald?
Bordertown,"I gave it a shot, and I have to say the Finnish have made a great show. 3 seasons with hour each where you want the next installment.

If you’re looking for something that’ll stick with you and keep you guessing we’ll worth your time."
Bordertown,This looks interesting
Bordertown,"Funny, I just recommended Bordertown in another thread. It's a great show and it's so beautifully done...the color palette, the cinematography, the location... :)"
Bordertown,"Friends of Alan Wake may also enjoy the cast, at least one of the regulars :)"
Bordertown,"It's pretty good but not great. It doesn't do anything new and it uses a bunch of dumb CSI tropes. For reference, the Red Riding trilogy is what I'd call great. If you like these Scandinavian noire detective shows, you'll probably like this one. The main character's magic autism thing gets old after a while. The wife is one of the best supporting female characters I've seen in a show.

[Ending spoiler](#s ""I didn't enjoy the non-linear ending. It just left me confused until I went back and re-watched the prologue. I'm not sure whether it was a dumb idea, or poorly done, or I was just not paying enough attention to enjoy it."")"
Bordertown,"The lead was a great villain in S1 of a great Swedish show called *Jordskott*, a folk-horror take on Scandinavian Noir.  Might still be on Shudder?"
Bordertown,Yep I really do think that. It’s worth the journey/time just as Wire in The Blood is.
Bordertown,We don't talk about that Bordertown
Bordertown,"Cool, thanks for the tip I'll have to check it out."
Bordertown,"While the other 3 were expected, I am somewhat surprised about **Grandfathered**'s cancellation."
Bordertown,Tiny bit sad about Grandfathered. 
Bordertown,The Grinder and Grandfathered were easily the two best new comedies on TV it's absurd that they were canceled. Fucking Seinfeld wouldn't make it past season 1 in modern television
Bordertown,"The Grinder was one of the best comedies to come out of network television in years. If you didn't get it, sorry. It was eons better than Grandfathered. It's Arrested Development getting cancelled all over again."
Bordertown,"Fuck! Grandfathered became really good by the end. Now I guess he can commit to Fuller House I guess...

Paget Brewster was so cute on that show. "
Bordertown,Bordertown was the biggest piece of shit I'd ever seen on TV 
Bordertown,"Oh god damnit, I liked The Grinder a lot. "
Bordertown,"What the shit, FOX?! Grandfathered had decent enough ratings for S2!... I guess Stamos/Brewster combo was too expensive for decent enough ratings... :'("
Bordertown,Bordertown was one of the worst shows I've ever seen. I had the displeasure of watching an episode at a local museum because the creator was trying to pass it off as a show that would fix race relations. 
Bordertown,Second Chance joins the list. (Somewhat obviously...)
Bordertown,"Oh man, I fell behind on both of these shows but still really liked them. Josh was really adorable in Grandfathered."
Bordertown,The Grinder is a great show.  Hulu save us!
Bordertown,"I started watching all these shows, but eventually deleted them off the DVR. It was me; I caused this. "
Bordertown,What's up with all these shows canceling? That time of the year or something?
Bordertown,This sucks.  Grinder and Grandfathered were both pretty great comedies.  Silver lining:  Maybe Paget Brewster will come back to Criminal Minds?  
Bordertown,Well Buck. Lets hope that Jazz album sells well.
Bordertown,"""We've been canceled, CANCELED!?"" - JOSH "
Bordertown,"On the plus side, hopefully we'll see Padgett Brewster return to Criminal Minds."
Bordertown,Damn I'm actually kind of sad about grandfathered. It was a pretty funny show to watch. I just have Too many other shows to keep up with
Bordertown,Well bordertown was destined to be cancelled anyway
Bordertown,Son of a bitch. Bordertown finally got its feet after bombing the first three episodes or so. 
Bordertown,"That sucks for Bordertown. I found it serviceable the humor was a bit different from the other McFarlane associated shows. I mean, it was racist but it was usually pretty funny. "
Bordertown,I'm gonna miss Bordertown.  Fox cancelled COPS for goodness sake so it's already official that they're maniacs.
Bordertown,I'm glad Bordertown is done that show wasn't funny at all
Bordertown,"Bordertown is unwatchable, it's so awful."
Bordertown,Fuck I feel like I need to give up trying out new shows. The ones I love always get canceled. 
Bordertown,God damn it. Both of those shows were hilarious.
Bordertown,Damn!! Just started watching Grandfathered. Soo good.
Bordertown,Wtf why did they cancel grandfathered? That show was good
Bordertown,"Shame. I really enjoyed the Grinder. Gradfathered, I watched in spite of myself (seriously Christina Millian and Josh Peck were awful). That said, both shows had, largely, outstanding supporting casts. I really hope most of these actors move on to a new show soon! "
Bordertown,That sucks I enjoyed the Grinder and Grandfathered
Bordertown,"Not the grinder.  It was great.  

I guess the Grinder does rest. "
Bordertown,I loved Grandfathered a lot. That's the show I'm most upset about. 
Bordertown,"Grandfathered, meh, girlfriend enjoyed it but Grinder was genuinely funny and had even more potential, disappointed about that

I look forward to new sit coms about parents moving in with kids and kids going back to their small town next season ..."
Bordertown,"Didn't see this coming. Legitimately bummed about both of them, (yes I'm not acknowledging Bordertown's existence.)"
Bordertown,If Borderland got a second season I would've flipped.
Bordertown,Those are all terrible shows.
Bordertown,Kind of shocking indeed. I figured one between Grandfathered and The Grinder would make it. This looks to be the season where the Networks clean house.
Bordertown,I agree it was kind of a shock.

Bordertown,"Yeah, I actually liked Grandfathered."
Bordertown,"Likewise! I love Stamos and Peck, and I thought the side cast were really starting to shine. Definitely a show that had more potential."
Bordertown,Grandfathered and The Grinder are 2 of the few shows that my wife and I actually watch on cable.  Back to binge watching Netflix and CraveTV. 
Bordertown,"it was one of my favorite new shows. not gonna miss it *that* much, but I would've definitely watched a second season."
Bordertown,"I was already reeling finding out about the Grinder gong away, but losing Grandfathered as well? Now I'm just upset. What an awful day for great television, between those two, Agent Carter, and Galavant..."
Bordertown,Yeah I enjoyed it and felt it was just getting good. TV execs need to stop canceling shows after 1 season before a show can build an audience or find its identity 
Bordertown,And the way it ended makes it even saddeer
Bordertown,Dad Face was an awesome episode

Bordertown,Ya its definitely strange they both took the hit.  Do you think the fact that tv is in such a transitionary period is why theyre short-leashing every show?  Its like 'give us gold right away or die' kinda thing and maybe its cuz all the networks are strapped for $ and stressed and being outdone and aint got no time for patience?
Bordertown,"Cough, Crazy Ex Girlfriend, Cough.

Though I did like Grandfathered. It had heart. The son really brought the show together for me."
Bordertown,"The embrace of Meta ness of the show was great intelligent comedy. Thats someone I am sad to say some people might have not understood. The cast was really great too, not a single weak spot "
Bordertown,My only issue with Grinder is the way the utilized the grandad. He was only good one senile-like one liners
Bordertown,"I completely agree, all of this love for Grandfathered is so confusing to me when we're losing out on more Grinder :/ It really was surprisingly deep."
Bordertown,The Grinder was try hard smart. Grandfathered was good wholesome stuff with heart. 
Bordertown,"If you didn't get it it's likely since Arrested development is old and out of date, and everyone has maoved on since then.

There have been 50 good shows sonce than that were cancelled unjustly. Update your reference.

I mean, Arrested development came back."
Bordertown,"It's funny what having Seth MacFarlane's name attached will do for a show (yes, I know he didn't write for the series and just exec produced, but it's still name recognition)."
Bordertown,I feel like it got better as the show went on. Kinda like how American Dad and Bob's Burgers started off pretty weak. 
Bordertown,It got much better about halfway through. 
Bordertown,"I thought the same as well but around episode 5 it picked up and became really great. It took shots at everyone, it was satire, comedy and had amazing subtle jokes. "
Bordertown,I tried to watch one episode and it was awful.  I only watched it because I love Hank Azaria.
Bordertown,Does Paget Brewster really demand the big bucks?
Bordertown,"Do you mean ""curator""?"
Bordertown,"I thought the same as well but around episode 5 it picked up and became really great. It took shots at everyone, it was satire, comedy and had amazing subtle jokes.

"
Bordertown,"I'm pretty sure the main plot point in episode 1 the ""deportation cannon"" was taken from a  15 second american dad joke. Quality content. "
Bordertown,"Holy hell that seems like a show from years ago. Forgot it was a ""current"" show."
Bordertown,"I watched a few episodes of that, and just couldn't do it. I thought it was a decent idea, and was looking forward to it when it was called Frankenstein...and Lookinglass. "
Bordertown,*get him!*
Bordertown,Yes. Tis the season. Upfronts in a couple weeks so renewals/cancellations are upon us.
Bordertown,[deleted]
Bordertown,It certainly got better after about episode three. I really think it was just coming into its own. 
Bordertown,"Cartoon version of Blazing Saddles & All in the Family.

Edit:  And Airplane because of the rapid fire jokes."
Bordertown,">I mean, it was racist but it was usually pretty funny.

It was racist at face value but if you look into it, it was racist to show you how stupid racism is. Buck said racist stuff but then he was shown how he was wrong by the end of the episode and ended with him apologizing and spelling out of for the audience how racism is wrong and how it's wrong to prejudge people. Or they would have him say something racist and then show how idiotic of a person he was thus showing that racism is stupid. It was saying in so many words ""if you're racist you're wrong"" and ""if you're racist you're an idiot."" 

"
Bordertown,One of my problems was when he talks the black stuff on his chin don't move with his mouth making it look even uglier.
Bordertown,I don't really remember a network cancelling every single of their new comedies? I expected something similar to when NBC renewed The Mysteries of Laura for Season 2.
Bordertown,I felt the total opposite.
Bordertown,Yeah it was a little bumpy in the middle but towards the end it was really finding its groove.
Bordertown,Enjoyed them too but just to point out - these were both network shows. 
Bordertown,Those shows are on free tv channels.
Bordertown,I think alot of it has to do with netflix hulu and amazon. 
Bordertown,"Yeah, but it didn't have Birdgirl."
Bordertown,Hell yeah it did. That show took shots at everybody and I really liked that. And giving a shout out to la chancla was hilarious. 
Bordertown,"No, one of the co-creators. 

Edit -- oh ... I get it. Thanks, Bordertown."
Bordertown,[removed]
Bordertown,What are Upfronts?
Bordertown,They start monday
Bordertown,"It's funny because at the screening I was at, the co-creator said he was going to show us episode 7 or so, but that his harddrive failed so he had to show us episode 1. I wonder if I would have liked it more had I not seen that episode because it was garbage. "
Five Came Back,"Movies, documentaries, World War II?? I'll be there."
Five Came Back,"This time last year, I was pissed that Netflix was letting go of so many movies and shows. I thought as a service it was slipping hard. But lately, wow, they are really killing it. I was expecting D-grade things when they were going on and on about original programming. But this stuff is fantastic looking. "
Five Came Back,"TL;DW: Spielberg, Streep, Nazis.  You're gonna watch."
Five Came Back,"Ha, great timing. I just ordered this book a few days ago."
Five Came Back,"with the current state of affairs in america, i think we need to be reminded of Hitler now more than ever. "
Five Came Back,"Looks a bit masturbatory, but interesting nonetheless."
Five Came Back,[deleted]
Five Came Back,This has everything I want. Sign me up 
Five Came Back,"Neat, pity it'll miss the first few years of the war no doubt."
Five Came Back,When movies are made about making movies it feels a bit narcissist.
Five Came Back,"""These filmmakers changed the world"" LoL they are so full of themselves."
Five Came Back,Jeez....it's enough already with the World War II/Hitler stuff.
Five Came Back,I just finished it a few days ago and had no idea this was coming. Tarantino recommended the book and I'm glad I picked it up.
Five Came Back,"As a Mexican who disagrees with Trump's brand of populist rhetoric:


*SHUT UP AND THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK*


Trump is many things: a billionaire with thin skin; an incompetent micromanager; GWB with a loud mouth, but he isn't and has never been a fascist.

This whole ""Trump is new Hitler"" narrative is an obvious sign of progressive hysteria that does nothing but rile up the liberal progressive base and turns off any moderate with an ounce of critical thinking and self awareness.


Do you want to have bigger electoral losses in 2018 and 2020? Because harping this nonsense will definitely do that."
Five Came Back,"The quote in this trailer, paraphrased, ""If it weren't so evil it'd be comedy"" is especially pertinent now.  A lot of people are brushing off Trump and his government as buffoons, or ""crazy"", and that's dangerous.  Take this government takeover seriously because if you don't..."
Five Came Back,"Fucking hell, can you do me a favour and go research history?

This circlejerkery of 'Trump is hitler' is stupid and offensive to the millions of people who actually were murdered by Hitler. "
Five Came Back,LOL. Keep telling yourself that.
Five Came Back,"> ...sounds like they got an agenda here

What, a documentary with an agenda? Whoever heard of such a thing! We all know documentaries are the most impartial, best-recherched, and unbiased sources of all time. I mean, ""Documentary"" even sounds like ""Document"", so it must be true!"
Five Came Back,i get the feeling you have an agenda too
Five Came Back,"They did though. No one took Hitler seriously before the war. Everyone thought he was a temporary, idiotic aberration. For example, Charlie Chaplin said that one of his biggest regrets was making *The Great Dictator* because it helped contribute to Hitler's image as a buffoon."
Five Came Back,It's a documentary. Can movies not be the subject of a documentary?
Five Came Back,"It's about the filmmakers who filmed the War, they volunteered like everyone else. They were cameramen who went on to be great directors and their experiences are what made them make the movies they made. It is a great book."
Five Came Back,"When doctors operate on other doctors, is that narcissistic too?"
Five Came Back,"I always like to say ""you can be a pretty terrible person without being Hitler"""
Five Came Back,"well some people, myself included, would say that your argument does nothing but distract people from how awful trump is and by belittling my argument you could be blinding people from a true fascist takeover. im not saying its going to happen, im saying we should be watching for it.


people thought Hitler was great too until they didn't. "
Five Came Back,"I know I'm going to get a lot of shit for this, but I genually fear that trump is going to lead this country into something very similar to nazi Germany. "
Five Came Back,"I never said trump is hitler. I implied that trump and hitler have similarities, which they do. They both rose to power by ostracizing a minority and through passion fueled arguments. Hitler did it with the jews, trump did it with Mexicans and now Muslims. These are facts.  "
Five Came Back,Or the millions who survived it. 
Five Came Back,">This circlejerkery of 'Trump is hitler' is stupid and offensive to the millions of people who actually were murdered by Hitler.

I think Holocaust survivors would rather people be overly sensitive about the possible rise of fascism than have them be reluctant to recognize its warning signs. There are real concerns. "
Five Came Back,"Wow, you're the only smart one on this thread, most likely the whole sub"
Five Came Back,"It's as bad as the kids in /r/the_donald calling everyone cucks. 
"
Five Came Back,ok
Five Came Back,"You've been downvoted I agree with you somewhat because there are similarities for sure.  I don't think it's because Trump is a Nazi or anything but because the same tactics that worked then to create ultimate power will work (and are working) now to create ultimate power.  That's the goal, right?  The downside now is that any world war started ends with the destruction of the planet.  "
Five Came Back,"Mussolini. that's who you should be looking at. Trump is not like Hitler, but he's eerily similar to Mussolini. "
Five Came Back,"No they aren't real concerns, I actually know people who have survived the holocaust, not one of them thinks there is the slightest tie between Trump and Hitler, and the historians I know agree.

Amazing how my comment suddenly went to 0, when I was sitting on 10 not that long ago. Because all I was doing was saying trump isn't butler."
Five Came Back,That's an interesting thought. What similarities in particular do you draw with him? I'm asking because I genually don't know a whole lot about Mussolini. The main comparison I make to hitler is the ostracizing of a minority to gain political power. Hitler did it with the jews and trump did it with Mexicans and Muslims.      
Five Came Back,">I actually know people who have survived the holocaust

My grandfather was a survivor, I have a lot of family that died in the camps/survived the camps. There *are* real concerns, but I agree with you that automatically claiming ""Hitler!"" about Trump is not productive at all and I actually don't see Trump as Hitler in the slightest. But there *are* concerns with Trump on many levels and I don't think comparing Trump to Hitler trivializes the deaths of anyone in the Holocaust. Is it somewhat unfounded and perhaps overly cautious? Yes. But, to quote Dan Harmon, ""Maybe alarmism is only bad when false alarms outweigh actual danger.""

I agree with you that the Trump = Bad, Bad = Hitler, therefore Trump = Hitler argument is ridiculous. But comparing the demonization of the press or the upswing in crimes against certain ethnic groups to the rise of other fascist regimes is not ridiculous and it's vital that these comparisons continue to be made."
Five Came Back,"For a short synopsis google Trump vs Mussolini you'll find some good info. There was a salon article that was somewhat interesting, considering its salon.

If you're really interested I'd look into some books about the rise of Il Duce and what living in Italy was like during that time period. I highly recommend it because it's fascinating. I'm sure in our shared history there are lots of stories about guys rising to power this way, but Mussolini was the first well recorded rise, IMO.

Then watch the Mussolini speech Dwight gives to the paper sales conference. Because that was hilarious. 

https://youtu.be/kysRQP0ca7s"
Five Came Back,"Fair enough my man, I respect and understand the points you are raising.

There are definitely crucial differences, and I do believe that with Trump they don't exactly point towards a fascist future, but I totally see how you might see that."
Five Came Back,And people say internet civility is dead :)
Five Came Back,Wonderful 3 part series. The third part was unsettling and gave us a different point of view of how people adjusted after the war. 
Five Came Back,Reminds me a lot of Man In The High Castle’s credits. 
Five Came Back,"massively underexposed, the 3rd episode is incredibly affecting"
Five Came Back,Yes! It's fantastic
Five Came Back,"Narrated by Meryl Streep. 

I hope this revives Mrs Miniver. Such a powerful Dunkirk film. "
Five Came Back,Does show have scenes of war?
Five Came Back,It's a good show
Five Came Back,"The book this is based on is fantastic. Not only that, but it got me into The Best Years Of Our Lives, now one of my favorite films.    
I have to get to this series one day."
Five Came Back,"Whoever made this intro REALLY likes that one technique where you show one thing and zoom out to reveal that it's actually a part of something else, or cut to another similar-looking thing in the same part of the frame."
Five Came Back,"It’s literally about directors filming real war scenes, so yes, a lot."
Five Came Back,"Yes, I was over it half way through. "
Five Came Back,"I forgot this was coming out today, really excited to watch it this weekend."
Five Came Back,"Just watched the first episode. Hearing the modern directors talk about them is just amazing!

As a fan of cinema and history this couldn't be any better! I really like that Netflix added a lot of the films mentioned throughout."
Five Came Back,"Loved the 1st episode, cant wait to continue this."
Five Came Back,"Just finished watching the series and it was quite an amazing documentary. The experiences of Capra, Ford, Huston, Stevens, and Wyler during the Second World War were remarkable and watching their stories, as told by 5 other amazing filmmakers who could be considered their equivalents today, put into perspective how great the impact of their contributions were, not only in showing us how the war unfolded but also how it affected each every person involved. Truly a fantastic documentary. Kudos to Netflix and the creators of this documentary."
Five Came Back,It's really good. Very well edited. I love that these stories are told by the men who benefitted most from their work. They actually want to talk about them. Well done.
Five Came Back,"Just watched the first episode and it was way better than i expected, the quality of the clips its amazing!

And what really surprised me was netflix adding a bunch of the movies and propaganda films mentioned on the show

Great job netflix!"
Five Came Back,"Incredible series. I'm an Afghan vet, and I had to go take a shower suddenly to keep my wife from seeing me bawl my eyes out during the third episode. On another note, I have a movie list that's a half dozen titles long to watch now, many of which I'd heard of but never realized we're made with actual war footage or by the same directors as those gonna made during the war.  "
Five Came Back,Netflix only needs one or two more Hitler documentaries before they've fulfilled the History Channel's old shoes.
Five Came Back,"A tremendous documentary. I found George Stevens arc fascinating. He went from filming comedies and musicals to being present for arguably the most important moment to document in the war, the liberation of Dachau. 

The importance recording what was seen in those concentration camps is immeasurable. "
Five Came Back,"Only two episodes in, and I absolutely love it.  It's amazing listening to modern filmmakers give their take on what was essentially propaganda, though very, very well-made propaganda.  That shouldn't take away from the bravery that the original five showed through their dedication to the cause.

Though John Ford didn't necessarily land in the first wave like photographer Robert Capa (https://pro.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&ERID=24KL535353), it must have taken an incredible toll on him to see the events as they had unfolded, and were still unfolding."
Five Came Back,"I loved the first episode because it frightened me.  The scene where those kids are literally singing, ""Hitler is our Lord"", ""we live for Hitler"", ""We die for Hitler""... its scary to witness such cultish behavior.  "
Five Came Back,"I loved it.  A little interesting that they chose to release it in three parts rather than a 3 hour documentary, because I think it probably holds the most power when you watch the story unfold in one sitting.  They do a great job giving these five men satisfying arcs.  A great combination of fascinating Hollywood anecdotes, WWII footage and history and I think some well earned emotion in that final third.  "
Five Came Back,"My wife and I are 15 min into the 1st episode.  It seems very well done and compelling.
"
Five Came Back,Wanted to see if I was the only one who had a similar reaction to the third.

Five Came Back,"The BMW people talk about how they still get residuals today. They were just joking about getting another 9¢ check.

They actually just had an episode where they talked about it.  They got different amounts depending on where it aired."
Five Came Back,"All I know is Jaleel White came up with a brand of weed called ""Did I Do That"" and got rich again."
Five Came Back,"Absolutely, and even worse."
Five Came Back,"I don't have any specific knowledge to contribute, but there's a bit of a chicken and egg thing here.  Those shows pay non-stop because they're inexpensive to run. If the contracts were better negotiated, something else would be playing in their place."
Five Came Back,Aren’t these agreements governed by union contracts?  And don’t they have professional agents negotiating on their behalf?
Five Came Back,"Jodi Sweetin was on Steve-O’s podcast and briefly talked about her Full House residuals; it’s enough to pay a bill a month, but nothing else. She also talked about how Netflix pays out on their shows as well. The whole interview is really worth checking out."
Five Came Back,"It's Hollywood accounting.  According to CBS, ""Star Trek"" has yet to make a profit."
Five Came Back,"If you get more on the back end, you get less on the front end."
Five Came Back,"As actors, I think they caught a huge break. If they got screwed, they should talk to their legal guardians. There are industry groups and unions that do nothing but make sure that their members get a fair deal. If they didn't use those, their guardians should be sued."
Five Came Back,It’s the Nickelodeon and Disney kids that don’t get residuals.
Five Came Back,Lol isn’t it called purple urkel?
Five Came Back,"There is much truth to that. That is why I Love Lucy and Andy Griffith and many black and white sitcoms were a staple of tv reruns in the 70, 80's and 90's ,and many sitcoms post 1970 quickly faded after 1st run syndication. The agreement of the 1970 SAG strike excluded pre 1970 shows from residual pay for performers. Ironically we are seeing something similiar play out in real time,where streaming Networks to save money will start cutting recent shows  but back catalog shows will be fine because per the terms of contracts of most contracts signed 15-20 years ago they don't have to give them any residuals for streaming even if a show is popular because streaming did not exist."
Five Came Back,"They're supposed to be, but if the show is owned by (for example) Disney, and they sell it to ABC affiliates for $1.  What percentage of that goes to the actors?  Zilch."
Five Came Back,It’s weird I never really thought about it but I feel like millennials and older have knowledge of these old shows that the younger people haven’t been exposed to.
Five Came Back,"You'd be surprised perhaps, the younger kids are doing this thing where they get really into older media or time periods and make me feel OLD for not being into the stuff my parents were. Things kinda just work their way back in cycles, like clothing trends or hairstyles."
Five Came Back,"He had to go back, Kate."
Five Came Back,Retirement..interesting term for it.
Five Came Back,"Hey, that’s Racer X(who is actually Speed’s long-lost brother, Rex Racer ahhhHHHHH)!"
Five Came Back,He was phenomenal in Bone Tomahawk.
Five Came Back,He was really good in We Are Marshall.
Five Came Back,Jack Sheppard is one of the more underrated TV characters. I also think the lore of the concept of Lost itself detracts from how strong so many of the characters on that show were.
Five Came Back,"From the trailer, the show looks interesting, will check it out.

I'd love to see 'Lost' TV movie or limited series, a la 'The Day of the Doctor', 'Deadwood: The Movie', 'El Camino', 'Stargate: Continuum', in time for the show's 20th anniversary in 2024."
Five Came Back,Isn't he a raging asshole
Five Came Back,"He saw the constant ""Whatever happened to Matthew Fox?"" threads on reddit and he realized the people needed him back!"
Five Came Back,"Damn, what happened to him? 

Evangeline lily is the only one from lost that could shed her kate image 

The actor that plays Sawyer, what happened to him"
Five Came Back,His performance in Bone Tomahawk was excellent. Brooder was an aloof and merciless gunfighter in the vein of Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes.
Five Came Back,His best performance is his cameo in Smokin’ Aces
Five Came Back,retirement? i thought he just faded away
Five Came Back,He was fantastic on LOST and loved seeing his journey from man of science to a man of faith throughout that show.
Five Came Back,"I'm disappointed that the first line of the article isn't ""for the money""."
Five Came Back,"Fun press hit because it’s definitely chock full of talking points specifically tailored towards sharpening his image up a bit ahead of time. He forever earned my admiration with *LOST* and walking away from the business was a bold choice (IMO, he really wasn’t cancelled and his reasoning is/was true) — I **am** intrigued by his return and will give this a shot. Though the subject matter sounds a tad bit dry, but obviously relevant and important, perhaps the story is rich. They chose a weird headline, though, because “it’s good to be back” doesn’t exactly answer “why” anything, does it?"
Five Came Back,I still wanna see the WWZ cut with him in it
Five Came Back,"I was surprised he didn't take off, good actor."

The House That Made Me,"Clarke:

>“No! Can you forgive me? It’s too weird. I’m so happy it’s happening. I’m over the moon about all the awards…I just can’t do it. It’s so weird. It’s so strange. It’s kind of like someone saying, ‘You want to go to this school reunion that’s not your year? Want to go to that school reunion?’ That’s how it feels. I’m avoiding it.”"
The House That Made Me,I watch your ancestors fuck
The House That Made Me,The analogy re: going to a school reunion that isn't your year is spot on.
The House That Made Me,"Makes sense. Once you make something, you don't find a lot of joy in watching it yourself. The illusion is shattered and it's hard to watch the show without thinking about the rest of the context. She'll never see the dragons as dragons, just green stuffed pillows and it'll be ridiculous to her."
The House That Made Me,"A very creative way to say ""please, enough with the Game of Thrones questions""

I love that universe, but the fans can be very assholes, always comparing actresses and putting their least favorites ones. And people scrutinize every answer the actors give."

The House That Made Me,I’m right there with her! I only watched the premiere and then I dropped it. Haven’t watched a second since then.
The House That Made Me,This is code for everything from the second to last season on is garbage in comparison to what came before.
The House That Made Me,It’s trauma from the main show. I forgive her for what they did to her

The House That Made Me,"Lol she is so animated in real life, I bet she would be great in Dreamworks cartoon if they took her likeness and voiceover."
The House That Made Me,Smart woman
The House That Made Me,It’s like asking the Saved By the Bell cast if they are watching Saved By the Bell: The New Class
The House That Made Me,"Same. But after the complete disappointment of the GoT finale, I can't invest in another one of these damn storylines. We all know how it ends."
The House That Made Me,10 hours of time she can’t get back. Show is absolute ass
The House That Made Me,She is so done with GOT.
The House That Made Me, It’s understandable
The House That Made Me,She is a smart woman.
The House That Made Me,The show about a family of incestuous dragon tamers’ drama is weird? Say whaaaat /s
The House That Made Me,Good for her. I couldn't get through the 1st ep. GOT is over for me.
The House That Made Me,Its almost as if being in the show doesn't automatically mean you're a fan.
The House That Made Me,"Emlia Clarke seems to be charming lovely person in interviews and a thoroughly indifferent actress, like a Bizarro Harrison Ford."
The House That Made Me,"Well I mean....I am not even gonna lie, if you asked me about her taste in media, I wouldn't even say that she watches fantasy shows just because she was on one. 

I think this might be code for her just not being interested in it in general."
The House That Made Me,I know how she feels. I refuse to watch the last three episodes of Game of Thrones. I’ve never seen them.
The House That Made Me,Who writes these fucking titles? Is re-reading that difficult?
The House That Made Me,S8 remake
The House That Made Me,Forgive? Why should we care what someone does or doesn’t watch
The House That Made Me,"Of course!  She won't watch it without me, she's saving it for our Netflix and Chill night

Any day now, any day..."
The House That Made Me,She's not missing much. No heroes or mystery. No reason to really care about all the petty sociopaths. No desire whatsoever to buy any merch.
The House That Made Me,"She's not missing much, I didn't even finish the season."
The House That Made Me,"Someone doesn't like the show that I do, or even just doesn't want to watch it.  So?  I'm an adult, I don't need everyone to be a carbon copy of me."
The House That Made Me,"Most actors don't even watch their own shows, much less the spinoffs they aren't even in."
The House That Made Me,Her platinum blonde hair and dark brown caterpillar eyebrows always threw me off enough to where it seemed too silly/unrealistic to watch. Who gives a shit.
The House That Made Me,"Variety.com
OP you must have a very boring life if you read that shit.

I couldn't fucking care less if Emilia didn't watch house of the dragon."
The House That Made Me,"She's got a point if we're being honest. House of the Dragon is a boring, badly performed mess."
The House That Made Me,Imagine sitting there and watching dragonshit when you could do something better with your time.
The House That Made Me,I think the new show is no threat to her legacy.  Not even in the ballpark. 😂
The House That Made Me,"Don’t waste your time, Em."
The House That Made Me,Is she watching The Last of Us?
The House That Made Me,cant blame her. hotd is shit.
The House That Made Me,"Me too, Emilia. Me too."
The House That Made Me,I don't blame her.
The House That Made Me,"what is there to forgive about? 

i also wish i had not seen house of dragon, but my girlfriend tricked me in saying it was good once the season was over. so i watched it afterwards. what a terrible mistake that was. it was like watching a reality tv show with housewives being pregnant. 

the only man in that movie, was that young kid who said i lost an eye but gained a dragon. other then that there was nothing bad ass about it.

Johnny Lawrence"
The House That Made Me,Being invited to another schools prom /homecoming. Familiar but different
The House That Made Me,"Im with her, but cause got ending put a poor taste in my mouth. So im gonna wait till its over to watch it"
The House That Made Me,What the fuck is house of the dragon?
The House That Made Me,She didn't miss anything. I stopped watching it myself halfway thru the 4th episode.
The House That Made Me,"She was always the worst part of GoT, especially early on. Not completely her fault, but her B story was awful."
The House That Made Me,Not going to lie.  Without Emila Clarke terrible acting.  The House of the Dragon is at least watchable.  Unlike the last couple of GOT seasons.
The House That Made Me,"I'm just waiting on the time travel plot where after Daemon does his thing to Aemon, he ends up 200 years in the future and hooks up with a resurrected Dany"
The House That Made Me,"Some of us couldn't even finish it Emilia, you don't require forgiveness"
The House That Made Me,"The poor woman's got PTSD from the GoT ending, no doubt. Why would she want to punish herself by re-entering that universe?

Incidentally, I liked Emilia in that movie where she works as an elf in a Christmas shop. She was so nice in that."
The House That Made Me,She's not ready to watch it unless she knows they ended it perfectly.
The House That Made Me,"Let's find a way to turn this into her complaining about season 8.

*Grabs the nearest phallus*"
The House That Made Me,"Show some respect, that's your family s history"
The House That Made Me,PTSD thanks to dumb and dumber
The House That Made Me,Yup! I’m with Clarke on this one.
The House That Made Me,"I don’t blame her for not wanting to get into a show that will likely set us up for another terrible finale down the road. 

We had to change the name of our Wi-Fi network after the GoT series finale."
The House That Made Me,">No! Can you [forgive me]?” Clarke said when asked about watching “House of the Dragon.” “It’s too weird. I’m so happy it’s happening. I’m over the moon about all the awards… I just can’t do it. It’s so weird. It’s so strange. It’s kind of like someone saying, ‘You want to go to this school reunion that’s not your year? Want to go to that school reunion?’ That’s how it feels. I’m avoiding it.”"
The House That Made Me,"If Emilia Clark wasn't one of the most charming adorable people IRL, I'd have a harder time forgiving her."
The House That Made Me,"I'm still not watching it, George."
The House That Made Me,"I won't watch it either, can I get attention for it?"
The House That Made Me,Ok?
The House That Made Me,The casting choices are weird
The House That Made Me,"I imagine it has to bring up a lot of weird grief. She had to spend a lot of time in Dany’s head and heart as an actress, being the last Targaryen with the last dragons. Seeing this series is almost a reminder of everything Dany’s lost; it’s everything she longed for. And then there’s how things ended for her… when you’re acting, your body can’t always tell the difference. She’s been through a lot to become the mother of dragons, etc. So, I don’t blame her for feeling weird about HotD, tbh. It makes sense."
The House That Made Me,Why is the title to this post written so poorly?
The House That Made Me,"what an absolute non-story, it must be a peaceful day on Earth today"
The House That Made Me,I can’t watch it either. I’m still too hurt from the last season of GoT.
The House That Made Me,It was terrible so she’s making a good choice. Episode 7 and on were pure pain to watch.
The House That Made Me,"She’ll only be known for that role, so not surprised she’s pretentious about it."
The House That Made Me,[deleted]
The House That Made Me,"I agree with her. While it is a good show well acted, it doesn't have the risque nor powerful characters GoT had."
The House That Made Me,"I don’t think she cares for GOT tbh, publicly she has to, I think she was done with it in season 2."
The House That Made Me,Damn that says loads. You only feel that way if you are embarrassed. It’s more like saying I choose not to go to this family reunion because I think half the family are conspiracy driven nut bags.
The House That Made Me,"I’m right there with her. I didn’t watch GoT because I’ve never had any interest, so I obviously have even less interest in this."
The House That Made Me,I think it's weird that she feels that way to be honest.
The House That Made Me,"Ehh, whatever. We all pick and choose what show as we want to watch anyways, for whatever reason we want. That being said she’s missing out on some great television"
The House That Made Me,I can't watch it either. I tried and probably will try again. After all it is GOT and the 11th Doctor.
The House That Made Me,"Dr. Who cast will continue watching Dr. Who. But I don't judge her nor should anyone else, it's her life. She's not being rude by not watching it. There are Hollywood stars that dont even watch TV/Movies except on rare occasions after they become famous except when they have to. It's very rare, but it happens. Should they be judged for not consuming the product of their industry? 

The title is so shit.. it makes it seem like she disapproves thus the hate bandwagon can proceed forward.."
The House That Made Me,"I mean the way they did her character in the end, I don't blame her at all.

Good show, tho."
The House That Made Me,She compared it to going to a high school reunion that wasn’t for your graduating class. Let her do her own thing.
The House That Made Me,"I forgive her and if she ever changes her mind, she's got an open invitation to come hang with me and we'll watch it together."
The House That Made Me,"I didn't even watch game of thrones, you're forgiven. Now let's talk about Terminator Genesys .... :|"
The House That Made Me,She's so gracious and lovely.  I get it.
The House That Made Me,"Well shes missing out , So far it is as strong as any early episodes from GOT Season 1-4."
The House That Made Me,Looks like someone’s got a case of the jellies
The House That Made Me,And why should we care?
The House That Made Me,"She would really dislike seeing the absolute masterclass in Targaryen woman acting, considering how fucking deadfaced she was the entirety of GOT"
Timeless,Absolutely magnetic in 24. I thought she was destined for big things. 45 is far too young.
Timeless,"Leaves behind 3 kids, one 12, one 9 and one 4 year old. Damn, fuck cancer."
Timeless,She also played that cult leader and mother of that shining girl in Marvel’s Runaways. Never knew she was Tess. Damn
Timeless,"The original Tess from **'The Last of Us'**.

I can't believe she's gone."
Timeless,"To think, her very first role as an actress was guest-starring on *Star Trek: Enterprise* in 2002.

20 years later, another Trek series would be one of her final roles (as the Borg Queen in *Picard*).

Fucking cancer."
Timeless,That's really sad to hear. She was terrific in 24 and in The Last of Us. Fuck Cancer
Timeless,Wow. She was interesting in The Rookie. She played bad pretty well.
Timeless,"I was just checking her imdb page yesterday, hoping to see her appear in The Last Of Us, I didn't know about her cancer. I really loved her in 24. Rest In Peace."
Timeless,"Wow. I remember bumping into her near the Northridge Mall when *Runaways* was shooting over at CSUN during its second season. We happened to be waiting for food next to each other and she'd complimented, of all things, a pair of Vans I was wearing; we actually straight up chatted for a bit, me hiding the fact I knew who she was because I was a *Runaways* fan and also recognized her from a few other things, but I remember she was just such a colossal sweetheart and was excitedly proud of something one of her little boys had done recently. This sucks. 45 is *nothing*, especially considering I'm just a little over a decade younger than her and *I* still feel incredibly young, and I can't imagine what her family must be going through."
Timeless,"I was just explaining to my wife the other day about how she originated the role that Anna Torv plays on ""The Last of Us"".  She was also fantastic on ""The Vampire Diaries"" and ""Timeless"".  So sad.  She was so young."
Timeless,"Shit, I loved her in season 7 of 24. One of my favourite characters in the whole show."
Timeless,"RIP

I knew she was familiar, she was a member of Rittenhouse on Timeless. She was also the Borg Queen in ST:Picard."
Timeless,"She was always a highlight in every show she appeared on, one of my favorite tv actors. Fuck cancer."
Timeless,"She was really good in 24.  And as a creepy psychopath in Castle as well.  

RIP."
Timeless,One of those actors who was never a star but who you were always glad to see pop up in the guest star credits. 45 is far too young. RIP.
Timeless,That’s horrible news. So young!
Timeless,She was fantastic as the Borg queen.
Timeless,Feels so surreal to hear news about celebrities you've watched during your teenage and early 20s pass away. She was great on 24 and Bosch. RIP.
Timeless,"She's one of my favorite actresses.She's amazing in 24, The Rookie, The vampire diaries and more...
She's good at playing a villain though I love her as Rene.

RIP."
Timeless,Damn that sucks
Timeless,RIP. I loved her on The Vampire Diaries and she was the main reason I watched Bosch
Timeless,"Her character in the show 24 appeared in season 7 and 8. Half way through season 8, it was already confirmed that 24 would stop being on TV after the end of season and the producers wanted to end the series with a movie. At that time I read an interview of hers talking about her character and season 8 overall. At the end of the interview, she was asked about the movie. She said she would love to in and it would be so cool for her character to appear, etc. The next day a new episode of 24 aired, and guess what, >!her character was shot and killed. I was so fooled.!< Good job and RIP Annie Wersching."
Timeless,"That’s sad, I was just watching her as the Borg queen on ST:Picard today"
Timeless,"Shit, she was so young"
Timeless,Fuck cancer.
Timeless,She was great in *24* and *Picard*. Rest in Peace.
Timeless,"She was such a great actress. I've seen her in so many shows including:

•NCIS

•Castle

•The Vampire Diaries

•Timeless

•Runaways

•Bosch

•The Rookie"
Timeless,She's a key reason season 7 was one of the better seasons of 24 and I always hoped she'd go on to bigger and better things. This is sad.
Timeless,"Stunned to hear about this, I thought she was great in the main 24 season she was in. Seemed like a very genuine, nice person too from what I saw of her in interviews. 

Apparently has 3 sons. 45 is so young, RIP."
Timeless,She was a great substitute for Alice Krige as the Borg Queen on *Picard.* Uncanny how much she looked like Krige with the makeup.
Timeless,Omg! I loved her in 24. That’s awful.
Timeless,"Genuinely stunned reading this headline. Had just looked her up again the other day. The OG Tess right here; one hell of a performer. 

Fuck cancer :("
Timeless,"She was a friend for over 25 years. Seriously one of the most incredible people I’ve ever known - almost impossibly big-hearted. I was lucky to share a stage with her back in college, and to see her often living in LA. I also had no clue. I feel like I’ve been hit by a truck. My heart breaks for her poor family."
Timeless,"WHAT


she was **not** anywhere near my celebrity death guesses


FUCK CANCER


that explains why she wasn't Tess in The Last Of Us"
Timeless,She was talented actress. I hate that her life was cut short
Timeless,"Fuck, I just saw this on Twitter. I'm stunned. I loved her in 24. My condolences to her family."
Timeless,I really wanted her character and Bosch to stay together.
Timeless,"It's not often a celebrity death really hits me when I see the headline, but damn this one was so out of nowhere. Had to re-read it to make sure I was seeing it right."
Timeless,"I can’t help but think she had a lot of fun filming Timeless. I thoroughly enjoyed her in that too.

EDIT: I just watched a few of her episodes on Timeless. She is fabulous."
Timeless,A great example of a good working actor. Never really the star of anything but made her mark in every role she had especially in genre shows. I’ll miss her not popping up in another series and then another and another.
Timeless,"I’m shocked and unexpectedly devastated by this news.

I first saw Annie on television 13 years ago when she co-starred in *24* for its 7th and 8th seasons. She was immense, holding her own alongside the legendary Kiefer Sutherland (no small feat) and revitalising a series that was on the decline. I remember her performance as Renee Walker for its effortless stage presence and gravitas. She poured all she had into the role, imbuing the character with a toughness and fierceness that was counterpoised by enormous compassion, empathy, and altruism – all qualities I suspect Annie herself possessed in spades. The same could be said for her brief yet superlative motion-capture/voice performance as Tess in *The Last of Us*.

Like Renee and Tess, Annie died tragically and far too soon, leaving behind a husband and three children whom she visibly cherished and adored. She never made it ‘big’ as an actress, but she was far greater than the sum of her parts and integral to the success of the projects she worked on – from *24* and *The Last of Us* to *Star Trek* and *The Runaways* to *Timeless* and many more. My thoughts are with her family, friends, and colleagues today whose grief must be immeasurable. Those of us who watched and loved her work share a small portion of that loss today.

Vale Annie. You will always be Renee Walker to me."
Timeless,wait what?
Timeless,Fuck cancer.
Timeless,"Loved her character in 24. It was nice seeing her years later in Bosch. 

RIP"
Timeless,She was lovely. RIP and also...Fuck cancer!
Timeless,"Rewatching 24 and this is so sad, 45 is way too young and was wondering why she wasn't in bigger projects.

May she rest in peace."
Timeless,I remember her very fondly. I worked on Timeless with her and she was so lovely. All I can think about is her children. She was pregnant when we last worked together a few years back. RIP.
Timeless,"RIP =(

She was one of the biggest highlights of the final couple of seasons for 24"
Timeless,Major bummer - she was great on 24. My deepest condolences go out to her and her family.
Timeless,"RIP. She had a great theme in 24 too:

https://youtu.be/ANQdtg8oXhM"
Timeless,"Can’t believe this.

Timeless is a guilty pleasure that I’ve watched through twice. And 24 too. Damn man. She’s a wonderful actress"
Timeless,Fuck you cancer
Timeless,"She also played Rosalyn Dyer, the psychopathic serial killer in the Rookie and the Borg queen in Season 2 of Picard."
Timeless,"She was only just in The Recruit.

V sad.

**[Edit]** - The Rookie, not The Recruit. 🤦🏻‍♂️"
Timeless,"Here she is covering Snoop Dogg with her nose :)
@5:20
https://youtu.be/aM43-hkr3NI"
Timeless,I'm so sad! She was always showing up in everything I watched. It hurts my heart thinking about that not happening anymore.
Timeless,"Very sad news, she was great as Tess and I remember her from 24 (probably second best female character after Chloe) and several other shows. Fuck cancer."
Timeless,This is truly devastating. This really breaks my heart. She was amazing in The Last of Us and 24. She also had some great guest roles on The Rookie and Castle.
Timeless,She was great in 24 and The Last Of Us. RIP.
Timeless,"I had no idea she was sick : ( 

45? That's so young."
Timeless,RIP. She was great as Renee in 24. I had a crush on her as a teenager at the time.
Timeless,She was always great on shows she showed up... I didn't know about her health. Will always remember her roles on 24 and recently The Rookie. It's a real shame.
Timeless,Amazing actress .. loved her role in 24 and Timeless.. Fuck cancer
Timeless,"Sounds like she was something special.  Heartbreaking.

Wersching’s husband, actor Stephen Full, issued a statement. “There is a cavernous hole in the soul of this family today. But she left us the tools to fill it. She found wonder in the simplest moment. She didn’t require music to dance. She taught us not to wait for adventure to find you. ‘Go find it. It’s everywhere.’ And find it we shall.  As I drove our boys, the true loves of her life, down the winding driveway and street, she would yell BYE! until we were out of earshot and into the world. I can still hear it ringing. Bye my Buddie. ‘I love you little family…’ “"
Timeless,I absolutely hate Star Trek Picard but she was one of the few good things about it. I don't remember her other role from Star Trek Enterprise but she certainly made the Borg Queen her own which is not an easy feat considering how great the previous actresses were. Rest in peace. Cancer sucks.
Timeless,I liked her in 24
Timeless,"Man, she was great on Castle and on the Rookie. F cancer :("
Timeless,Damn shame.  45 is too young to die from cancer.
Timeless,Fuck cancer
Timeless,"Damn, that explains why she hasn't been in that much in the last little while except for Picard and The Rookie.  Wow I guess she was filming those while battling cancer, that's nuts."
Timeless,This is so sad 😞. Gorgeous too.
Timeless,"Her [goFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/for-annies-boys-freddie-ozzie-and-archie) page dedicated towards raising money for her kids has collected over 130k in just a few hours with a goal being 250k 

RIP PRETTY LADY!"
Timeless,"I was just rewatching S7 of 24 again in the first time in years last night and thought of her. How very sad. I didn't know she was that young, she was only in her 20s on that show. It's difficult to grasp because she was so young and beatutiful, and now she's just gone. As opposed to someone looking like a mess for years like Nick Nolte where you get what the outcome will be."
Timeless,R.I.P Annie
Timeless,"Just finished watching her story ark on the rookie, gutted for her and her family"
Timeless,Sad news and at a young age.
Timeless,Rest in peace. She was wonderful as Renee Walker
Timeless,"Well, that certainly ruined my day."
Timeless,"RIP, talented actor."
Timeless,That’s sucks. She was in like everything we watched. Too young. RIP
Timeless,She was so good in 24. So sad to see her gone so young!
Timeless,May she RIP.
Timeless,Horrible to hear. She has 3 young kids - hopefully her husband gets the support he needs and wants.
Timeless,What a stunning woman.  Fuck you cancer.  Fuck you hardcore.
Timeless,Also made an appearance in [Charmed](https://youtu.be/XeHKczYEr-Y)
Timeless,Fucking cancer
Timeless,So tragic. Rest in peace to her soul and I pray for strength to her family and loved ones.
Timeless,Damn that's so young.:(
Timeless,She was also Tess in the Last of Us video game
Timeless,Man...she was phenomenal as Dr. Nieman in Castle and as Roslalind in The Rookie. I personally haven't seen any of her roles in Star Trek. Very sad news.
Timeless,I’m sad about her passing she pulled off a great Borg Queen
Timeless,loved her in star trek! the borg queen!♥️ RIP beautiful talented lady..
Timeless,I wish they would say which cancer she had. I am also a woman in my 40s with cancer (breast) and these things concern me… reminds me there’s a limit to what medicine can do.
Timeless,Fuck cancer man
Timeless,One of my biggest crushes. When I wrote my TV series(later turned into a novel) I imagined her as the leads mother which made it so much easier to write...was the ultimate dream to one day get my novel turned into a series with her being cast.
Timeless,This made me very sad. Fuck cancer.
Timeless,"I’ll miss her. I first saw her as Tess from tlou when I was much younger. It was sad enough to see her during the game (her performance was phenomenal), but seeing this makes it much worse. Fuck cancer"
Timeless,Jack Bauer will find who's responsible for this and make them pay
Timeless,"Far too young to go. I have seen the effect losing a parent can have on children so young. I do feel for them. 

Now I don't want to sound heartless but the article states ""A GoFundMe has been launched to support the family."" Is donating money to the families of Hollywood actors who get/have gotten consistant work is a thing we do now?"
Timeless,"Somewhat bizarre to me that Tess just died in the TV series and now the original actress is gone. Terrible loss, RIP."
Chesapeake Shores,"I don’t know why but I love putting the Hallmark Christmas movies on in the background. Sure, they’re cliche as all hell, but they still have a certain charm to them, and they get me in the Christmas mood."
Chesapeake Shores,Omg good witch is so boring. Nothing ever happens and she has the same facial expression and emotion in every situation
Chesapeake Shores,I kinda want a Dinotopia reboot but I'm afraid Hallmark would changing it to fit with their Hallmark romance genre
Chesapeake Shores," We need more Aurora Teagarden mysteries, please."
Chesapeake Shores,"I wish they'd renew *When Hope Calls*, but it's not looking for a season #2 of that one at this point..."
Chesapeake Shores,My Aunts will be thrilled.
Chesapeake Shores,This Hallmark thing is so weird from the perspective of an Australian. I’ve heard it’s all trash but it also probably has higher budgets than anything we on tv over here.
Chesapeake Shores,Not more sappy holiday movies!
Chesapeake Shores,"I so desperately want to like them, but I just can’t stomach the formulaic storylines."
Chesapeake Shores,I watch it when I’m super stressed. I never realized her fave doesn’t change... damn...
Chesapeake Shores,I wish *Hallmark* meant now what it meant in the early 2000's.
Chesapeake Shores,"Trash...no. Just all basically the same, romance, romance, trouble, more romance-even with the Christmas movies. Higher budget? definitely not. They cost less, so they can make a lot of them. Not cheaply made, but easily made."
Chesapeake Shores,"Hey, again that’s why I find them charming in a way. All so predictable. But I most likely don’t throw them on for the story, again moreso to get that Christmas mood going."
Chesapeake Shores,At this point Hallmark should sell the rights to it a lot of companies and people were interested in doing Dinotopia projects before Hallmark got the rights like Disney (their Dinotopia project ended up becoming the movie Dinosaur) and George Lucas (it's rumoured that he used some of the concepts for his cancelled Dinotopia project for the architecture of Naboo in the Star Wars prequels)
Chesapeake Shores,I know somebody who's weird aunt is going to be super excited! 
Chesapeake Shores,"Oh cool, I remember stocking those books at work "
Nexo Knights,Z nation
Nexo Knights,i liked She Hulk personally.
Nexo Knights,No Ordinary Family
Nexo Knights,Not really that low of a score but I love Legends of Tomorrow
Nexo Knights,The librarians
Nexo Knights,The Tomorrow People - the remake one.
Nexo Knights,"Well that's easy. Velma, 1.4/10."
Nexo Knights,I actually dont have one. When it comes to movies a lot of 90s movies are way too low rated. But tv shows I dont know. All tv shows under 7.5 are bad or not good enough for me.
Nexo Knights,"Recently, Gannibal (7.4), Midnight Mass (7.7) and Bly Manor (7.4). They are all great shows and I don't get how they can be under 8 tbh. I'm sure there are more, especially when it comes to Asian shows, but these are the firsts that comes to my mind right now."
Nexo Knights,Nightflyers
Nexo Knights,She-Hulk was really fun.
Nexo Knights,"[Same, I find the rating to be harsh.](https://i.imgur.com/gr4eRR6.png)

I mean, '2 Broke Girls' has a better rating."
Nexo Knights,That just got review bombed by a certain demographic because it upset them.
Nexo Knights,Does that show end on a cliffhanger?
Nexo Knights,Eh being in the 7.0+ isn't awful on IMDB. Especially 7.4 upwards
Nexo Knights,2 broke girls was horrible. She-Hulk was fun and by the end of the show the main character had actually learned lessons and become a better person.
Nexo Knights,It’s a shame that some people with valid criticism got buried under a load of angry losers spamming the 1/10.
Nexo Knights,"It's entirely reasonable to criticize the show, the Cgi was not good. Despite that I still enjoyed it a lot. Definitely not a 1, but I could someone saying 3 even 2 and meaning it."
Nexo Knights,Fair
