TV Show,Comment

The Lost Art,I've never seen the show but one time I accidentally lightly bumped into Andrew Rannells in The Commodore in Brooklyn while trying to order their excellent fried chicken around 11pm one Friday about a decade ago. He got pissed and threw what we believe to be a hurricane on me. 0/10 Would not recommend.
The Lost Art,"Yeah.  ""A show was good and then became bad"".  It's actually kind of a good reminder why a two-hour premise doesn't need to become a five season series."
The Lost Art,"It’s so weird almost no one is taking about this show. I don’t get it, it’s not like there are many tv series of this caliber on the air right now.

/r/Counterpart has like 500 subscribers. What?

I feel like I’m in some weird parallel universe."
The Lost Art,Is this the show with j jonah jameson? Any good? 
The Lost Art,"This show is great. 

It’s on Crave TV in Canada if anyone is wondering. 

Well worth it so far. "
The Lost Art,"I shit pretty hard on the second episode (it deserved it in my opinion), but this episode was a major improvement and renewed my optimism about the show turning out well. "
The Lost Art,I am loving this show. 
The Lost Art,Cord cutters certainly dont have access to the channel
The Lost Art,"Having watched all three episodes, I'm honestly shocked at how good it is. J. K. Simmons is amazing, and the rest of the cast is great too. The writing doesn't let it down, either; the characters are interesting and the plot is compelling. The mystery and intrigue is actually, well, intriguing. At this rate, as long as it doesn't completely shit the bed, it will be one of my absolute favorite ongoing shows before the end of the season. And it's already renewed for season 2, so Starz clearly has confidence in it."
The Lost Art,"cast also has Olivia Williams and Richard Schiff (Toby Ziegler from The West Wing).  and the writing is crisp -- imagine Fringe crossed with John LeCarre spy fiction

ETA:  the show has its own sub at r/Counterpart -- already reasonably active for such a new show"
The Lost Art,"I've seen the first two episodes, it's great so far. "
The Lost Art,Very good. A bit like the good parts of *Lost* the unpeeling of the layers of an onion. Let's just hope the writers have an actual idea where they are going.
The Lost Art,I like it quite a bit but it's an extreme slow burn. It's like Homeland meets Fringe. 
The Lost Art,It is excellent.
The Lost Art,It's on Starz. Cord cutters can get Starz. 
The Lost Art,[deleted]
The Lost Art,How
The Lost Art,"> Given how no-one seems to be talking about this show

That's seems to be normal about Starz shows. There's always barely discussion about them. "

You can also add it to your Amazon Prime subscription. "
The Lost Art,Oooo thanks
The Lost Art,Captain Jack Harkness and Rory Williams in the same scene? Sign me up.

The Lost Art,So if LoT is moving to Tuesday is Flash moving to Thursday?
The Lost Art,where the fuck is arrow trailer﻿
The Lost Art,People who gave up on this show after season one should give it a shot now. Season 2 is really  good. It has no boring and forced drama unlike other Cw shows.And that Vixen girl is amazing. 
The Lost Art,This is the funnest show on TV. 
The Lost Art,"It's pretty  funny that this episode shares the name of a Gossip Girl episode of all things..
"
The Lost Art,Could have happened in A Good Man Goes to War but [Barrowman](http://i837.photobucket.com/albums/zz298/sleepy_orange/Gifs/Barrowman.gif) was busy filming Torchwood Miracle Day. 
The Lost Art,"In the stinger from the previous episode, they showed a character directing on a movie set. Also this episode might take place in the 80s. There might be more overt references in the episode itself, but the title is probably mostly a fun callback."
The Lost Art,"No, LoT will air right after Flash to get more viewership"
The Lost Art,I'm just glad the show has got back to quality enough that we actually want trailers for it again!
The Lost Art,"Yeah, the show was ok season one but season two is such a big improvement. It's a really fun show and the mix of characters is so much better. Despite missing Michael Snow field who is the only one I miss. Which is not to say the show isn't better with out him in the mix because Lincoln Burn-rows is really entertaining and can now burn bright."
The Lost Art,"I was more annoyed with how little regard they give to the time traveling. Fuck treating it with anything that could tangentially be referred to as logic. Even considering the inherently problematic nature of it, they did a terrible job. 

After the recent clusterfuck of a crossover they just dropped me in the middle of, I have stopped watching DC's shows altogether. Supergirl was never that good anyway, and Flash was on the verge of losing me after this Flashpoint nonsense."
The Lost Art,I only watched the first episode this season. Finally got sick of the Olicity drama. Does Felicity get killed off? That's the only way I'd watch again
The Lost Art,You can't look for any semblance of time travel logic in Legends of Tomorrow. If you do you're just gonna frustrate yourself. Just gotta sit back and go with whatever timey wimey rules they're making up on the spot. Much more enjoyable that way. 
The Lost Art,"They aren't together this season. They've gone to the basics, season 1 type stuff. The new team does take some time getting used to though. He's killing again too!"
The Lost Art,"Wish they would've kept this on Thursdays, I loved having 4 nights in a row of DC shows to watch.Still though this show is tons of fun, it fully accepts how ridiculous the premise is and just goes with it. One episode they're preventing the assassination of King Louis XIV, the next they're freeing slaves and fighting alongside Ulysses S. Grant against CONFEDERATE ZOMBIES, and then infiltrating a speakeasy and fighting against Al Capone and the Chicago mob. It's the stupidest shit but somehow it works."
The Lost Art,"This show gives no shits and I love it. Especially considering the entirety of this season of The Flash so far as been about scolding Barry for messing with the past. The Legends probably cause more damage than they fix and it's all good. That's how you should treat time travel sci fi like this. This isn't Looper or Terminator or serious sci fi, it's a fun DCW show and it knows it."
The Lost Art,"The two Darin Morgan episodes were by far the best two of the revival. They weren't the only good ones - his brother had some good ones too, especially the one in the sushi restaurant - but they were the standouts."
The Lost Art,"It is shocking that Darin Morgan never made his own shows or movies but from what I've gathered he has to be kind of forced to write by his brother lol

His episodes are always hilarious & it's amazing how the show could balance the serious episodes with the funny episodes."
The Lost Art,The whole Dr. They scene is amazing
The Lost Art,I need to binge watch this show in its entirety.
The Lost Art,"I'm almost done with my first watch through and saw this ep last week - completely agree. Might even be a top 3 episode for me. It was just so cerebral and clever and deep and perfectly wrapped in satire and humor. 

Darin Morgan has made only a few X-files episodes (maybe only a few eps of TV in general) but the tone he is able to capture is so crucial to understanding the variety of style that show was able to lean into throughout the years."
The Lost Art,"The lost art of title credits humor, as well"
The Lost Art,"I can always tell the Darin Morgan episodes without even checking. They are some of the strongest, with such crazy meta humor that you have to make sure you're still watching X-Files."
The Lost Art,"> the one in the sushi restaurant

Going into that episode knowing AI was gonna be targeting them, I was actually expecting it to be a clever tie all the way back to season one’s “Ghost in the Machine,” which left off with the AI they encountered and thought they destroyed surviving. On one hand, I was slightly disappointed it *didn’t* circle back around to it, but on the other, I was happy it didn’t because the reveal that all of it happened over the refusal to tip and finally stopped when 10% was given was great."
The Lost Art,"Agreed, paid so much tribute to everything that makes the show great, but added so much of his own flavour also. It all just worked so well together."
The Lost Art,I rewatched the episode immediately after.
The Lost Art,It’s well worth it.
The Lost Art,Guess I’m watching it again 😂
The Lost Art,"Man, that episode was a trip. It's like it didn't even belong in that season, it was like it's own standalone short film, or an episode of Black Mirror.

 I think that's when the X Files is at its strongest, when it gives the writers the ability to just fuck around and do whatever they want within a single episode"
The Lost Art,"I think about this show often, mostly because it gave us Sebastian Stan.

A couple highlights from the article:

-One of the NBC presidents having virtually no recollection or interest in the show.

-The showrunner learning to never compromise from Bryan Fuller. Because Fuller's methods always make for such smooth productions.

-NBC reusing some of the shows abandoned marketing concepts for... The Cape. Fucking lmao."
The Lost Art,I remember liking it.  It was different.
The Lost Art,I remember really enjoying this when it came out.  Probably would have been more successful on a streamer if it was released in 2019 instead of 2009.  Network television was not the place for this kind of show.
The Lost Art,Ever since i saw the gif of Ian mcshane in Hercules go around I have been thinking of this show. Thinking of it makes me feel like a kid. It’s the last show I remember watching before going to college
The Lost Art,"Thanks for sharing. This was a very weird, challenging, wild show I wouldn't mind revisiting. I remember watching and thinking it would never survive, but you had to admire them for taking a big swing."
The Lost Art,I liked it but I do remember thinking that the marketing didn’t really match the show.
The Lost Art,"Everyone (rightly) talks about Ian McShane and Sebastian Stan, but Eamonn Walker, Susanna Thompson, and Dylan Baker were all fantastic too.

The scene where Samuels (Walker) tells Silas (McShane) that he has lost the kingdom is one of my favorite TV moments ever, as is the scene where Silas reveals he knows Jack (Stan) is gay. Both are in the first episode, I think."
The Lost Art,"It never actually had a chance. It needed something like 2.5 rating in the 18-49 demo for it to be successful and there was no way in hell it was going to get right out of the gate (and on Sunday nights going up against Fox animated shows). 

By '09 there was simply no way for a broadcast network to launch that sort of big budgeted drama and give it enough time, support and exposure for it grow like AMC, FX or HBO could do for their prestige dramas, and I honestly don't think there ever was time NBC or any other broadcast network could've done it. It took until the final half season of Breaking Bad for it to be a legit hit, Game Of Thrones also took a few seasons to turn into a blockbuster, same with Sons of Anarchy and Mad Men was never a hit in the first place."
The Lost Art,Oooh. I can’t wait to read this article. I’ve had so many questions about Kings.
The Lost Art,I worked on this show! Haven’t thought about it in years. Ian McShane was a total diva in ADR sessions. I suppose he’s earned the right.
The Lost Art,I loved Kings. It deserved better and probably would have done better on another network or service like HBO or something. It was ahead of its time.
The Lost Art,"The advertising was so bad! I have the show on DVD and in the commentary, the creators say NBC was really supportive of the biblical angle while they were making it but we're scared to advertise it that way so I remember the ads were like ""from a producer of Heroes"" (which was in season 3 and crashing and burning like nothing else) and a bunch of random imagery of butterflies and flags.

Interestingly, it was one of the more expensive shows made at the time, with a FOUR MILLION per episode budget! (laughably low now, of course.)

By the way, the same writer/director team are working on a Bioshock show"
The Lost Art,"Wow I'd never heard of this before but what a fascinating premise! A weird mix of mythical bible story palace intrigue and like Succession-type modern political machinations, even now I think this would be a bold new concept for television to run with. On 2009 network tv? Didn't stand a chance. Shame because there is so much potential in this idea."
The Lost Art,Where can I watch this??? It doesn’t appear to be on peacock
The Lost Art,"I watched it a couple years ago, I really liked it."
The Lost Art,Loved this show
The Lost Art,"This reminds me of why Arrested Development didn't work as a single cam network comedy \*AT THAT TIME\*. Then, it changes everything."
The Lost Art,"Ah, I loved this show. I even own it on DVD. Loved the faux-Shakespearean dialogue. Most of the cast were phenomenal, although the weakest element was David and the Princess' romance storyline. Way too network trope-y. A show like Kings would have been way better received now than on NBC circa 2009. Succession meets Game of Thrones meets the Old Testament? Come on!"
The Lost Art,">on which NBC bet it's prestige future

My recollection is that NBC didn't really bet anything on it, and signaled *very* early on that they'd given up on it.  they did no promo, and cancelled it almost immediately.  If they wanted to have a prestige future they should have alt least tried a little bit."
The Lost Art,"I could never get into this, even though it has a real cult following. Not as well written as people suggest imo."
The Lost Art,Does anyone know if they ever revealed why the character Andrew Cross was exiled?
The Lost Art,"I loved this show, but it was really weakened by the lead actor, dude was duller than cardboard. But this is what made me an Ian McShane fan, dude was a FORCE."
The Lost Art,"iirc, in Australia this was only shown on free tv at around 1am. So, that sucked. Else I really wanted to check it out."
The Lost Art,Loved the show. You don’t hear too much about it these days
The Lost Art,I genuinely love that show. It's always on my list of shows I wish would've gotten more seasons.
The Lost Art,It was ambitious with its alternate version of history. But I could only watch the pilot.
The Lost Art,"I think the best quote from the oral history is in the footnotes: ""Jeff Zucker did not respond to a request for comment"" lmao"
The Lost Art,6 seasons and a movie!
The Lost Art,"I remember The Cape.

I remember watching the first episode, realizing it was dumb, and never thinking about it again."
The Lost Art,Sebastian Stan was in The Covenant a couple of years before Kings. Just saying. I know it isn’t everyone’s cup of tea lol.
The Lost Art,"And that’s why it died on network tv. Network is for safe bets (cop shows, lawyer shows, hospital shows) anything outside of those almost always die"
The Lost Art,"Absolutely. If a streamer made this now people would go wild for it.

Such a weird, cool concept to have gotten made at all though.

For folks who haven't seen it - it's a *very* loose rework of the story of the biblical David's rise to kingship, set in a sort of monarchy ruled modern US-esque state. Lots of political manoeuvring and weird omens, with Ian McShane as the current king. Somebody declares war on God and means it very literally."
The Lost Art,"There was a handful of shows from 2008-2012 that would have done better in 2022 on a streaming platform.

Stuff like ""Awake"", ""Flashforward"", ""Caprica"", ""Dollhouse"", ""Party Down"", ""Terminator Sarah Connor Chonicles"", ""Pushing Daisies"", and even ""Jericho"" though it was earlier than the rest. I remember shows like ""Shark"" and ""The Event"" too had some buzz but also had concepts better suited for binging on a streaming service."
The Lost Art,"For some reason, I didn't even get the biblical allegory until a few episodes in.

Despite David vs Goliath, I guess I've just heard the name Goliath used in too many things to automatically associate it with the Bible.

Mostly Gargoyles."
The Lost Art,"I'm not sure if it's still there but for at least a decade it was on nbc.com, in the ""Throwback"" section. It was also released on dvd"
The Lost Art,"I mean, ADR sessions kinda suck when you’re the editor or on the board, I can only imagine how terrible they must be when you’re an actor and in a tiny ass room watching your work over and over."
The Lost Art,"It's not on any streaming from what I can find on JustWatch. Have to buy it online or pick up a DVD set.

I first watched it back in the good old days of  Hulu. When you didn't have to sign in, they put full seasons of shows up, it was extremely easy to navigate with tidy spreadsheet layouts, and only one ad played at a time. Those were good times."
The Lost Art,"Well the president of NBC at the time did. She championed the deal at NBC, gave them the budget they needed and was going to put them in the coveted Thursday night ER spot.

Then she was unceremoniously fired, the network dropped all marketing for the show, and moved it to Sunday nights, which was basically the worst night for prime time network TV viewings (which is hilarious considering now that’s HBO’s big night for their prestigious shows)."
The Lost Art,"Yeah, the writing definitely reached for high concepts while being very clunky. The actors did a really good job which may have fooled people into thinking the writing was better."
The Lost Art,"Something can be well made and you not liking it. Not sure you have the right to judge what others think just because you put IMO. Truffles are not for me, that’s one thing, Truffles are overrated and dosent taste as good as people suggest, IMO. See? That’s arrogant AF."
The Lost Art,"The six seasons and a movie quote which originated on Community was about The Cape. 

I think it was well acted and had heart. Maybe it was dumb but they tried to make it fun at least. Sometimes it is OK to be dumb."
The Lost Art,I call that the homoerotic version of The Craft. So much baby oil...
The Lost Art,"There is an article on tvline regarding 2023 pilot season. You nailed 90% of the new shows.

https://tvline.com/lists/pilot-season-abc-cbs-cw-fox-nbc-2023-2024/abc-pilots-2023-2024/

I usually read them to see if there is a new sci fi show on the horizon.

Also lots of The Good xxxx or spin offs of The Good yyyy"
The Lost Art,"But you have those rare examples like Lost or Heroes. Kings was a show along those same lines, with a mythology. I guess the ratings just weren’t there. The show wasn’t perfect but it was so different and I just wanted to learn more about the world they were building. Definitely a show where I wish I could visit some alternate timeline where they ended up making 5 seasons or so of it."
The Lost Art,"It's a weird juxtaposition of a network show with a prestige cable/streaming show.

Ambitious and unique premise, decent production values, Ian McShane acting the hell out of everything, and some really interesting plot points. Running directly into network budgets and network trope plot points. There are episodes with incredibly good and aggressively bad writing all in one.

I remember listening to the director commentary for the pilot with a few producers and Ian McShane. They recorded it for the DVDs long after the show was cancelled and wrapped. McShane said he got talked into it by the show runner because it was going to be better than typical network tv drivel. Then McShane keeps saying ""should've been on cable, this was too good for a network, should not have been on a network,"" for the rest of the commentary haha. 


Haven't read the article yet but looking forward to it. This is such an odd little known show that I never see enough discussion about."
The Lost Art,"Pushing Daisies never stood a chance being so bright and kitschy, high concept, and getting ruined by the writer's strike. But it was great. 

Kings also never stood a chance being so high quality and being on NBC. Had it even premiered a few years later, it'd have gone to Netflix or an early Prime show. It was too good for broadcast TV."
The Lost Art,"I had an idea for a podcast, I’m sure it’s been done already but I haven’t found it, where I’d go through shows like the ones you listed and add some others like Black Donnellys and Kings, and kind of do a recap/history.  Similar to the Blank Check format.  Spend a few episodes recapping the show, talk about production, etc.

But I don’t have the time or skill to make it work.  Maybe some day."
The Lost Art,I think “Hannibal” would fit on this list as well.
The Leaves,You literally don’t do anything but post about this. You need some fucking hobbies you desperate hag.
The Leaves,"Why in the world are some people so committed to defending this creepy weirdo?

Is a three year span of decent music worthy of such blind devotion?"
The Leaves,You can make any excuse you want that guy was fucked up and should  Not have been around little kids. It just. Shows money can buy anything
The Leaves,Michael Jackson was still a pedo.
The Leaves,Well great then I bet I can find another pedo you can let YOUR kids hang out with. I guess the kid that identified the birthmark on his dick was lying also?
The Leaves,He was a pedo no doubt about it. You can think all you want but I bet you wouldn’t leave your young son with him
The Leaves,It’s pretty obvious you love mj and even if they had pictures of him fucking some little kid you still would not believe. You are probably a anti vacxer also. Hope you never have kids
The Leaves,"If it makes you feel better to believe he was a pedophile, believe that.  If it makes you feel better to believe he wasn't a pedophile, believe that.  It does not matter any longer, he is dead.  Knowing the truth will in no way effect my life, or the lives of anyone I know.  Maybe there are a couple of victims that might be able to get a payout from his estate, but as most of them already got a payout the first time around, I don't even think they're getting that."
The Leaves,adult man sleeping with children in his bed is FUCKING WEIRD. taking children around the world with him. Again FUCKING WEIRD. no one does this!!! You don’t have children as friends as an adult. He’s a damn predator stop being so blind.
The Leaves,He would not have paid out millions of there was nothing to hide
The Leaves,And yet no one in this thread addressed the lies of Safechuck and Robson they made as adults about the allegations I highlighted in my OP. Using a testimony that your own mother even stated was completely untrue in a civil complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the supposed trauma you went through  as a child.
The Leaves,[deleted]
The Leaves,You have absolutely know idea what I do offline or online. reddit is a small snippet of my activities.  Stick to what you know
The Leaves,"Why are some people so committed to the narrative they have of a person despite how uncredible the accusers are? And being a 'weirdo' is not the same as being a criminal. Without the deviant weirdos , this world would would be in its regressive state that it was originally in"
The Leaves,99.999 percent of kids who ever went to Neverland said they had a largely positive relationship with mj and it's only been 6 dubious accusers who claimed they had a bad relationship with him. two accusers claim that mj acted inappropriately towards him(even though their social media history shows them praising mj). two accusers have made contradictory claim about the more recent aspects of their allegations.  AND ITS clear that the parents of the other two accusers forced their children to make false sex molestation allegations towards Jackson for monetary reasons.
The Leaves,NO EVIDENCE FOR THAT CLAIM SIR!
The Leaves,"He didn't identify his birthmark,  otherwise he would have been arrested.  The smoking gun article also reported that the Linden report said that jordan claimed that mjs penis was circumcised and autopsy report showed his penis to be uncircumcised.   Also, evan Chandler saw what mjs button look like because he gave him a butt injection prior to the allegation so he probably saw what his penis look like.

There is also a former college roommate of Jordan Chandler who will be interviewed online next month who told her that evan chandlers dad forced him to lie about the mj accusations and stated that he never forgave his parents for what he made him do.  Jordan Chandler emancipated himself from both his parents two years after the settlement was finalized in 1994. June Chandler testified in in the 2005 trial that she has not talked to Jordan Chandler since 1994."
The Leaves,"Plenty of doubt. Plenty of evidence that shows his accusers have a monetary incentive to lie, that parents pushed children into lying for them. Look at the arviso and Chandler cases."
The Leaves,ITS pretty obvious that you wont addressed the facts of this case that I highlighted here because it contradicts the narrative you had about mj.
The Leaves,AND being weird is nor a crime. PEOPLE think I'm weird too because I believe nudity should be normalized but I dont advocate sociopathic behavior
The Leaves,It's common practice to settle lawsuits with no admission of guilt.
The Leaves,"and the payoff out did not prevent the criminal trial. Mind you, the criminal investigation was ONGOING AFTER the civil settlement was made. 

If Evan truly believe that his child was molested,  then he would have immediately went to the police. He did not. He INITIALLY wanted to keep not only the police but lawyers too out of the issue and wanted it to be a business deal between mj and him. that's not what the parent of someone whose kid is molested does."
The Leaves,Don't they though?
The Leaves,"Multiple posts a day about this topic.  You’re an obsessed loser.  

You need serious psychiatric care."
The Leaves,"“The photographs reveal a mark on the right side of Defendant’s penis at about the same relative location as the dark blemish located by Jordan Chandler on his drawing of Defendant’s erect penis. I believe the discoloration Chandler identified in his drawing was not something he could have or would have guessed about, or could have seen accidentally. I believe Chandler’s graphic representation of the discolored area on Defendant’s penis is substantially corroborated by the photographs taken by Santa Barbara Sheriff’s detectives at a later time.”

The innocent don’t write $20m checks attached to NDAs.

The only thing shocking about the documentary is that it took this for people to accept the truth about the creep."
The Leaves,"So you’re saying your hero had sleepovers with 60,000 children?  That’s not at all creepy."
The Leaves,[removed]
The Leaves,But you DO support pedophilia.
The Leaves,"Says who? Human behavior is weird. People are weird. You just can't discredit someone or something by saying that they were behaving in a way that they shouldn't have. Where are you getting your behavioral template from? Unless you have a background in behavioral psychology, nothing you say has any credit. 

This kind of thinking is very toxic and dangerous. It's the same kind of mentality that people use to discredit rape victims who take weeks to report their attack. ""If they were really sexually assaulted, they would've reported it right away!""

Oh please. Isn't it possible that maybe Evan's child was molested, and he might just be a shitty person that's more interested in profiting from the assault of his child than seeing the perpetrator face justice? I've seen parents of victims do all kinds of shady things. People are not all one in the same and just because YOU think you would behave differently in a scenario, doesn't mean it's impossible for someone else to behave differently."
The Leaves,"AGAIN LOSER, stick to what you know. what part of the statement 'reddit is a small portion of all of my online and offline activities' do you not understand?"
The Leaves,"they did not match. the Linden report claimed that jordie claimed they were circumcised. the autopsy report revealed that his penis was uncircumcised.  EVEN if they did match, that doesnt mean that the kid saw the penis. jordies dad admitted to given Jackson a butt injection too, so the dad also saw the discoloration. 

He would have been immediately arrested if their was an actual match. Two grand juries decided that their wasn't enough evidence for an indictment. 

Evan Chandler claimed in a phone conversation that mj would never sell another record and claimed that mj would be destroyed. Mind you, this is 8 DAYS before he claims that his son makes his accusation to his dad about the mj allegations.  And he also states that he has no clue if mj is molesting his son. why would evan Chandler make those statements at the time if he doesn't know if Michael committed any violent crime towards his son?

Also, when his son does ""confess"" to him about said incident,  why not initially go to the police? After the allegations were made, Evan Chandler initially wanted to have a meeting with mj about a monetary negotiation and did not want lawyers involved.  It is even reported that Evan Chandler hugged MJ at that meeting.  why would you hug your sons rapist if you truly believe he molested your child?

And the criminal investigation was still ONGOING after the settlement was made. The DA at the time even stated that a civil settlement would not have prevented a criminal trial. The criminal trial did not occur because Jordan Chandler refused to testify and Evan Chandler had gotten what he wanted. 

ALSO, why did evan Chandler had to get a psychologist to let the authorities know that mj allegedly molested Evan's son?(who was required by like to report allegations like that to the police).Why not directly go to the police directly? Could it be that Mr. Chandler did not want to be held criminally liable for false allegations ? Think about that."
The Leaves,"sharing a bed with a child does not automatically equal child molestation.  If that were the case, then I be a fucking child molester then for sharing a bed with a 10 year, the child of my best friend"
The Leaves,You have the sick mind if you believe that everytime an adult shares a bed that there will be an act of child molestation
The Leaves,"How do you know he dumped them all? That was the narrative that has been promoted in the leaving Neverland documentary and in victor gueriterraz  book.How do you know that the kid did not choose to leave Neverland because engaging in water balloon fights and doing other things associated with kids activities becomes too immature as they aged? How do you know that these kids that mj ""dumped"" did not become more interested in pursuing more intimate relationships with their ""peers""? 

How do you know it was a ""shitty"" thing to do? Do you know the circumstance of the relationship he had with every kid? What if in some cases, the kid and the family became ""shitty"" people by growing more entitled to his generosity and wallet? MJ has stated he wanted to distance himself more from the arvisos(the family of the 2005 accuser) Because the whole family overtime became entitled people.  A person assistant of mj's have stated that the Safechucks were a family who acquired an entitlement problem. She stated that MJ would make it an effort not to be at Neverland whenever the Safechucks were there. The Safechuck mom failed to pay back a loan mj gave her for a house so after so many failed attempts at repaying the loan back, he eventually forgave it. 

If he encountered people like the ones I've mentioned in the second paragraph,  then I be inclined to dump their asses too."
The Leaves,When have I here advocated for pedophilia?
The Leaves,"Jordie Chandler never made any accusations against MJ UNTIL he was in the custody of his father. 8 days before the accusation, Evan stated in the phone conversation that he wanted to destroy mjs career and wanted him to never sell another record. He also stated in that phone conversation that he did not have a clue if mj molested his child.

There were going to be witnesses who testified that Jordie confesses to him that he  made up the whole thing if jordie were to testify. 

there are pics of jordies former girlfriend on Twitter who have said positive things about Michael Jackson and even list him as a musical inspiration.  WHY would you say all of these things about your former boyfriends child molester if mj truly molested jordie?"
The Leaves,Your obsession is bordering on dangerous delusion. Seek professional help you sad creature.
The Leaves,"You’re defense is that a child rape victim doesn’t know the difference between cut and uncut pedo dick?


You’re fucking disgusting.  There’s a special place in hell for people like Jackson and his staunch defenders."
The Leaves,You’re aggressive defense of another child molester has been concerned the latter might be true.
The Leaves,"It doesn't, but it still is creepy. It's one thing to share a bed with a child you know or who is a relative and it's another to be a superstar sharing a bed with countless random children. It's weird. There's no way to spin it to make the fact that MJ shared bed with countless of strange kids anything but weird."
The Leaves,So you’re saying you’ve done it elsewhere?
The Leaves,"If what you're saying is true (which I don't know if it is) because simply I just don't care enough to do the amount of research that you've done into the topic, then yeah, it's all very weird.

But you're missing my point. I'm not disagreeing with you on the fact that these people were behaving strangely. Everyone involved in this case, from the accused to the accuser, was behaving in a pretty strange way at one point or another. 

My point was that just because someone is behaving strangely and you can't understand the logic behind their behavior doesn't mean that they are lying. 

I don't know why his girlfriend would say such things. Sure, it's odd. But again, that doesn't mean that he's lying. It's all circumstantial. You are just connecting the dots in your own way and seeing what you want to see. If you are a MJ believer, you will be able to find concrete holes in every accuser's story. If you believe the alleged victims, then you will find irrefutable evidence that MJ is a pedo everywhere you turn. Confirmation bias is a very real and very dangerous thing. 

Frankly though, it's hard to view MJ as a victim in all this either way because as a grown man this is why you shouldn't share bed with children. It leaves you open to accusations like this. And if you think the benefits of sleeping with children outweighs the risk of receiving false allegations against your name, something isn't right with you and you can't help but question how false the allegations might be."
The Leaves,And you not addressed a single damn fact I highlighted.  Thanks for showing the world the lack of credibility you have
The Leaves,Prove he was a child molester.  unsubstantiated accusations by accusers who made serious lies about this case is not and never will be proof.
The Leaves,"Its abnormal but not creepy.  Just you have been taught in western society that this type of behavior is not okay, doesnt make it wrong. There are plenty of benign reasons to share a bed with an underage person"
The Leaves,You are putting words in my mouth
The Leaves,You don’t understand the meaning of the word “fact”.
The Leaves,"Prove he wasn’t.  You state statements and opinions as fact, but easily dismiss the same that you don’t agree with.  

Not really how life works."
The Leaves,"It's creepy to me. I'm sorry, but this world (not just western society) is filled with child predators so I'll be damned if I let my child share a bed with some celebrity. It just seems like an unnecessary risk to let your child share a bed with a celebrity. Best case, nothing happens. Cool. But worst case, your kid gets molested. So I just don't get why it's worth it to take that risk with the well being of your child.

What are these purported benign reasons MJ had to share a bed with these children? Is there any reason other than he just wanted to sleep in the same bed as children? And if that's the case, one must ask why a grown man is so insistent on sharing a bed with so many children if his motives were truly as benign as you say."
The Leaves,And we all know what Michael put in little boys mouths.
The Leaves,That would be you my dear
The Leaves,I have stated facts. Just because you assumed that factual statements are opinions for whatever reason doesn't make it so.
The Leaves,you probably wanted mj to put his dick in your mouth.  Not everyone shares your sick fantasy bub

The Leaves,And DAMN the fact that Chandlers lawyer did not even want the drawing introduced as evidence.  AND damn the fact that the smoking gun article claimed that LINDEN report claimed that jordie claimed that the penis was circumcised when autopsy reports revealed that it wasn't
The Leaves,"I trust the roommate more than unsubstantiated claims made by proven liars. There are actually pics of them together as a couple. Plus , the tweets from this former gf of chandlers praising mj and name him a musical inspiration of hers."

The Leaves,"I love all my streaming services equally

Earlier that day: I don’t care for Netflix"
The Leaves,"Arrested Development season 4 was the reason I signed up for Netflix in the first place! 

I'm also not a person who generally rewatches shows but Seasons 1-3 are my comfort shows.  I will probably just buy the seasons on physical media (if I can find it.)"
The Leaves,[deleted]
The Leaves,"What were they just too CHICKEN to pay for it???

CA-CA-CAWW CA-CA-CAWW"
The Leaves,Why?! How much could it cost to keep it on? $10?!
The Leaves,"Michael: Get rid of the Seaward.
Lucille: I’ll leave when I’m good and ready.

Still cracks me up."
The Leaves,"And once again the need for physical media is made necessary. Thankfully the first four seasons have dvd releases but the fifth never got one. Is it good? No, but it's extra official AD media that - if it wasn't going to Hulu/Disney due to expired rights - would eventually just disappear. Streaming exclusives *are a plague* and is going to be responsible for the mass disappearance of shows and movies in the near future because execs want to keep their subs in the here and now."
The Leaves,Sad snoopy music
The Leaves,"How do you lose the rights to air a show you produced a season of? 

Netflix is becoming a textbook example of squandering a lead."
The Leaves,Ive had season 1-3 on DVD for roughly twenty years and always glad I do.
The Leaves,"It’s the rights to a tv show, Michael. What could it cost? $10?"
The Leaves,but I thought there was always money in the Banana  stand
The Leaves,God that's dumb. I wonder if where season 4 lands it will keep the original cut (the superior imo) or the 22 episode redux that doesn't work at all so they basically make the narrator the main character.
The Leaves,I wish Disney+ in America would incorporate way more of the content it relegates to Hulu. Like how they do it internationally. Seems like that service could be so much better if they embraced that content like they have elsewhere. I mean Arrested Development totally feels like it would fit on the same services that hosts The Simpsons.
The Leaves,Guess I’ll finally watch it. Don’t hate when I have motivators like this since I never know what to choose to watch and sometimes like the decision being made with the sheer amount of content everywhere nowadays.
The Leaves,"This is my fault guys...

I started 30 rock. It went bye bye.

I decided to re-watch arrested development.

Oops. :-/

Quick, name some shows you hate, and I'll start them next!"
The Leaves,"They got rid of The Office and now Arrested Development and they’re raising prices and also being draconian about shared passwords? Bye, Netflix."
The Leaves,"Wait, but Netflix owns 2 seasons.. are they selling it to someone else?"
The Leaves,This is why physical media should never die. I'm sick of people telling me that Blu-rays/dvds are pointless.
The Leaves,Funny because I’m leaving Netflix in February
The Leaves,"Lots of things leaving Netflix in March

Mostly Canadian subscribers"
The Leaves,Good thing I have the first three seasons on DVD.
The Leaves,"I’m just watching this and love it but after reading the comments, what the hell happened to season 4? Original cut? Redux? Why isn’t it just episodes I watch??"
The Leaves,"Arrested season four was one of the founding pillars of Netflix original content. I remember being 12 and thinking “pfft, Netflix ordinals? We’ll see how long that lasts.”"
The Leaves,Netflix: I’ve made a huge mistake
The Leaves, Guess who has two thumbs and is also leaving Netflix in march?
The Leaves,My reasons to keep Netflix are dwindling.
The Leaves,"Not that there’s necessarily a big demand for this, but will there be any legal way to watch seasons 4 and 5 after the show leaves Netflix?"
The Leaves,Aren’t seasons 4 & 5 Netflix originals? That’s so odd
The Leaves,"If Netflix ever loses its rights to Bojack Horseman (is owned by Tornante Company), I'll cancel the service."
The Leaves,"The ol' ""charge more for less"" business philosophy that always goes great for embattled companies."
The Leaves,Reminds myself I need to finish season 5. I never went back to it when they split the season in two releases. Can't even remember what happens in the front half.
The Leaves,I always thought it was weird how I could watch Arrested Development on both Disney+ and Netflix here in India.
The Leaves,As if we needed another reason to quit Netflix.
The Leaves,"Time to rewatch the show then, 'cause I'm not watching them on hulu with ads."
The Leaves,"I never did get around to watching season 5, but I do love the first 3 seasons. Like everyone else."
The Leaves,"I have never seen it or Parks n rec or the office, none of those are available in my region.... #someday #goals"
The Leaves,"Canadian here, remind me why I should keep this shit when they’re cracking down on passwords and in exchange we get this"
The Leaves,"They should just pet the royalties, what could it cost? $10?"
The Leaves,I don’t think I could have taken netflix from the top to the bottom with the same graceful incompetence if someone was paying me to do just that
Fiery Love,I like how they list Bobby Flay as one of the people now on Food Network as if he hasn't been there since basically the beginning.
Fiery Love,"Good Eats is over, but with twelve years and nearly 250 episodes of content, I say they just make a good eats channel, looping the whole damn thing. I'd watch it. At least put the whole thing on Netflix. What were we talking about?"
Fiery Love,[deleted]
Fiery Love,"I think that what destroyed Food Network is the ridiculous need to have a ""story"" for each recipe, personally. They take forever to set up a scene and it gets unnecessarily specific.

*""Hi, welcome to my kitchen! We have new neighbors moving in next door. John and Doreen from Chicago, with their wonderful children Pattie and Max, and their dog Teenie. They've moved to our neighborhood after John was given a job at the local news station, where he'll be working from 9 to 5, monday to friday. So as a welcoming present, I'll bake my famous meat loaf. This recipe has been in my family for generations! My mother used to bake it for Popop while he was at the lumber mill with his cousins Jim Jon and Bobby Joe...""*

And it's swell and all, but it's been like 10 minutes of you talking and clips of your new ""neighbors"" pretending to move in and you still haven't touched any food and now there's a commercial break... It takes more time to set the scene than it does to do the actual recipe."
Fiery Love,"These Salon opinion articles (screeds?) always conjure up the most annoying, whiny middlest of the road outrage, no matter what.  The author is speaking in the same taut and glib ""local news speech"" that he/she is deriding.  I mean, TALK ABOUT A TOUGH STANCE, making fun of guy fieri is about as novel and radical as, i dunno, watching character-driven dramas? not liking racists? 

This ""article"" reads like a Yelp post, battered in clickbait, rolled in the dust from the floor of the content farm, deep fried in the oil of a thousand forgotten facebook likes.  "" highly processed inedibles"" indeed.

I'd buy that for a dollar!"
Fiery Love,">They’d often use a natural-light filter that made food appear delectable, as if the chefs were blissfully cooking their culinary delights in the sunlit designer kitchen of a tastefully decorated, impeccable home somewhere in the Hamptons""

i hate guy fieri as much as the next guy but man that's pretentious. i had 10 solid years in commercial kitchens and those two extremes represent the worst of ""foodie"" culture.

edit: also lets not forget how annoying it was when food network was the 24/7 EMIRAL GOES BAM!! channel "
Fiery Love,"http://guysamericankitchenandbar.com/

The person who made this menu sums up Guy Fieri quite nicely. Apparently, when Guy opened his NYC restaurant, his people never secured its domain name. So, someone else took the liberty. "
Fiery Love,"Where's Alton Brown's Good Eats in this conversation?  The guy found the best way to mix chef with TV personality.  The guy understands the history and science of food, and can present his product in a sometimes obnoxious, but quality method.  I think its hard to replicate what he did, and he proved that a great food network product can be done with very little money."
Fiery Love,"The original Iron Chef was glorious, I will never forgive the food network for what they did to it."
Fiery Love,"I thought Iron Chef had a lot more to do with changing the landscape of cooking shows than this guy. He's WAY after Iron Chef.

I never watched Food Network before Iron Chef, and it seems to me Master Chef, Chopped.. all those competition shows got inspiration from Iron Chef, not Guy Fieri."
Fiery Love,"What a load of shit. I don't like him either but he didn't ruin the channel. He has his own style, and people obviously like it. The cooking network decided to expand both types of programming, moving the ""cooking in a kitchen"" type shows to its own channel (The Cooking Channel). Programming and styles change over time. "
Fiery Love,Drive-Ins Diners and Dives is actually pretty interesting. 
Fiery Love,"I can't believe this is actually an issue. Here's why I love DD&d:


Guy is actually really positive. Sure the Guy is eccentric looking; but in a vast majority of the episodes he is just seems to be stoked to be eating bomb ass food (because who fucking wouldn't want to have that job.)

I learn so much about cooking while watching that show. They basically make the food from scratch right in front of you. It gives you guidelines and ideas for stuff to add the next time you fry chicken or make a rub for ribs.

It also gives you a good list of places to go the next time you're in Saint Louis, or Philly. It also supports bomb ass restaurants and helps keep bomb ass restaurants in buisness.


They could also just show only good eats and I would be happy.


TLDR d&DD is awesome. It's good for my kitchen, good for my stomach and good for the food industry."
Fiery Love,"Wow that's pretentious. Guy ~~is a~~ might be a douche, but I've been to a few places he has shown and they were awesome. He might not be cooking the dishes himself, but they show a step by step process in making the dishes of the restaurants he goes to. Why does every cooking show have to be stuck in a studio kitchen? I wonder if the author has a hate boner for Anthony Bourdain as well."
Fiery Love,"I disagree. I used to watch the Food Channel all the time, but what ruined it for me was before Guy came on board. It was/is all the contest shows. Instead of being informative and instructive, it has become almost unwatchable for me. It began for me with ""Iron Chef"", which had great ratings but seemed to be trying to attract a different set of viewers ( maybe more men?). I still like a few shows, like The Pioneer Woman, but I rarely even turn my tv onto that channel any more because it no longer is relevant to my life and tastes. And that makes me sad. "
Fiery Love,"Never watched his show but I love all the Jaboody dubs of it!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHHp5cVQ5yw  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmjZH76OtOw"
Fiery Love,"FWIW, part of what happened is that Food Network decided to split their brand. FN proper became more of a ""food lifestyle"" network, with all the reality and contest shows, while all of the actual cooking and instructional shows were shifted over to their new Cooking Channel. "
Fiery Love,Join old Discovery and History channel fans.
Fiery Love,"I've never understood the hate for Guy. He seems like a pretty decent dude. He is the same as when he was on who wants to be a food network star, just regular dude who is excited as shit about anything you're making."
Fiery Love,"I used to love the food network. And I dont mind some DD&D. Some of that food looks amazing, but fuck let me learn a bit about it. Bring back Good Eats! Stop with crappy cooking competitions that show no real skill. Hire Bourdain and get Top Chef back on the network.

I love food, teach people again. Thats what was so great about the network early on. "
Fiery Love,"What really destroyed the Food Network is its shift towards focusing more on competition shows and moving most of the cooking shows to the Cooking Channel. Competition shows get more ratings.  They are getting progressively worse though, with outlandish ingredients and non-realistic situations and tight deadlines for added drama. What used to be a channel where you can actually learn a few useful tips in the kitchen, like a good home cooked meal, became nothing more than junk food for the masses.

MTV did the same thing decades ago when they switched their focus from music videos to reality shows and spun off MTV2 to play music videos.  

The Food Network basically became the MTV of food television.  "
Fiery Love,Invitation from Flavortown revoked.
Fiery Love,Things change and I am PISSED about it!
Fiery Love,"DDD isn't too bad.  But the original Iron Chef was easily the best they ever had to offer. 
Besides that, there's nothing worth watching on the Food Network anymore. Giada (sp?) is the most insufferable imo. It drives me insane to hear people over pronounce words for no reason. "
Fiery Love,"http://cdn.firstwefeast.com/assets/2014/07/DDD.jpg

I'll just leave this here. "
Fiery Love,"Didn't have a problem until the first time I met Guy Fieri. Walked into the hotel lobby screaming at his assistant with his wife following closely behind walking with her head down.
A work friend's wife jumped up out of her seat to say, ""Oh my god Guy! I am a huge fan! Can I just shake your hand and say thank you!?""
His response. . . ""Who the fuck is she?"" Looking at his assistant. 
We all were speechless.
To ease the tension, a guy in the lobby offered to buy him a beer, Stone IPA. ""It's made by a brewery in a southern California! ""
Guy: ""Never heard of it. Check your facts""

Mind blown. . . I had watched his shows and to see that's how he was in real life?! Ended that day thinking, you know what, he was probably tired and having a bad day . . .

The next morning- 
After checking out of the hotel, walked out the front door to get a cab. Who do you think I cross paths with again?

Guy is screaming into his cell phone, ""I've wasted enough time in this god dam city! Get me the fuck home! "". His wife (looked on verge of tears) and his frazzled assistant were putting bags into a black charger that was parked up on the curb.

Best part of this encounter was that he made eye contact with me, maybe remembering me from the lobby the night before. I looked him dead in the eyes and made sure he saw me shake my head. He did and gave me the ""psssh"".

No longer a fan and love telling anyone this story. Wish him the best but he'll always be a prick in sheep's clothing to me."
Fiery Love,This guy seems pretty....salty.
Fiery Love,[deleted]
Fiery Love,"Cordcutter here. My husband was so excited to have cable in our hotel room, over the Thanksgiving holiday, so he could watch Food Network. You can imagine his disappointment that Guy was on the entire 4 days."
Fiery Love,Listen to the audio of Guy Fieri screaming at his hair dresser.
Fiery Love,"I forget where I heard this, but the best description of Guy Fieri that I've ever heard is: ""He is what happens when you put sunglasses on a happy meal and leave it in the sun for 30 days."""
Fiery Love,"Yes, before Guy Fieri The Food Network was filled with such intellectual shows that highlighted the wide varieties of culinary excellence found in America and all over the world...

Oh wait, no it wasn't. I was filled with mindless fluff such as Rachael Ray, Sandra Lee, Paula Deen, and Emeril Lagasse saying ""Bam"" over and over again. Pretty much the only saving grace of that network was Good Eats.

Guy Fieri is a douche but acting like the Food Network has been destroyed from it's original purpose and quality like TLC has is naive and a huge stretch."
Fiery Love,who gets this butthurt about triple D? #THAT'SMONEY
Fiery Love,"Personally I like his stuff, you get a look at some if Americas most well know establishments and some hidden gems. But also a look at how they make some of their signature dishes. You know what I hate more? The ass ton of cooking competition shows. Really, kids cooking? Really? I enjoy seeing more about the actual industry, or people teaching, than someone running around with their head cut off trying to figure out what to do. "
Fiery Love,"I don't really get the Guy Fieri hate train sometimes. He can be a little over the top sometimes but Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives is a good show that saved Food Network from bankruptcy.  I mean really has the author seen Sandra Dee?  That was a studio cooking show where she literally just used boxed dinners and processed food and whipped up trailer park cuisine. I'll gladly take Guy Fieri over that any day. "
Fiery Love,He didn't really ruin the network. The channel is still about cooking. Literally they still have a shit ton of shows just about people cooking.
Fiery Love,"these fake personalities and ego driven people have killed the food network, not to mention the reality game shows are cringeworthy."
Fiery Love,They turned it from informative to entertainment.  I love to cook and take it pretty seriously.  I can't remember the last time I saw something on one of their shows or website that I went and made.  But it was probably something on good eats. 
Fiery Love,"This is garbage. Sandra Lee was ruining Food Network way before Guy Fieri was a TV personality at all. He may not be everyones cup of tea, but he has a pretty outrageous personality that is refreshing from ""serene"", boring chefs. I like how his show (Triple D) puts little mom and pop/hometown places in the spotlight. And he cooks real food on his cooking show. 

Seriously, check out some of her youtube videos. They are hilarious, and people buy fucking cookbooks from her!"
Fiery Love,"You could say this about, Discovery, History Channel, A&E, or TLC. They all have been ruined by BS low brow crap fest shows."
Fiery Love,"I've eaten at both of his Santa Rosa, CA restaurants: one is now out of business and the other gave me food poisoning. His food is, amazingly, even more toxic than he is."
Fiery Love,"Funny timing. I just noticed this earlier tonight. I have two weeks off from work and wanted to use that time to expand my cooking and baking skills. I used to watch Food Network to get inspired but when I checked the guide it was almost nothing but Diners, drive-ins and Dives. "
Fiery Love,"you've got to blame the consumer/demographics though, not the personalities...but also look at the general health trends of the US. Obesity. Mass consumption of rubbish. If the chicken came first, then the chicken is society, the egg is Food Network. I'm not at all surprised that large loud high fat high cholesterol high sodium cooks are dominating the television. They are the ones who, i guess coincidentally, are creating the most rubbish foods. The stuff, it would appear, too many people in the US, want to eat."
Fiery Love,"The fact is that tv isn't selling for shit any more. Reality tv triggered a death spiral in programming. It was new, novel, and *crazy* cheap to make and everyone ate it up. Then the novelty wore off and all that was left were the idiots who couldn't stop watching other idiots. Budgets had been slashed since there was no need to invest in quality any more. Then the internet struck with megaton force and the idiots could watch even bigger idiots on demand via youtube or hell, just the side bar ads on weather.com. With ad revenues now in a total tail spin and no budgets to work with, they (tv networks) had to continue to cut programming down to the cheapest possible productions.

Guy fieri isn't on Food network because he's popular. Guy fieri is on food network because he's a fat fucking slob who will do tricks for milk bones. He's there to attract the idiots who haven't found the internet to entertain them yet. 

"
Fiery Love,"The fact is that this clown is a mirror image of America - a fat, loud, white, douche who eats unhealthy and feels the need to cheer and high five every little thing. Food Network sees this guy as being the one that Americans can relate to and thus increasing their viewership. "
Fiery Love,"When I listen to the Alton Brown podcast, I think, ""Fuck, why isn't it nothing but this?"""
Fiery Love,"I like the food network. I will admit to enjoying chopped and cutthroat kitchen. I really don't like Guy Fieri because literally every aspect of him is not only phony but also FEELS phony... You expect some level of falseness from a cooking show, the setting demands it since you can't cook something for 2 hours in half an hour for example but he is also fake. "
Fiery Love,"To be honest, as someone passionate about the food industry, I like a lot of the new cook-off shows better than those sunlit kitchen-monologuey types. It's cool to be able to relate to the chefs actually busting their asses in the kitchen like they do every day for a living, rather than standing in a cozy $200,000 home themed studio kitchen making food for the family. Give me the rush of the kitchen that I'm used to, (like on ""Chopped"") in my television programs, not ""Paula Dean puts a pound of butter in everything and licks her fingers alot""."
Fiery Love,Totally agree. This guy has 'douchebag' written all over his face. 
Fiery Love,"Alton Brown makes the show worth watching. The way he presents each sabotage is hilarious to watch along with the chefs freaking out over them.

The show really shows how talented and ruthless people can be. Definitely worth watching!"
Fiery Love,"He's disgusting. He can touch a batch of food with his bare hands, eat over it, double dip out of it, all while the owner wears gloves making it. Even Andrew Zimmern doesn't do that, and he's pretty disgusting too, but at least he has manners and consideration for others. Fieri is a PIG."
Fiery Love,Every time I look at this guy I wanna punch him in the face. How do people like this guy? He's 40 years old and looks like an annoying 12 year old.
Fiery Love,This is like MTV and History Channel all over again.

Fiery Love,"Wasn't Emeril Lagasse the first shouty chef? I barely remember his show, but I seem to recall he was pretty annoying too... and he was on a decade before Guy's crap. 

I don't like Guy, but pinning the network's problems on him is a shit move. Blame all the realty shows they're airing for that."
Fiery Love,"The only reason to hate Guy is jealousy. He's a fat guy who loves BBQ and he turned it into a CAREER. 

Good for that dude "
Fiery Love,"Guy might be partially to blame, but Food Network started going to shit long before he arrived. "
Fiery Love,"This blogger is out of his fucking mind ! What killed the food network and bring so much stress and shitty food is all those insanely stupid competitions like Chopped and cie, Kitchen Inferno, Cutthroat Kitchen, Food Truck, Food court, Cupcake and etc... Wars,  where they have to finish a dish in 20 minutes, not a single second more. how fucking stupid and stressful is that ?!! Those are the fucking shows that destroy the Food Network !!! What a fucking stupid blogger !!!!

Fieri with his show Dinner Drive' in and dives actually shows what constitute the real good cooking you can find in the US, the little places that everybody can afford and that doesn't sell shit process food or from a can. Ok it's junk food by European standard but that's the essence of American food: good, rough, handmade food.

What represent the typical cooking in the US are not the fancy restaurants, they are too few and nobody goes there. I'm french and those little hole in the wall that Fieri put to light are the equivalent of the little affordable French restaurants that serve authentic French food. Of course traditions in France are different so the food look less like junk food but what makes the BIG difference is the way french eat: not everything is in a sandwich and we take way longer to enjoy our meal.

How stupid is this article !

 "
Fiery Love,"I work for The Food Network and I can tell you it's a lot like Mtv not showing music videos, people would much rather watch reality style TV than an actual cooking show. Even the ""cooking shows"" are all laced with fake narratives about family & other things producers know people can connect with. 

PS. Paula Deen is a saint"
Fiery Love,"I couldn't possibly agree with this more, I used to be able to watch the food channel & the history channel for days on end but lately it's just garbage. I think the history channel is in the lead for turning into one of the worst channels on t.v. (american pickers, pawn shoes, ice road truckers..like where the fuck are my documentaries..) yet the food channel is slowly catching up with shows like ""Chopped: With Teens"" or whatever that garbage is called"
Fiery Love,"The dude literally just came to my hometown, went to two restaurants. One was literally built five years ago, and the other is an institution; because of its drinks, not because of the food. My town is famous for the wings in one restaurant, it's a staple, and people travel far distances to eat them. The hack never even went there. His car is bullshit too, he just poses in it for pictures then it gets towed to the next location."
Fiery Love,"Rant warning here but this is a topic that really gets me going.

I watched a lot of food network growing up. I actually use to learn every day home cook techniques, tricks and recipes from what I watched on Emeril Live and Two Fat Ladies. I wish the whole network would just endlessly play Chef At Home, Barefoot Contessa, Naked Chef and the like. Show me Giada and Laura Calder! I wouldn't even mind watching more of that Anna Olson (aka Food Network Soccer Mom) from Sugar. Don't stack all these quality shows at 5 in the morning and fill the rest of the day and prime time with re-runs of Cutthroat Crap. 

Show me how to cook! Show me different recipes and how-to's! Show me knife skills and how I should clean a fish before I cut it. Don't show me hours of ridiculous cooking competitions that are based on reality shock factor and backstabbing rather than a chef's ability to cook. 

Oh, Chopped is on back-to-back for 6 hours? Let me guess the 4 ingredients: processed food item, exotic whatchamacallit, vegetable and normal. I'll make ice cream and win the game.

I get it, America is full of wondrous greasy spoon diners and hidden gems tucked away next to road side gas stations but was it necessary to get such an insufferable man to host the show? I find his dialogue as offensive as his hair style (e.g. ""This is money"", ""This is flavour town""). It blows my mind that he is popular enough to merit a new television show. Now he's got some sort of grocery store reality competition show that I see commercials of all the time and I don't need to watch it to tell me it's going to teach me nothing about cooking. The fact that every day people are becoming more prevalent on reality cooking shows rather than professional chefs is even more indicative to how bad this degradation has gone.

I feel a kinship with people who use to be fans of History Channel and National Geographic channel because I feel like they also understand how horrible it is when the integrity of your favourite television network is compromised for mediocre shock factor reality television. I'm sure it's also happened to HGTV and Space as well, and no other network knows the epidemic worse than TLC.

**TL;DR** I'm jaded and wish that shows about learning how to cook sold more than shows of cooking reality garbage. "
Fiery Love,"I hate watching him, but obviously people don't. If he wasn't leading to viewership and profit he would be all over the place.

Because one network changed their style and some people don't like it doesn't mean it's ""destroyed"" "
Fiery Love,MTV is to music as Food Network is to cooking.
Fiery Love,"Thank you everyone for including your positive take on this.  It's so easy to join in on cynicism, but it just feels so much better to let it go, especially when the cynicism doesn't solve anything.  

I too noticed how The Cooking Channel houses all those ""cooking in a kitchen"" shows, just as the DIY Network is HGTV's equivalent.  Seeing reruns of shows I didn't like too much - like Diners Drive-Ins and Dives - playing constantly on the Food Network caused me to look for alternatives, and the Cooking Channel is just one channel up.  

I wish they'd play the original Iron Chef, though."
Fiery Love,"I work for a restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  The customers we get are GREAT for the business, but nearly all of the time they are LOUSY tippers.  Not relevant to the post necessarily.  However, didn't they make an entire new channel the ""Cooking Channel"" that has all the good shit on it.  Food Network is just the ""game show"" type of food shows now."
Fiery Love,If Guy Fieri showed up in my restaurant sticking his fat little sausage fingers in the food I was preparing I'd boot his ass onto the street. 
Fiery Love,"Yeah, what an asshole. The way he goes around from town to town, promoting small businesses and giving them exposure they wouldn't get otherwise. I'm sure every one of those businesses where he has spouted his inane catchphrases with his stupid hair would rather throw him out than see the increased business that comes from getting sudden nationwide exposure.

Pretentious gibberish like this is why I gave up on salon.com a long time ago. "
Fiery Love,"Mark summers is really to blame for all of this reality TV ""FOOD WAAAR"" bullshit unfortunately, he's the producer for a lot of it.  
  
I can't watch it anymore. I liked learning the science and history behind food with Alton, not him making people cry."
Fiery Love,Guy Fieri on Food Network. Pawn Stars on History. Honey fucking Boo Boo on TLC. My favorite channels are dead because of this tendency.
Fiery Love,Sadly I think the only recipes I get from food network anymore are from Diners Drive in and Dives when chef shows us the signature dish.....
Fiery Love,I still remember the original iron chef days where everything was dubbed over in English. Now that was entertaining! 
Fiery Love,"I haven't watched Food Network since Essence of Emeril stopped. BAM! But even before I watched him, I used to come home from school and watch Great Chefs before Bill Nye - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh-seoO78NI Those were the days... "
Fiery Love,What happened to the food network that I used to know?
Fiery Love,"He's the ""Larry the cable guy"" of food TV... how could anyone have thought that would end well?"
Fiery Love,I just don't watch his shows. They're all fucking advertisement for his shitty restaurants.
Fiery Love,"The food network used to be the shit. Specifically ,Good Eats was awesome. Now its just .....terrible"
Fiery Love,"I feel like Guy Fieri is reading the article, and now the comments, and sobbing over a bucket of iced cream covered in pancake batter and deep fried in heavy oil, seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon and set on top of a thick, moist, butter-heavy brownie."
Fiery Love,"Not a fan of Guy Fieri, but is was the phony-as-fuck Mystery Diner, hidden camera shows that ruined the channel for me. "
Fiery Love,"At least Anthony Bourdain didn't have to change his birth name for ""show biz"". Guy is a huge douche."
Fiery Love,"This article is so right and so wrong at the same time. Guy is the largest tumor on the face of this network, but there's something more insidious happening on the inside of Food Network. The brand is losing its sense of identity. That identity is not sun-drenched tablescapes, its food. celebrity CHEFS are now CELEBRITY chefs. Good Eats replaced with Cutthroat Kitchen? Seriously? Every time I view the network at primetime it's a goddamn reality show.

Food Networking is holding on to its connection with food by a butcher's twine. I'm seeing all the symptoms G4 had before it supernova'ed into a 24/7 cops marathon. I'm starting to fear the network passed the Chandrasekhar limit. RIP my favorite network :("
Fiery Love,I got sour mashed potatoes at one of the places that fat fuck spotlighted on DDD so fuck him and his stupid fat head. Someone should call 1988 up and say they want their look back.
Fiery Love,"From the end of the piece:

>Just look at the “personalities” that now populate The Food Network – Guy, Rachael Ray, Sandra Lee, Bobby Flay. Did the head of their programming issue a mandate to seek out the most supremely irritating people who may or may not be able to cook decent food to host gimmicky competition shows interspersed with confessional interviews à la “Real Housewives”?

Uh Rachel Ray, Sandra Lee, and Bobby Flay have been on the network far longer than Guy. This writer should probably get his facts straight before bitching."
Fiery Love,"It's not just him though, bobby flay, ann burelle (or however you spell her name), that dude with too much hair on his face, and that near-bald guy who wears really right shirts (Simon, I think), and Alex guacamole are also offenders here"
Fiery Love,A girl I know has met him and worked on his TV show. Says that he is a really nice guy. 
Fiery Love,"Supply and demand, deep-fried meatball stuffed twinkles is what the people want"
Fiery Love,"I used to really hate Guy Fieri, then I jokingly hated him, and now I honestly kinda like him. He's a huge douche, that's obvious, but his show is pretty good and it's better than their other current programming. I do miss Emeril though. "
Fiery Love,"It's real fucking simple, stop making game shows. Put a cook on camera and let him cook."
Fiery Love,Everything went to banal cooking competitions and I tuned out.  I still enjoy America's Test Kitchen.  
Fiery Love,"I don't understand how so many people can complain about the current shows on television. The only reason those shows are shown over and over is because people watch them and it generates ad revenue for the network. If people wanted to watch chefs serenely baking in sunlit kitchens then the network wouldn't hesitate to show it in order to make money.

This is the same reason TLC has gone to shit, MTV stopped playing music, History Channel only shows aliens and Pawn Stars, and Animal Planet can go a whole day without showing so much as a peacock. If you really want your favorite shows to get more air time, watch them, or write a note to the network execs (gl with that one though)."
Fiery Love,I miss Batali on there.  I liked Chuck Hughes Day Off. Still like Giada's Cleavage. 
Fiery Love,They should just make a Chef's Network
Fiery Love,"Eh, Alton Brown was the best cooking show host to ever live. If he's not in it, I'm not interested anyway. "
Fiery Love,I'm so proud of Anthony Bourdain for telling them to fuck themselves. 
Fiery Love,"Every show on every channel that is popular with the unwashed masses has people screaming. I've never been able to handle that and I'm embarrassed for everyone. Food TV has few cooking shows, they just have cheap sideshow entertainment and use the same people over and over because it's easy. I didn't used to think I was better than everyone but I do now and I have for a long time, thanks to tv.

I think the loudest, screamingist food show I ever liked was the original Iron Chef, with subtitles."
Fiery Love,"Eh, maybe.

My girlfriend loves the Food Network. She'd watch Chopped and Cutthroat Kitchen all day if she could. Unless there's a Law & Order on. But nothing will get her to change the channel faster than Guy coming on.

He is pretty grating. I *like* his show. I like seeing the places he finds and the food they make."

The Crown Princess,"I feel like the general public will enjoy it for the most part, whereas the television critics will be very vocal about their dislike of it.

Personally the last season was my least favourite season out of all the seasons. Not bad by any means. I just didn’t enjoy it as much as the first three seasons."
The Crown Princess,McNulty really moving up in the world
The Crown Princess,"""Princess di throwing shade""

Fucking cringe"
The Crown Princess,The fuck did I do?
The Crown Princess,"The review in this season is pretty much divided, many reviewers calling it a brilliant representation with clever writing weaved together for the house of Windsor in the 90s while some calling it poor taste to be released at this time, a life time original with a 100 Million dollar budget, and convuluted asf.

We will have to wait for the IMDB and Metacritics scores to know if it has the game of thrones ending."
The Crown Princess,Give me more sandals. I want to see the sandals!!!
The Crown Princess,"Is this show very pro-Monarchy? Or is it more like The Wire where it exposes them? The show seems incredibly well made so I'm morbidly interested in watching it, but if it's just prestige propaganda I'd rather not"
The Crown Princess,Is that Mr Protestant Whiskey!?
The Crown Princess,rolling stone has the fucking worst headlines
The Crown Princess,Spoiler. The main character dies at the end
The Crown Princess,"oh, the pouty-faced diana. quelle drag! really, the only interesting parts of this series have been the historical-based stories. i could do without the recreated personal conversations and thoughts of a bunch of prats."
The Crown Princess,I thought people wanted to know “everything” about them? Haha Womp
The Crown Princess,I’ve never met a person irl who has watched this show.
The Crown Princess,I'm sure the following season will be better as it focuses on the war on terror and massive screw ups of the labour party.
The Crown Princess,What a dumb show. This shit already happened in our lifetimes and the old fucks are dead. They are all useless. Stop giving them attention
The Crown Princess,"""What the fuck did I do?""- Charles to Diana.
""You're a man whore,Charles.""-Diana to Charles."
The Crown Princess,"Anytime I see him, I can't help but think about that loveable loser, McNulty."
The Crown Princess,"""Di, Di, Diiii - DIANAAAAAAAAA"""
The Crown Princess,"I think The Crown's biggest problem is that what gives the celebrity drama its weight and significance is the historical background it's set in answer to. Seasons 1 and 2 were so good because the drama is set against Winston Churchill, the End of Empire, and quite serious constitutional debates. But the truth is as history marches on, the historical events get less and less spectacular and the Royals play a smaller and smaller part in them. Additionally, as the Queen and Philip eventually settle into their roles and their particular issues get resolved, they get less interesting as characters, and the show focuses more on the rest of the cast, who aren't as likable IMO. Still among my favourite shows ever though."
The Crown Princess,"I really liked the Thatcher stuff tho, the whole season made me really uncomfortable but in a good way"
The Crown Princess,I think the third season was easily the worst
The Crown Princess,"So goes its Emmy winning hopes for drama for 2023 I guess, because you need Critic and General Audience acclaim to be even considered."
The Crown Princess,"Dominic West not only plays a cheater on 3 different shows ( The wire, the affair, the crown) but also cheated on his wife irl"
The Crown Princess,That’s the face of a man who is wondering if he can get some scrapple with that.
The Crown Princess,"I'd imagine that the show is still good, albeit a reflection of a scandal-plagued era for the royal family. The first seasons felt more political, in comparison.

But mainly, I think the context has changed."
The Crown Princess,"> some calling it poor taste to be released at this time

The people saying this are the same people who have been bashing on the show the whole time, they're just using the Queen's death to further their agenda. Everyone should ignore the pearl-clutching Royalists, they aren't arguing in good faith. Their objective is to protect the image of the Monarchy."
The Crown Princess,I thought there is one more season?
The Crown Princess,"Royalists will all be slamming it, so the negative reviews are probably mostly dishonest.  Fans of monarchies are weird."
The Crown Princess,">while some calling it poor taste to be released at this time,

I really hate this logic, can't tell you how many shows I've watched that have had their episodes switched around because there's been some shooting."
The Crown Princess,"As a huge fan of the show, it’s definitely a bit of both. I think the show is intended to make you sympathetic toward the characters and understand the pressures that they deal with, and how hard it is to stray from the status quo even if they don’t necessarily agree with it. It’s definitely a balance between criticizing/exposing and respecting the monarchy and the people involved."
The Crown Princess,"Well it's not that.

I actually think it's kinda neutral. Neither an exposé nor a ringing endorsement.  More just using the royal family as a focal point to traverse UK history and events. 

[Peter Morgan](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0604948/) is primarily a historical/political playwright. He only started writing about the Royals while doing his Tony Blair trilogy (*The Deal, The Queen, The Special Relationship)* all centered on Blair with Michael Sheen playing Blair. But *The Queen* became such a runaway hit, that he ended up writing the West End play, *The Audience,* where Helen Mirren reprised HMQ with the play centering about the monarch's weekly audience with the prime minister.  And that play is what got expanded into *The Crown.*"
The Crown Princess,"It celebrates the good things they do l, those brief glimpses of humanity and leadership, but loudly broadcasts and condemns every single bad thing they do (which is where a lot of the drama comes from as it goes on).

At it’s best it’s really a show about Britain but uses the Royal family as a way to illustrate the changing society and world around us. I recommend it. A lot happens that makes you go “I had no idea that happened”!"
The Crown Princess,Darth Windsor
The Crown Princess,In the end credits she is revealed to have survived his apparent death in by transferring his soul into a clone of himself that he had developed and saved in case he needed to be resurrected.
The Crown Princess,How is this relevant?  There are millions who watch it.  The fact your circle of friends and family isn’t interested probably says more about you than the quality or content of the show.
The Crown Princess,"9.3 Million Viewers in its season 5 trailer alone mate, probably more than your show."
The Crown Princess,"I dont think it will be, seems likely that the show will end in 2002 as that was the year of the Golden Jubilee, and when both Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother died."
The Crown Princess,It’s ending after this season.
The Crown Princess,Yea you took the time to post about it.  What a useless post.
The Crown Princess,"30 years ago is a generation and a decade ago so yes, its part of history now."
The Crown Princess,imagine him with that reedy whispy chuck voice saying i'm a breathing machine for my dick
The Crown Princess,Autoparts
The Crown Princess,[deleted]
The Crown Princess,I know no one wants to talk about prince asshole- but wasn’t he married to fergie and that was huge scandals ? I’m assuming we won’t have that story line ? Or did I get my princes mixed up
The Crown Princess,Yeah. I love the episodes where something is happening in the real world. Episodes focused entirely on the royal family are a snooze fest. Always looks great and the acting is always superb though
The Crown Princess,"Same, I find these new seasons to be even more engaging, since thematically this idea of “royals really struggling to stay relevant” feels more true to the story the show wants to tell than the Foy seasons, where the Royal Family still had tons of institutional power.

In fact, if this series up to now we’re to be summarized, it seems like seasons 1-2 Elizabeth and her family mostly fought against the institution of tbe monarchy (telling them who they could marry, who could be queen, who they could speak to, etc, mostly through Tommy) and in the 3-4 season it’s the family mostly fighting against public perception, dancing the perfect dance to stay relevant and in public favour."
The Crown Princess,"It's going to be up against Succession - a huge Emmys darling (for a good reason) and the final chance to recognise Better Call Saul

The Crown's chances were slim anyway"
The Crown Princess,Its called method acting
The Crown Princess,I’ll be forever grateful to him for giving us McNulty but West himself seems like kind of a douche irl at times. Makes me wonder how much of his performance as McNulty was actually acting.
The Crown Princess,"That's the main criticism is that they tried so hard to intertwine politics, intrigue and royal gossip into a weird, inappropriate mix."
The Crown Princess,[deleted]
The Crown Princess,"Variety: 

>To the question of whether the show is sufficiently respectful of the real people it depicts: It’s too respectful, perennially taking no one’s side in showing that every person involved is fundamentally Good. At one point, Prince Charles, the closest thing to an antihero the show has, dances to rap music with the young people of color his charity supports, as text onscreen tells us how many people he’s helped.

yeah sounds like real hard-hitting stuff

this show’s never been anti-royalist in any meaningful sense. it’s Peter Morgan!"
The Crown Princess,This context makes a bit of sense to me. But the idea that it’s in “poor taste” because a nearly 100 year old woman died as expected is weird as hell to me.
The Crown Princess,"The dude is also good at making historical events or biographical events feel romanticized, mythologized, and like a boxing showdown."
The Crown Princess,What are some of those good things?
The Crown Princess,You’re 100% right about that.
The Crown Princess,It’s not. There’s one more
The Crown Princess,And you were so offended you wasted your time responding. Lol
The Crown Princess,They didn't even show her attempted kidnapping!
The Crown Princess,"I wonder if they’ll cover one of her dogs basically mauling two young children whilst they were playing in the park. Seems like they should and make good use of the actress.

>	The Princess Royal today became the first member of the royal family to be convicted of a criminal offence as she pleaded guilty to a charge under the dangerous dogs act.

>	One of her dogs, a three-year-old English bull terrier called Dotty, bit two children as they walked in Windsor Great Park on April 1 this year."
The Crown Princess,"Oh yeah she was hilarious, they should have used her more. They didn't even talk about her kidnapping!"
The Crown Princess,It’s brought up in one of the episodes this season.
The Crown Princess,Fergie??
The Crown Princess,"The way I see, it Seasons 1 and 2 looked kindly on Elizabeth and co while making the Royal institution look negative. They spent time showing how they struggled to their new roles and had to deal with all the internal policies. But in season 3 and 4, Elizabeth and co now *are* the institution which is why they become far less likeable and we see how some such as Diana suffer."
The Crown Princess,"The Crown literally swept the Emmys last time out, and BCS has never won a single Emmy. Its chances are not slim at all."
The Crown Princess,They better hurry up or the monarchy will end before the show does
The Crown Princess,Didn't Peter Morgan start out saying he's not a royalist and then change his mind two seasons into the show?
The Crown Princess,"It's nuanced in its depiction, kinda like how HBO historical dramas show their history and intrigue to their series."
The Crown Princess,"They’re usually personal triumphs. Charles meeting his parents’ cruel expectations while learning Welsh from a leading republican is a fascinating story. The episode that deals with Aberfan is grisly and moving. There’s some great moments between Thatcher and QE2 which demonstrate the dance between monarchy and democracy, especially around apartheid and Falklands. They’re probably exaggerated for dramatic effect but they are a triumph of writing and performance.

Mostly the show focuses on how some fairly nice posh people slowly get warped into gruesome uncaring monsters that worship their own farts. Charles is a great example. Starts off as a sympathetic child who clearly just needed a hug and becomes a rotten heartless wanker. He does call Andrew a cunt though so that’s satisfying. Elizabeth goes from romantic lead to full on villain. You get a lot of political drama too as each Prime Minister becomes a lead.

I dunno, try it and see what you think. It’s a very well made drama but if you hate the royals it’s not going to change your mind. My girlfriend is from Wales and hates the royals but enjoyed the show and found them broadly sympathetic (sometimes). It doesn’t change any minds because it’s fiction at the end of the day."
The Crown Princess,"Oh shit, my bad!"
The Crown Princess,Clit
The Crown Princess,No time for that when we need another episode of Phillip being moody and Margaret dating someone.
The Crown Princess,"Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York - Prince Andrew’s ex wife."
The Crown Princess,Poor Summer child
The Crown Princess,The Crown swept the Emmies last time out against a very poor field.
The Crown Princess,"i don't know, dude flip-flops more than David Mitchell who says he's not a monarchist then says he does."
The Crown Princess,Agreed. It criticizes them but also humanizes them
The Crown Princess,Commander
The Crown Princess,"When you cast HBC as Margaret, she’s going to command a lot of screen time…even if her storylines aren’t that compelling."
The Crown Princess,That episode of Philip being miserable with those church guys was the most boring thing I've seen on telly.
The Crown Princess,Tobias Menzies was god level Phillip

The Crown Princess,"No.

It won Best Drama against The Boys S2, Bridgerton S1, Handmaid's Tale S4, Lovecraft Country, The Mandalorian S2, Pose S3, This Is Us S5

I don't want to sound like I'm shit talking those shows because I happen to like some of them but as far as competition for a Best Drama Award goes, it's a pretty weak field"
The Crown Princess,"> The exact moment of the crash impact will not be shown

That's it. They're not avoiding the story."
The Crown Princess,Perhaps they could also skip past the world wide televised funeral and parading around of the children as Royal Props to exploit for attention too.
The Crown Princess,"Talk about buckling under pressure. The House of Mountbatten Windsor still has say over their fucking media. Isn't Netflix worth more than their entire Crown Estate?

God DAMN the King!!!"
The Crown Princess,"Probably the right decision, it wouldn’t have added anything to the show besides a grotesque voyeurism."
The Crown Princess,Probably right decision since tons of people on social media get angry very easy.
The Crown Princess,I'll never get the obsession with this family.
The Crown Princess,[deleted]
The Crown Princess,Lol what a thing to get pissy about
The Crown Princess,I don’t think they were forced. The show cares more about the private reactions behind closed doors than the public events.
The Crown Princess,"No, it's not and a very cop out structure of storytelling. The Crown is known for its nuance and balanced storytelling so leaving one of the most important factors that led to the monarchy nearing dissolving in the subsequent funeral is hogwash."
The Crown Princess,"> it wouldn’t have added anything to the show besides a grotesque voyeurism.

It is a show that is about nothing but grotesque Voyeurism."
The Crown Princess,"I pretty much don't care about royalty, but the Crown is a fantastic show."
The Crown Princess,We don't know what's the plan for season 6.
The Crown Princess,"But it is a private event, no adaptation of this crucial event is not yet filmed to celluloid."
The Crown Princess,It’s not as if they’re skipping her death entirely. Can’t think of anything more nuanced than deciding we don’t really need to watch Diana die to tell this story.

About Time,"TLDR

OP wants to feel good about pirating media."
About Time,I think needle drops are the reason this’ll never happen
About Time,don't what?
About Time,"I literally suggested an a hypothetical steam service that would allow people to digitally acquire media they cannot acquire currently, or allow people to legally buy it to keep it. An alternative to the streaming model which leaves massive gaps."
About Time,wdym
About Time,Need an international streaming service.
About Time,"It’s called iTunes. You are never going to get everything you’ve ever wanted in one place, which everyone has pointed out. You’ve over and over used this as an excuse to talk about piracy."
About Time,Shows that use existing songs have to clear them in every country they sell the show in
About Time,This wouldn't be a streaming service. It'd be a storefront like Steam
About Time,">It’s called iTunes. You are never going to get everything you’ve ever wanted in one place

Steam has mostly everything. If it doesn't, it's likely on another storefront or is digitally buyable independently. iTunes has a small fraction of TV shows.

>which everyone has pointed out. You’ve over and over used this as an excuse to talk about piracy.

Suggesting the TV industry work towards setting up a storefront where most TV shows are buyable is somehow justifying piracy? I'm encouraging them to adopt a solution that should help mitigate piracy by removing the 'excuses' for it."
About Time,I mean Netflix manages global releases fairly easily (it's almost everywhere). There's a clear outdated mindset going on with rights here that otherwise makes it absurd.
About Time,[removed]
About Time,Holy fuck I give up. The literal definition of entitlement.
About Time,Yes you figured it out and they didn’t.
About Time,"Netflix for sure manages it for their originals (which is 100% by design). But as any VPN ad will tell you, there’s tons of non-original content on the platform that’s available in certain countries and not others."
About Time,"Well, yes, but I meant to suggest as something that would help the industry like how Steam helped video games."
About Time,Do you actually object to the idea as suggested in my post? A storefront for TV shows that has a comparable scope of content to that of Steam?
About Time,There are already tons of shows that release globally on day 1. It is already clearly possible.
About Time,"Sure, but that's not due to music rights - but due to the fact that there are other contracts on other streaming platforms for the show in other countries. Babylon Berlin, my main OP example, is carried by Sky in Europe. Netflix has the rights in USA and some other territories."
About Time,It’s called iTunes. We’ve covered this.
About Time,https://youtu.be/TRTkCHE1sS4
About Time,"Listen I have no doubt that’s a factor. But my go-to example to for how big a role music rights play is Beavis and Butthead, which to this day *still* has segments you can’t watch legally in the US (let alone other countries) because of music rights are so expensive."
About Time,iTunes is not remotely comparable to Steam in scope here.
About Time,"Yes. Unironically. Why should releases be staggered in this day and age?

Some tv shows literally never release legally in some countries"
About Time,"I honestly don't think this is a music rights thing in this particular context. Certainly not in BB's case. 

I am just amazed the industry doesn't see how this drives piracy"
About Time,Ok well good luck negotiating media rights with every content provider ever invented so that you can get what you want when you want it. I’m sure you’ll make it happen.
About Time,"It’s all contractual. Music rights, first look contracts, syndication deals, supply and demand, etc…"
About Time,"For all I know it’s changed now that streaming and home media are so universal, but I’m fairly certain shows used to only clear music rights for broadcast only. Any other format and the rights had to be re-negotiated. ([this ancient techdirt article](https://www.techdirt.com/2011/08/02/new-beavis-butt-head-to-contain-less-music-because-mtv-mtv-says-its-too-expensive-to-license-music/) talks a little about it)"
About Time,"I assume many European companies would be glad to have a way to offer the world their content since currently it's completely unavailable

Pretty sure it's ironically a non-issue for Korea, by the way - who realise the financial and soft power of culture. There are multiple internationally accessible Korean streaming services."

About Time,Yeah I don't know how much of a *modern problem* it is. But you're certainly right historically.

About Time,It's unfortunate they never explain what happened to the little boy named Hugo who disappears at the beginning of the series. What a strange loose thread.
About Time,"Yeah, I thought of the same thing when I saw the name pop up. The movie was supposed to get a series adaptation but never came about. It could have been a new Sliders. I'm was a little curious about how this Disney+ show would hold up to either of those."
About Time,"I watched the trailer and it looked like a *Dark* remake. 

That’s not a bad thing."
About Time,"The genre is Science Fiction / Adventure. It's better then a 90s kids show. It's one whole story from beginning until the end. 

The actors are good, especially the one that plays young Victor. (Yeah, of some characters there is an old and young version.)"
About Time,"ERN is the most plausible explaination. Every world is different, so everything is possible. Even having powers."
About Time,i believe victor and romane (17 yo version) are from a timeline where humans have super powers. i noticed they were the only ones to have powers AND they traveled together to sam (13 yo version) and bilal (30 yo version). they are all from 3 different timelines with different perspectives and storylines reunited by the ERN
About Time,"It started with Thunder Gun Express.

About Time,"hey women... it's just a fake prosthetic. Just telling you now, sorry... even in Rome the Tripod used a prosthetic because women want to see it longer. He said that he had to use one because he isn't as big as others and they wanted to use TRIPOD later. He's a grower not a shower.

Same with Boogie nights and Mark Wahlberg for the ending.

remember, nothing on TV is real..."
About Time,I don’t like it and I’m pretty sure nobody does
About Time,It's *such* a big penis!
About Time,If there's a Golden Globe for this category I'd nominate Dr. Manhattan in HBO's Watchmen. Just sayin
About Time,HBO was way ahead of its time with full frontal dongs!

About Time,Right? Is this person really saying they don’t believe people want to see nudity??? Like you really think straight women don’t want to see some dick?? Fuck that leftover religious indoctrination that girls and women aren’t as horny as boys and men
About Time,"Fringe isn't necessarily *about* time travel, but it's a very important part of the overall story. Additionally, it's a fantastic show—definitely one of my favorites."
About Time,"12 Monkeys, it's currently in it's 2nd season. It's great. "
About Time,"11.23.63 on Hulu was AMAZING! Short show, only 8 episodes I think. But probably one of my favorites!"
About Time,"[Seven Days](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167720/).

I love this show. The government has a time travel machine that can only go back 7 days in the past. So when a catastrophe occurs, one guy goes back 7 days and warns his department. But since he just went to the past, they have no idea what happened and they have to take his word on everything.

It's interesting because unlike other shows where global catastrophes are barely stopped at the last second, they always occur on this show. I even think a nuclear bomb went off one time."
About Time,Steins;Gate
About Time,"Quantum Leap, Dr Who, and if you can find it Journeyman from 2007 and also 12 Monkeys on Syfi"
About Time,"[Continuum](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347/?ref_=nv_sr_2), one of my personal favorite shows."
About Time,"***Primeval* (2007 - 2011)** - A British television series about a team of scientists and zoologists, as well as the government must deal with rips in time opening up called ""anomalies"" leading to both the past and the future letting in all sorts of things to the present day including dinosaurs, other prehistoric creatures, a medieval knight and predators from the distant future. The CGI is a little shaky to start but I'm sure you'll enjoy it for it's time-travelling aspects. "
About Time,"Daybreak starring Taye Diggs. It was one season long and is a contained story. The premise is that it is Groundhog Day, but instead of being a Rom Com, it's about a cop who is framed for a murder and has to clear his name and figure out who is framing him.

Journeyman and Life On Mars have both been mentioned here. I would lump all three of these together. They're all about guys who are dealing with time travel that they have no control over and they are trying to figure out why it is happening to them. I'd recommend all three of them, but they may be hard to find. "
About Time,Lost
About Time,Quantum leap 
About Time,"Continuum is quite interesting, I never finished more than a couple of seasons, but I think it's good. 12 Monkeys is great, it's currently on its second season and I really enjoy it. Then there is an anime called Steins;Gate that I think is absolutely brilliant, but I know not everyone is into anime. 

Next season though, we'll have a couple more time travel shows on air; Making History, Time After Time, Timeless, and Frequency (this last one isn't strictly time travel, but communication through time)."
About Time,"Time Tunnel - From the 60s, about a secret Government/Military run time travel machine.

About Time,"Voyager, was a time travel show from the nineties.  I loved it as a kid. "
About Time,"Futurama's premise is based on a *form* of time travel, and some of the best episodes and movies expand on the concept."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"On the one hand, I am glad this silly idea of children's books now have a television show based on them.

On the other, as a big fan of the books growing up, I am still fairly soured by the entire execution of the franchise.

I was so excited to see the movie, and overall it was decent. But it entirely skipped an entire book in the series, and not just one entire book but *the* book where Captain Underpants gets his powers.

I had some hope that the TV series would actually course correct and continue the adventures from the books instead of make up brand new stuff. But oh well, not like I am the target demo anyway."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Why on *earth* would anyone post a promotional trailer as an **unlisted** video on Youtube? Don't you want people to find it?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Season2?  I didnt know this was even a show.  My daughter loved the movie and has just started reading the books. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,The movie was alright. The TV show was atrocious. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Well it was on verified sneak peak sites
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,It is amusing. I hate the fourth and ninth episodes tho
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Explain
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,But this has to be better than Teen Titans Go or My Little Pony Friendship is Magic ... right?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"The voice actors were horrible, which is a common enough occurrence. You hire big Hollywood stars to voice act themselves in the movie and since you can't afford their salaries you end up with second rate actors voicing a rough facsimile. There are of course exceptions to the rule (Like Tangled which is phenomenal) but...  
That aside, from the 2 episodes I've seen it seems very formulaic and not very interesting.  
Do the kids like it? I don't know, maybe. But it didn't really appeal to me, a grown up who can afford his own candy to snack on while watching cartoons."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I kind of like both of those shows, but popular consensus would say MLP is better, but TTG is worse because internet "
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Which two episodes did you watch...?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I don't know how anyone over the age of 6 could have a lot of enjoyment out of MLP, I tried watching it when the brony craze was hitting and I couldn't even finish the first episode, it felt like a baby show"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"The first season is the wrong season. I don’t even care if you’re a stickler for chronological order, get a better season."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Ya know, people hate on Flash animation so much....done right and with style I think it can look pretty damn cool. I feel like most shows that use it DO just that. Yes, traditional hand-drawn animation from Korea will always looks better, but I do think that Flash animation has a place for itself when done right. Classic Hanna Barbera/Cartoon Network/Nickelodeon cartoons had some ROUGH looking animation with it being hand drawn..

So yeah, I don't think the animation of this show looks bad. In fact, I think it rather fits the overall style of the show/content. People like to shit on ""Flash"" animation but don't realize that acclaimed shows like Rick and Morty or Bob's Burgers use VERY similar methods."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"This makes me sad, I was really hoping for a second movie. The first one was amazingly well made, I don’t have high hopes for a flash-animated series."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,A sequel is still possible. There is a Trolls Netflix series and a theatrical sequel is still coming. There are also several How to Train Your Dragon seasons on Netflix as well. 
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,The how to train your dragon is the only good series on Netflix and miles ahead in quality then the other dream works show.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I'm mostly interested in how Yaddle speaks. Is she going to have the same speech patterns as Yoda? Or are we going to find out Yoda had a speech impediment all these years?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,That role was absolutely MADE for Jessica Chastain. So Bryce Dallas Howard will be perfect.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"They should have a scene where Yaddle wields a lightsaber in heels, just as an easter egg."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Howard is Yaddle, and Zendaya is Meechee"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Y'all clowning on her for the Jurassic World scene but nobody's giving her respect for directing awesome episodes of Mandalorian and Book of Boba Fett. She's very much part of the good side of modern Star Wars, and it's nice she's getting to do voice cameos in the wider franchise."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Finally, Justice for Yaddle"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Oh good, it's been too long since we've had a star wars series."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,This is Yoda’s secret lover
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I still can't get over how she wore white clothes and heel through the jungle and came out the other end never getting stuck in the mud or getting her clothes dirty. I mean bringing back dinosaurs from extinction is more believable than that happening.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I remember her in TPM, and Yoda just ignoring her big time like the cold motherfucker he is"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Thicc Yaddle incoming.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! YADDLE!!!!!!!!!!!! YADDDDDDLEEEEEEEEEEEEEE WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! ITS HAPPENING. ITS FINALLY HAPPENING! YADDLE! **WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,>Criticism has already started mounting for the show after a clip showing a worried Yaddle in high heels running hurriedly from a T-Rex has disappointed a number of vocal fans.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I hope Exar Kun will be in this.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,[removed]
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I still don’t understand why baby Yoda’s name wasn’t something like Yabo
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Cool?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Please make it stop
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Will Judy Greer play Yaddle’s sister?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,They need to take a two year starwars break.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"It just occurred to me, isn't grogu in the temple rn?"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Is her lightsaber going to be green or orange?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Alrighty.  I tuned out halfway through season 2 of Mandalorian.  All these vapid shows and movies with puddle-deep, made up as they go along stories. Star Wars just doesn’t have much to offer.  It’s be nice if Hollywood could come up with a new idea."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,“Bryce Dallas Howard will play…”. That should be a new tell of when something has jumped the shark.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,You’re all thinking about a pizza delivery porno staring both yaddle and yoda with there broken English
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I'm thinking of that old image floating around of a picture of Yaddle and a green fleshlight
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I forgot how stuck up and snobbish this sub could be. Quick browse through the comments and I remembered.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I don't believe I have liked a single thing she has ever been in
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Star Wars is so fucking dead. Everything has to be explained.

The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,But she doesn't have the same opportunities and gets paid less than Chris Pratt
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,How the hell is someone of Yoda's race going to fight in heels?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space, No nepotism here!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Woop woop yoda with tits!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,She’ll voice her
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,....okay?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Soon to be known as lady Yoda
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Yaddle gonna get killed by Dooku for sure
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,That’s Fiona and golem baby
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,nah bro this will be called female yoda just like how mando's baby yoda called baby yoda. see i even forgot what name he had. something like groot or something idk. baby yoda. female yoda. and normal yoda.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Are we finally getting Yaddle Milk?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I think she did an alright job, and it absolutely confirms that Yoda is a little weirdo for speaking the way he does, and I love it"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,It’s along the Confucius says line…
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I gave up on Star Wars after Mando…hate that the woke crowd has successfully infiltrated the galaxy.  Shameful.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Makes you wonder who was cast first and then got bumped...
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,[deleted]
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,A female of the Yoda species? Oh the fans are not going to like this.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,She is gonna have to lose some weight for the role
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"i collect *star wars* black series action figures and they currently have GLucas, Dave Filoni, and Jon Favreau head sculpts which are detailed. *jurassic world* released a Claire action figure and if you squint, you'll barely see BDH. 
with all the *star wars* directing she does, i was fingers crossing they might find a character for her to play. well here it is and she's voice acting...so close to getting an accurate *spider-man 3* gwen stacy action figure...and I'm ranting. anyways i can't wait for this show to premiere tonight/tomorrow"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,This is less than ideal positioning.  She is vastly more suited *behind* the camera than in front of it (for Star Wars.)
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,YES!!!!!!!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Fuck this
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Make it stop
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Yaddle must have some Tig ol bitties
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,bryce dallas howard is a mediocre nepotism baby
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Well that's fun.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Grogu's mother?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,WHO?!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Why is she still in things
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Baby yoga’s name was a drawn out big reveal that happened well after I’d been watching, but I see this new character’s name in a thumbnail before I even knew the character existed. 😐"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Are they going to CGI her absolute unit of a dump truck?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"As an old guy and a Star Wars fan that saw the first film in the theatre, Im facing some serious burnout with the franchise.

Disney has the throttle wide open and in as much as I like to see new Star Wars content, I feel its killing it for a lot of people."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Someone tell Conan
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,RLM called it.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"They need to slow down with the Star Wars stuff, wtf.."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I'm sure Mr. Plinkett is thrilled
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,This looks incredibly stupid.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,It would be hilarious if it turns out yoda's entire species has been thinking hes a dumbass.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Historically she did speak similarly to him, but after the Disney canon reset she speaks normally in the couple of places she’s shown up.

One thing about Yoda is that if you listen closely he says normal sentences with all the words in conventional order plenty of times, so it’s a mystery. Maybe he figured out it made people listen more closely to what he was saying. That would be a very useful tool as a guy who was a diplomat, professor, lobbyist, general, leader of a religion, and a wizard all at once."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Yaddle speaks normally in the books at least.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"Isn't there a theory behind Yodas speech is that he's lived so long that while language has developed and changed over the centuries, he still speaks the way he learnt growing up. It'd be like if someone who grew up in Shakespearean times was still around speaking like that.

So it depends how old Yaddle is. Quick googling shows she's only half the age of Yoda, so it's very feasible she talks differently to him."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I always though Yoda spoke that way as a way to put others off their guard. If he sounds ridiculous, he must be ridiculous, right? In private with his most trusted friends he spoke normally, like he did to Obi Wan and Luke in Empire. In public he adopted his backwards speech to make others think he was a harmless odd creature, not the powerful warrior he truly was.

That or he just liked fucking with people."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Speech dyslexia and aphasia are real things. Would be super cool if Yaddle was just popping off in flawless RP and Yoda is effortlessly retconned as an inspiration for people with speech impairments.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Good question! Or a whole difference speech pattern!
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,I say split the difference and have her speak in the same speech pattern but in a really clear formal accent instead of a Muppet voice
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"In the game knights of the old republic a character, master vandar, was the same species as yoda, he spoke ""normally"""
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I don't think of Yoda so much as having a speech impediment as having a foreign dialect and speaking pidgin. A big chunk of Star Wars is ""midcentury tropes IN SPACE"" (which only the sequel trilogy has really tried to update with variable success). One of the biggest elements in the Star Wars stew is a mostly harmless but slightly outdated Orientalism: ""anything from the Far East is cool and mysterious."" So you get things like a wandering samurai-philosopher with a faux-Asian name and a last name designed to sound like ""shinobi.""

But you also get weird lingering elements like Yoda, a wizened old shaman in the woods who teaches faux-Eastern mysticism and speaks with a vaguely Asian accent, as well as conjugating his sentences awkwardly in the style of midcentury Engrish tropes. Things like ""Confucius say"" jokes, characters like Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan, etc. Yoda is Space Asian, but he's so universally beloved that no one finds him particularly offensive or outdated. So will they make the rest of his species pointedly Space Asian as well, or is it just going to be him?"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"In the EU, it turned out that while Chewbacca spoke perfect wookie, he was unable to speak English/Basic like other wookies."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I think the current canon answer to this is that he speaks that way because he learned the language so long ago, the rules of it have changed. So she could speak like him if she's around his age, or if she's significantly younger she may speak normally."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,"I think the biggest theory about Yoda, pre-prequels, was that his weird-ass backwards speech was to make anyone stumbling upon his Dagobah enclave assume he was a crazy hermit.

His speech levels out a bit once Luke and him have a rapport, then almost vanishes when Luke revisits in Return of the Jedi.

But that all went out the window with the prequels. It was a clever idea, at least."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Erm. In the shop it is?
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants in Space,Yoda confirmed to constantly be high on ketamine

Down to Earth with Zac Efron,is this the show where he almost died? Did they change the name?
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I can't tell if this is going to be treat or torture for my quarantine-heightened wanderlust/ZEfron general lust.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Zac is so disconnected from all this, its sad, this could have been much much better with someone who has a bit of humility, manners and better vocabulary. Wouldn’t be surprised if some of his word choice makes it viral on twitter lol"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,What happened to his cheeks?
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I like it. Less the hosts and more the people and places they visit. 

The France episode reminded me of the time I visited Vienna and became obsessed with how good the water was compared to my shitty florida tap water."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,This looks kind of fun.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I didn't like the trailer music but otherwise, I think it looks good! Zac Efron is perfect for this type of show."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/zac-efron-health-illness-papua-new-guineau-png-instagram-a9263916.html

I had same thought but no, that one's called Killing Zac Efron.  Cue the jokes..."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I think that is another project, not this one."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I didn’t even see the trailer and my thirst for Zack Efron is justifiably enough to check out at least one episode
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I came here hoping someone else noticed all of this. I’m finishing up the first episode as I type and can’t help but think of how rude it sounded to ask “so shit smoked?” when he was elaborating on what “dung smoked” meant.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Agreed. I am embarrassed that the show makes Americans seem so clueless about the basics of energy production, e.g., the question at the thermonuclear plant in Iceland, “so how do you turn steam into electricity?”"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Steroids
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,bulking season
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Haha yeah its bad or in Efrons words Its a bummer, uncool, not rad"". 
Thought he'd be funnier or more charismatic....seemed forced and made me think hanging out with Zac would be not fun. Sad..... Lol I have theory Darin is rich and starting hanging out with efron for younger pussy and one day he was just like bro we should do a show.... FM"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"just passed the energy part, i don’t mind some of the more naive questions but neither have some personality and i honestly don’t know why darin is in the show"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,wait till the costa rica and italy episode he literally uses the word chicks for girls
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Why would people take that shit?
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"This is some of the funniest shit I’ve read all day lol I thought the same. I know the dude was an alcoholic, so maybe sobering up or something made him kind of less charismatic. Or maybe he’s just uncomfortable in front of a camera like this. We won’t really know I guess! **shrugs**"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Easy. Sex. Money. Looks.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Don't know about looks!
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Someone called it **""A bro has to travel around the world to gain some perspective.""**"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Watched the first episode and I learned a lot about thermal energy. I appreciated the humble learning experiences.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Well his high school didnt really teach science, it was all basketball and singing"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Every time Zac encounters something, anything at all: ""Siiiick!"""
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"It's okay at best, I don't mind watching it but the chemistry between the two doesn't translate great for the format, it seems forced a lot. The worst part is Zac's narration though imo. I'll keep watching because it's good background noise but it doesn't really rank amongst other good travel shows or travel buddy shows."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"It starts off reasonably, but quickly descends into pseudoscience. An ounce of good is wasted in a gallon of nonsense."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Anyone else tired of these lifelong wealthy celebrities doing travel shows?
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Having watched a few episodes, I really enjoy it. The only thing I disliked so far was the Costa Rica episode. It was just a bunch of privileged white hippies doing nothing and it was almost cult like."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Anyone else get annoyed by the ""life coach"" he brought on his journey? Felt like he was  leeching Zac right in front of the camera."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"All of these comments, and not one of you gave him recognition for trying to do something good with his celebrity status?  I for one was fascinated to travel and learn about sustainability.  Many Americans are completely ignorant to how far back we are on the environmental activism front.

The show isn’t meant to be a buddy comedy for your entertainment, it’s a celebrity trying to do something good for the world in a format that younger people can understand.  “Bro... siiiick” may not win a Pulitzer prize, but it speaks to a lot
of the youth.

If a celebrity has enough pull to get a sponsored trip or two around the world, and is able to share it on a huge platform to raise awareness, shouldn’t we be celebrating?  

It’s not “The Other Guys”, or some other dumbass comedy flop.  Let’s not treat it like one."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,He reacts like a 3-year old when they finally put the right wooden block in the right hole
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Zac and the other dude had as much personality as a potato salad.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Ulimate dude bro. Heavy pass
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"""Hi I'm Zac Efron. I'm rich and hot. But it's not all great. The planet is DYING bro. Let's check it out.""

Also, I'm surprised people haven't mentioned how high he is. In the second episode in France he had an ""I'm too high for this and I need to come down"" face the entire time they were lighting candles."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,and he’s stoned the whole time
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I thought this was a pretty decent show. I mean, I wasn't expecting much, but I liked it and blasted thru all of the epi's on one sitting.

Pretty cool show. His hippy surfer dude is def cringe with all of his ""take your shows off so the current of the earth can go directly thru you and make you feel connected"" bullshit.  I hate people like that. 

But other than that, def worth a watch"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,The Costa Rican school community seemed like a cult
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Zac’s narrative “personality” is what you’d think he’d be like all the time in the show, but he’s the complete opposite when the cameras are rolling. Short, unresponsive, lacking in the emotion he’s supposed to be portraying. It all feels weird. I can appreciate what the show is getting across though so it’s a nice background show"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Ah I miss an idiot abroad
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,[deleted]
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I didn't like it. The two didn't have great chemistry. Felt like a worse version of Departures.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departures_(TV_series)

Each to their own."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I enjoyed this show a lot, and honestly Zac’s reactions were always so incredibly pure. It was very heartwarming. 

The cohost grated on me a bit though. And I hate being lectured to “eat fresh and local” from people living in a tropical environment. Sure. You have a year long growing season. Some of us are encased in ice for a good part of the year, BRAH!"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"There's nothing more pure than watching a millionaire celebrity actor traipse around the world on Netflix dime?

No fuck off you cunts. Fuck right off."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Dammit.  I’m not so good with sarcasm on Friday’s.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I'm tellin' ya, they're going to cast him as the next Wolverine."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I hope Zac got after it with the British vegan chick
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,How about all the RVCA product placement. An obvious sponsorship?
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,A snooze fest. Couldn’t even finish an episode.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,How did I know before clicking this that this was a Brian Grubb article?
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Reddit say bad, so it bad"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Made me sad for Effron and his lack of basic knowledge. I was embarrassed for him. I wish he had done his HW, he could’ve really made an impact by educating his young followers. What a missed opportunity. Someone should’ve taken the edibles or bong away right before taping."

Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"""To gain some perspective""

American visits Costa Rica to meet other americans in a little american haven"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Bro gets gains. But this time; they’re intellectual 😎”
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,At least his girlfriend won the science competition in the end
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,The way I watch it is not for Zac’s commentary but to learn some interesting things and for landscape porn. His reactions shouldn’t be the focus.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I enjoy it. It’s two different generations colliding. Zac is humbly awkward as much as Daniel (?) is carelessly childlike.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Can we please talk about how Zac was stoned during half the show? Lmao

Watch the scene where it's both of them, and the girl in the restaurant. It's fucking hilarious."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"It's torture at best, 2 morons that couldn't turn a tap on without instructions, I had to go and watch bourdain just to remember what good journalism was... This pair are fucking idiots. Fucking disgrace this pile of shite."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Dude I feel exactly the same. Started off interesting with all the hydroelectric power and then just started going way downhill when they did the water tasting. The last couple of episodes were just unbearable. To me it just seemed so obvious that Darin hasn't got a clue about the science and is just either making it up on the spot or has learnt it from a load of spiritual bollocks.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Yes! I was not amused with how out of touch Zac Efron was acting. His response to trying goat milk wasn’t “cute” like he probably thought, the show missed the mark for me."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,This is why I don’t watch crap shows like this. It just puts my sad life in perspective...
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Ok, TV Show Idea: We find out what project David Simon is working on where he hires some authentic local person to star in one of his shows, like he did for the Wire.  We take that local guy and make a travel show with him.  Then we air that travel show after David Simon's show becomes popular.  That way people who care about celebrity will enjoy it but the character wouldn't be completely tainted by celebrity.

Or we just take one of the characters from Tiger King and do a travel show with them."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,It’s the second stage of every reality TV sub genre - do the same thing with celebrities.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"So only poor people should do travel shows? Dude, what the fuck? Your jelly is showing."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I saw right through that hippie dude with the super nice house. Hippie-ing(?) it up for the camera.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,That's how traveling to Costa rica is tho haha it's hard right now to travel away from that cause it's just filled with white people trying to change the world. Country is beautiful tho so I love going down there
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Came to reddit to find a comment about this episode! The more we watched it the more i was like a lot their characteristics and mannerisms are borderline cult like.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I’m convinced the guru was the one paying for the whole production and Zac was the star hired to be his “friend”. Every episode they met with someone that guy already knew and in some cases like the fancy potato it seemed he had an actual investment in
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I agree. I enjoyed it because I was happy to see Zac Efron who has a huge following bringing some light to this subject. There are people all round the world who have no idea about this kind of stuff and having his face on this program might get a few more into it.   
If it was a middle aged nobody doing this show, would it have the same pull as sticking his face on it?   
I’m not a fan of Zac‘s but he was getting educated which was nice to see. Opening his eyes a bit, and hopefully he will do some good, and hopefully his fan base will also maybe think a little more about the environment and how the world works."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Redditors love to hate...and love to hate on celebrities. Personally, I find the guy rather goofy and charming and at least he's actually interested in what's going on.

Fucking Reddit is so damn cynical - they think, ""hey a good-looking young celebrity doing some awesome shit, yet he's not a 140 IQ dignified Nobel prize-winner? FUCK that guy!"""
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Well said, and disappointed I had to scroll this far down to see a positive comment. I enjoyed this show, taught me alot about sustainable living and alternatives that I wasn't aware of before. Literally the point of the show. Also Zack seems pretty authentic and ""down to earth""."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Eat your own tongue, “The Other Guys” was outstanding."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"r/television views everything through the filter of ""if I personally like it, it is objectively good, otherwise it is objectively bad""."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Personally, I enjoyed the show. It gave me good vibes. But it is not out of the helms of criticism. Some of it is really basic info and others are a bit white washed green. But everything has its use. 

Not everyone knows what they are showing, maybe because they are young or because they never felt engaged enough to learn about. So watching this info be presented on a new format, with great HD footage and a recognizable celebrity might be what moves people.

Also, it brought me to perspective on how most of people don't know all of this!!! Zac was so out of touch with so much and that is probably how most of United States citizens are. So yeah this show is necessary. It has it's place in the world and it doesn't deserve the hate."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Aren’t celebrities just people too lol, like Leonardo Dicaprio has been pro environment for awhile and wants to do something about climate change. This show is helping with awareness regarding about sustainability . Some of these top comments are sickening"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I’m into it for the same reason. My sister enjoys the show, and these aren’t things she would normally be thinking about."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Remember when everyone fell in love with Zac Efron because he was killing it in “big boy” roles? Now he does one mediocre travel show on Netflix and suddenly he’s back to HSM heat on Reddit.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I’m sorry, but just doing something because it’s for a good cause doesn’t make it good, or better said: oblivious to criticism.


If you liked it, great for you. We all have different opinions. But I really don’t get why you’re specifically mentioning everyone that didn’t like it.


Just as they’re not being mad at people liking the show, so shouldn’t you. But you can write why you loved the show. Simple as that."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,I am guessing this is not the right place for a TWSS joke.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,What kind of potato salad? Because I fuck with some amish.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"The point is to raise awareness to his audience you muppet. Which it surely has, because there was alot to learn about sustainability that alot of people wouldn't have necessarily been exposed too."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Agreed
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Agreed! I was like of all the cases ive read about cults this sounds and looks very similar to a cult!
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,He didn’t say she had a bad diet he said his cousin didn’t lead a very healthy life which is completely relevant to what they were talking about imo
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"I would say departures is completely different, both in purpose and intent.

Departures is an actual travel show about mid/late-20's wanderlust. As interesting and fun as it was, it was often very melancholy because it reflected the double-edge of travel being simultaneously rewarding/life fulfilling but also lonely & holding you back from progressing your life/relationships."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Departures is amazing.  So much more fun and interesting than this show.
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Oh man I love departures. Anyone who hasn’t seen this yet, watch it. 

They both come across as tools, but they grow on you eventually."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Obvious Hilton hotels placements as well
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Same here. 

Wow. why the downvotes for an honest opinion?"
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"At first I thought wow is he dumb or just un educated about these topics but then I thought maybe he’s just trying to start from zero with the info because the majority of people don’t know about these things(Iceland energy, etc) and we live in a society where you’re mocked for not knowing enough or trying to educate yourself. I think the main point of the show is to use Darin’s knowledge to find topics to talk about and use zac’s popularity to bring it to the younger generation."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Yeah, unfortunately the show was more about his surprise to learning things instead of the science that was forgotten in most episodes. Everything was taken at face value and there was nearly 0 empirical thought, then 0 follow up on many of the assumptions taken from drawing conclusions on basic correlations."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,That episode gave me flashbacks to the south Park episode about Hawaiian natives
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Emphasis on ""some."""
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,Don't know why you're downvoted. That shit is hilarious
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,The somebody feed Phil approach
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Yeah, no, you’re right - the show down to earth with Zac Efron shouldn’t focus on Zac Efron. Im sure that’s why they went with Zac Efron. Because their intent was for the focus to *not* be on him. /s

At the end of the day, who cares what people focus on? It would be great if people improve their mindsets, collectively, and begin demanding more from their government in a way that creates sustainable and effective improvements. But man, one hurdle at a time. If people take some joy out of Efron reacting in a less than articulate manner to highly articulate people, that’s fine. I think I’d like the collective happiness around here go up. Even if it’s for stupid reasons."
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,But his reactions are what is going to draw in the eyeballs and hopefully the vapid masses learn something
Down to Earth with Zac Efron,"Ha I need to take a deeper look. Anna Kendrick, is that the water segment?"
Dating Around: Brazil,So many people say You is a guilty pleasure.  Personally I don't feel an ounce of guilt for really enjoying this show.  Just finished season 4 tonight and loved it.  Joe is pure plot armor but honestly I really just don't fucking care.  Stab away Joe.  I'm with you till the end buddy.
Dating Around: Brazil,Joe is the the textbook definition of plot armor. There must be no good lawyers in the you-verse if he’s able to successfully frame so many people
Dating Around: Brazil,First time?
Dating Around: Brazil,"The writers don't understand Joe's character but you do. 
It's always been you.
You're the only one who understands Joe."
Dating Around: Brazil,did you not pay attention to the part where Joe said he wanted Marianne to be found. so her daughter would have closure?
Dating Around: Brazil,"I think this is You's worst season. The whole murder-mystery vibe of the first 5 eps was just okay, but none of those formed into a cohesive ending as the ""killer"" just ""revealed himself by the end of ep 5. None of Joe's investigating has come to a cohesive thought.

With the benefit of hindsight, of course this isn't what really happens (talking about who the killer really is, ep 6 above). But all of the runtime investigating who the eat-the-rich killer was wasted and almost the entire 5 eps felt like they were almost all for nothing. 

Aside from that, the first 5 eps had a weird vibe. I think the writers wanted to change things up, but the generic murder-mystery vibe of the first half made You lose it's identity. It was never like that for the past 3 years.

The 2nd half felt worse. It's almost 5 eps of joe just fighting his inner demon (you-know-who), and the plot just felt like it was pondering up until the 10th ep. I absolutely loved the last half of ep 10 though. The plot twist has been a number of times so it wasn't really a shocker or a game-changer, and it really slowed the pacing down."
Dating Around: Brazil,"I think you're applying too much real world logic to the show. It's a silly murder comedy drama, not a documentary."
Dating Around: Brazil,"I dropped this show after they decided to kill Love and just start the cycle all over again. It was a nice guilty pleasure, but I’m done. The best part of S3 was the brief moments where Joe and Love worked together.

Did they bring Mariane back? Such a dull character when compared to his previous love interests. I couldn’t stand his infatuation with her in S3. I was like, ffs, just focus on Joe and Love."
Dating Around: Brazil,Also would he not watch the news to see if they found her body?
Dating Around: Brazil,"I'm going to agree with A LOT of what you said. Hands down the worst season. It didn't get good or interesting until episode 9!! 🤦🏼‍♀️ The whole ""Eat the Rich"" drama was over the top. None of the characters were good. Over the top, bad acting and hey who cares. Zero investment. Yes in season 2 & 3 there were over the top characters but the writing and acting brought them to life. Forty! Loved him! Sherry and Cary! Hysterical! There's no saving the ""Eat the Rich"" crew! No depth and uuuggghhhh so poorly portrayed.

Was taking that storyline sooooo far worth the payoff at the end! Not sure! 9 episodes were wasted. And really why oh why wouldn't Nadia call the police immediately when she found Marianne. And run like hell when she saw Joe!.🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
Dating Around: Brazil,"Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just *needs* to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous.

As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe."
Dating Around: Brazil,I this season 4 was the best season. It was dumb mindless drama. Yeah lot of plot of armor but it’s popcorn tv just set back and enjoy it.
Dating Around: Brazil,[deleted]
Dating Around: Brazil,"This show is not going for awards. It knows what it wants and executed on it. I love it. I just started, “Your Honor”. The judge is every bit of fuck up like Walter White was. It’s cringey, but I’m sure they know this."
Dating Around: Brazil,What I don’t get is now Joe has multiple personality disorder? Lol it would make sense if that was the case since season 1
Dating Around: Brazil,"I'm just starting to watch season 4. I love the quasi Hercule Poirot whodunit with a established group of suspects in a modern, but traditional English setting. There was even a nod to Agatha Christie in the library! I hope there are more seasons set in Europe.

Binge watched it. Talented writing. Excellent."
Dating Around: Brazil,The blackmailing to kill rhys made no sense because it implied Kate’s dad knew rhys has something on joe. In reality rhys doesn’t know who tf joe is
Dating Around: Brazil,It took you until season four to realise the writing makes no sense?
Dating Around: Brazil,"your complaints make no sense, ur questioning why a psychopathic killer who was experiencing dissociation killed people because of ""not much rationalization"" and yes not hiding Mariennes body was questionable but to me hiding her body was just extra work that wasnt necessary, he hides bodies that would be linked to him, NOt hiding her body isnt a ""plot twist"" in my opinion"
Dating Around: Brazil,I’m happy with this season tbh. Much better than the coattail riding season of 3 from season 2
Dating Around: Brazil,Anyone think Kate gives Ghislaine Maxwell vibes?
Dating Around: Brazil,Another major plot hole I found ridiculous was the way in which Nadia found Marianne. It seems extremely unrealistic to me that nadia simply saw photos of joe frequently eating at that Indian place and somehow put together exactly where Marianne was . Not to mention the fact that she broke into an extremely observant serial killers home 2x and he didn’t even notice (even tho he had a camera planted in the same room) .
Dating Around: Brazil,"I agree with all the points made by OP. It wasn’t fun to watch (yes, I still did), there were so many plot holes and the fact that they tried to give him a redemption arc and then gave him a happy ending is so old and predictable. Based on how they begun this season, they could’ve ended it so much stronger."
Dating Around: Brazil,"**Could not agree more.** 

I found it painful watching the characters time after time make weird decisions. Joe started as a killer who killed but had thought behind it- in this season he seemed to turn into a psycho with no remorse and now will be killing for fun for Kate? HUUH

Watched it all but MY GOD, disliked the character assassination throughout. They have truely ruined his character, I can only predict the next season:

\- Joe kills for Kate

\- He over steps

\- She confronts him

\- They argue

\- If they want another season: she dies. If they are ending it: he dies. 

&#x200B;

Ez

Was nice to see Love again, though."
Dating Around: Brazil,"I completely agree with you. This season was absolute garbage. Honestly, I was so mad when it was revealed that Rhys was just a figment of Joe’s imagination. It is incredibly cheap- just for shock value. Joe’s behavior does not make sense. Most of the character’s behaviors don’t. Season three Joe literally didn’t kill anyone without a thorough reason (Ryan and Love). He even ended up saving Theo and tried to let Gil free. Now we are supposed to believe that he just kills mindlessly, without reason? They really did assassinate his character. Does Netflix expected us to have forgotten what they laid out in previous seasons? honestly I’m incredibly mad and disappointed."
Dating Around: Brazil,That’s how I felt until this season. It was sooo nonsensical that it wasn’t even fun anymore
Dating Around: Brazil,What was plot armor about joe in this 2nd part? I swear yall love throwing that word around when theres plausable reasons for whatever it is
Dating Around: Brazil,"How many people are going to use the useless phrase ""plot armor"" 😒 use your big words and explain exactly what you mean!"
Dating Around: Brazil,"It's fun to watch a villain do what they do best! It's never been about Joe finding justice or completely believable murders. It's about a twisted man who justifies his actions any way he can.

I think he kills so easily because he's unraveling, and I for one love to see it. I'll also be watching till the end :)"
Dating Around: Brazil,Joe has the good lawyers 😂
Dating Around: Brazil,"Not only that but Marianne wrote that in the letter she left for Joe that he read and then burned.

She literally requested that her buddy be found so that her daughter would have closure. 

It was not luck it was all part of the plan to keep her body safe and I guess there OP missed that part."
Dating Around: Brazil,Right. So now she hasn't been found because she got up and left? Surely smart Joe would have realised there was no report of her death. She would have been identified from dental records or maybe even ID on her body as Joe wanted to make sure her daughter got closure?
Dating Around: Brazil,It has to be believable to some degree to be fun to watch. Otherwise it’s magical realism and that’s not what this show was supposed to be.
Dating Around: Brazil,The season 4 love interest will frustrate you even more
Dating Around: Brazil,You should watch it. It will piss you off
Dating Around: Brazil,I feel like finding a dead homeless person in a busy city wouldn't rank highly on most news days but who knows.
Dating Around: Brazil,">Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience. Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

>Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

No the plan doesn't make sense at all. Too many things could go wrong. You don't get locked up for months and decide to remain locked up with someone that hasn't fed you for a while. There was even no guarantee he would return. The plan to kill a professional could also easily go wrong. 

>The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just needs to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous

I don't have a  problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire. 

Joe in past seasons never killed for flimsy reasons. Why would Joe kill a drunk girl cos she said: the murders started after he appeared.

No one even took her seriously.

Joe mostly kills for obsession, love or to protect himself or those he loves. Even when he kills bad people, it isn't for flimsy reasons like that.

>As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe.

He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that"
Dating Around: Brazil,"I know a lot of people disliked Beck when the first season was initially airing, but she had by far and away the most chemistry with Joe, and the writing for her was far stronger than any of the love interests that came after her."
Dating Around: Brazil,I noticed that at the end. They just wanted him back in New York with no credible story on how to get him there
Dating Around: Brazil,"You can't even read and understand what I typed. You just rushed to defend

I said it makes no sense that she would fake her death rather than just escape or call the police. It makes no sense because she had no idea what he would do to her body.

Remember he burnt his ex-wife...there's no guarantee he wouldn't cut up Marienna or bury her

Her gamble makes absolutely no sense especially when you look at the easy option of getting him arrested...which she refused to do because PLOT"
Dating Around: Brazil,"Completely agree, how would you say to end it? I thought they chose the worst option but not sure how I would've wanted it to continue. Almost wish it ended with him killing himself: unsatisfying, but an ending."
Dating Around: Brazil,"There’s going to be another season?!??! People need to stop ruining good things. You’s expiration date was max season three, maybe even two."
Dating Around: Brazil,"The show was adapted from it's books....

But I heard only up to Book 3 has been released...so Netflix went their own way for S4...

Explains the mediocre writing"
Dating Around: Brazil,Felt this after season 3. But I thoroughly enjoyed season 4 more
Dating Around: Brazil,I’m with you. Felt like they killed it this season. This want early joe
Dating Around: Brazil,Seriously. He died but was lucky to get revived from the bay. It is broad daylight but no one sees him slit someone’s throat. His gf is apathetic to him being the one who murdered all her friends and her dad.
Dating Around: Brazil,I was thinking about a news report at least of her body but ya know. ✨️✨️Tv magic✨️✨️
Dating Around: Brazil,The whole point though was for Marienne to be found and identified for her daughter to get Closure so surely Joe would want to make sure his great plan of leaving her on a bench with a weak pulse definitely worked?
Dating Around: Brazil,">The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience.  
>  
>No the plan doesn't make sense at all. Too many things could go wrong. You don't get locked up for months and decide to remain locked up with someone that hasn't fed you for a while. There was even no guarantee he would return. The plan to kill a professional could also easily go wrong.

Of course getting the police would be the better plan, but she was traumatized, scared, tired, etc. The only thing that was keeping her going was her daughter. She wanted to get home and make sure the glove-trotting serial killer would never find her again.

>Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though. He didn’t care about burning Love’s dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn’t love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

>I don't have a problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire.  
Joe in past seasons never killed for flimsy reasons. Why would Joe kill a drunk girl cos she said: the murders started after he appeared.  
No one even took her seriously.  
Joe mostly kills for obsession, love or to protect himself or those he loves. Even when he kills bad people, it isn't for flimsy reasons like that.

Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

&#x200B;

>He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.  
For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that

He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media. He can erase any connection Joe has to Kate or himself. Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads."
Dating Around: Brazil,And her reaction to finding out his depravity was accurate
Dating Around: Brazil,"So do you not know how the real world works. As stated in the show there are people watching the area because its a popular spot for people to jump from. And do you not believe in medicine or science? From personal experience i can tell you people survive drowning. When i was like 16 i got pulled out to sea and was basically dead, but here i am writing this. The only unrealistic thing about that scenario was how fast his recovery time was.

Did you not see the body was hidden in a non populated area behind a car with trees around. Its not that hard to understand…. He didnt just kil him in the middle of a busy highway 

Joe never said he killed all her friends and dad. He only specified that he killed people before. And we know kate is not all the way sane either. She is used to her father disappearing people (killing them) she herself gave kids cancer. And she did dispose of a body previously with joe. She loves him and so she accepts him. 

Im really trying to understand how this is plot armor to u, its not rocket science."
Dating Around: Brazil,">We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though.

Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.


>Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.


>He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men.

Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads.

Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice"
Dating Around: Brazil,"My man was a serial killer walking around in broad daylight, who just so happened to end up with a billionaire girlfriend that was okay with him killing at least one person that she personally knew. It's also absolutely bonkers that he committed all of those murders himself and never got caught. Like the police in London must be absolute dipshits to not put 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 together. Also the absolutely stupidest part of the entire season was Nadia not calling the cops immediately when she found Marianne. Like her being a little Nancy Drew and conveniently fucking the whole thing up was just incredibly lucky for Joe, and the show even hinted at his plot armor here. ""If you call the cops on him he'll just weasel away again."" I'm sorry but Joe is one of the most plot armored characters I've ever seen in fiction."
Dating Around: Brazil,">This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.

I’m not denying that it‘s a gamble or irrational. I’m just saying she’s a traumatized, desperate woman trying to make sure her serial killer kidnapper/stalker can never come looking for her again.

>This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.

Of course not, he’s crazy. He thinks a guy whose book he read and is running for mayor is blackmailing him.

Also I’d argue that he’s *always* smart enough to cover his tracks. When he’s more stable he comes up with it on his own. But when he’s split into Joe and “Rhys”, his mind rationalizes the importance of cleaning up his own messes by coming up with  blackmail schemes and avoiding being “framed.”

&#x200B;

>Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice

If Tom was running for mayor I’d agree, but he’s just financially backing Rhys’s political opponent. Plus, like I said, he can bury stories. No one knows Kate was responsible for children getting cancer when she was 19. If the media found out Joe killed Rhys, who would look deeper into Joe and Kate? Joe’s only friends are Kate’s friends. They barely know him, and they’re all too self-absorbed or too dead to cause a fuss in the media. Plus they would want to protect Kate anyway."
Dating Around: Brazil,"Your a clown right. Your mad about the plot of you? The fact that he met kathryn a woman with a rich dad? He litteraly stalked her at first it was bound to happen. Do you know how many murders arent caught? Its a higher number thank you would think. What 2 and 2 are the police supposed to put together exactly? With the fire at the masion joe was also almost killed so thats good cover. Joe doesnt know rhys so they suspect him of killing him. Nadia wanted to call the police you dumbass. That was her first instinct but marienne (however u spell it) told her no because she knows joe is smart and can get out of tricky spots or flee. How did nadia fuck it up??? She litteraly helped her escape the cage. It was just her need to see justice putting a serial killer away that got her caught.  You can litterally do your own research instead of bitchin.“Often, a serial killer kills for quite some time and they get sloppy but in general the sloppiness is a result of a mental/emotionally spiraling out of control.” There are lots of murderers and killers that we walk by everyday and have no idea because they seem like the “average joe”. It seems your just mad that he keep getting away, but if you used your brain you can connect the dots on how he gets things done. Also at the end of the day this is a fiction show, every show gives character luck or some amount of plot armor to do what they do"
Dating Around: Brazil,"** The one thought that keeps stumping me. Is that at Rhys announcing his candidacy for mayor. Fruitcake crazy, Dawn takes a picture of both Rhys and Joe standing next to each other. 

So does that mean that since they've been seen together... There's a good chance it wasn't just Joe by himself. All along?"
Dating Around: Brazil,Lmao you seem like the only mad one in the conversation. Imagine glorifying a TV program so much that you would write an entire essay to defend it’s ridiculous plot points that make absolutely no sense in the real world.
Dating Around: Brazil,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Dating Around: Brazil,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Dating Around: Brazil,This was a great read.
Dating Around: Brazil,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Dating Around: Brazil,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Dating Around: Brazil,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Dating Around: Brazil,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Dating Around: Brazil,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Dating Around: Brazil,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Dating Around: Brazil,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Dating Around: Brazil,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Dating Around: Brazil,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Dating Around: Brazil,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Dating Around: Brazil,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Dating Around: Brazil,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Dating Around: Brazil,Delta state was the shit!
Dating Around: Brazil,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Dating Around: Brazil,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Dating Around: Brazil,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Dating Around: Brazil,It was on both actually
Dating Around: Brazil,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Dating Around: Brazil,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Dating Around: Brazil,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Dating Around: Brazil,"If you liked MTM, you had a couple places to go from there. There's the Rhoda spin-off, and the Lou Grant spin-off.

Lou Grant was an hourlong drama, though.

I see The Bob Newhart Show and Newhart have both been mentioned. Those two were also produced by Mary Tyler Moore's production company, as were Rhoda and Lou.

And one more total classic that happened to be produced by MTM, WKRP in Cincinnati. Great show. Music rights have virtually disappeared it in the last 20 years, but the Shout Factory DVDs have restored about 85% of the music. And honestly, if I hadn't just told you, you'd probably not even have ever known about the music issues.

Outside of MTM Productions, check out Taxi. Danny DeVito, Tony Danza, Christopher Lloyd, helluva cast."
Dating Around: Brazil,"CBS's Saturday night lineup for the 1973–74 season is often considered the best ever TV lineup:

8:00 All in the Family

8:30 M\*A\*S\*H

9:00 Mary Tyler Moore

9:30 Bob Newhart

10:00 Carol Burnett"
Dating Around: Brazil,[The Bob Newhart Show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068049/) was pretty good.
Dating Around: Brazil,Carol Burnett Show
Dating Around: Brazil,"Ever watch All in the Family. Great show I watched as a kid with my dad. Funny as hell. Still holds well. Cheers is an old favorite. And the A Team, damn I loved that show."
Dating Around: Brazil,Get smart
Dating Around: Brazil,You might want to try News Radio
Dating Around: Brazil,"Cheers  
All in the Family   
M*A*S*H   
WKRP in Cincinnati  
 
Cheers holds up very well. Highly recommended."
Dating Around: Brazil,"Those two, All in the Family and I Love Lucy have all aged amazingly. Even Alice is a fairly good one (based on the Scorsese movie of all things). 

I remember that one where they think the cabin his haunted is surprisingly creepy for it being a 60 year old sitcom too. And the naked painting one is so funny. Too many good ones to list."
Dating Around: Brazil,I absolutely loved the initial interview in the MTM show pilot with Mary and Lou Grant.  It shows the quality of the writing that we came to expect.
Dating Around: Brazil,"You are talking about two of the greatest sitcoms ever, rewarded with countless Emmy Awards, with dream casts and writers and directors and creators, the best of the best. 

So really anything else will pale in comparison. For me, one of the most interesting things about them was that they never seemed to be in a rush, never seemed to be pushing, but instead let the comedy happen, with impeccable timing, making it funnier. These days, everything seems so abrupt, with punch line after punch line not landing. There are exceptions of course, but comedy is just different today."
Dating Around: Brazil,"""WKRP in Cincinnati"" is very good"
Dating Around: Brazil,"That Girl, Laverne and Shirley, The Monkees, I Dream of Jeannie, Bewitched."
Dating Around: Brazil,"MASH, Barney Miller, both Newhart shows, Andy Griffith Show"
Dating Around: Brazil,"Yay classic TV! Lots of my favorites have been mentioned, Cheers, Newhart, Get Smart, The Monkees, I Dream of Jeanie. Other favorites: Green Acres, Our Miss Brooks, Sanford and Son, The Lucy Show (what she did after I Love Lucy), Dobie Gillis, The Jeffersons, Car 54 Where Are You, Good Times, Sergeant Bilko/The Phil Silvers Show, and others I’m sure I’m forgetting. haha And The Golden Girls is a classic, but assuming most people have seen it even now days. Oh, and not as old, but Wings is another favorite.

If you want to browse classic TV shows, besides paid streamers like Hulu and Paramount+, there’s a ton of channels that show old shows on free apps like PlutoTV, Tubi, and Classix, and then there’s MeTV, Antenna TV, Decades, and some other over the air TV stations!"
Dating Around: Brazil,That Girl!
Dating Around: Brazil,"Try Sports Night, great cast and good dialogue."
Dating Around: Brazil,The Odd Couple. Great show.
Dating Around: Brazil,"Lots of great suggestions here from Rhoda, to Taxi, to Laverne and Shirley. I’ll throw in Murphy Brown."
Dating Around: Brazil,Mad About You
Japan Sinks: 2020,I just saw Japan Sinks was trending and I just assumed the country fell into the ocean considering how this year has gone
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Might not be Yuasa’s best work, or the anime of the year, but I think it’s an absolute must watch. 

It’s a rollercoaster ride of surprises and one of the most contemporary anime out there."
Japan Sinks: 2020,This show was excellent
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I gave up after the third episode. Characters didn’t seem to care when other main characters just... died. It was like, well time to keep moving the plot forward."
Japan Sinks: 2020,The first episode is outstanding. Then it just crashed.
Japan Sinks: 2020,absolutely terrible show
Japan Sinks: 2020,I don’t know how this show became such a hot mess. It was a disaster
Japan Sinks: 2020,"It started out strong then got boring, then jumped the shark several times, then had a ‘heart warming ending’. Great show if you only watch episodes one and maybe two."
Japan Sinks: 2020,I'm binging this now. It's like the character treatment of The Walking Dead with the optimism of The Road.
Japan Sinks: 2020,I loved it
Japan Sinks: 2020,"This anime was the absolute worst one I've watched this year.   
The ""main character"" Ayumu was unbearable to watch and just as one-dimensional as the other characters and I felt absolutely nothing when each character died. It wasn't even an ""it's so bad it's good"" type of anime. The ways the characters died were ridiculous, the way they argued, conversed, everything felt forced. The only decent episode was the last one, but compared to the others, that doesn't mean much. If you watch it, at least watch it with other people so you can complain and scream together."
Japan Sinks: 2020,So.. it's not sinking?
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I mean, that *is* the plot of basically every Japanese dystopian future"
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I watched 4 anime the last week, Japan sinks was in fourth place.

It was simply too dull.

The other three are

Bofuri, Chinnubya, and Carole & Tuesday"
Japan Sinks: 2020,I agree. I feel like people are overthinking it.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"So? No one has died close to you? Lives keep on going, and earthquakes are not going to wait for you to cry over it."
Japan Sinks: 2020,You need to keep watching. It gets explained.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Yea same. First episode drew me in, I was ready for more gnarly disaster scenes and bodies falling out of the sky. 

Everything after that was atrocious. Boring hikes with half drawn characters, and I think I somehow slept through the scene where Japan actually sinks into the fucking ocean because I somehow missed it. Then there is the weirdly cheerful ending after 8 hours of boring misery porn. What a cockup."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I loved the show overall, but I couldn’t help but feel like it would’ve been more entertaining to watch the family make their way across the disaster area of Japan trying to find each other."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"dont know why you are getting downvoted. Because this show IS fucking awful. When their fucking FATHER died no seemed to give two shits after 10 seconds. And when the girl died from the gas died, literally no one cared. They might as well just took a shit on her body because they was how much they cared."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"No, but 2020 is only halfway over."
Japan Sinks: 2020,Apparently not
Japan Sinks: 2020,For good reason
Japan Sinks: 2020,I just hate how they butcher all of the character deaths except the mom and kite.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"People are not that rational. I liked that the mom was clearly hurt and holding it together by a thread to be strong for her children, but the 2 kids having almost no reaction to losing their father and a close friend is beyond bizarre."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I refuse to believe Kite died. Also, agreed about all the deaths"
Japan Sinks: 2020,"sees [Redacted] field....


[Redacted]: **YaMs**"
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Through multiple episodes they are talking about their dad quite a bit, ayumu has a breakdown and throws shoes that her dad bought her because she didn't think anyone cares about his death, because they were being rational and new they had to keep moving. The boy, Go, also talks a lot about the dad, saying he wants to meet him again and wondering if he does will he be able to talk to him, I don't want to spoil it for others but they most certainly do care."
Japan Sinks: 2020,u/waspsmacker found a [picture of kite in the audience](https://preview.redd.it/im12s8h7xla51.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=5984a74287c4ac40dd07ca1d1b33ac66e96696da) when Ayumu is in the olympics! Holy shit!
Japan Sinks: 2020,Agreed my personal fan theory is that those white haired kids at the end are his descendants.
Japan Sinks: 2020,I mean... spoilers? But he’s literally at the end lol. He streams that song as she gets ready to run
Japan Sinks: 2020,Those were all flashbacks. Kite is in the crowd watching Ayumu at the Olympics.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Do you have a picture?
Japan Sinks: 2020,[Here you go.](https://preview.redd.it/im12s8h7xla51.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=5984a74287c4ac40dd07ca1d1b33ac66e96696da)
Japan Sinks: 2020,Damn it's real
Japan Sinks: 2020,Looks good!
Japan Sinks: 2020,Cant wait to start it. The trailer looked amazing.
Japan Sinks: 2020,This was both a TV series and movie in the 70s.
Japan Sinks: 2020,That headline tied my brain in a knot.
Japan Sinks: 2020,count me in
Japan Sinks: 2020,I love Netflix so much.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Another Netflix Yuasa series? Fuck yes.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"It was also a remade in the early 2000s IIRC. And there was a parody film called ""The Entire World Sinks Except Japan""."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Great news! His projects are all visually interesting and captivating on at least one level. My favourite of his works is the anime series *Ping Pong the Animation*, although he also did very well with *The Tatami Galaxy* and *Kaiba*."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"> The best-selling novel “Sank Japan” by writer Samatsu Komatsu will be animated for the first time as “**Japan Shark 2020**” by Director Masaaki Yuasa

JAPAN SHARK? That sounds like a very different story."
Japan Sinks: 2020,Excellent.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Wasn't that a movie from a few years ago?
Japan Sinks: 2020,Sounds great!
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Fantastic. Was waiting to hear what his next project would be, have yet to be disappointed.

Already a placeholder up on Netflix for it too, added to the never ending list."
Japan Sinks: 2020,This terrifies me because I'm moving to Japan for work end of this year...
Japan Sinks: 2020,Anime would surely give them edge against disney
Japan Sinks: 2020,oh fuck ya this is the new i have been waiting for!!!! any news on when in 2020
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Apparently it's based on [a popular book from the 70s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Sinks)

Which became *so* popular that it got a parody movie in 2006 called ... [World Sinks *Except* Japan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Igai_Zenbu_Chinbotsu)"
Japan Sinks: 2020,Check out Mind Game if you haven’t already. It’s my personal favourite of his.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Kaiba is one of the best things I have ever seen, anime or not."
Japan Sinks: 2020,Japan Shark has my vote in 2020. He’s a candidate that can cut through all the BS and keep it to simple goals like swimming and eating.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Yes and very underrated that everyone forgot it existed
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Mind Game is so amazing. Also, *Devilman: Crybaby* is on Netflix. If anyone is curious about his work I highly recommend it."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I think I need to rewatch it, because I remember it getting overly convoluted near the end. It’s strange, because I usually prefer serialised storytelling to episodic storytelling, but I ended up preferring the one-off episodes in *Kaiba* (I still think ‘Chroniko’s Boots’ is a phenomenal episode)."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"NSFW though. I didn't know anything about the Devilman series, but I assumed it was hero stuff, since Netflix also has a Devilman/Cyborg 009 crossover. So I started watching it at work and mistakes were made."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Post more threads like this for sure. Always fun to read about some of the lesser known and hyped shows that are due in 2023. I was aware of some of these shows but I had no idea stuff like Mrs Davis and The Consultant were in the works. 

You do a decent job of selling all the shows on that list and that is often more than can be said for the distributors themselves!"
Japan Sinks: 2020,"This is really cool, I've seen some of these where the ""why you should be excited"" section didn't do much but you made me genuinely excited to watch a lot of these, thank you!"
Japan Sinks: 2020,Warrior season 3 HBO Max
Japan Sinks: 2020,The Curse is going to be fucking bonkers but it's going to be on Showtime so I won't ever see it
Japan Sinks: 2020,Interesting that there's no mention on IMDB or the show's poster that Shogun is an adaptation of an incredibly popular book by James Clavell. You would think they'd want to let people know to draw in that audience
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Fantastic write up, love the format. Already knew about many of these, but the 'Why should I be excited?' would for sure sell me on these shows otherwise. Specially the mention of showrunners, writers, and directors and previous shows, since is really common for people to look for new shows based on previous ones they've liked.

I personally I'm most excited for **The Fall of the House of Usher**, as a Flanagan superfan that recently watched **Midnight Mass** and loved every second of it and **Retreat**, ever since **The OA** cancellation my heart longs for more Brit and Zal storytelling.

I'll add **The Consultant**, **Mrs. Davis** and **The Curse** to my list, all seem like great projects."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"There's a non-zero chance that Brit Marling's show is actually season 3 of The OA in disguise, knowing how creative she is."
Japan Sinks: 2020,Woah the guy who made counterpart is making a shogun adaption?? Holy fuck I am extremely excited for that. Counterpart is one of the coolest shows I’ve ever seen and definitely the most unique spy thriller show.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Well now im interested in Time bandits
Japan Sinks: 2020,Nice to see a list that isn't just posting all the blockbuster shows
Japan Sinks: 2020,The ending to the time bandits movie was so messed up it still bothers me to this day ever time I think about it.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Most interesting is mrs davis
Japan Sinks: 2020,Really looking forward to the Apple + shows.  Mrs American Pie and Time Bandits.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"I started watching Willow and was thinking how cool it would be to have a Time Bandits TV series, so happy to see it on the list. The rest of the shows don't really interest me much at this stage, going by the descriptions. Could be some gems in there but nothing I can see right now.

Thanks for posting though."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Or I can not access the streaming service or I dont have that service or Is not interesting enough. Or all reasons to once in the mayority of times.

But your work is interesting."
Japan Sinks: 2020,Looking forward to Shogun. Anything with Samurai Warriors & Japanese Culture intrigue me.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Echo (Disney+) 

Agatha: Coven of Chaos (Disney+)"
Japan Sinks: 2020,How about some foreign shows?
Japan Sinks: 2020,Only the curse sounds great on paper
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Not excited by any of those, but thanks for the post.

Hopefully something piques my interest in the next one.

I have almost nothing to watch at the moment and struggling to find new stuff."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"They pretty much all sound good, but really excited for retreat, shogun and the curse because of whose attached"
Japan Sinks: 2020,I try to keep on top of new stuff but there's a couple of things I'd not heard of that I'll likely read more about/check out
Japan Sinks: 2020,None of these sound interesting.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Great, more of the same shitty shows for white, middle-aged, alcoholic moms."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"> Shōgun, set in feudal Japan, charts the collision of two ambitious men from different worlds and a mysterious female samurai.

That... Is not the plot of ""Shogun"""
Japan Sinks: 2020,Only one I knew about was House of Usher. I'll definitely check out the shows from ''Servant'' and ''The OA''s creators as well as the one from Lindelof.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Honestly I had never heard about any of these shows before reading this. Definitely looking forward to a few of them.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"If Damon Lindelof hadn't already sold me on Mrs Davis, ""Betty Gilpin as a nun battling artificial intelligence"" definitely did"
Japan Sinks: 2020,Agreed. Excellent thread and now I have shows to be excited for. I’m pumped.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"To be fair, most of those shows just haven't started their marketing campaign. The important thing for the distributors is that people know about it when it releases."
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Same. As someone who loves House Hunters International *and* Emma Stone, I feel like this show was basically made for me but I have no clue if Showtime is even a thing here? And if not, where can I watch it?"
Japan Sinks: 2020,It's really not that hard to watch a show on a channel you don't have c'mon.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Paramount+ and Amazon Prime have deals on Showtime frequently. If you have Prime go sign up for their 1.99 a month Black Friday deal and watch Yellowjackets. At least if you're in the USA.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"Please God, I'd do anything for this"
Japan Sinks: 2020,we can only hope.
Japan Sinks: 2020,It was evil.
Japan Sinks: 2020,Shogun doesn't interest you?
Japan Sinks: 2020,Read the book. It is a masterpiece.
Japan Sinks: 2020,I'm pretty sure at least 2 of the 10 are foreign.
Japan Sinks: 2020,"There was one on the list, but I’d love to see more options too. There are some great shows out there we  Americans miss out on until someone like AMC+ or EPIC+ buys the rights. *This is Going To Hurt* was my favorite show this year and no one saw it."
Stateless,It's a beautiful yet harrowing show. A work of art!
Stateless,"Yeah, I really liked it too. The characters had so many layers, especially the arc of Strahovski's character. I was constantly intrigued by the decisions they made. I thought the ending was to be expected since it was based on a true story. You don't usually get really climactic endings unless it's fiction."
Stateless,"I don't like that the show is all about delivering social commentary, I wish it would be more subtle. The ending works for me though, makes it more real.

I porbably recommend this show just for acting, it is that good."
Stateless,"I started watching due to my man being in it, Dominic west. 😍
I’m not too far into the series but I’m already confused(it doesn’t take much)
Can someone please explain to me how she took a dip in the ocean and the next thing she’s in a jail with a German accent. I’m not one to sit still for long and often I get up to do a chore or two... did I miss something ?!? 
If it’s a spoiler, please don’t elaborate."
Stateless,Not finished yet. Like it so far.  I'm at the part where Cam (the gaurd) becomes an utter asshole.
Stateless,"Spoilers... 

I also was really interested in her character. It was clear she was dealing with some major trauma and had some sort of psychotic break. The way her break from reality kept escalating with the dance numbers in her head and everyone around her being like this girl needs help...now, I expected her to really freak out and do something extreme. 

They seemed to be building up to that, but never went through with it. 

There was so much tension in that last episode with the visitors coming to the detention center and the media closing in, I couldn’t believe they deprived us of some clashing between all of the groups and their separate interests.  

There was also little resolution. The cult leaders didn’t face any consequences, the people running the detention center didn’t get any kind of comeuppance. They did such a good job giving these characters layers, it just sort of fell flat at the end."
Stateless,"The show is about asylum seekers and the Australian immigration system, which is monumentally screwed up (and got even worse after when this show was set). I don't know how you could expect this show to not be political. That's the point. It's a criticism of the system and its treatment of people and is based on true stories."
Stateless,They jump around in time at that part. They slowly show us flashbacks to fill in the blanks between that scene and when she is in jail with a German accent.
Stateless,It's one of those shows where things don't make any sense until you keep watching. Especially Sofie's story. I watched the whole series tonight and I was just as confused at first. But it all gets slowly explained. And then she ended up being a character I  was really invested in.
Stateless,"I don't mind that show is political. My problem is that they build story (fictional part and interpretation of real events) around message. ""True"" art doesn't work this way. I understand it is a very subjective, but I feel like the show was cutting conners (from artistic perspective) and was manipulative in a bad way sometimes."
Stateless,Thank you!
Stateless,Did you like the series?
Stateless,"Yeah, I did! Main criticism was probably that I would've loved to have the episode count expanded so we could've seen more of a backstory and arc for some of the asylum seekers we're introduced to. And I wanted to know more what happened at the end to some of the characters. I wanted it to keep going basically haha It's the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) though and they don't get a lot of funding unfortunately.

I wouldn't have changed anything massive with the main storylines. All the leads were covering a different perspective so none of them were really expendable. It helps that the show is packed with amazing Australian actors. Really it was nitpicky things mostly. With the occasional criticism.

Overall the show is very polished. It teaches a lot. It's beautiful and generally well-written. Acting is great. Although the start is a little weird. Sofie's arc is very strange at first but she ends up being one of the best characters. :)"
Stateless,This looks really interesting. Some familiar faces from Rake i could see. Also my boy Jimmy McNulty.
Stateless,I was wondering how soon hollywood  will run towards detention centers(or in simple terms concentration camps) to make some bucks.

Stateless,"Cate Blanchett is ready to kick off her TV career. Next week on March 1, ABC (in Australia, not the US) will premiere the series. Blanchett is also the creator and executive producer behind the scenes and she will also star in the series. 

And on April 15, FX on Hulu will premiere another Cate Blanchett-led series ('Mrs. America') with a stellar cast. She joked on The Ellen Show that she was willing to trade one of her Oscars for an Emmy but it seems she's serious about it."
Stateless,Really wanted her to return as Galadriel for the LOTR show. She still looks amazing.
Stateless,"she must be getting paid a buttload for this or a true, personal passion piece for her. no need for one of the best actors ever still in the prime of her career to do a netflix series."
Stateless,Is there a trailer for stateless?
Stateless,The show is produced by the Australian Broadcasting Commission so definitely a passion piece
Stateless,[Here it is](https://youtu.be/nyxdf2TvcJE)
Stateless,That makes a lot more sense then. Thanks
Stateless,"Blanchett is barely in that trailer. I wonder if this is a George Clooney-in-*Catch-22* situation. EP, active behind the scenes, but barely in it as an actor despite what any marketing might suggest."
Stateless,">The series centers on four strangers — a flight attendant escaping a suburban cult, an Afghan refugee fleeing persecution, a young Australian father escaping a dead-end job and a bureaucrat caught up in a national scandal — who are stuck in an immigration detention center in the Australian desert. Each character deals with the contradictions of protection and border control from a unique perspective, offering relevant and timely insight into issues that countries are grappling with around the world."
Stateless,"Wow, Cate Blanchett is really into TV, it's her second show this year."
Stateless,F* you McNulty.
Stateless,"I’ll be interested to see how this plays in the US, where “just lock up all the illegals and asylum seekers in a camp in the desert” is still outside the Overton Window.

I imagine it might lead to a response of “wait, we can do that?”"
Stateless,"Doesn't sound interesting but because of the cast, I might give it a shot."
Stateless,"Ugh Australian drama makes my skin crawl. It’s rarely if ever good. Animal Kingdom comes to mind as a solitary good example.

There’s a few good creative names here but a lot of domestic run of the mill names from ABC driven productions. I wonder what the motive is here?  I reckon it’s Blanchett and Upton feeling political and moving the machine to talk immigration policy issues. Fair enough, but a strange move for a Hollywood  star. Wonder where she’s headed career wise..."
Stateless,"Obviously a flight attendant is Yvonne Strahovsky, and a bureaucrat is Cate Blanchett who has taken the juiciest role for herself. But who is Dominic West? He is hardly *a young father*, because he is in 50s now, and he doesn't look like an Afghan man."
Stateless,What's the other?
Stateless,"> where “just lock up all the illegals and asylum seekers in a camp in the desert” is still outside the Overton Window.

I mean, even here in Australia you have a bunch of people who are just like to ""Turn back the boat!"" and would rather put people in offshore (and onshore) detention centers."
Stateless,"Aussie drama is either popular, trash, and features the same recycled actors; or it is not really watched and is fantastic."
Stateless,"I don't want much Aussie drama, but whenever I see an add for a new TV show coming onto one of the networks, it seems like it's the same cast from all the other shows. It seems they keep reusing the same actors for everything. Occasionally swapping some in and out."
Stateless,"> Ugh Australian drama makes my skin crawl. It’s rarely if ever good.

Well, SBS did ""Deep Water"" with Yael Stone and Noah Taylor - I quite liked that one. Granted, it was a miniseries, but I remember it having a tight script.

> I reckon it’s Blanchett and Upton feeling political and moving the machine to talk immigration policy issues. Fair enough, but a strange move for a Hollywood star. Wonder where she’s headed career wise...

Well, she does a lot of work for UNHCR so it doesn't really surprise me that she's using her clout to do something like this. She's at the stage of her career where she can choose to just do passion projects for the rest of her life without having to worry about finances, so maybe this is a passion project for her.

Whatever it is, I think it's rather exciting to see an ABC production with a relatively strong cast. I don't rate Courtney at all, but I certainly would watch Blanchett and Strahovski all day, so..."
Stateless,"They could have meant young mother which could be Yvonne leaving Cate as the flight attendant and Dominic as the bureaucrat, I'm just as confused as you. Maybe he runs the detention center?"
Stateless,He will play McNutty.
Stateless,"Actually, Blanchett and West will be the [cult leaders that Strahovski is escaping from](https://www.if.com.au/cate-blanchett-co-creates-and-stars-in-refugee-drama-stateless/)."

Could be worse. The Afghan man could be Scarlett Johansen."

Stateless,"What? Her article was very well-written, with well-presented arguments in favor of her observations. I watched one episode of this show last night and my impression of the show matches hers. I thought - hoped - that Ameer and his family, Afghani refugees, would be given more screen time and character development in further episodes, so I'm disappointed to learn that that isn't the case. I'm still going to watch it, though, as it is a very compelling story that is well-acted, with high production values.

I don't understand what's up with the comments on this subreddit, though. The woman who wrote the article lavished praise on the show, and stated multiple times that the main story, that of a white, middle-class Australian who ends up in an immigrant detention center, is very compelling and very much deserving of attention. But I agree with her that if you're going to do a show about the poor treatment of immigrants and refugees, it would be good to portray it realistically, and the fact is that a huge number of the world's refugees are people of color. The show does at first seem to be about those immigrants who are most badly affected by the crisis, but it's not really about that, at least not to the level that would make the most sense, given reality.

It sounds to me like there are two different programs here. The story of the real-life woman who Sofie is based on is one, and stories about people affected by the refugee crises, especially refugees themselves. Maybe they shouldn't have been put together. But as I said, I've only seen one episode, so maybe I'll change my mind.

Come on, don't be snowflakes. You can take hearing some criticism of a white-centered show that should be more universal, right? No need to get all defensive about it. For god's sake, the writer of the article is *not* racist."
Stateless,">A beautiful performance from Yvonne Strahovski gets a bit more screen time than is appropriate

What is this crap?

I mean I'm sure I won't watch it anyway, but this is still a garbage article."
Stateless,More white people bad. I guess its not racist if theyre white.
Stateless,"Whiteness....

This article's writer seems to be a racist...doesn't he? /s"
Stateless,"Lmao what? Well then go on, tell Luke Cage is racist show for overwhelming blackness.

hypocrites."
Stateless,Can someone explain to me about the whole helicopter coming and they have to hide?
Stateless,">I thought - hoped - that Ameer and his family, Afghani refugees, would be given more screen time and character development in further episodes, so I'm disappointed to learn that that isn't the case.

I have finished watching and I encourage you to watch until the end. **Possible spoilers ahead but I can't hide them under the tag without messing things up: Ameer is the emotional center of the show. He, along with Mina is the most sympathetic character and the one people tend to root for. Sofie is more of an entry point into more stories. By the time you reach the finale, the show has shifted more to Ameer. I thought they were able to balance it anyway. Sofie and Ameer share parallels and I see it as one of the show's statements on race.*

**Possible spoilers: Javad's story has a resolution. If anything, I would have wanted to learn more about Rosna and Farid. I beg to disagree with the article's assessment, however, that side characters like activists, save for Kate Box's character who also happens to be a main character's sister, had more to say than them. *end of spoilers*

The critic wrote:
>Stateless assumed its audience needed white characters to care, reinforcing the disturbing sentiment of Rau's experience — that white people will always be the first given attention in a crisis.

I think this in itself is another statement the show was making. That's actually how the real life case played out and it's still an unfortunate reality until now. I have read about the case Sofie's story is based on, and it truly is sad that in real life, even among thousands of refugees, it took a case of a troubled white woman to get people's attention. **Possible spoilers: Also, in the first few episodes of Stateless you already see the difference in perception and treatment. Sofie is just the unruly illegal German backpacker while the refugees are being interviewed as though they were  terrorists. *end of spoilers*

>Her article was very well-written, with well-presented arguments in favor of her observations.

There are some well-written arguments but I thought she was conflicted or confused, as though under editorial pressure, if not chasing some clout. She kept praising the show but her shifts to criticisms seemed to me like she felt like she just needed to say something negative.

I would also like to point out that the critic herself needed an entry point when it comes to her interest in the show: the white female lead.(In all fairness, Strahovski is indeed phenomenal in her role. She stands out among the cast.)

Overall I really liked Stateless. It was tough to watch and I had to pause a few times but it's an effective eye-opener that doesn't deserve the smug criticism that a few are levelling against it.

Edit: formatting (spoilers)"
Stateless,"Virtue signaling from the left going into hyperbolic overdrive, it'll only get worse in the coming months."
Stateless,A show about refugees should not centre on white narratives. Think slum dog millionaire for example which explores the slums of India told through a white humanitarian for example. This story focuses on Sofi and the guards while I would have liked to see more of the stories of Fareed and Rosna (kurdish girl) and Mohsin and the hilarious Tamil refugees.
Stateless,"My guess is, they don't want the media to get a hold of footage inside the camp. Their living conditions weren't the best. If that footage was on the front page of newspapers, it would be disastrous for the immigration department"
Stateless,Fun fact that cult is based on a real one that's still operating. They even posted a response to the show.
Stateless,This is quite good. It will be on Netflix globally.

The Underclass,The only issue with alternate history looks at the world is that whatever message was intended. A look at what might have been.

The Underclass,"I watched the first episode when it aired, but didn't see the rest of it. I might catch up as we run short of TV in the next few months, but might not bother.

One of the reasons it didn't grasp me is that the main character  was one of the oppressed underclass - a young white man. So although the story-world had an inverted racial order, the show didn't follow through on it's promise and still presented a narrative where the most important perspective was the same as it ever was."

The Underclass,"Only response you can formulate, typical lmao"
The Underclass,"I think that's part of the point that commentator is making isn't it?

That technology was more a contributor to the ""Success"" of European nations than the fact they were white. Had guns been created by African nations first then they realistically could have risen to power because they were simply superior at the technological level.

I'm not well versed in that kind of historical theory to say either way but 1000 years ago being white or black was most likely irrelevant to your nation's position of power in the world, it was more based on things like the land you lived on and what resources and technologies became available to you as a result."

Unfortunately you can't just use one or two blanket slurs for white people.  You have to find out what their ethnicity is, and go from their.  But most people who use the word cracker are too lazy to figure it out.  Just the way it is."
The Underclass,"Resourceful is more tactical. It's being able to make a shelter with just a knife and immediately available resources. Surviving with just a fishing line and a safety pin.

Smarts is learning metallurgy, chemistry, ballistics. Learning the scientific process and applying it. You need all of that in place before you can make guns. And you need your society to be able to support the people developing these things and have enough resources in place to absorb the inevitable failures during the learning phase. Smarts is strategic.

Smarts trumps resourcefulness."

The Underclass,"Lmao, you tried to argue that China “colonized the planet” (LMAO, you flabbergastingly histrionic and historically illiterate racist).  The US actually colonized Korea through massacres and set up fascist dictatorships, like they did the Philippines, like they did in Indonesia, like they did all over the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America (Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador).  Hell, even the US itself is an imperialist, settler colonial project from its inception, and built on terror, genocide, and ongoing murder.  China is not the “world police” and never had an “Open Door Policy”, you fucking propagandist.

Then, when I showed you that the only real world colonizer is actually the US with historical evidence, and all your Yellow Peril scaremongering is just anti-Asian racism with “global Oriental cabals” rather than Jewish ones, you melt down and call a Korean a “Chinese shill” like some hilariously racist Langley bot 🙄.  I guess all Asians are the same to you, you fucking idiot?

Also I know most say The Wire takes a while to get into, but I was honestly hooked from the [cold open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmIvu1yg3bU). The dialogue just seemed so natural and unlike any other cop show before it, plus it's an allegory for the whole show and the war on drugs."
Hook,"Breaking Bad, man that pilot was nuts, guy recklessly driving an rv off-road in a gas mask with an unconscious guy next to him and 2 dead bodies in the back, crashes then aims gun at the open road waiting for the cops. Hooked me right away.

And also The Walking Dead, it might have gotten bad in the later seasons but that pilot was epic."

Hook,"Patriot, I would even say it was just the cold open, before the intro credits that got me a 100% hooked. Truly an amazing opening.

Hook,Fargo. Both season 1 and 2 had perfect first episodes. Season 3 was great as well but took a bit longer to get hooked.

It usually does take me a while to get into a show, but clearly there’s a huge amount of shows that I clicked with immediately!"
Hook,"Do you mean the miniseries or ""33""?"
Hook,Absolutely! And holy shit what a ride!
Hook,"I have mixed feelings on this one.  On one hand the pacing and the ending are absolutely *wild.*  On the other hand the ""bro=ey"" vibe of it, I think, contributed to the misperception that it was a ""badass cop"" show and not an incredible prestige drama."
Hook,"Oh man, yes. *Great* pilot."
Hook,Almost every Sorkin pilot is solid
Hook,"Breaking Bad took a little longer to really grab me but my dad also got super into it on the strength of that opening scene alone. 

Admittedly, it's a great scene. ""My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is NOT an admission of guilt."" Fucking iconic."
Hook,I liked the pilot a lot but I think Netflix has an extended pilot that really doesn’t work for me. It’s significantly longer and the pacing is terrible since all the extra scenes feel useless.
Hook,Came to say the same thing. I laughed all the way through the title credits after that. I tell people they'll know if they like the show or not at that point.
Hook,"I don't love FNL as much as most people do. I'm one of the people who like the later seasons a lot better, BUT I do the same with that pilot episode. I go back and watch it as like a movie. So good!"

Hook,"Bud, I love the show. It is the poster child for the first season slog."
Hook,"I thought the ending of the first episode was kinda silly, but the show is so fucking good in the first two seasons."
Hook,Either.  Both.
Hook,"I didn't watch the mini series because I thought it was the same story and not a prequel.

Starting with 33 was a hell of a way to start a show, just straight into the deep end."
Hook,33 may be the best episode in the series.  It was awesome
Hook,"It wasn't exactly prestige drama, either. Kind of like someone managed to successfully combine Hill Street Blues with The A-Team. Both a badass cop show and ACAB simultaneously."

They don't remember anyone's names or plot points so there aren't any spoilers when they start at ep.1"
Hook,"Battlestar Galactica, S1E1 ""33"".

The miniseries is actually the ""first"" episode of the show, but it can be a little slow at times. ""33"" is straight into the action and tension and it doesn't let up until the end. If someone is skeptical of the series I think it's a good idea to start there and if that doesn't hook them, it's probably just not their sort of show."

my favorite current show is ""For all Mankind"", and I always hope that people make it to episode 1x3. I wouldn't say ""Start the show at 1x3"", but that was the episode that gave me confidence in the show.

Hook,Walkabout in Lost. Maybe my second favorite episode after the self contained The Constant.  I've seen it so many times but the ending still gives me goosebumps.

Basically if you even look at it you’re already dead."
JU-ON: Origins,"With how 2020 is going, we’ll be lucky to make it to October"
JU-ON: Origins,"Something like that yeah. But I could have sworn that also in the grudge 2 the house was burned, essentially releasing the curse out to the world. Then it gets to the USA and it impacts the apartment building.

Shitty ass curse.

I would probably piss myself if a person pretended to be the grudge girl and hid in my house."
JU-ON: Origins,"That's it, one more unprecedented incident and it's Halloween for the rest of the year."
JU-ON: Origins,"I like thinking that the story is circular. That Haruka is the first victim, is held hostage in the house, thus causing the cycle to repeat."
JU-ON: Origins,"I just bing watched it today. 


Based on my understanding, here is the explanation.


1952, the first event occurred that cursed the house : A woman (The Ghost) was kidnapped by the son of the owner of the house. She was sexually abused and died, but the baby went missing after she gave birth.


1960, Yasuo, his father and sister moved to the house. Yasuo and his sister encountered The Ghost, his sister called her mom ( does that mean she is the baby that disappeared in 1952??). He was given the fetus and saw Kiyomi from 1995 trying to break in. He fainted. After that his father disappeared in front of him (melted to the ground)


1988, Kiyomi was raped in the house, her attackers disappeared and she manipulated her rapist into killing her mom and ran away with him. Tetsuya (Haruka's boyfriend) went to see the house and he got cursed and killed by the ghost of the house and infected Haruka's apartment and got her into the event. 
1995, Kiyomi married to Yudai, her rapist and have a son, Toshiki (this kid might be the ghost's kid as Kiyomi said she was given by the ghost). Both Kiyomi and Toshiki got abused by Yudai, Toshiki ended up in coma in the hospital but his spirit went around and tell people to run away.  Kiyomi became hooker, met up with Yudai after he sold his kidney then killed him. She ran to the house, trying to break in and met with her two attackers. They apologized to her and took her back to high school timeline (Whatever the heck that mean).


In the same year, idk before or after, Nobu and his wife were living in the cursed house. Nobu had an affair with Chie, who was pregnant with him. She tried to break up with her husband and got killed by her husband. Her husband then took the baby out of her tummy and went to the house to bury the baby. He saw dead bodies of Nobu and his wife who died 1 day ago. He then encounter Tomoko (from 1997), who made him ramen, he ate then went home and turned himself in to the police. 


1997, preggo tomoko and her husband moved in the house. She met Chie's husband and served him ramen then they saw Nobu and his wife's dead bodies. After that, they invited Haruka, Yasuo and Tetsuya's mom to the house to end the curse. Haruka and Tomoko saw The Ghost killed her rapist, Tomoko turned crazy, her husband melted like Yasuo's dad. Yasuo lived and told the story but he doesn't want to have kids anymore. Tetsuya's mom told Haruka to bury something together, so she buried the cassette and got attacked by the son of the owner which indicate she was the Ghost from 1952 who got kidnapped and sexually abused by him. Which also explain why Tetsuya didnt want to tell her what he saw because he saw her. And the cycle repeated.


To answer your question, 

1) The mom found out Haruka is the ghost afterall, so she's done with all this shit and went crazy

2) Basically every events happened to this house related to her, the baby, the ghost, the fetus, she is the curse itself.

3) Yeah, she is the ghost afterall. 


Some fun facts:

All the news from the TV were actual events that happened in Japan according to the year, Chenobyl, gas attack, serial killer, Junko Furuta. 


House phone is bad: 

Kiyomi's mom got killed by the phone

Toshiki got beaten by the phone

Chie got her tummy stuffed with the phone"
JU-ON: Origins,"I am a fan on the grudge franchise. This was on my suggestions. I had no idea about it. I was also skeptical about it since, shows tend to get ruined in the process to appeal to a wide audience. I was going to watch 1 episode, but ended up watching all of them. Its more of a supernatural mystery with a lot juicy horror. The entire show really does showcase Japanese horror marvelously. The last episode could have been the best if there was more time given to it. My only question, and this bothers me, is why was Tetsuya's mother left alone after the seance?
If someone is thinking about watching it. Go for it. It's got 6.5 on imdb. That is a 7.5 in horror ratings. Sad some people don't get this. I really how there is a second season."
JU-ON: Origins,"Although, like they said, they didn't use jumpscares compared to previous Ju-on/Grudge films (some say jumpscares are cheap and overused these days), I think they did it really well to build up the fear throughout the series. I binged the entire 3 hours on the Friday night it came out alone in my apartment and wasn't scared initially, but I did notice it starting to creep me out more towards the end.

One thing I must say is, I think they might have done it this was to highlight the real scary thing, which is the true horrors of Japanese society.

Another thing I loved about this series is the similarities to my all time favourite horror film, Noroi, in the way it slowly builds up an investigation into a mystery and it ties together a bunch of seemingly unrelated stories towards the end.

I feel like I have seen some of the scenes before in some of the old Ju-on films. i.e. the fetus in the jailcell and the shadow time traveler at the end seem very familiar. I will have to rewatch some of the old films."
JU-ON: Origins,"Here’s my questions, what I’m uncertain about, and what I believe:

1.) what really happened to Mai? She is the other female friend of one of Kiyomi’s attacker. We don’t know how she disappeared and if anything she did plays out in affecting the timeline. During kiyomi’s rape she meows like a cat and then disappears. What lured her away? Are we supposed to accept that the curse killed her off and that it is what it is? Maybe Kiyomi and the 2 female friends are still alive since we never see their physical dead bodies and are just traveling between timelines. 

2.) did Yudai really hit toshiki on the head with the phone? I feel like it could have been Kiyomi or The Ghost. The obvious conclusion is that that yudai hit toshiki then left, only to come back in the crowd when the ambulance arrives, but what if Yudai was already out and Kiyomi lashed at toshiki. It’s like the scene is set up to easily blame the husband but the body language of Kiyomi and circumstances tell a different story. Toshiki only comes to Yudai while he’s in the coma saying “run away” and Kiyomi tells Yudai when he visits that toshiki never visits her. 

3.) I don’t think Chie’s husband stuffed the phone inside her, even he was surprised by it. That little detail is shrouded in mystery too and add to the fact that yasuo knew about it as well. 

4.) how did Nobu and his wife die? Did nobu kill his wife to be with Chie then commit suicide from the aftermath guilt? I don’t think it’s this because in the restaurant, Nobu didn’t seemed interested in Chie, it was probably a one time affair which he probably regrets. He brushes off Chie when she wants to come up with baby names and only offers to help her but never be there. It doesn’t feel enough to compel Nobu to kill his wife and then suicide. This leads me to believe there is more mystery surrounding their deaths. Or was it the house and the curse?

5.) I don’t think the black shadow is Kiyomi and here’s why. The first scene of her breaking the glass, she sees young yasuo, and then the perspective changes and yasuo does in fact see Kiyomi, not a black shadow. Kiyomi never leaves the same way she came in, she left through a side door with the two girls back to “high school”. It also doesn’t match up with how Kiyomi described having to have gotten her child toshiki. Unless the directors changed this up so that we wouldn’t be able to figure things out until the end, it’s only the second time that she is changed to a black shadow, but I believe it has to be a different entity. 

6.) what’s with yasuo’s dad and and tomoko’s husband suddenly vanishing in thin air? Since they happened to be standing in the same spot, I think the first time Haruka and Tetsuya’s mom did the seance, it was the curse of the hand touching the map because when Haruka and the mom looked at it, there was a burn on the map just like the burn on the ground where they disappeared. 

7.) when did Tetsuya’s mom tell Haruka to bury something together? The Ghost visits Tetsuya’s mom in the attic and after that we don’t see her ever again. At the end she shows up laughing and is gone the next moment, I’m assuming she’s dead and that was her ghost. 


There has to be a season 2 because so much is left in a mystery. 
- Why is toshiki saying “run away” and what happens to him now that he’s in a coma and possibly recovering?
- When did Kiyomi get toshiki?—the black shadow could not have been her because it’s details are way off.
- We find out the rapist of 1952 actually died and that the girl he got pregnant is alive, so why did the newspaper say that she died and the baby/rapist disappeared?—also why did it take place in the bedroom and not the attic like yasuo and the detective discovered in the episode before?
- where the heck is Tetsuya’s mom?"
JU-ON: Origins,"One thing I don’t see anyone mention; when kiyomi is raped, she is told “you know why this is happening to you, right?” And i don’t get it?
Is it a red herring? Or is there some deeper meaning to the rape?
The whole story of the two first episodes with the rape and the girlfriend that’s okay with it, but then her friend dissapears in the house, and everyone is acting as though kiyomi wasn’t just raped... it’s so confusing to me"
JU-ON: Origins,Im planning to watch it again atleast the final episode.. see if I missed anything.. cuz as it stands.. dont have the slightest clue..
JU-ON: Origins,"What if the whole thing was a time loop and Haruka is the woman in white. Haruka goes back in time in 1952 , ends up being the woman the landlord's son tortured ."
JU-ON: Origins,Did two men die of Spontaneous Combustion in front of the house?
JU-ON: Origins,"IS TOSHIKI meant to be TOSHIO???? . lol, i rather enjoy it, but nothing about it feels like ""origins"" its just confuses me even more rather than getting answers how it started."
JU-ON: Origins,"1. What was with Tetsuya's mother laughing at Haruka for, at the end of 6th episode.?
I believe that Haruka could see the ghost of the person that was about to die. That scene may take place during Tetsuya meeting the first murdered lady

2. What does the fetus crying mean after Haruka burying whatever it was?
Probably the symbol for the first murder case cause the horror scene. Since the house isn't actually haunted, but a portal between time.

3. Finally from where and how did the guy with the knife shows up from behind Haruka, taking her hostage?
The guy probably from the first or second murder, you could rewind back when the inspector talking to the house agent about the past history of those people who bought the house."
JU-ON: Origins,It reminded me a lot of Twin Peaks the return. The story telling and the nature shot at the end of the episodes.
JU-ON: Origins,"I'm on my second viewing and am loving it (because it reminds me of my favourite horror film Noroi), but am hearing some very divided opinions on it (if any, given that it pretty much seems to be hidden from the mainstream). There isn't much written about it online but just saw an article from Forbes calling it one of the worst series on Netflix.

I feel like this must be an acquired taste because I only like it because of my obsession with Japanese society and japanese cinema in the past decade - and it definitely captures a lot of the elements of that.

I guess maybe Netflix is too mainstream for something like this."
JU-ON: Origins,"I just finished the show in one sitting, I was invested at first but to be honest I just found it quite silly by the end, especially due to some cheesy effects. That merging timelines makes sense to me but I still dont get what the fuck was happening. Is there supposed to be another season coming?"
JU-ON: Origins,read this explanation article it’ll much more sense after 😰 https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.denofgeek.com/tv/ju-on-origins-ending-explained/%3famp
JU-ON: Origins,Is this in any way related to the Japanese movie Grudge?
JU-ON: Origins,"I loved the show but I found it pretty confusing towards the end. Can someone try and explain the last two episodes for me? Why did the two men just vanish, leaving a boiling puddle? What did the seance in the attic accomplish? Were all the hauntings just cases of time periods overlapping? 

Some guy kidnapped a woman and impregnated her and then she killed him and nobody ever found the body. Then the paranormal writer guy's sister was taken by a ghost (of the kidnapped woman?) and he saw a black ghost (super fucking creepy) that was actually the raped girl breaking into the house in 1995. What happened then? Why did the writer's dad seem to freak out and run out into the street and vanish in a puff of smoke?"
JU-ON: Origins,Yup!! Same here.. even with the hard to follow events or scenes it was still pretty disturbing to say the least.
JU-ON: Origins,"Just watched it. It is not scary but storywise and atmosphere is an improvement from the 2014 Japanese remakes. 

On another note, Tetsuya's mum laughing at the end is creepy. She's probably dead by then right cause she looks blue? And why is Yasuo the only one surviving everything."
JU-ON: Origins,"From what I gathered, Ju-On origins, while very similar in ways to the original, isn't quite the origins? Toshiko is very similar to Toshio, except that Toshio's mother was killed. I guess this is a series with many references from the original, but uses an alternate reality that does not include the Saeki family? There were references to Koboyashi with Kiyomi."
JU-ON: Origins,Is there going to be a season 2 where it goes more in depth?
JU-ON: Origins,"i kept watching it expecting something like the oldschool grudge movies.

&#x200B;

was expecting some creepy girl to be walking down the stairs all crunched up and creepy moving.

&#x200B;

glad that never came.  don't think my heart could take it.

&#x200B;

i was bit confused on the little girl? the storywriters sister?

so she and the brother (storywriter) were in the attic.. ""hey mum, mum""  ""thats not mum?"" and thats when the brother tripped and fell back into the house.

&#x200B;

what happened to the sister? is that the part of the newspapers saying the little girl went missing? she was basically taken? 

&#x200B;

also who is she(the woman in the attic)? the dad of the son/daughter had no wife right? i recall something about stairs being removed with the furniture being upstairs. the real-e-state guy wasn't sure if she passed away.

&#x200B;

was the dad keeping her (his wife) locked up there? but the son said it wasn't her mum?

&#x200B;

the 2 dads being combusted.. apparently it was linked to the burn mark on the map? ok.. i got that.

&#x200B;

why did they leave the ghost whisperer in the attic alone? anyone? the scream of the girl/pregnant wife drama.. they got split up?

&#x200B;

nobody went to check on the ghost whisperer back in the attic tho?

&#x200B;

and the end.. burying the tape.. not sure why the ghost-whisperer was laughing.. unless it was because she was talking to her (the girl who was burying the tape) in the attic.. 

which she then got kidnapped? possibly raped/kept in the attic. was that her in the attic then? timelines.. crossing the end is actually the beginning starting with you.

&#x200B;

tho the creepy girl in the attic didn't exactly seem like a ghost? more like a zombie. is this why everyone is missing. bit of a dracula scenario and shes taking everybodys life force to live on. would explain the decaying-look. 

&#x200B;

would love a continuation on this tho. i'd re-watch the grudge movies but it was more horror based then mystery/spooky/dark like this series. i still remember the washing the hair and suddenly feel a hand on the back of your head. that made me scared to close my eyes in the shower as a kid. many shampoos in the eye."
JU-ON: Origins,Rewatched briefly today and i noticed something about Haruka. She is the same actress who was in 2014 Ju-on The Begining of the end. She was a school girl bully in that movie if i recall.
JU-ON: Origins,"Holy shit, Tetsuya’s mother laughing at the end while the tape is buried... I think I had a nightmare about that the night after I watched it."
JU-ON: Origins,"Finish watching all 6 episodes. Is this a prequel of the 2014 reboot movie?  
Because the Saeki Family incident should already happen in 1994.  


Whatever The Series seem to use a time travel plot."
JU-ON: Origins,"I enjoyed it, but there was barely any scares (if any at all), which was the main reason I watched The Grudge in the first place. That said, I have no idea what happened LMAO the time travel kind of threw me off, I guess the whole thing just circles itself and in the end the house is just eternally haunted by the souls captured. 

The beginning where the girl hid in the closet, that was recreated from the first movie, wasn't it? I vaguely remembered it, but I do remember that that scene scared me to death when I was a kid, and the recreation barely did anything for me.

I'd still be very much interested in another season if they decided to make another!"
JU-ON: Origins,I understand everything except the one scene where the guy beats(kills?) the little girl in the car. How were they connected to the story?
JU-ON: Origins,Hell yeah ! I thought this show was going to be mediocre or meh ...boy was I wrong so very wrong ...this show is fucking nuts !
JU-ON: Origins,So I've never watched the movies. Do I start with this or do I need to see the movies first to get this whole connectivity plot?
JU-ON: Origins,"I like the symmetry of the more obscure curse aspects. Take for example: 

1a ) of Chio's husband getting stabbed in the kidneys when she tries to kill him (before he kills her and steals the baby)

Compared to 1b) the punk schoolboy being fresh off the table of a back alley operation, fresh wound in a similar location, limping a similar way

And then a step further: both were not the father of the child they thought was theirs. And both responsible for their child's death (or brain death). 

And then step back: the 1st child was taken directly from chiyo's body, mirroring the initial missing baby from the original kidnapping victim back in the 50's or 60's. 

The braindead kid is pretty much the same age as our main paranormal author was when he lived at the house, both survived their respective encounters. (As far as we can tell anyway). 


There's a lot more of those symmetrical tidbits i want to explore, but i just finished ep. 6 about sn hour ago and am still processing."
JU-ON: Origins,Let me just say that I have never been as traumatized by a scene as the one where young Yasuo was holding the crying baby and its mouth stretched. I got goosebumps and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Love how Japanese horror (for the most part) doesn't rely heavily on cheap jump scares to scare you.
JU-ON: Origins,Is juon about the junko murders?!
JU-ON: Origins,A guy on YouTube breaks it down really well!
JU-ON: Origins,"is there a main thread for this series? i am loving reading all of your analysis!!

u/Princessalicekawaii explained it the best. 

I need to re-watch to understand the original ghost theory a little more."
JU-ON: Origins,A bit late but who was the skinny girl in the attic who killed tetsuyas mom
JU-ON: Origins,"Why did the man in jail, Yasuo interview also escape unharmed? The husband that the baby wwnt into mouth.... did he go mad or die in prison?


Just binged all 6 episodes and went online for clarification and found loads of cases of frustrated students killing other students.... very traumatic 😓🤮🇯🇵"
JU-ON: Origins,"My theory: 

Facts: Yasuo and his family moved to the house in 1960 (Yasuo 5, sister 8 years old). Yasuo said they were both adopted. The incident of the captive woman occurred in 1952. 

Theory 1: So I think the sister of Yasuo is the actual daughter of the Ghost. That’s why she said when they were kids and go up and saw the Ghost “it’s mom”. She actually was her mom. And what happened to her after that? We don’t really know.

Theory 2: I would even say that the mother of haruka’s boyfriend could be the sister of Yasuo as an old person. That would explain her “powers” and her laught at the end.

Theory 3: In fact I think there is 2 babies. That’s why the Ghost said “buried it together” and Yasuo saying at the end about the telephone “it’s to keep something from going out”. I think baby 1 is the sister of Yasuo that lived and was adopted. And baby 2 it’s the one that died, the one “cursed” that goes from women to women.

Or something like that haha this series has to many holes to fill with just theories.

Oh, and I agree with the theory of Haruka being the Ghost and the full circle theory. 

Good series though!

Edit: grammar"
JU-ON: Origins,"So I just watched the show (late to the party I know) but has anyone thought maybe Kiyomi in the closet is Kiyomi from the future? Maybe her going back to a time she was in put her mind in that body. Think about this:

She sees Yudai after he raped her and seems happy to see him/wants to be with him. Kind of odd unless it's her from the future happy to see her husband alive again (after she killed him and then seemed to have regrets). It also explains her ""going back to high school"" and vanishing. 

Just some thoughts I had about that exact moment"
JU-ON: Origins,"Necropost!!  Haha, get it?  ... y'know, 'cause...  dead people..

Anyway, who can explain the footage shown during the credits?  A bunch of fallen trees in water, with a sort of black sludge oozing from the center?"
JU-ON: Origins,[deleted]
JU-ON: Origins,Yea.. that could also be the case.. but if you think back to the final episode when Haruka has the vision of the guy getting he's throat sliced off on the bed.. the pregnant lady looks nothing like Haruka neither does the lady in white.
JU-ON: Origins,"This was my first thought when i saw that.  My husband disagreed, but didn't have another explanation to offer.  

We finished it a couple minutes ago so I'm just now processing it"
JU-ON: Origins,"Thanks for typing every single detail appreciate the effort. Now that I think about it.. Tetsuya's insistence that his mother and Haruka keep away from the house and finally the mother losing it at the end gives me a different insight about the show.. which is also what everyone seems to think that Haruka is the victim eventually turning into a vengeful ghost and the whole cycle repeating itself. 

Thanks again 🙂☺️"
JU-ON: Origins,"I think the only part I am not sure about is if Haruko is the original ghost. Because we actually see the woman who becomes the ghost slit the throat of the landlord’s son and she looks nothing like Haruko. I think Haruko being kidnapped at the end by the landlord’s son is just a way for the curse to continue... though admittedly that’s less satisfying then Haruko being the OG.

I also wonder if there is something to Yasuo guessing that the phone was inside Chie’s bodu. The detective looked a little suspicious and Yasuo’s behavior in that scene looked off."
JU-ON: Origins,"Sounds very plausible!

only one thing seems off here: It seems at first Yasuo saw Kiyomi breaking the glass. However, when he retracted his actual memory, he saw a black figure breaking the glass and took the baby. The black figure got long hair and wore skirt, while Haruka's hair was short  and she wore pants then. I thought it was the White Woman, but then why she took the baby after she gave it to Yasuo. Is this the reason why the baby disappeared because another ghost took him? If Toshiki IS the baby, then it is impossible that Kiyomi broke the glass and stole it from Yasuo, as she said she was given the baby by the Woman in White."
JU-ON: Origins,"Something else to note, early on, Tetsuya saw the ghost in the apartment but when Haruka comes in to comfort Tetsuya, all he sees for a brief moment is the Ghost, which would make so much sense with your theory that Haruka truly is the Ghost before shit hits the fan"
JU-ON: Origins,"When Kiyomi went back and broke into the house, the way I saw that is that the 2 school girls were already spirits, and they took her off to her ‘high school times’ but they somehow killed her so she can be a spirit as well. 

I also found it odd that Yasuo knew about the phone stuck inside the dead girls belly when no one knew that except the detectives and the killer. And yasuo never did explain the question that people kept asking him about his interest in writing those stories. Was he involved somehow without him remembering?"
JU-ON: Origins,"Thank you for your summarize! That clear a lot of questions I’m having.

I still have some question though. Can you help?

1.	Who put the telephone into Chie’s belly?
2.	Who is the black figure that take the baby from the house?
3.	Haruka look different from the women that kill the rapist. Are they really the same person?"
JU-ON: Origins,Any idea why Yasuo was spared from death/misery by the house/ghosts?
JU-ON: Origins,Ok I see I'm just going to have to watch this over again because I am equal parts lost and horrified. Thanks for your explanation.
JU-ON: Origins,I don’t understand how Haruka saw Tetsuya across the park at Tetsuya’s mums house. Was her being at the house a dream?
JU-ON: Origins,Great over view. Any idea about Yasuo?   The detective pointing out the phone issue in his book makes me feel his is very much the key to this mystery.  His wife saying another one know or something like that makes me think the story is writing itself as though he writes the story and the stuff actually happens.  I need to rewatch and look for Easter eggs or something.  Crazy show but I actually like it. Maybe it’s because it keeps me guessing.
JU-ON: Origins,"- My take is Yasuo the author, is the missing child from the original rape victim back in the 50s. 8 years later, he grew up and moved in with an adopted family back to the same house. Note that the adopted family was without a mother. In the closet when the sister then went Attic, somehow the sister proclaim the ghost to be the mother. While the ghost handed a dead baby to yasuo for no good reason."
JU-ON: Origins,"I think as Tomoko was distressed Haruka might have raised an alarm so the inspector and Masuo went to their aid, leaving Tetsuya's mom alone."
JU-ON: Origins,"""Noroi"" il be sure to check it out. I grew up watching horror films but something about the way the Japanese do it really makes me fall in love with the genre all over again."
JU-ON: Origins,"The original Japanese barely use any jumpscares as well. Not as much as the American remakes, anyway"
JU-ON: Origins,"Thank god, I 100% agree with your questions and analyses.. While a lot of these other comments are nice, they’re majorly confused. I think most of the uncertainties you note shouldn’t be written off. Hopefully it’s resolved in a new season, but I’m familiar with some contemporary Japanese narratives being content with mystery for the sake of mystery (see Kafka on the Shore by Murakami)"
JU-ON: Origins,"**1) I think Mai and Yoshie died at that house, but their bodies vanished, because we’ve seen other instances of people vanishing at the house too** (the poor dads, who got blitzed into smoke, and Testuya’s mom...who’s probably is dead by the time she appears laughing in the last scene).  Whatever happened to them, their fates are tied to the house forever.

Kiyomi’s probably dead too. She leaves with Mai and Yoshie, but we don’t see her leaving the house. She’s not at the house when the detectives arrive the next day. We don’t see a scene of her in the past again either. Since one of the themes here is that trauma can’t be erased, the only way that Kiyomi returns to the past (her time of innocence) is as a ghost.

**2) I think Yudai hit Toshiki with the phone. When Toshiki is first introduced, we see Yudai hitting Kiyomi, and then aggressively turn to Toshiki to scream and stomp at him.** So Yudai already has a history of aggressive behavior towards Toshiki, has a motive for violence (Yudai believes Toshiki isn’t his kid), and then it turns out that the same weapon he bashed Kiyomi’s mom in the head with has been used to bash in his son’s head. Conversely, we don’t see Kiyomi behave aggressively towards Toshiki, and she tries to protect Toshiki in the first scene by holding Yudai off.

Besides the phone, another parallel would only work as well if this were true too. The last straw for the Lady in White is when her rapist thrusts a knife at her after touching her pregnant stomach. Symbolically, she kills her rapist after he threatens her child. Kiyomi kills her rapist after he puts her child in a coma.

I also think that while Toshiki has the soul of The Lady in White’s child, biologically he’s Kiyomi and Yudai’s child. It’s hard to hide pregnancy lol. Toshiki probably loves his parents, even though they gave him a shitty childhood. When Yudai wasn't blaming Kiyomi and their kid for “ruining” his life, he probably showed Toshiki some affection too.

I’m not sure why Toshiki doesn’t appear to Kiyomi. I wonder if it’s because Kiyomi is a surrogate for the Lady in White? She acts like a proxy for the Lady in White’s rage (kills her abusive mother and rapist husband) and raises the LiW's child. Maybe it's kinda hard to warn the someone who's so closely tied to the ghost."
JU-ON: Origins,"I think she already had a reputation to be a ""whore"" for some reason. Her mother said something like that she seduced her father. And the mother also thought that the teacher wanted to fuck her. So I guess they said  “you know why this is happening to you, right?"" because shes ""that kind of girl"""
JU-ON: Origins,So very confusing
JU-ON: Origins,"Did you get all the radio and tv references? They were all linked to the timeline and that's why they're on. You will probably recognise more cases.

Heres a few I remember they had:

March 1995: Tokyo subway sarin gas attack

Jan. 1989. Murder of Junko Furuta(the barrels they found)

I feel like they talked about Tsutomu Miyazaki too but i dont remember.

I recognised all cases but i just dont remember, watched them all an hour ago.

If you haven't already try get your hands on the original movies and watch them all, more clues are given and will fill some of the story you might have missed"
JU-ON: Origins,This ! Thats my theory is. She was the woman in white. The ending episode def has something to do with time travel because the 3rd father (one who had a affair ) met the 4th father and the pregnant wife of the 4th father fed the 3rd father. But what was the boiling puddles that they turned into ?
JU-ON: Origins,I wouldn't pass that theory my friend.. 👍 sounds plausible.
JU-ON: Origins,I like this theory very much!
JU-ON: Origins,"I think it was portraying a cultural mythology we don't necessarily have in the west: a kings of phenomenon where they basically melted due to the pure angry force of the spirit imposing their will and hate on them. Both were seen trying to leave the premises, but don't make it out of the area  affected by the grudge's influence."
JU-ON: Origins,Adding to 2. Haruka was burying the tape hoping it would bring peace to the spirits and stop them haunting her.
JU-ON: Origins,Agree that it is perhaps an  acquired taste also agree that Netflix is too mainstream for this show.. completely disagree with Forbes take on the show.
JU-ON: Origins,"I'm going to rewatch it soon. I just finished it and came to reddit to give my thoughts after reading everyone else's observations. There was some lines that stood out and confused me while watching but I have a theory that might make sense.

1. The scene that shows Toshiki (the little boy, I'm sorry I'm terrible with names so apologies if the name is wrong) before he is supposedly bashed in the head by his father. It shows the two hiding in a room, with men yelling. 
The boy says to run and we can assume that's what he did. However the mother says at the hospital after the boy is in a coma that she is ""finally free"" in fact she is laughing hysterically. She genuinely seems happy. We see her no where in the scene with the two, we don't see the father hit the child or become mad. 

I believe since these characters are trapped in a time loop with episodes having time skips (for instance the couple that moves in episode 5 or 6, they encounter the man that killed his pregnant wife and take him in from the rain) that the mother actually bashed in the head of the child, because she was trying to break the time loop. I think she had already experienced the events several times. She says something along the lines of she will just ""start her life over"" which sounds a lot like when those two spirit high schoolers say she can return to high school times then wisp her away.

2. The very first rape scene at the house, the behavior of the high schoolers at first just seemed demented but they did say something's that were weird. ""You know why this is happening to you right?"" It could be because they are just sick, or it could be because the events had already happened many times over. The whole ""you can't change fate"" message. The behavior of the students also had to have been influenced by the house, I was reading that even the child killer M had, prior to becoming a killer, been obsessed with old newspapers. He then found out about all the violent crimes that happened in that house and the curse moved to him, influencing him towards becoming a serial killer. The same thing happened to these students as they had said they were interested in the house (in fact it's the first thing they talk to her about)

3. I like the theory that Kazuka is the original woman abducted in 1952. It would make a lot of sense. Her fiance first sees the woman in white approaching him when Kazuka is approaching him trying to calm him down/ask what's wrong. We see other characters unaffected by time/existing outside their timeline so its plausible she is too. Kazuka is also around both times that the original landlords son is seen, first when he tries to stab the pregnant wife and second when Kazuka herself is abducted. It would explain also why the mother of her fiance is laughing at the end aside from creepy factors. She could see what her son had and realized that Kazuko is actually a ghost. 

4. The paranormal investigator said he was 5 and his sister was 3 years older, so 8. They moved in 1960 to the house, the crime happened 1952. So exactly 8 years later they moved in? He also stated he had no idea where his mom was (he just blanks out and never says where his mom was, just says his whole family is dead.) My theory is that the baby never disappeared it was just killed and buried away from the mother. The paranormal detective along with his sister and father was the original family from 1952, existing as spirits in the home. This is why his sister said Mom when she saw the white lady ghost. It also explains why the paranormal detective essentially time shifted and saw events that happened in the future such as the window being broken in.

5. Lastly, one thing that bugged me and I'll have to rewatch for this one. But in the episode where the husband murders his pregnant wife, I think I saw the paranormal investigator tailing behind him at the subway station. Maybe I'm misremembering but I thought it was alluded to that the investigator already knew of the inhabitants of the house prior to being told the location of the house which would mean he already knew about it. Its plausible that he tailed the husband back to the home, saw the affair situation, witnessed the murder and used telephone talisman trick to try and prevent the spirit from coming out. (Apparently a japanese belief that the womb is an opening or gateway to another realm or spirits)

6. Episode 6 entirely, it makes me think the paranormal investigator knows much more than he let's on. The wife seems tense and her behavior is off. The detective seems suspicious about how he knew of the telephone since you can't just fiction that sort of thing up. It alludes that possibly the paranormal detective is also time traveling/has definitely been impacted by the curse instead of unaffected like he thinks. In fact everyone is still dying around him as he spreads the curse."
JU-ON: Origins,I don't get why the one father from the 60's just disappears when the little boy is watching through the window in the flashback. And then the husband just disappears in front of the other two characters at the end. I didn't understand that part.
JU-ON: Origins,"There has to be.. 
Reason 1. 6 episodes seemed too short considering multiple plot lines and back stories.
Reason 2. A lot of it felt unanswered didn't seem like a proper end to this particular series."
JU-ON: Origins,Completely agree. I thought the story was going to focus on the first haunting. What caused the house to be cursed to begin with? The events leading to Ju on the movie or even the Grudge. It wasn’t scary and they just pieced a bunch of shit together and was like figure it out lol. It was boring.
JU-ON: Origins,In every way actually.
JU-ON: Origins,"It is overlapping all the movies, recommend watching them first to spot the references and be more immersed in the story and understand what's happening and why.

They use an identical house to the original. I cant really give to to many clues and spoilers.


Begin with the original Katasumi and 4444444444"
JU-ON: Origins,"Yes. According to the show, the movies are based on a true story, something that actually happened in real life. The events of this series are THAT story"
JU-ON: Origins,The black ghost was much more terrifying than the Woman in White for me. Idk it fking haunts me still
JU-ON: Origins,"Honestly, I gave up trying to make sense of it after episode 3 or 4, and accepted it as a parade of cool scary ideas.  

Honestly, what I remember most is the girl with her toxic manipulative mother, and the relationship itself seemed like a terrifying curse than the ghost itself.  

But that is about it.  Oh yes, one male actor, who died right after proposition, was cute."
JU-ON: Origins,Did you reply to your post?
JU-ON: Origins,"Yeah she's dead. Her laughing that turns into hoarse sobbing  in the plus with the darkness shrouding her features (thereby making her eyes look like empty holes), really really DISTURBED me more than I'd like to admit . *shudder* 
they effectively showed just how a ghost would 'realistically' appear to someone. She just appeared so silently and appeared at Haruka's peripheral vision and started laughing. dunno why haruka didn't just run away screaming after burying the casette tape"
JU-ON: Origins,(My theory) I think the reason why tetsuya's mom is laughing at haruka is because she knew that the curse is haruka herself. Regarding to Yasuo being left alive I think because because he rejected the baby gven to her by the woman in white
JU-ON: Origins,"I have no reason to think otherwise.. since its on Netflix and there have been long time admirers of the Ju-On franchise.

But Im not sure how much of it would be related to the 2020 one."
JU-ON: Origins,"I knew it couldn't have only been me that was so EXTRA bothered by her ghost in the end! She just appeared at haruka's peripheral vision like a ghost most likely would. Her eyes looked like empty black holes and suddenly she stretches her smile wide enough to show her teeth and laugh which turns into this hoarse sobbing. Then next thing you know, she's gone. it kept replaying in my head arghh"
Southern Survival,"Vikings and Ozark are not on the list because you did not enjoyed or because you never watched?

I love Game of Thrones,The Last Kingdom,The Handmaid's Tale and Westworld from your list.
Unpopular but i also enjoyed Cursed,It was fun to watch.
Season 4 of The Walking Dead was one of the best seasons in my opinion,If you disliked that season you would have hated some seasons in the future."
Southern Survival,Big Mouth is 10? That's seriously the worst show I've ever seen.  I always wondered who exactly watched that.
Southern Survival,Bob is awesome! Love that show!
Southern Survival,How is Ted lasso not a 10
Southern Survival,Breaking Bad but no Better Call Saul?
Southern Survival,Ewww Chrishell and Christine are both bad. Mary all the way.
Southern Survival,"Half of Game of Thrones (seasons 1-4) is a 10/10 show and the other half of it (seasons 5-8) is a 2/10 show.

So averaging them together, the show gets a 6/10."
Southern Survival,"If you subtracted 5 from each rating and went an ""* out of 5"" rating system instead, it still would be about the same."
Southern Survival,"Vikings and Ozark are on my list to watch! As for TWD I think I may have stopped after 3rd season? I don't remember as it was a while back but will definitely have to resume. I forgot to add to this list but the new show Invincible is really, really good and is made from the same people as TWD, highly recommend."
Southern Survival,exceptional in its 1st season and hits different but 10/10 is hard to hit for me and should be reserved for the absolute best that couldn't have been better
Southern Survival,😑
Southern Survival,Simply haven't seen but I hear it's as good as if not better than BB
Southern Survival,Mary is indeed the most mature and apparently carries the load in terms of earnings for the O group. the favoritism seems to only be for drama as she has actually earned her place at the top.
Southern Survival,"It definitely got worse in the later seasons but for the most part it was still pretty epic, quality, or maybe I was just so invested at that point (sunk cost). Either way still an amazing show but I get where you're coming from"
Southern Survival,"if he multiplied each rating by 13.8 and did a “* out of 138” rating sys, it would also be about the same"
Southern Survival,"If you like Ozark, check out Justified."
Southern Survival,"Interesting, but I think you are missing a proper hook and reason to tune in for characters -- the world being the hook only lasts a couple episodes

One of the issues with alternate history media is that you really need a specific central character(s) that the audience can relate to as a newcomer so you can unfurl the world to new eyes, then you have to make them care about the characters who are playing this world out -- its incredibly difficult -- you need to set the rules and then tell me how they work and who I care about

Its ""easy"" to play world builder in alternate history, because you can simply make anything true, without necessarily needing real-world logic, but in the end, it has to be a  grounded story about people who happen to live in those times, and not about ""those times""

Background and overarching ""world"" plot arcs are fine-- but tell me the character(s) that I come back for each week.

(lastly, this would need to be non-ad supported, I can't see a lot of companies wanting to buy ads against this)"

Southern Survival,"Ideas are a dime a dozen. Until you write it, you have nothing."
Southern Survival,This isn’t a fuckin fan fic sub.
Southern Survival,"So the United States is still a global superpower without all of the CSA states? Makes Abe Lincoln look like a dumbass for trying to preserve the Union when apparently he’d been better off just letting them go according to you. You don’t seem to understand how inflammatory of a statement that is and then you fail to detail what type of theme you are trying to explore or outright statement you are trying to make. Your idea is almost all about war plots and nothing about the cultural or thematic issues you would inevitably commenting upon with a story like this. What are you trying to say? The country is divided, sure, but what statement are you trying to make? You don’t really mention politics or culture and so this seems more like a war games fantasy. Which, to be fair, is less controversial than actually dealing with all the political and social themes involved in A Story like this, but also, why use these themes if you don’t want to address these issues?"
Southern Survival,">hypothetical

We're only 2 years past a moment when white supremacists carrying the emblems of the CSA overran the US capital in favor of overturning the defeat of a white supremacist president. 

None of the ring leaders have been censured, charged, or convicted. Most of them are back in office.


Not a hypothetical."
Southern Survival,It’d be interesting to explore present day stated as disputed territories.
Southern Survival,Tbh I think the whole succession thing was just an issue because Benioff and Weiss were unpopular after the GOT finale. I agree it sounded like a concept that could be interesting
Southern Survival,"Interesting. I like it.

I don't think the CSA would be as impoverished as you suggest. Agriculture would their #1 export/a profitable industry."
Southern Survival,Harry Turtledove would be a great read for you.
Southern Survival,"Agreed, I'm hearing a lot about events and plot but not a lot about people.

One of the best books in this genre is called ""underground airlines"" by Ben Winters, which has a really compelling main character - a former slave who hunts down other slaves in order to maintain his freedom. The background is great but the characterization makes it really compelling."
Southern Survival,"HBO and D&D never addressed it again. The outrage was actually mostly manufactured, but regardless, the show was DOA from it... I actually don't think it was going to get greenlit anyways, but of course the reveal went poorly so it didn't matter"
Southern Survival,"No, all I know is that they dropped the idea"
Southern Survival,"What are you on about? 

The majority of the story is literally politics/geopolitics followed by spy intrigues and finally military actions (and even then it’s either a professional military fighting insurgents for most of the time up until the end where actual war between two industrialized nation comes to fruition). This is literally just an idea I thought up of after watching a short alternate history video on YouTube, obviously if I spent time on this I’d flesh out the cultural, societal, economic, etc. consequences of a Southern victory. 

>What are you trying to say? 

Again, literally thought up of the idea on the spot after watching a YouTube video yesterday. It’s not a multi-year project or whatever with solid, concrete ideas and themes fleshed out. But since you’re so inclined to ask, if I had to find a theme, it’d probably be analogous to the triumphant spirit of our country, doing what’s right (with “right” being defined in a morally grey zone), the internal logistics behind why major political decisions get made, how a war affects a country, etc."
Southern Survival,Good question.  Why wasn't Ray Epps arrested and charged?
Southern Survival,"I'm sure that was part of it, but there's also the optics of two white guys being the one to tell the story of an alternate universe where the South won."
Southern Survival,"Particularly ""The Guns of the South,"" which is really the literary starting point for these sorts of stories."
Southern Survival,Because it was a terrible idea.

Southern Survival,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt’s destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Southern Survival,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Southern Survival,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn’t get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Southern Survival,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"

Southern Survival,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Southern Survival,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

Still, thank you for this."
Southern Survival,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Southern Survival,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Southern Survival,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."

Southern Survival,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Southern Survival,"They should have played the opening animated intro (not the CG) to Witcher 3. Briefly explains magic, the conjunction, witchers, people's attitude toward both, and touched on the wild hunt.

Southern Survival,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Southern Survival,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Southern Survival,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Southern Survival,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Southern Survival,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Southern Survival,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it’s be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Southern Survival,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don’t care. Evidently there’s something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what’s going on. 

It’s one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn’t going to understand the world—isn’t given enough information to—and likely isn’t going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn’t get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn’t be the norm."
Southern Survival,"It’s a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren’t up to snuff in 2020.

I’m worried it’s not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Southern Survival,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Southern Survival,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they’re not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Southern Survival,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Southern Survival,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Southern Survival,This is a great primer but you shouldn’t have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I’ll watch season 2.
Southern Survival,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Southern Survival,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Southern Survival,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Southern Survival,My wife and I are watching the series now and were quite confused. Your timeline doesn't seem to match what we are watching.
Southern Survival,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Southern Survival,"I know that I will get downvoted for this but if the first season of a fantasy show needs a post like this to explain it... then it is not a good show.     

I am currently watching the Dark crystal age of resistance and it has a lot of fantasy elements which are very original yet nothing that needs a lot of outside explanation if you have not seen the movie since it explains most of them as the story goes on"
Southern Survival,"I watched it and was also mildly confused until the last two episodes. If a show needs a ""guild"" then it wasn't explained good enough in the series. Did anyone notice when a time or scene changed there was never a caption explaining the time or location? Pretty frustrating and not insightful"
Southern Survival,"Guide or no guide, it's still an average show"
Southern Survival,Appreciate the help!
Southern Survival,"The thing is, this being necessary means the show failed in its job."
Southern Survival,You're an amazing writer u/grizwald87. Better than any of the recap videos I could find on Youtube. Thank you!!! 💖
Southern Survival,"Very nice explaination. Although the plotis not hard to understand by just watching, your write-up makes it better.

> Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher’s keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn’t know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

You didn't mention the part where Geralt saw his mother. Was that a ""dream"" or was his mother actually there?"
Southern Survival,This is an absurdly long post for a show that isn’t at all hard to follow
Southern Survival,"Holy heck thank you for this write up. I watched the show and loved it though was very confused initially. I own Witcher 3 but haven’t played and have never read the books. It helped so much, especially the backstory."
Southern Survival,It’s a really big indictment on the writing in the show that you’d feel like this type of thing was necessary.
Southern Survival,Extremely helpful and well-written. Thanks!
Southern Survival,"Thanks so much for this. I went in totally blind and this helped world-build a ton for me. I think the show is entertaining and pretty well done, but I wish this backstory would have been explained more (or better)."
Southern Survival,Very helpful. I think if you pay attention most of this is clear in the show but this definitely helped me connect some dots. The law of surprise connection being such a strong father - daughter bond for them was not 100% clear to me before this so things make a lot more sense now.
Southern Survival,"The wish to tie their fates together, didn't that stop the djinn because if the djinn killed Yennifer then it would have killed Geralt and a djinn cannot kill it's master?"
Southern Survival,Fantastic writeup
Southern Survival,"Good writeup overall, missing most of the details of Yennefer's plotline, but I can see why you left them out for clarity's sake."
Southern Survival,[deleted]
Southern Survival,"Super helpful. Once I realized there were more than once timeline, even for just a relatively short period of the show, I got co fused and somehow thought Renfri and Yen would end up being the same person. Like Yen would transform to Renfri which is why Renfri was a monster or something."
Southern Survival,"Any explanation as to why Geralt's eyes turn black and face turns extra veiny looking during a fight, but he looks like a normal, painfully handsome man the rest of the time."
Southern Survival,Saved for when in finished
Southern Survival,Very good post
Southern Survival,"The only thing that bothered me was the characterization of the Wizards/Sorcererers in the series. In the books and games, they are said to be the most beautiful/handsome a person can get due to magic manipulation. So they should be all Kens and Barbies, but i can udnerstand the issues of adapting that."
Southern Survival,Thanks man this helped so much! Hopefully they have a less confusing timeline in season 2
Southern Survival,"Thanks very much for the write up! It's nice to have some of those gaps filled in. I didn't see this asked anywhere, so apologies if this was clarified, but why was the law of surprise in one case (Duny) a marriage, but in another (Geralt/Ciri) it's protection? 

Will Geralt eventually marry Ciri when she gets older or something? The rules just seem so ambiguous for such a powerful request."
Southern Survival,"RemindMe! One week ""Read this when you have finished the series"""
Southern Survival,"Thanks, that is helpful. Never read books or played games but post TV series, inspired to buy and started playing Witcher 3. Already learnt lots prior to this post thanks to the game."
Southern Survival,Save for later
Southern Survival,Commenting to find later!
Southern Survival,Awesome write up! Succinct and to the point. I like how you skipped over the entire forest of Brokilon arc with a single sentence :p
Southern Survival,Bravo and thank you.  *Tosses a silver to his Witcher bard*
Southern Survival,Question for anyone who caught this: what was vilgefortz doing at the end? He survives his battle with Cahir and then wakes up and....bashes a friendly mage's head in with a club? I was so confused.
The Baby-Sitters Club,I don’t understand this. They did a full children’s Emmy and Bluey was not nominated for anything? Is it because it’s Australian?
The Baby-Sitters Club,Love it when a show gets awards after it's been cancelled.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"time to revive baby-sitters club, netflix. it's ok to admit your mistake of canceling it."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Yes.

  
Kids are not an inferior public !

  
They deserve better than those who’d financially profit out of selling them shameless low quality products."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Total agreement with you. One of my only parenting regrets was not discovering Bluey sooner. Absolute gem of a show. 10/10
The Baby-Sitters Club,"You say this as if there has never been high quality children’s programming.

Like all media, there is crap and there is art; and there is everything in between."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Yeah I don't really understand this comment? I'm glad that children's entertainment is getting its own separate awards recognition but it's not as if children's television has solely been profit from low quality products. Are you familiar at all with PBS?? Except for Caillou it's pretty high quality programming for basically no profit since they don't have regular ads on there.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Awww bummer! I’m still in the middle of S2 and really enjoyed it. I am nowhere in the audience for the series but I thought it was good tv and the kids actually acted like kids.

I’m not surprised to hear it got canceled though since it never really got popular"

The Baby-Sitters Club,"I watch this with my daughters, and we really enjoy it. That sucks."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Awwww, this show was so cute, that’s a bummer"
The Baby-Sitters Club,"I'm sad but also part of the problem as I still haven't seen Season 2 even though I *adored* 1. As a huge, HUGE BSC fan as a kid, this show really captured the spirit of the series and it had a wonderful cast. I'm sorry it never found more of a following."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Such a bummer! My daughter and I enjoyed watching this show together. I loved the books and media when I was a kid and this reboot was pretty good. She will also be bummed to know Julie and the Phantoms and Ashley Garcia are canceled. :(
The Baby-Sitters Club,Daughters going to be crushed. It literally got her into reading the books.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Aww I liked it! As a millennial it brought back memories of reading the series as a kid. The girls in the show were so wholesome.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"I really loved the first season (30 something year old dude here) mostly because it was fantastically shot and the cast was actually preteen/teenage girls. It was also really close to the books and also had the author involved in the series. It's long shot, but I really hope that the shop it around and it ends up elsewhere."
The Baby-Sitters Club,I’m still salty after Santa Clarita diet
The Baby-Sitters Club,Oh bummer. My daughter really liked it.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Oh fuck off Netflix! 

I’m in my early 40s and I love the show. BSC books were a huge part of my childhood. I thought the series was really good. Well, damnit."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Fuck all the way off, Netflix.  A surprisingly good, fun show."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"damn, that's 3 shows I liked canceled within a week (only one on netflix and the other two were no surprises, or even less surprising, I should say)."
The Baby-Sitters Club,I'm still sad about Grand Army not being renewed.
The Baby-Sitters Club,What crap. I read these when I was younger and got my daughter into them. We watched this together and she LOVED it. Season 2 was even better than 1 and several of the episodes had me openly crying.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Never seen this series & have no desire to but it seems like Netflix keeps hurting themselves buy prematurely cancelling series. 

If I know a series doesn't have a proper ending I'm not investing any time watching any of it. So in that regard all the money they invested in it up until that point is wasted. If they decide to end a series they should invest a bit more to do an extended episode to at least give the series a proper conclusion. Otherwise their entire previous investment is worthless imo."
The Baby-Sitters Club,How is Emily in Paris still going and this gets canceled? I thought Fuller House ended too soon at five seasons but BSC only getting canceled after two is a huge bummer. So many more possible books left to adapt and solid writing.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"This is a real bummer. As someone who grew up with BSC, I thought this was just incredibly well-adapted. Hope these actresses go onto big things. At least the first two seasons will remain available."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Disappointed, that was a cute show. BSC will always be special to me."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"They should have put it on Disney + probably would have fared better over there than on Netflix,I was looking forward to season 3 I was hoping that Mallory would have her own episode in season 3 since she never got one in season 2 and the other girls did. Hopefully another streaming service will pick it up and it can continue"
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Expected. There just... wasn't any buzz around it, at all."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Booooooo!
The Baby-Sitters Club,This is a nightmare:(
The Baby-Sitters Club,Aw I liked I AM Not Okay With This.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Wow Baby-Sitters Club was hyped up hard by Netflix. It’s actually not a bad re-do, but I am a bigger fan of the 90s series."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"It’s easy to rip on Netflix for being like this, but I wonder how this would compare to regular network television.  Seems like they run a lot of trash that doesn’t get renewed, too."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Should’ve kept it nested in the 80s.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Watched the first few episodes bored one night I liked it but not enough to give it a full view! Plus not that shocking considering some of the leads look like the could almost be 18
The Baby-Sitters Club,Had no clue this existed
The Baby-Sitters Club,2 seasons? Huh
The Baby-Sitters Club,"We know guys, it’s your favorite show, it shouldn’t have been cancelled, Netflix cancels all the popular shows way too soon."
The Baby-Sitters Club,And the actors are growing up.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Aw shit! Teenage Bounty Hunters was so fun!
The Baby-Sitters Club,Still sad about Julie and the Phantoms.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Aunty Donna's Big Ole House of Fun?
The Baby-Sitters Club,"That's so weird, I have Netflix, watch it often and I've never heard of almost any of those."
The Baby-Sitters Club,That list looks awful. Netflix is definitely falling behind.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"> Bridgerton (renewed for 4th season)

Wtf? Haven’t even had the 2nd season premiere yet."
The Baby-Sitters Club,[removed]
The Baby-Sitters Club,Spinning Out was great!
The Baby-Sitters Club,Damn they cancelled Gentefied? They kinda ended on a cliffhanger…
The Baby-Sitters Club,I enjoyed Away a lot. I was disappointed it was canceled. I think Netflix needs to up their quality because it’s really ridiculous how many of the shows get cancelled. I’m afraid to start a new show
The Baby-Sitters Club,Damn it. I loved AJ and the Queen.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Is *Ratched* coming back? Kinda pleasantly surprised. First season was ridiculous but I loved it.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Where is my season 2 of Warrior Nun
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Other than Baby Sitters Club (which I only knew about because the girl I crushed on hard on the sixth grade was obsessed with that series) I haven’t heard of a single one of those cancelled shows. Suppose it’s not just me, and why they were cancelled."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Edit: My bad thought it was since 2020

I think Sweet tooth is missing, and I feel like there might be a few other missing renewals.

That said I think it would be interesting to compare to other networks and while Netflix doesn't look great it isn't exactly like others are much better with how much COVID wrecked productions for other shows that are now in limbo."
The Baby-Sitters Club,I like Space Force. It’s not the best show but it’s a fun little comedy.
The Baby-Sitters Club,What are these shows?
The Baby-Sitters Club,"I will say as a huge drag race fan, they did us a favour by cancelling AJ and the queen"
The Baby-Sitters Club,These shows can’t have people find them if Netflix keeps cancelling after 10 episodes
The Baby-Sitters Club,Has she seen the older movie and series? I loved those when I was a kid.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"The OA too, still upset about that one even after 3 years :/"
The Baby-Sitters Club,Me too
The Baby-Sitters Club,Its an emotional trauma i will never recover from. I still rewatch it monthly
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Yup, my girl loved it too. It was awesome to watch together as I grew up on the BSC books."
The Baby-Sitters Club,What else is new for Netflix? They always cancel the good shit
The Baby-Sitters Club,"same, that show could have found new fans from euphoria watchers (although the main appeal of euphoria is the amazing cinematography which grand army doesn’t have). there was some controversy on the set for grand army though which might have made netflix decide to cancel it"
The Baby-Sitters Club,"*Emily in Paris* gets a lot of views and this didn't. Even though lots of people claim to hate watch Emily (like most people I know who have seen it), they still watched the whole thing and that's what Netflix cares about."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"As others have put, Emily in Paris gets A LOT of views and typically dominates the charts the week it comes out and goes on for quite awhile. These two shows are in completely different levels in how much they get watched.

On top of that Emily in Paris helps Netflix complete their legal requirements for how much content they need filmed in/about/with France to operate there so it is even more so a win/win for them."
The Baby-Sitters Club,well the original Dawn from season 1 wasn't available for season 2 because she got cast in the new Dr. Strange movie as >!America Chavez!<  so she's already off to a great start.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Both seasons have a perfect 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes. That's pretty impressive.

It surprises me that Netflix didn't market this show as well as it should have."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Yea heaven forbid they put any target marketing behind shows and let them be for the audience that does like them
The Baby-Sitters Club,"There was some, but I suspect it being more that the actors are getting older."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Neither did I. I read a lot of the books as a kid, I would have watched this if I knew it existed."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Couldn't have been that popular to get cancelled at only 2 seasons.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Yeah I didn’t quite make it to the end (time poor) but I thought it was surprisingly fun. Definitely would have been keen on a second season!
The Baby-Sitters Club,The Method Man was so good.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"This, I hate Netflix"
The Baby-Sitters Club,The canceled shows get buried deep in the algorithm.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"I mean they can reverse the decision, they've done it before. lol. 

But I think Bridgerton is very much here to stay tbh. Popularity might dwindle a bit, but given the buzz season 2 trailer garnered on socials, I think a lot of viewers will stay on the Bridgerton train (myself included)."
The Baby-Sitters Club,So they have faith in it. Super popular and it hits the same demographics as other shows - I imagine Emily in Paris plays to the same audience.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Means it made enough revenue for them to justify future expenditure.

People need to get over the idea of them “cancelling the good shit”. They cancel the stuff that isn’t driving enough viewers(and subscriptions/maintanence) to justify finding another season.

They are looking to spend minimum dollar for maximum return. Cancellations will follow that, not the quality of the programming.

The worst aspect is that shows could get cancelled because they already have those subscribers on lock with 4 other shows they have going that link with other viewer groups. So they can axe that show and deploy the funds to target a weakening subscriber area."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"In all fairness, Space Force season 2 is bombing because season 1 was complete dog doo doo. From what I’ve heard though it’s actually a really good show now, so that sucks."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"> Blood & Water because it's their first South African original series.

Shadow was their first South African original series. Queen Sono was the second. Both were cancelled after only one season."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Ratched came with a two-season initial order. The series has been officially renewed for a second season since 2017 when the project was announced.
The Baby-Sitters Club,I'm Not Okay With This was greatness.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Teenage Bounty Hunters was dope as hell
The Baby-Sitters Club,"I actually heard a lot of people talking about AJ and the Queen, Messiah and Teenage Bounty Hunters when the shows were released. I also know a few people who liked Away, blackAF and Julie and the Phantoms.

But the other shows I only knew they existed after I made this list."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Brews Brothers, judging by the first episode I watched, was absolutely terrible."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Netflix does a shit job promoting their new shows and then cancels them if they don't get amazing ratings within the first week of the season going up, so the shows Netflix themselves never mentioned don't have time to get word of mouth going before they get canceled. 

Which then leads us to the vicious cycle of people thinking ""Well they'll probably just cancel this show after one season anyway, I don't want to watch it until it's been renewed or has a concrete series finale"", so the companies are like ""oh nobody's watching this show, better cancel it."""
The Baby-Sitters Club,"> I think Sweet tooth is missing

""List of English-language Netflix shows released in **2020**"", Sweet Tooth was released in June 2021.

> I think it would be interesting to compare to other networks

Netflix produces MUCH more shows than Amazon, HBO and Hulu, but Netflix also has a worse cancellation rate than them in the last 5 years.

Edit:

Just an example because I'm not going to put all my lists here:

Amazon series that premiered in 2019: Too Old to Die Young (canceled), Hanna (concluded), Carnival Row (renewed), The Boys (renewed). Amazon series that premiered in 2020: Truth Seekers (canceled), Utopia (canceled), Alex Rider (renewed), Hunters (renewed), The Wilds (renewed), Upload (renewed). Netflix cancellation rate has been waaaay above 50% since 2017, they focus on quantity, so they cancel the vast majority of their shows."
The Baby-Sitters Club,American Vandal 😭
The Baby-Sitters Club,I will never not be upset at the OA’s cancellation. Fucking masterpiece.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"they cancel the good shit that isn't getting watched by enough people, just like any other network would"
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Welcome to capitalism, where if it isn’t generating you profit then it doesn’t matter how good the product is.

If they are cancelling the good shit, it’s because no one is watching the good shit, or because the viewers the good shit attracts either

A) only sub for that one show and hence don’t generate long term revenue 

B) are already viewing 4 other shows and the fifth show isn’t able to extract any extra cash out of therm.

So you cancel the show allocate the funds to another subscriber group that needs content to secure them from 8 months a year to 12 months a year."
The Baby-Sitters Club,Oh I didn't know about any set controversy. And excellent point about the audience base from Euphoria.
The Baby-Sitters Club,Yeah very true
The Baby-Sitters Club,That’s pretty much the problem. I still don’t get how OBX keeps getting renewed.
The Baby-Sitters Club,"They do, but they have a budget depending on that market and a lot of times the staff and crew don't/can't want to work for that budget.

Have posted this before but Netflix's ""issue"" is they often allow near blank checks for creatives off the bat which is often a trap as they will write in massive budgets for projects that all the funding in the world won't get those kind of ratings. And quickly falls apart as people don't want salary reductions and have to drastically scale things BACK later on.

Some of the ""darling"" shows that have been cancelled were prime suspects in this with MASSIVE budgets and viewer expectations that they simply were not going to be able to hit and keep people on board (*cough* Sense 8 *cough*).

I have been saying for awhile that Netflix needs to rein this in a bit and find a balance closer towards shows needing to build towards that increase, but not so far like some major studios with fresh projects often get shoestring budgets to work with and have a hard time getting people hooked off the bat."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"I did wonder about that, logistically. And it’s tough to let them age beyond 13 because then you get into California Diaries territory… Different energy."
The Baby-Sitters Club,"Technically in the books they should have aged ,I never understood why Ann M Martin never aged the girls up a few years so they could grow with their audiences, how many Christmases did they celebrate or new school years just to be stuck in sixth and eight grade at 11 and 13 . Sweet Valley High did the same thing ,but at least they got spin off .Sweet Valley Twins(12) Sweet Valley Kids(7) and Sweet Valley University (18) 131 books plus Mysteries and Specials and they never aged past thirteen. Even in California Diaries they were still thirteen. The book Boxcar Children did the same thing at first then they actually started ageing the kids up"
The World of the Married,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
The World of the Married,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
The World of the Married,Undone was the shit
The World of the Married,Anime Watchers: What gap??
The World of the Married,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
The World of the Married,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
The World of the Married,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
The World of the Married,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
The World of the Married,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
The World of the Married,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
The World of the Married,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
The World of the Married,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
The World of the Married,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
The World of the Married,Huge gap??
The World of the Married,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
The World of the Married,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
The World of the Married,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
The World of the Married,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
The World of the Married,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
The World of the Married,This show is so amazing
The World of the Married,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
The World of the Married,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
The World of the Married,So many better shows than vox.
The World of the Married,What gap ?
The World of the Married,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
The World of the Married,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
The World of the Married,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
The World of the Married,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
The World of the Married,Best show of the year so far
The World of the Married,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
The World of the Married,Second season is even better than the first one.
The World of the Married,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

The World of the Married,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
The World of the Married,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
The World of the Married,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
The World of the Married,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
The World of the Married,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."

The World of the Married,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
The World of the Married,What’s the show about?
The World of the Married,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
The World of the Married,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
The World of the Married,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
The World of the Married,Arcane is amazing.
The World of the Married,Primal was fucking great too
The World of the Married,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
The World of the Married,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
The World of the Married,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
The World of the Married,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
The World of the Married,[deleted]
The World of the Married,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
The World of the Married,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
The World of the Married,RIP Pantheon.
The World of the Married,Arcane?
The World of the Married,Don’t forget King of the Hill
The World of the Married,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
The World of the Married,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
The World of the Married,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
The World of the Married,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
The World of the Married,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
The World of the Married,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
The World of the Married,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge…"
The World of the Married,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
The World of the Married,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
The World of the Married,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are “hundred year old demons” or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end “but it was a boy in a girls body.” Fucking pervs."
The World of the Married,Shows that don’t have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show’s total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
The World of the Married,Cartoons
The World of the Married,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
The World of the Married,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
The World of the Married,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
The World of the Married,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
The World of the Married,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren’t corpo shills telling them, “no, we can’t have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.” They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
The World of the Married,"See I’ve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn’t expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that’s exactly what it delivered."
The World of the Married,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero’s moving through still shots? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
The World of the Married,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
The World of the Married,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
The World of the Married,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
The World of the Married,This is true the animation isnt great
The World of the Married,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
The World of the Married,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
The World of the Married,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
The World of the Married,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
The World of the Married,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
The World of the Married,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
The World of the Married,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
The World of the Married,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
The World of the Married,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
The World of the Married,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
The World of the Married,"Let’s be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it’s the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn’t The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it’s a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they’ve made flop, so they aren’t even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
The World of the Married,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
The World of the Married,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
The World of the Married,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
The World of the Married,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
The World of the Married,I never watched role (but i do follow a different unrelated dnd group) and enjoyed it so its not  a prerequisite for enjoyment.
Warrior Nun,"I feel like Netflix experiments with shows tbh. 

They really must want every show to do Stranger Things numbers for them  to renew damn harsh lol..."
Warrior Nun,"Oh that's just sad - I liked the 2nd season. No promotional budget but still managed to be Global Top 3.

I thought it would have been given one more."
Warrior Nun,How about someone renews something?
Warrior Nun,"Im actually kinda surprised by this cancellation. this show has a perfect rating on rotten tomatoes and a huge fanbase on twitter that is going WILD for it, this cancellation makes NO sense"
Warrior Nun,a tradition unlike any other
Warrior Nun,What a waste. This show was so good. They had no budget but they still manage to have some of the most beautiful cinematography. Pure talent wasted.
Warrior Nun,"It felt a little like a foregone conclusion given Netflix's indifferent marketing to it, but still a shame.

One more show for the pile of forever unfinished menu fillers nobody ever watches again because the story has no ending."
Warrior Nun,"Crap, only just discovered this show, and loving it :("
Warrior Nun,The star is great.
Warrior Nun,Dude...I just started this yesterday.Being a paraplegic I really understood her in the first episode.Damn you Netfflix.
Warrior Nun,"I can't say I am surprised given Netflix's complete lack of promotion for season two.  It seems likely would have made the decision regardless of how well the show did.

I wasn't the biggest fan of the first season but I quite enjoyed the second one so at least the show went out on a high creatively."
Warrior Nun,Man what the hell.
Warrior Nun,"It feels like Netflix is expecting every show of theirs to do big numbers, which is just not feasible. There's been so many great shows Netflix has cancelled after a season or two just because it wasn't watched enough by a larger audience/ wasn't talked about enough through media outlets. Not sure why Netflix bothers picking up shows if they'll just cancel it after a season or two."
Warrior Nun,American Vandal and Santa Clarita Diet were genuinely original and funny shows that were both canceled. So... I'm not super surprised.
Warrior Nun,"Every show I like gets cancelled prematurely so I would like to apologize to everyone for liking this show, I brought my curse upon you. Fuck can't I just have one or two fun TV shows that get a proper run with a proper ending?"
Warrior Nun,"Well, fuck. :("
Warrior Nun,"It seems like streaming services need to rethink the concept of ""seasons""

They should order X episodes with a definitive end for the number of episodes ordered. Otherwise don't green light the show. Because they are the cusp of turning off viewers who are just going to stop caring about TV series because they are most likely going to end incomplete."
Warrior Nun,"I haven't watched this show, but the impression I got online was that this was really popular and a ton of people seemed invested.

Netflix continues to be run by dumbasses."
Warrior Nun,Okay now we riot
Warrior Nun,I watched the first season. Netflix never told me there was a second season so I never watched it. That's on them.
Warrior Nun,Bummer
Warrior Nun,This show was surprisingly less shitty than I expected it to be!
Warrior Nun,Fucking great. Fuck you Netflix. Bring Blockbuster back
Warrior Nun,Still on my watch list.
Warrior Nun,*Wednesday* demands more budget I guess
Warrior Nun,God DAMN IT
Warrior Nun,Boo!
Warrior Nun,Too bad. I kinda liked this one.
Warrior Nun,Nooooooooooooo
Warrior Nun,Goddamn Netflix!
Warrior Nun,Season 2 was much better than season 1 in my humble opinion. Of course when I start liking a show it gets canned...
Warrior Nun,"You ended the first season on a cliffhanger literally in the middle of the battle with the big bad evil guy. Fun show finding its footing until then, almost sorry I didn’t come back for more but you burn me once I’m waiting to find out if you do it again.

Cliffhanger season endings kill shows."
Warrior Nun,It seems like a show is being cancelled every day now….
Warrior Nun,Reason 234 why I don't get invested in shows until years after they air now.
Warrior Nun,"At this point this isn’t news. 

We should all get excited when the headlines read “Show Renewed for Third Season in Unprecedented Move by Netflix”."
Warrior Nun,It's so funny to watch all the streaming services make the exact same mistakes that led to people to stop watching network TV.
Warrior Nun,"Ouch. This was literally the last interesting series Netflix had to offer (they cancel or mess up everything else - see The Witcher, etc)...  
  
Hopefully they can sell it to another platform.  
  
Netflix subscription cancelled - for the first time in 6 years."
Warrior Nun,"I just went and looked at Netflix's [List of Ended original programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ended_Netflix_original_programming).

In ten years, they've had 

- 5 out of 70 dramas have more than three seasons,
- 6 out of 64 comedies have more than three seasons,
- 5 out of 38 family and kids shows have more than three seasons,
- 3 out of 17 adult animated shows have more than three seasons, and
- 1 out of 17 anime shows has more than three seasons.

Netflix feels like the Google of streaming. The biggest and most famous for canceling things before they get started."
Warrior Nun,Jesus Christ
Warrior Nun,"Hbo does it right and has shows end after a few seasons at most. Netflix tries to find one to ride to dust, canceling everything else early. Its making their backlog worthless. They need full series"
Warrior Nun,I was today years old when I found out a show called Warrior Nun existed
Warrior Nun,"Netflix cycle strikes again 

Renews series
Releases after 2+ year 
Barely promote
Cancels 

Nothing new."
Warrior Nun,I just want a 'The OA' final season or movie to finish the story.
Warrior Nun,I kind of figured it would. I enjoyed it a bit but I wouldn’t necessarily call it very good. An interesting watch in between lulls of shows and content you might rather watch.
Warrior Nun,"Netflix is still stuck in the Network TV/Nielson Ratings treadmill, despite hyping itself as the antithesis to it."
Warrior Nun,"I never watch Netflix anymore - at this rate, what’s the point?"
Warrior Nun,"Something else I won't waste time with then... if something isn't hugely popular right off the bat, Netflix just doesn't care and cancels it. They have too many options so often that people get overwhelmed, they need to realize a show needs more than a month or so to find audience, or for people to actually have time to watch a returning show. Netflix and HBO Max/WB keep losing everybody's faith in them."
Warrior Nun,it seeems you need to wait like 2 weeks after a show is released to watch to see if they cancel it now.  save the time investment for something they will get behind
Warrior Nun,My dad used to have these Warrior Nun action figures. I might still have them in storage
Warrior Nun,"Second season has not been out for very long and it came out at the same time as several competing shows. I watched the first season and was looking forward to the second
 They should giving people a chance to watch it before killing it"
Warrior Nun,"Oh, Twitter is going to be more of a hellhole bc of this, this show has a lot of very uh, dedicated, fans..."
Warrior Nun,Nooooo! I liked this show!!!
Warrior Nun,"Is season 2 wrapped up nicely, or is there no closure? I’m on episode 3, but I’m wondering if it’s worth finishing at this point."
Warrior Nun,Come on I liked this show
Warrior Nun,FUUUUCK!!! I just ended my binge off the second season last night and was looking forward to the third season.
Warrior Nun,Dang I loved this series
Warrior Nun,Damn :/
Warrior Nun,"This is the first time I've heard of this show in my life. With all the other garbage that Netflix recommends to me bearing no resemblance to anything I recall liking, it's disappointing to keep hearing that they kept these gems hidden for me to somehow discover in spite of their algorithms."
Warrior Nun,"I may not watch Netflix series any longer. I’ll watch films and docs. I’m sick of loving a series, getting emotionally invested in story and characters and then have Netflix tell me it’s done. Fuck that."
Warrior Nun,It was a great show
Warrior Nun,"Ah, Sense8 all over again"
Warrior Nun,Oh Man… not again again again again…
Warrior Nun,I was excited for this. Sad.
Warrior Nun,"Not specifically for this show, but is there a site or something else that lists what shows have been cancelled by Netflix or other streamers and do not end on a cliffhanger. Essentially, series where while it would be great for more seasons, its somewhat self-contained."
Warrior Nun,"Tbh it was kinda meh, at least the begging. I think shows that don't hook you in early get cut off by netflix. Probably for logical reasons, i.e I can imagine it has been seen by 100k people (example numbers) but only 20k people continued watching it."
Warrior Nun,sucks. I really enjoyed this past season.
Warrior Nun,I’m still waiting for Priest Cop staring Danny DeVito and Kevin Sorbo
Warrior Nun,"This was a given considering the viewership numbers were poor for the second season. Netflix has a high threshold of about 30 million equivalent complete viewings over 4 weeks as the renewal point (there are a few exceptions) and Warrior Nun s2 only did between 11.3-13.2 million. That was never going to be enough. 

Pity as it was a fun action fantasy show and the RT audience scores were very good!"
Warrior Nun,"I think I have Netflix fatigue. Is there such a thing? This show was neither good nor bad, quite honestly, and I am finding a lot of content falling into that category: okay to watch but forgettable. Regardless, it's a bummer if they leave things on a cliffhanger. This is a practice that Netflix should assert contractually not be allowed for the most part. They should respect the viewers who took the time to watch a program through, who have the right to expect some sort of resolution."
Warrior Nun,The only surprise here is that it got a second season at all. And I say this as someone who enjoyed that goofy little show.
Warrior Nun,They should cancel the stinking turd witcher series and put the money on something like mindhunter and these small series
Warrior Nun,"I thought this show was well received? Oh, I just remembered they like to cancel those.. :("
Warrior Nun,Shocked Pikachu face 😑
Warrior Nun,"I saw that coming.  2 Seasons usually is when stuff gets the axe, but tbh, warrior nun wasn't all that good anyway.  I mean I watched it, but it was all, getting the shot and the accompanying metal music and fight scenes.  Not so much on writing most of the time."
Warrior Nun,That'll be because it wasnt very good.
Warrior Nun,"I liked the show, but I’m not surprised. I feel like it was made to be a replacement for Lucifer, but it was never close to doing Lucifer numbers."
Warrior Nun,If it don't get the numbers it's got to go. Netflix releases hundreds of shows and movies a year. I hate that they cancelled Sense8 but the numbers sucked.
Warrior Nun,I was surprised it got a second season in the first place. At least the second season didn’t end in a utter cliffhanger or anything.
Warrior Nun,Fuck you Netflix
Warrior Nun,Should’ve been cancelled after season 1 to be honest. So many good shows get cancelled so fast and this somehow got 2 seasons.
Warrior Nun,I had never even heard of this show until I logged in to Twitter today and saw it trending for being canceled.
Warrior Nun,There is a season 2?
Warrior Nun,People are loud online but don’t stream shows legally. Half the people complaining probably watched on unofficial streaming sites then get mad when Netflix cancels a show due to bad viewership
Warrior Nun,capitalism is shit.
Warrior Nun,Got 2/3 through season 1 it was so fucking boring and predictable. People said season 2 was ok but couldn’t be bothered.
Warrior Nun,Spoiler: shows with low ratings get cancelled.
Warrior Nun,"Good lol, season 2 was terrible compared to season 1"
Warrior Nun,The second season was tough to watch
Warrior Nun,"1st season great

2nd season bad tone shift for us."
Warrior Nun,Season 1 was somewhat interesting. Season 2 was just terrible lol. The stan accounts hyping the show up is hilarious
Warrior Nun,I was about to start it too. Oh well.
Warrior Nun,It would be hilarious if network shows end up enduring and outlasting other 8 episode stuff
Warrior Nun,Of course. I just started watching it today.
Warrior Nun," keep investing in cheap shows, you won't ever get my money again."
Warrior Nun,It's kind of a Self-fulfilling prophecy at this point.
Warrior Nun,"Good thing I saw this news, I was about to start watching it during christmas break but with a possibility of a cliffhanger i'll just find something else with a finished show on netflix."
Warrior Nun,"Im seeing a new trend in my larger online friends groups, they arent willing to watch a show from netflix or any other streaming service without waiting for them to cancel it after one season and having it end up in the air and they are walking away for that very reason"
Warrior Nun,How about we cancel Netflix? Is there even something worth watching there anymore?
Warrior Nun,I’m sorry everyone. This has been in my watch list since season 1. I haven’t started it yet. This is all my fault.
Warrior Nun,"I gotta admit I was intrigued by the premise,  but when they cut from action to her narrate about all the cute boys,  I was out.  

Good on them for 2 seasons in this market I guess."
Magical Land of Oz,"Hosts so far this season: Miles Teller, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Thee Stallion, Jack Harlow, and Amy Schumer. 

I love Brendan Gleeson but hes not exactly super popular in America. Looking at that list it's not surprising at all to see Chappelle pull the highest numbers."
Magical Land of Oz,"""he police, ain't he?"" Barber skit was great."
Magical Land of Oz,The way he says ‘god damn’ cracks me every time
Magical Land of Oz,It's almost like people like Chappelle
Magical Land of Oz,The black heaven skit was one of the last times I remember actually laughing out loud at SNL since the last time Chappelle hosted.
Magical Land of Oz,"Why is ""it's almost like"" such a common refrain in this thread? It's fucking weird. CTRL+F that shit, it's everywhere."
Magical Land of Oz,“Fuck yo dragon!”
Magical Land of Oz,He should bring back The Chappelle Show-just do it on SNL.
Magical Land of Oz,"Honestly, my favorite episode of the season so far. Most all of the sketches were on point"
Magical Land of Oz,[deleted]
Magical Land of Oz,"I have to admit, it was the best episode of the season so far."
Magical Land of Oz,"Interesting framing here by Tony Maglio at IndieWire (btw: really shitty clickfarm, IndieWire. You're not getting news from there. You're getting Geek Culture hackwork rewritten from actual news releases found somewhere else)

1. the rating provided (0.90) is strictly for the 18-49 demo. Granted, pretty solid representation of who SNL is trying to court, so it makes sense, but it's still a qualification.
2. the viewer number (which isn't explained at how it arrived there, it's just given) is about 500k higher than the previous leader for this year, Amy Schumer (weird how ""it's almost like people like Schumer"" wasn't a common refrain there, LOL) and as the IndieWire article points out (with no real backup or clarification) is behind both Jake Gyllenhaal AND Will Ferrell's outings, according to Maglio (who, again - sucks at this).

As it turns out, compared to other guests from the past calendar year, Dave Chappelle was a full point better than Kim Kardashian (3.8 rating), dead-even with Kieran Culkin (4.89), and behind guests including:

Jonathan Majors (4.97), Billie Eilish (5.16), Paul Rudd (5.15), Arianna DeBose (5.05), and Willem Dafoe (4.97).

That Chappelle's episode got to 4.8 isn't that remarkable. The large preponderance of guests for SNL's previous season also hovered around that same range, and his jump from Schumer's hosting job isn't particularly remarkable, either.

Again - in 2005, this would have been the hottest episode of SNL ever. But in 2022 it's just run of the mill. It's not remarkable, not in the way IndieWire is framing it."
Magical Land of Oz,It almost like the people screeching on Twitter and reddit aren’t representative of most people
Magical Land of Oz,His opening monologue was fantastic.
Magical Land of Oz,Can’t believe how canceled he is.
Magical Land of Oz,Nice going for a cancelled man.
Magical Land of Oz,lol hilarious this is 56% upvoted rn
Magical Land of Oz,"Yet another cancel culture victim, oh wait"
Magical Land of Oz,Someone please cancel me too
Magical Land of Oz,"Even my wife laughed at it, and she has trouble understanding a lot of humor. Dave’s delivery on most of his stuff is fantastic, even if he’s a bit of a polarizing figure. She liked the Megan episode too.

It hasn’t been bad this season, imo, some skits have bombed but it happens."
Magical Land of Oz,And he will still complain about being cancelled.
Magical Land of Oz,No shit. It’s almost like… the show has terrible writers and has had them for years now
Magical Land of Oz,Imagine that
Magical Land of Oz,"Should really say Dave Chapelle and Black Star. I know he's the main draw for a lot of people, but I'm sure the first appearance back for a legendary group like them also drew some people (like me)."
Magical Land of Oz,And it still blew. SNL is far past its prime.
Magical Land of Oz,"You’re allowed to laugh, you’re allowed to cringe, your allowed to have complicated emotions about numerous topics. Dave isn’t the devil, and neither are you if you like him, or dislike him."
Magical Land of Oz,The show felt like an unaired episode of the Chappelle Show.
Magical Land of Oz,"Wow, *so* cancelled."
Magical Land of Oz,"Every time someone gets through an attempted cancellation, the people who desperately wish it worked pretend it's evidence there's no cancel culture.

The NRA should start pretending people surviving gunshot wounds prove guns aren't lethal."
Magical Land of Oz,I think Chappelle should revisit why he left the Chappelle show.  Then apply that to his jokes on Jews as well as his attacks on Trans people.  Somehow he is disconnecting them.
Magical Land of Oz,Highest viewership in nearly 4 years and some of the best ratings in roughly 20 (that’s what some article titles say I have not read any of them beyond the titles)
Magical Land of Oz,BLACK STAR
Magical Land of Oz,The monologue timing with the chain is so good.
Magical Land of Oz,they got the most viewers when someone funny was on the show? I don't think i can explain that.
Magical Land of Oz,I'm just thinking about how this guy complained about getting cancelled.
Magical Land of Oz,My potato hole.
Magical Land of Oz,He’s a god damn legend for that monologue
Magical Land of Oz,"Chappelle will always be funny. If you can’t take a joke, don’t listen. No one is forcing you. Crazy idea, I know."
Magical Land of Oz,But reddit hates him and was saying he’s cancelled?🤔😱
Magical Land of Oz,Another cancelled comedian struggling to make a comeback. What a shame. /s
Magical Land of Oz,It was refreshing to see SNL be funny again for an episode.
Magical Land of Oz,Chapelle is a national treasure
Magical Land of Oz,Imo Chappelle and Gleason had the only good SNL episodes so far this season
Magical Land of Oz,Love to see it.
Magical Land of Oz,If there’s a favorite American past time it’s watching hasbeens slowly burn themselves.
Magical Land of Oz,Biggest ratings of a bad season.
Magical Land of Oz,Because he's actually funny.
Magical Land of Oz,The world needs more comedy.
Magical Land of Oz,Ricky Gervais next
Magical Land of Oz,Bring back the chappelle show
Magical Land of Oz,Wow those writers sure did cancel him
Magical Land of Oz,"Dude did a 15 minute opening monologue and killed the audience the way Netflix stand up specials do in 1 hour

Every post about Dave Chappelle gets brigaded hard af by people who are still butthurt about the Netflix shit."
Magical Land of Oz,"Oh gee, it’s almost like outrage is manufactured to increase viewership and thereby increase ad revenue."
Magical Land of Oz,Again proving that Reddit’s opinion is the minority
Magical Land of Oz,They not gonna like this
Magical Land of Oz,"It was a great episode. But just like clockwork there were a million articles talking about him being antisemitic or whatever which is absurd...but even more absurd than that was an article I saw bashing him for not addressing his Trans stuff...I'm sorry WHAT?!?! How can the man win? He mentions it, you're mad cuz he won't shut up about it, now it seems he's moved on and you're mad that he's not still talking about it. Get real."
Magical Land of Oz,"The number of articles that pop up every time Dave Chappeles name is even whispered is incredible. 1% are positive. The rest are clickbaity let’s cancel the mofo because They once heard him say something they didn’t agree with or heard someone say they heard him say something they thought someone might disagree with. Solution is simple. If you don’t like him, don’t watch him. Don’t buy the sold out tickets for his shows."
Magical Land of Oz,Didn’t the season just start lol
Magical Land of Oz,No one watches snl unless someone like chappelle is on.
Magical Land of Oz,That 13 min monologue was really funny.
Magical Land of Oz,Funniest SNL in a long time. Brilliant
Magical Land of Oz,Damn you believe how cancelled this guy is
Magical Land of Oz,Yeh because he is actually funny
Magical Land of Oz,Fuck cancel culture.
Magical Land of Oz,"Reposting my reply to another commenter for visibility, but to the numerous commenters ridiculing Chapelle as an antisemite, please rethink your knee-jerk outrage-conditioned response.

In his monologue, Chapelle said that he's been to Hollywood, and realistically, there are a ton of Jewish people in leadership positions in all of corporate, especially in Hollywood. He implies that coming to that realization is, arguably, a natural one. He goes on to imply that there are ""non-conspiratorial"" reasons this might be the case. Then he explicitly says that Kanye pointing it out in such a random, incendiary way (DEATHCON 3) IS HOWEVER PSYCHOTIC.Chapelles monologue is a masterclass in social commentary, storytelling, and comedy. I don't think it's as simple as what these naysayers are trying to make it out to be, i.e Kanye evil! Chapelle evil! Chapelle is antisemitic! I don't think that's what Chapelle is trying to get across at all. He's commenting on a situation and making fun of the ridiculousness of it as well as some of the veiled truth of it.

&#x200B;

*""HO HUM... What about where he said a group of jewish people was a coincidence and nobody should talk about it? ISN'T HE AN ANTISEMITE?"" asks a mouth breathing troglodyte.*

&#x200B;

That is in fact the point of the joke. It's edgy humor. He isn't sitting on either side of any fence, except perhaps the fence of reason. Think about it. He dunks on Kanye, then admits that Kanye used to say some funny and insightful things in the past. He dunks on a black republican calling him a mouth breather, then dunks on the democrats because they were being salty losers. He says Trump was a star for being so radically honest about the corrupt system, then dunks on him for being a grifting, evil colluder. DUNKS ON THE RIDICULOUSNESS OF  ANTISEMITIC CONSPIRACY THEORIES, THEN ENDS HIS MONOLOGUE BY BEGGING THE SHADOWY POWERS THAT BE NOT TO STEAL HIS JOB. He's a comedian. If you're this upset that he's making fun of Jewish people in such a lighthearted way, while simultaneously making fun of the ridiculous people that are spouting antisemitic rhetoric, you probably shouldn't consume any more media because you lack the level headedness and critical thinking capacity to digest it and think for yourself.


Further edit for the subsequent mouth breathing troglodytes: 


Chapelle is literally making fun of holocaust deniers during his monologue. He says Jewish people have been through horrible things all over the world and he goes on a long tangent saying black people have been through their own fair share of problems and Kyrie in particular wasn't anywhere near the Holocaust when it happened. And this next part is how you know for sure thay it's satirical. He says Kyries not even sure the Holocaust happened. *That's the punchline.*

It's funny because Chapelles essentially saying that someone doubting whether or not the Holocaust happened is absolutely ridiculous. It 100% happened. He's calling Kyrie the worst kind of idiot here.

Chapelle leads the listener on a wild goose chase of ups and downs, implying that maybe black people shouldn't be blamed for the Jews problems. Then he ends his mini monologue by fully implying that of course they CAN AND SHOULD be held accountable, especially in the case of an idiot like Kyrie that probably denies the Holocaust even happened."
Magical Land of Oz,"First time I’ve even watched a clip from SNL in years, granted it was online and not the show itself. Great job Chapelle, that monologue was heavy duty! Saying a ton of wild shit and they still can’t cancel him"
Magical Land of Oz,Chappelle is fantastic. The fake outrage is goofy as shit.
Magical Land of Oz,He crushed that intro!
Magical Land of Oz,Makes sense he’s a hilarious comedian and his writing on the Chappelle show was fantastic
Magical Land of Oz,This was the best episode in recent memory.
Magical Land of Oz,"How many posts have we seen complaining about Chapelle being cancelled, literally dozens, and here he is breaking records for viewership.  Someone is full of shit."
Magical Land of Oz,I honestly didn't find his monologue that funny?
Magical Land of Oz,I thought he got cancelled or something?
Magical Land of Oz,Best episode
Magical Land of Oz,True
Magical Land of Oz,You go Dave!
Magical Land of Oz,"That was the great most authentic, honest and real monologue I’ve ever seen. Dave Chapelle would make an incredible leader."
Magical Land of Oz,Dave Chappell becoming what Eminem thought he was. “Now this looks like a job for me cuz we need a little controversy… cuz it feels so empty without DC”  neHNeHNEHnEhNEh
Magical Land of Oz,Hate watching?
Magical Land of Oz,Epic
Magical Land of Oz,He loves making jokes at the expense of literally everyone!! Which is why I love him.. Oh wait except for Muslims..weird..but I still do genuinely love his comedy
Magical Land of Oz,"I don't get it. Chappelles Show was one of the funniest shows on television. He had some monumental specials back in the day. These days, I dunno. And its not being offended or thinking you can't tell jokes about certain subjects. It's just the last couple specials I saw (that double special he released on Netflix a few years back) was fucking boring. I don't find him edgy, I just find him dull now."
Magical Land of Oz,This is your reminder that most of America is normal.
Magical Land of Oz,"Every single time he comes out with a special or gets on stage there are people who get outraged at his jokes, or websites pretend to for clicks. He hasn’t said anything egregious and for people to act like he does all the time is ridiculous. I’m glad SNL decided to have him out there because I’m all for cancel culture if someone deserves it, but he hasn’t done shit and people need to chill because nobody gives a shit."
Magical Land of Oz,Where are all the haters hating on him now?  For the entire week people were nonstop bitching and complaining. And for what?!  He hosted a great show and one that made us laugh!
Magical Land of Oz,So much for some of the writers boycotting this episode LMAO
Magical Land of Oz,"I watch old commercials on YouTube and I saw a commercial for Comedy Central that had a comedian making a joke about River Phoenix ODing because he was a vegetarian. “You need a nice base of steak in your system to handle that much heroin.”
This was a commercial for gods sake; no way they’d get away with that today. 
We’ve become so puritanical on the left and the right that we don’t even remember what comedy is about. We don’t celebrate free speech like we used to. We infantilize people and treat them like children, so they don’t cry. Then they act like children and have tantrums. 
All this to say that funny stuff is funny and eventually we will get back to not taking everything so goddamn seriously."
Magical Land of Oz,But he’s being silenced!
Magical Land of Oz,It’s almost like the people vocal online don’t represent the actual populace. Weird.
Magical Land of Oz,And it was fucking hilarious.
Magical Land of Oz,Dave Chappelle is the GOAT.
Magical Land of Oz,Antisemitism is indeed very popular
Magical Land of Oz,Dave Chappelle is hilarious
Magical Land of Oz,Funniest thing thats been on snl in years
Magical Land of Oz,Best episode in decades
Magical Land of Oz,"He’s a pretty funny guy, and for some reason those seem to be really scarce in that show, so it makes sense."
Magical Land of Oz,"deservedly so, it was a great show, some excellent sketches."
Magical Land of Oz,People just tuned in for the monologue
Magical Land of Oz,"It’s so funny how all I saw were posts bashing him. Then (since I would never watch SNL) I looked it up and it was masterful comedy. 

I wonder if the 4.8m viewers included YouTube and other apps.. I’m betting it does. And how many viewers actually watched all of the SNL episode?"
Magical Land of Oz,Dave Chapelle is the man.
Back in Very Small Business,Trapped on Amazon Prime sounds like a great premise for a show
Back in Very Small Business,Leaves Prime in two weeks which is annoying. Thanks for the recommendation though I’m going to check it out.
Back in Very Small Business,"""Trapped"" is the name of the tv show btw, in case some people are confused at first like I was"
Back in Very Small Business,There is a 3rd season on Netflix. They changed the name to Entrapped for some reason but it's the same show.
Back in Very Small Business,"It is a good series, and is on Netflix in Canada. I didn’t like the second season as much as the first."
Back in Very Small Business,"Oh this sounds great, thank you for the recommendation."
Back in Very Small Business,"Check out The Minister if you know where to find it. It's a great show and Olaffsons's performance is beyond just about anything else I can think of. You won't understand unless you see it.

Don't watch any trailers because they're all really spoilery and misrepresent the tone of the show.

He also plays a fun villain in The Tourist."
Back in Very Small Business,"Ólafur Darri Ólafsson is a wonderful actor. If you liked him in *Trapped*, you'll love him in *The Minister*. He plays the Prime Minister of Iceland in the throes of a psychotic break."
Back in Very Small Business,"I watched this show a few years ago and LOVED it.  Whenever someone in r/mayorofkingstown asks about a similar show, I recommend Trapped."
Back in Very Small Business,It is a brilliant show and watching the star as the Eurovision chief Icelandic judge in Fire Saga is such a ride. Also spent lol of season one thinking the Icelandic word for police was the name of the town
Back in Very Small Business,I misunderstood the title the first time I read it and was gonna ask about the show name lmao
Back in Very Small Business,Yup great show. I remember watching it when it was on Netflix.
Back in Very Small Business,It’s a great show! But the first season was the best imo.
Back in Very Small Business,https://youtu.be/I-OOpZitfd0
Back in Very Small Business,"There are actually a bunch of great Icelandic shows: Trapped(and the third season which is called Entrapped and, annoyingly, streams separately), The Valhalla Murders, The Lava Field, Stella Blomkvist."
Back in Very Small Business,It's about time to get to Amazon Prime again
Back in Very Small Business,Trapped is indeed a good show
Back in Very Small Business,[deleted]
Back in Very Small Business,Haha!
Back in Very Small Business,It’s on Netflix as well.
Back in Very Small Business,"Oh, man, didn’t know that—I’d better pick up the pace!"
Back in Very Small Business,">	Leaves Prime in two weeks which is annoying

Where do you see the date it’s leaving?"
Back in Very Small Business,"Yes sorry, i should have made that more clear :)"
Back in Very Small Business,FYI your user name made me immediately think of the chorus to Dream Weaver :)
Back in Very Small Business,Same :)
Back in Very Small Business,Accurate!
Back in Very Small Business,>Trapped on Amazon Prime
Back in Very Small Business,Awesome thank you
Back in Very Small Business,"Not in the US. The 3rd season “Entrapped” is on Netflix, but the first two seasons, “Trapped”, are not."
Back in Very Small Business,For me it’s in the app on iOS right above the blue play bar.
Back in Very Small Business,"Oh, we got both in EU. Maybe use a vpn 😄"
Back in Very Small Business,I always thought it was funny that backwards ass Pawnee had a thriving gay bar.
Back in Very Small Business,Greetings from The Snakehole Lounge!
Back in Very Small Business,"In my small town young people hung out at the Waffle House or just in grocery store parking lots because the bars all had a gross, older alcoholics vibe."
Back in Very Small Business,Maybe you just don't get invited to the good parties.
Back in Very Small Business,"So you're telling me that not every female in Letterkenny, Ontario, is a slim tall attractive woman who wears short shorts in mid winter?"
Back in Very Small Business,"My first night living in a classic American small town after leaving The City was basically exactly that though.

Old timey but fairly nice bar. Lots of wood. Great bands. Attractive people dancing. I was actually staying at the house of the good looking female bartender that knew all the local dramas.

Looking back now, it's kinda funny."
Back in Very Small Business,"It’s not that they haven’t been outside of LA, it’s that the reality of small town life isn’t anything anyone wants to watch.


Why do people always assume in accuracies are unintentional?"
Back in Very Small Business,The young people usually move away before they're 21 here
Back in Very Small Business,good thing tv is not real and a local watering hole where the who’s who of the small town hangs out is a convenient story setup
Back in Very Small Business,"You bring back fond memories of the one evening I spent in Arkadelphia, West Virginia.  The fond part is the fact that it was only one night, and then we escaped."
Back in Very Small Business,"I always assume those kinds of trendy small towns are on the west coast. They're definitely not here in the south lol

I think Resident Alien is a good example of this. A little mountain town with a small population where everyone is well-educated and dresses nice. I'd love to live in a place like that if they actually exist."
Back in Very Small Business,"I live in rural Midwest town and we have two bars.

One is small and occupied/kept afloat by the same 10 guys who are there (almost) every night. They even have holiday parties at the bar with just those guys and their wives/families. I went there once and it was like walking into a slightly less depressing Moe’s Tavern.

The other bar is the “younger” bar where generally people in their 20s go. There is a dance floor but no one ever dancing. No live music, but a juke box that people rarely use. And a couple pool tables. And always, always full of smoke. They really only open on Friday’s and Saturday’s because it’s the only time they get any business. It only stays open because it’s connected to and owned by a family that also owns a successful restaurant in town."
Back in Very Small Business,I actually stayed a couple of nights in a small town whilst travelling through Texas. They had a bar which was pretty much in a strip mall but it was ace. The decor was a bit dated but they had duelling pianos and line dancing and I went a couple of nights and it was bouncing
Back in Very Small Business,My favorite thing is those Hallmark movies where a single woman runs a tiny antique shop in a small town and somehow earns enough to drive an Escalade and own a five-bedroom home on 10 acres.
Back in Very Small Business,I get your point but…would you really want to watch a show that sticks closely to real life in a small town?
Back in Very Small Business,"If it's what you're looking for, 'Horace and Pete' is essentially a direct response to this trope. Enjoy."
Back in Very Small Business,"This really depends on where you are. If you have a college near by? Yes, I see that all the time. Tourist area that has a solid local population? Yep. Oilfields or quick cash towns? You betcha..."
Back in Very Small Business,"It always baffled me when there'd be a nightclub where all the teens went, as if an underage hangout would have top notch bands/djs. Think Buffy or Save the Last Dance. Or Smallville, but I believe that one was mostly a hip coffee shop"
Back in Very Small Business,Just watched The Peripheral tonight. I think they do a decent job of showing a small town bar replete with pine and shitty tvs.
Back in Very Small Business,"I, too, watch Virgin River"
Back in Very Small Business,"The small town I'm from didn't have jack shit when I lived there. Just the one rough biker bar. About ten years after I left they got a night club. It didn't have live music, but it played rock and country pop music. And it was packed. Like a damn high school reunion, but for them it was just Friday night. It's where everyone went to hook up and get laid. It was the only party place in town, so you never had to wonder where everyone was. And everyone just seemed to end up going home with everyone else eventually. If I had stayed there a month, I could have knocked boots with every girl I went to high school with that wasn't married."
Back in Very Small Business,Why do people think that if something isn't exactly like they've experienced then it means it's not true or realistic
Back in Very Small Business,"You often need a way for various characters in shows to interact in a natural way. The small town bar trope exists because it’s cheaper and easier to have one set of a central location where all your characters could believably interact with one another and have both private and public conversations. 

A bar allows you to have characters share information with one another/the audience that they normally wouldn’t/shouldn’t disclose. It allows you to use many various tropes that will further the plot easily. Like [“Drowning My Sorrows,”](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Drowning_My_Sorrows) [“In Vino Veritas,”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas) and many more. 

Generally in a small town in the USA/Canada you have a market and some stores, a local diner/restaurant (along with some chains), a movie theater, schools, a bar (or bars), some type of amphitheater or assembly hall, churches, city hall, etc… A bar is the single location that works best where ALL your characters could have an excuse to be at during various times and is a location where you can have “secret” conversations, private conversations, and public discussions/proclamations/speeches with all your characters. 

A school or church or most anywhere else, wouldn’t make sense for [a drifter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter) to make a natural appearance and espouse dialog that furthers the plot. 

There is also usually a TV in the bar which allows you to further the plot and bring news from outside of the town via [“Coincidental Broadcast.”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast)

You also get to use the [“Recovered Addict”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoveredAddict) and  [“Off The Wagon”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon) tropes to enable [“Character Derailment”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment) and other tropes and divulge to the audience some tragic backstory or important plot details. 

The bar is usually used as a window into the outside world and way to get information from the rest of the world to the townspeople."
Back in Very Small Business,"I’ll clue you in on something…

Real life is shitty and doesn’t look, sound, or feel like most things on TV. They’re selling the audience an escapist fantasy where they can see pretty people do awesome, stupid, interesting, dramatic, cliched things. 

Most people don’t want to watch sort-of-6-but-small-town-solid-8 people make awkward conversation at a sticky bar leading to depressed, shitty choices."
Back in Very Small Business,I agree but Twin Peaks has all of those things and it's brilliant.
Back in Very Small Business,"I don't know how to tell you this, but TV isn't real life and sometimes creative liberties have to be taken for storytelling/worldbuilding purposes."
Back in Very Small Business,"The local coffee shop has ten times the average daily traffic as both of the local bars... and this ""town"" has two bars, one coffee shop, one gas station, and a pizza joint that's open about two days a week to launder drug money. 

That's it. The bar that does food gets ten times as much dinner traffic as they do bar traffic."
Back in Very Small Business,"It's not a TV show about an average place, it's a TV show about an extraordinary place; That's why there's a show about it. 

That's the way I look at it at least."
Back in Very Small Business,"[And yet, the bar from New Vegas' prologue exists, in the middle of nowhere, is not a tourist spot (well, maybe a little), and is straight up from a Hollywood movie.](https://youtu.be/89sOyZdtVA0?t=2960)

I really don't know what to do with this. BUT it just hit me why being a biker in Nevada is so fucking cool.

And here I am, in Poland, Europe, where every square meter is the same. Everything mixed together for hundreds of years, all in the same, mid climate... boooring. I don't admire your electric grid Texas, but... you attract me."

Back in Very Small Business,"When our bar has live music it's a super heavy metal cover band, cause I live in the midwest and apparently that's the music everyone wants to hear. No one dances except for 2 or 3 really drunk women who are in leather and fringes. If you can't take the sound level, you hang out in the parking lot."

Back in Very Small Business,Most bars are mostly males and most of the women in the bars if they are there are older women.  But the media has always created this element of harmony in whatever set is being shown in the tv show.
Back in Very Small Business,"They usually forget the impoverished white families, meth addicts, and lack of jobs and hospitals."
Back in Very Small Business,a thriving gay bar plus a night club that is seemingly full or at least bustling on work nights
Back in Very Small Business,"The show shows Pawnee as 60,000 to 80,000 people not the most rural-ness place and even smaller somewhat ass backwords towns can have that kind of 
dichotomy. 

* Rural Decorah, Iowa with a population 8,000 of puts gay pride flags up during pride month and yet has ""Club 45"" a bar named for Trump 's presidency. It has a liberal arts college in town

* Suburban/rural Waverly, Iowa with 10,000 people voted for Trump in 2020 yet has city owned power/water and gigabit internet. Also, was the city owned power company was the first utility in the Midwest to have a wind turbine. The the smaller liberal arts college in town has a drag show and this year went off with zero protests. 

* Cedar Falls, Iowa(40,000) and Waterloo, Iowa(60,000) metro which Waverly exists in is has a two day Pridefest every year. 

* one of the years I worked at a Boy Scout camp in Eastern Iowa had a camp staff that was, for those under 30, 27% LGBT: 3 Bi gals, 2 gay guys, 4 bi guys, and 2 who have started their transitioning from guys to gals."

Back in Very Small Business,"I always felt like they came close to getting the small town bar right..  They over exaggerate the attractiveness of the few women in town but the people there are actually pretty average and the slim pickings are accurate.  

Except for the hockey players, for whom there’s just far too many hockey groupies for a small town."
Back in Very Small Business,Did you live in a Netflix show set in the rural West but actually filmed in Canada
Back in Very Small Business,It's also because they need to have a small number of sets. That's why everyone is always hanging out in the same places. Keeps the budget lower.
Back in Very Small Business,is that a real place?
Back in Very Small Business,Didn't they have a fancy French restaurant in that show?
Back in Very Small Business,"Yes, this is the rural midwest town that I am quite familiar with indeed"
Back in Very Small Business,"Most of these places are kept open by the illegal high stakes poker game that starts after midnight and ends as the sun comes up.

Back in Very Small Business,"Yes - but Twin Peaks is 100% ""David Lynch has never left LA"" - it's supposed to have a population of 50k people and still be a ""small town"" - 50k people would make it the third largest city in Washington that's not a suburb of Seattle, Spokane or Vancouver."

Back in Very Small Business,Or they just don't want to make the show worse for the sake of making it small town accurate?
Back in Very Small Business,"Honestly though, I felt Schitt’s Creek really did show small town life somewhat accurate. The whole concept of having one restaurant where everyone eats, few shopping locations, gossipy small-town politics and having to drive half an hour plus to anywhere is pretty accurate. Now I do think that Schitt’s Creek wasn’t accurate in showing a great number of hip, attractive twenty-somethings because that was definitely not my experience in a small town."
Back in Very Small Business,"Laid back, chill place"
Back in Very Small Business,Doesn't Pawnee have like 70k people? That's not a big city but it's above what I'd consider a small town.

600 Bottles of Wine,"LOST was the show that got me into television. It was more than just an episode a week, it was chatting to strangers online afterwards and throwing around theories. It was staying up till 4am so I could watch it as soon as possible and see what craziness had happened. It was watching all of season 1 over a weekend as my girlfriend had never seen it before.

I haven't watched the finale since it ended but I remember being happy with it. I never needed all the questions answered, I had more fun speculating than a definite answer could have ever given me. The show is next up on my rewatch list and I can imagine binging it would be excellent."
600 Bottles of Wine,"I enjoyed watching the series very much, and, unlike some, liked the ending and thought that the character arcs were pretty much excellent. That said, I thought the last season as an whole had problems: it felt a bit disconnected, in terms of plot, of the others. That said, watching it was an hell of an experience, and I fully intend to rewatch it eventually."
600 Bottles of Wine,"Here's the thing with Lost: the final season isn't *bad*. From an acting, directing, narrative perspective it's a good season that hits a lot of emotional highs and manages to sustain a sort of cohesive theme. The problem is that it's got nothing to do with the rest of the show. Lost was defined by its mysteries and the explanations we wanted for them, and the explanations it offered felt like they were from a different show entirely.

Aside from that, I loved most of the chars, especially Ben, Locke, Sayid, Desmond, Charlie and Alex. The best part of the show was always 100% its ensemble, even if you ignored the annoying love triangle there were lots of awesome characters in the series.

Overall, a great show, elevated by its ensemble cast and its superb first 3 seasons, although great episodes existed in every season. The confusing ending has become a bit of a meme but honestly it's not confusing at all if you just pay attention, it's really straightforward."
600 Bottles of Wine,"I recently finished watching it too and i enjoyed the emotional bits of the finale. I teared a bit at the end with Vincent and Jack. Lost is a show full of great characters that's why I feel Jack gets overshadowed a little, but the way he smiles when he sees the plane leave, knowing his sacrifice was worth it gets me every time. He might not always have used the right methods but all he ever wanted was to keep people safe and get them home, and I love him so much for that."
600 Bottles of Wine,"I love the ending of Lost and I think the finale is near perfect. Sure, they didnt answer everything and I have some problems with the final season *as a whole*. But the finale as a self contained episode is perhaps the most satisfying series finale of all time. They managed to give each member of their very large ensemble cast a perfect send-off. It was emotional, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and beautiful. Not to mention the action, excitement, cinematography, and that Giacchino score. It was a perfect farewell to the characters I grew to love over six years. The finale was not about answers (the lack of answers was the responsibility of the entire last batch of episodes). ""The End"" accomplished exactly what it set out to do. To do this day, and dozens of shows later, I have yet to see a better series finale."
600 Bottles of Wine,"100% Satisfied 

(these were my exact words immediately following the finale when it aired live)  "
600 Bottles of Wine,Sun and Jin’s ending is everything. 
600 Bottles of Wine,"lostpedia.com is a fantastic resource to find things you missed, by the way.

It's my favorite show of all time, the one that got me ""into"" adult television (it was during the first summer break that I rented 24, and the first seasons of Alias and Scrubs from Blockbuster, god that summer was beautiful), and expanded how I thought stories could be told creatively. Season 5 is my favorite, especially the first half. The first has actually few episodes that I would consider my favorite (I'm not exactly hankering to watch Hearts & Minds or House of the Rising Sun any time soon), but the season as an entire package is truly something special.

600 Bottles of Wine,I can recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_DGamgvcXw&list=PLR-Yx2zNLl3m4R42-Z4fwybpdUwb4u-KI) review series on YouTube. He kept track of all the things I wished I kept track of while watching it :D He goes down all the rabbit holes.
600 Bottles of Wine,My favorite show ever! I think it’s even better as a binge show than it was when it aired. Being able to watch the episodes back to back is amazing. 
600 Bottles of Wine,How is the rewatch value?  It seems like I remember so much from one watch watching it live weekly because I really thought hard about each episdoes events.  But the last season is a blur
600 Bottles of Wine,"I need a pill to forget. So i can watch it all over again. 

I watcher every episode from its debut, week after week, but then binged the second to last season and wish i didnt. What made the show so good was the speculation and watercooler talk during those weeks. Binging it was of course gratifying, but then you didint get time to theorize and observe clues and red herrings. "
600 Bottles of Wine,The only thing I remember about the final season is them cutting to Jimmy Kimmel and him saying. “What the hell just happened “ or something like that. 
600 Bottles of Wine,**PENNY**
600 Bottles of Wine,"I remember having a strong desire to kick my TV screen in during the finale. I think it was the realisation that i had wasted hours of my life watching a show that had no pay off.

Edit: Yes they answered all the question. The problem was the answers sucked and were unsatisfying."
600 Bottles of Wine,"Everybody was complaining about the Kate love triangle recently, but I love it. I was rooting for Jack and Kate. "
600 Bottles of Wine,"Never watched Lost, but wine is nice"
600 Bottles of Wine,no
600 Bottles of Wine,The ending ruined the show for me. I haven't watched an episode since and I doubt I ever will.
600 Bottles of Wine,The ending of LOST was never going to do the show justice but to me lost was about the journey and not the destination. Most shows you just get the enjoyment of the show so if it’s 100 hours of tv that’s all you get but with LOST I got more out of talking about and listening to podcasts about it than any other show ever.
600 Bottles of Wine,"And thats what a lot of people didnt get. You go through so many seasons of questions being brought up, did you not think that more questions would pop up after every answer. 

I didnt expect every thing to be answered and i was satisfied with the finale."
600 Bottles of Wine,Alex as in Ben's daughter?? She was barely a character lol
600 Bottles of Wine,"The final season is easily the weakest. There's a ton that's underdeveloped (Sayid and ""the sickness,"" etc) because so much time was spent on these flash-sideways that didn't serve the story.

Setting aside that the flash-sideways reveal doesn't make sense when you think about it too long (and the creepy implications of Ben/Danielle), they could have strengthened the show considerably by doing fewer ""what if"" scenarios and focusing on the actual story. The reason people focus on the afterlife thing so much is because the on-island stuff is so anemic."
600 Bottles of Wine,"Every Lost season is great, not just the last 3. Also Lost was defined by its great characters, not just the mysteries"
600 Bottles of Wine,"That was just perfect, what a send-off."
600 Bottles of Wine,I cried almost as hard as I did when Charlie died!!! Heartbreaking!!
600 Bottles of Wine,"Their flash-sideways ending was, similarly, perfect. As well as Juliet and Sawyer’s."
600 Bottles of Wine,Shiiiiiit this is starting great. Thanks for the linking.
600 Bottles of Wine,"That dude is a dumbass hater
"
600 Bottles of Wine,I have done both and the weekly discussion and podcasts that came from this show made the show what it is. If LOST was on Netflix type of release it wouldn’t have been the show it was. You would have people coming in that Monday to work talk about it that monday and never mention it again until season 2 comes out. Shows like lost need a weekly format to get the full experience out of them.
600 Bottles of Wine,"I don't think you can fully appreciate the show if you didn't experience the week and season long cliffhangers, but it was definitely fun to go back-to-back-to-back episodes without having to wait."
600 Bottles of Wine,"I think you'd be surprised at how much you actually don't remember. It was a lot of fun to re-live it again, and if you're in between TV shows, I would suggest a re-watch."
600 Bottles of Wine,"Even though I definitely disagree, I appreciate that you simply didn’t like the answers. People who act like it answered nothing (or think they were dead the whole time) drive me crazy. It’s just completely false. Not liking how it went however, is totally understandable."
600 Bottles of Wine,No pay off?
600 Bottles of Wine,They didn't answer all the questions.
600 Bottles of Wine,"It's funny because I think when I first watched it originally, I was hoping for Jack and Juliet, and Sawyer and Kate. This time around, I was really happy when Sawyer and Juliet hooked up and glad things turned out the way they did."
600 Bottles of Wine,Why?
600 Bottles of Wine,"It was pretty obvious that the show will be in the red after finale. They overspend on loose ends and the matter was on the damage control .

But the ""golden light cave""? That was ridiculous. "
600 Bottles of Wine,You're welcome! I was equally excited when I found it (probably somewhere here on reddit...)
600 Bottles of Wine,Yeah I liked it less the longer it went on. He was getting more and more ragey the longer it went on lol
600 Bottles of Wine,"I can see that. I’m like that with Stranger Things. I love the show, but the time between seasons causes me to have to rewatch the whole previous season to remember what’s going on. "
600 Bottles of Wine,"I loved it when it aired for sure, don’t get me wrong. 

One thing I have noticed that differs between some who watched as it aired and those who’ve only binged is that those who only watched as it aired seem to be the ones who don’t understand the ending the most. They seem to be the majority of the crowd who say “They were in purgatory the whole time!” Ugh. Lol

Is it just me or have you noticed that as well?"
600 Bottles of Wine,"Because it pretended to be a science fiction/mystery show up until the ending when suddenly it had always been a magical bullshit/drama show. 

I honestly don't know how anybody can take it seriously knowing the mystery aspect boils down to there being a plughole of evil in the middle of the island."
600 Bottles of Wine,"It's funny you mention that, because it happened to me. I couldn't exactly remember the meaning of the ending from my first watch, so I just took the dead theory as fact. After just hearing Christian talk to Jack in the end, it made a lot more sense."
600 Bottles of Wine,"It still feels like a scifi/mystery show to me. The ""magical"" parts of the season were just people who didn't understand the ""science"" trying to explain it in the best way they knew how.

DHARMA told us earlier in the show that the pocket of energy beneath the island was electromagnetic energy and negatively charged exotic matter. The Mother and Jacob didn't understand what any of that was, so they called the energy ""life, death, and rebirth"" or ""malevolence"".

That plughole wasn't there to contain evil. It was there to keep the island's electromagnetic energy from dissipating after an incident that caused its intensity to fade. (And on a thematic level it was there to parallel the button/failsafe key from Season 2.)"
600 Bottles of Wine,What was ever science fiction about Locke being able to walk again?
600 Bottles of Wine,"Interesting! What did you think on the flash-sideways scenes? I have to admit, I put the story together a lot better on my re-watch. "
600 Bottles of Wine,"In the real world there are people that believe electromagnetic energy has healing properties. Lost took that idea, dropped the characters on the largest pocket of electromagnetism on Earth, and rolled with the pseudoscience.

What is sci-fi but impossible scientific theory imagined to be real? It’s just like teleportation or lightsabers."
600 Bottles of Wine,"I still don't quite understand those. I enjoyed them, though and thought they were entertaining. Just not sure if they actually took place or were just ""what could have been""."
600 Bottles of Wine,"This is the best explanation I’ve ever found for them: http://lostpedia.wikia.com/wiki/Flash_sideways_world

They did experience it, but it was bringing them together in the after life, no matter when that time of death may have come for them. In that state, time doesn’t exist. It was a gathering place for them to meet so they could move forward together. "
600 Bottles of Wine,"The only thing I got from this post is that there's a channel that shows nothing but 80s Price is Right, and somehow I'm not watching it right now."
600 Bottles of Wine,This may be the most Reddit post of all
600 Bottles of Wine,1 dollar Bob
600 Bottles of Wine,"Holy shit, I'm watching an episode right now and just saw something I've never seen before: it was the game where the contestant has to assign prices to 4 different prizes, and then a number lights up showing them how many are wrong, and they have to replace them while a time clock counts down. This time, the people running the game kept getting the number wrong, so Bob Barker stopped time and let the lady replace things. They got it wrong again, and so Barker just said, ""Fuck it, I'm giving you all 4 prizes,"" and they stopped the game and went to commercial..

Amazing. This is why Barker was a class act (and is, because he's still alive at 98)."
600 Bottles of Wine,"If you can guess the price of the showcase within the parameters to win it, you watch another episode.  If not, you take a break.  Get some skin in the game!"
600 Bottles of Wine,"Omg, I remember being home sick from school and watching it at 10am as well. There wasnt anything on tv during the day back then, Price Is Right was the best."
600 Bottles of Wine,"I grew up with that show. It’s so silly and goofy and wholesome. Bob Barker became an icon from that show. 

It’s a game show staple. At this point the trinity of game shows is Price, Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune. They might outlast us all"
600 Bottles of Wine,"There is no hope. Give in. Go all in.

Get the suit and microphone. Then start announcing around the house and having family members name off prices. After a couple months you have enough savings to build a couple props from ebay. 

From there you double down even harder. Convince a grocery shop owner to let you work on the premise. You follow shoppers around, yelling price related questions at them. The shoppers couldn't be happier."
600 Bottles of Wine,Thanks.  On my way to Pluto TV.
600 Bottles of Wine,I also recommend watching episodes from the 1970s! The kitchen and living room sets are hilariously hideous!
600 Bottles of Wine,"Are you the mom from ""requiem for a dream""?"
600 Bottles of Wine,God damn as a musician I have to say the bass line of that theme is bitchin'.  Like Geddy Lee level bitchin'.
600 Bottles of Wine,"I'm right there with you. I may not watch nearly as much as you do, but I enjoy viewing a couple hours at a time for many of the same reasons. I just find it fascinating - the fashion, the hair, the technology, the prices, and the seemingly random conversations Bob would have with various members of the audience."
600 Bottles of Wine,"Watch the documentary about price is right, pretty cool"
600 Bottles of Wine,"I had no idea there was a Price is Right channel. I installed Pluto TV and now I am also sucked into the nostalgia void of psychedelic colors, amazing music, 80s fashion and the mildly passive aggressive Bob Barker.

I want to know who designed the set of the Price is Right. It's pure eye candy. Psychedelic consumerism.

I can't get enough of this. Thank you for sharing, I'm having a great time today despite a lot of really stressful messed up shit going down in my life."
600 Bottles of Wine,"#$1, Bob!"

But you don't see anything like it anywhere else. You can scratch that itch for old Kamen Rider or classic Doctor Who while occasionally taking in a Father Dowling mystery or whatever.

600 Bottles of Wine,"Enjoy it! For me, it's the Johnny Carson channel. When I was little, my grandfather was the de facto babysitter during summer vacation, and he always loved watching reruns of shows from the 70's. There was a ""best of Johnny Carson"" show that was on every day, and we just had to watch it. I remember Carnac the Great, and how my grandpa would almost choke from laughter, watching Carson trying not to break during that sketch.

I actually haven't watched anything on the channel yet, cuz I know I'll end up just watching that. Right now I'm stuck on the CSI channel. There's no nostalgia there for me, it's just decent background noise.

Things are pretty crap out there right now, so don't feel bad for enjoying something that reminds you of when life was easier."

Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
21 Again,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
21 Again,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.

21 Again,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
21 Again,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
21 Again,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
21 Again,🙂💕
21 Again,It’s great but it’s depressing.
21 Again,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
21 Again,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
21 Again,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
21 Again,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
21 Again,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
21 Again,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
21 Again,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
21 Again,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
21 Again,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
21 Again,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
21 Again,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
21 Again,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
21 Again,I was sad when the article ended. I don't watch a lot of those shows either so it went by quick. :(
21 Again,Parks and rec subplot wasnt really forgotten. Mark and Leslies relationship was resolved and the Park was put on hold to save the department. They will probably focus on it again next season in tandem with Leslie running for office.
21 Again,"That blurb about Foreman's bout with naegleria on House was clearly written by someone that never really watched the show.  While the overall point that the event had no long term consequences is correct, it's incorrect that it was dropped after he wakes up with right/left reversal.  For the next three episodes after that one Foreman is seen struggling with mental tasks, and frustrated at having to study to re-take a certification exam to keep his medical license.

If you want to talk about things on House that are swept under the carpet, there are much better examples:

- House's ketamine treatment that gives him the ability to walk and run for eight weeks off camera but which has him back on the cane after only two episodes.

- House's methadone treatment that also gives him the ability to walk without a cane for approximately one act of one episode before he realizes that it stunts his mental acumen.

- House's experimental muscle regrowth serum that also lasts all of about one episode before he discovers that in this short time it's created tumors.

"
21 Again,The Pattern in Fringe was fully resolved once it was revealed that Walter wrote the handbook and later when it was revealed who was behind the shapeshifters from the other side.
21 Again,"I'm a big fan of the A.V. Club (about 230#, if you must know), but a couple of these criticisms felt rather forced.

Deadwood: while the Earp story was a bit rushed, remember that the show only had twelve (?) episodes per season. Also remember that part of the charm of Deadwood as a setting was that it had an itinerant population, so people, famous they may be now, might drift in and out. It felt fairly organic to me, anyway, but I do love the show and am likely to forgive its faults (even though there aren't any lalalalala-I-can't-hear-you).

The Shield: that Julien is gay is a fact of his life, not the story. I liked that the show managed to make it clear that he was a troubled dude without giving his troubles the movie-of-the-week treatment. Besides, there really wasn't much more drama to squeeze out of his story, at least not compared to what the Mackey crew was enduring."
21 Again,"I thought the  Furio subplot was kind of resolved.  He went back to Italy after almost killing Tony.  Later  Carmela brought up their affair, if you can even call it that, to Tony, he called Italy and made sure Furio would be dead if he ever surfaced.  I was satisfied.

What I kind of wanted to know was where did Christopher's wife come from?  She just showed up and was pregnant in one episode. 

"
21 Again,"Forget the body snatching TNG plot, what about the whole ""limited warp speed"" policies introduced and then practically forgotten in Season 7?!"
21 Again,"When I saw they mentioned Fringe, I was hoping they were going to mention Peter's shady past working in Iraq. The whole first season they kept planting these ""What was he doing in Iraq?"" questions in your head, and by season 2 it was never really brought up again."
21 Again,"Before I clicked I hoped Walt would be in there somewhere, laughed when I saw his picture under the headline.  Sigh."
21 Again,"There's one subplot from The Wire that was never resolved.

Spoilers?

Perhaps have someone discover he's gay and all the political backlash that would occur.  Yet that's the only mention at all about Rawls being gay."")"
21 Again,"Sam in the West Wing was just killing off a (good) character, not really a subplot. They did a good job with Mrs Landingham, just BAM! she's dead. And later the swearing in latin - genius TV.

21 Again,"I believe during the Mark/Ann relationship, Leslie was also dating David, Louis C.K.'s cop character, who she even considered moving to San Diego with. So I don't think she really cared that much for Mark at that point."
21 Again,"also it wasnt ""briefly mentioned"" when ann asks leslie to date him, because the rest of the episode involves her stalking them...."
21 Again,">House's ketamine treatment that gives him the ability to walk and run for eight weeks off camera but which has him back on the cane after only two episodes.

Wasn't that all a hallucination or something?"
21 Again,"Yeah, that really irritated me when I read it, too -- did the person actually *watch* the subsequent episodes?  Like you said:  probably not.  Not that the AV Club is the WSJ or the New York Times, but it is startling when misinformation is passed along as fact to round out a list."
21 Again,"It's not a subplot, just character development.

The Wire does it better than any other show, as far as I'm concerned."
21 Again,yeah i wish they'd give us a little more on this too.
21 Again,"That scene in that cathedral is amazing to watch every time, but IIRC this was at the end of season 2, when Sorkin was really at his best."
21 Again,Yep. It seems kinda silly to include still airing shows in an article about forgotten plot holes.
21 Again,"No, it was real.  House did suffer a hallucination immediately after being shot, and it is this experience that convinces him to request the treatment; at the end of the episode he wakes from the hallucination and tells Cuddy that he wants the ketamine.  Fast forward to the next season and we see he's been recovering over several months and is able to run 8 miles to work."
21 Again,"Ah, okay, that's right. It's been a while."
21 Again,"Wow, ok I can break down a lot of this. I hope this gets you started as you asked like 20 question, which would be an entire college course in media and distro finance, not a reddit thread

The first thing to realize is self-produced vs. acquired content.  For example, Disney owns Star Wars/MCU, makes it themselves, and distributes it. Everything is done in house.... and well self-produced content can (and nearly almost is) much more profitable (or better to say, less expensive) than acquired content, its a lot cheaper to make and you can do wonky stuff with moving around costs.  For people making this, well, Disney is paying itself, so its not relevant really, for like actors and such, they just get a flat fee, which is often more than they would otherwise since this is the only time they will ever get paid on the show.

In acquired content.  In streaming, the distributor, like Netflix (netflix acquires nearly all its content). Pays for a product thats already done, or pays a production company to make it and they get distro rights. These are generally done on a cost-plus basis for streaming. That means they pay ALL the production costs, plus more as pure profit. This is because they generally get exclusive rights and the show wont have any more way to sell to other distributors ever, its a one and done so they put profit in. It can be alot. These are generally MUCH more expensive than self-produced content. Like way more expensive. Netflix pays a lot more than other companies for content. In regular TV, generally a distributor would be ~80% of production cost, but only get limited distro rights (such as first run linear rights in the US) and the production company could then sell all the other distro rights to others and make back its money + profit. Selling to streaming is free money.

As for how long exclusive deals on acquired content go... its negotiable. For self-produced content, you own it, you can do whatever you want with it or sell rights to someone else

>What if Netflix announced they are willing to pay 3 billion USD a year for streaming rights to all Star Wars properties, does that mean Disney is obliged to match 

In theory, Disney (and Netflix) both have to do business in the best interest of their shareholders. There is at least some number that makes sense for Disney to sell rights, but what that number is, who knows, its probably really high."
21 Again,"Ok, imagine I run a streaming network. 

Scenarios 1)

I make a tv show “in house.” We come up with the concept, we write the scripts, we cast the actors, we hire the creative crew (directors/cinematographers/editors/etc). We make the show and launch it on our platform. The platform owns the show.

This is how Disney’s Star Wars and MCU shows work. 

Scenario 2) 

A producer at my network reads a novel and thinks it is bananas. My network “option” or licenses the novel and uses it to make a tv show. We own the show, the author owns the book. Depending on the contract they can take the option somewhere else when/if it expires.

This is how Daredevil worked between Netflix and Disney.

 Scenario 3)

We read the book - we buy the rights outright. We make a show. We own everything.

This is how Amazon’s Rings of Power works.

Scenario 4)

Someone else makes a show. We love it. We license the show and air it on our channel for a certain length of time. The license expires, the show’s creators take it somewhere else.

This is how Breaking Bad and Better call Saul on Netflix worked.

Scenario 5)

Someone else makes a show. We love it and we buy it - we own the show. The show’s creators pitch a sequel/interquel/prequel based on concepts tied to the show. We pass. They take their pitch to one of our competitors who options it provided they not use ideas we defined. We get paid a little.

This is how Avatar: the Last Airbender worked.

> residual values of shows

I have no idea how residuals work in streaming.

Tv shows and movies used to be available for syndication - which was when a secondary or tertiary network bought the rights to air episodes of a popular show a certain number of times for a certain length of time. 

That doesn’t happen with streaming shows. I can only think of one streaming show that was brought back after cancellation (Tucca and Bertie) - it just doesn’t happen like it used to."
21 Again,"Streaming residuals are insanely complicated and havent even been fully worked out yet. Its why you see such huge upfront payments to the above the line people, because they arent getting their typical percentages."
21 Again,"Some of the more popular franchises are owned outright. Disney full on bought Marvel comics and such over a decade ago. They don't own Spider-Man in film because back in the 90's Sony bought the film rights. So Sony can do whatever it wants with Venom, Madame Web etc. Some of it gets real funny like how Disney has Spidey cartoons because apparently the contract lets Disney use animated Spidey stuff also long as it's under 44 minutes. Meanwhile Sony can do animated films like Spiderverse. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch being related to both the Avengers and X-Men let both Avengers Age of Ultron and the Fox films have a Quicksilver. Disney had Marvel Comics retcon that Magneto is not actually their Dad though and that's still in place despite Disney buying Fox and having sole rights to the characters now.

So suffice to say, Star Wars won't come up for sale, Disney has their own long-term pans for a Star Wars theme park. So it won't matter if Netflix wanted to pay for it.

Netflix itself has it's own contracts for the shows. It made Marvel shows but those got cancelled and now Disney got the streaming rights back for those since they own those in the first place.

Sony owns Columbia Pictures and has a decent sized TV library but has no interest in a streamer for whatever reason. So they let Seinfeld stream on Netflix for a long-term contract a few years ago. But they basically have a monopoly on anime streaming in the West now with CrunchyRoll and Funimation.

Warner is doing the real baffling stuff now with Discovery merged and in charge. They apparently want ""big IP"" like Harry Potter and DC in house but are also letting a new Batman cartoon from Bat-master Bruce Timm be shopped to 3rd parties after axing plans for it to be on HBO Max. This is all way above the heads of most showrunners.

if you're a producer like Greg Berlanti with like a dozen shows on multiple platforms it's better but Berlanti doesn't have total control over everything. Flash show is still DC/Warner for example despite being Berlanti's production company."
21 Again,">however the shows themselves belong to the creators/producers/production companies

There is no reason why that has to be true.

The short answer to who owns a show is always: it depends on the deals that have been made.

Those deals can be very complicated, but we will see more and more that streaming companies will try to have full control over the distribution rights, or even the copyright itself.

Some additional information about copyright and licensing.

I often buy stock photos, technically I buy a non-exclusive license with limitations to use those photos.

Who owns the copyright? It depends. Under US law the person who makes the photo owns the copyright, unless there is a written agreement that states otherwise.

If I hire a photographer, I make the photographer sign an agreement that makes it clear the photographer makes the photos as 'work for hire' and the company I work for owns the copyright and the full and unlimited distribution rights.

If I use a model, the model has to sign a contract as well. That contract also contains some article that protect the rights of the model, so for example, the company I work for is not allowed to use the image of model outside of the original context."
21 Again,It depends on the contracts. We just saw with black widow video sharesand big screen shares are not the same
21 Again,">But does Disney really ""own"" Star Wars and MCU, any more than Netflix ""owns"" Stranger Things and The Witcher, or Amazon ""owns"" Ring of Power?

Yes.

I guess it does get more complicated. Warner Bros. owns Sandman and Batman but was able to shop Sandman around ending up at Netflix and there's a bidding war for an animated batman series. 

>What if Netflix announced they are willing to pay 3 billion USD a year for streaming rights to all Star Wars properties, does that mean Disney is obliged to match that to keep Star Wars on Disney Plus? Because otherwise they'd be screwing over the creators and whoever else is entitled to a share of Star Wars earnings?

presumably Disney who owns Lucasfilm needs it to prop up disney+ which will long term make more than enough."
21 Again,"Disney owns the SW characters and mostly owns the Marvel characters.  Amazon owns their original characters within RoP but doesn't own a lot of the stuff with the IP.  The Witcher is based on a book series (or the game that spawned off of it, I'm not sure of the ownership).  Stranger Things I think is also not owned by Netflix but I don't know of the details there.

A lot of companies are trying to distribute products they produce as it's more profitable.  Disney owns a lot more IP than Netflix does.  They do still have to pay residuals to creators, but they don't have to pay out to a production company when they are the production company.

The companies are publicly owned and have to maximize profits.  If Netflix were to offer 100 billion/year for Star Wars, Disney would probably be legally obligated to accept that deal (or pay out residuals to the people who made it as if they made that deal).  But if it's a reasonable figure, Disney can say that it's more profitable for them to keep it housed under Disney+ than they would make by selling it to another service."
21 Again,I read that some of the royalty's on hbo max content was based off of how many subscribers they have which was one of the reasons that they took away some content that was not being watched by many people
21 Again,"Hey thanks for the examples!  That's a really good way of showing how a particular show can be made, owned, and commoditized.

I guess my initial take is that Disney's method of buying major franchises for a large lump sump fee, but then having the ability to develop those franchises however they want by using hired creatives and then owning the resultant shows and movies outright for perpetuity is gonna be a lot more cost effective than Netflix acting more like a distributor and partner to production companies that makes many of its shows, but it does hinge on whether Disney can continue to milk the Star Wars and MCU properties for years to come. 

In regards to residuals,  I guess my question is more about who ""owns"" how much of each show and therefore who gets his much of its LONG TERM income. The example is always how much Jerry and Larry had made from Seinfeld, because they presumably own a large chunk of the show itself,  so as long as the show makes money,  they get a large cut. 

Is that still the norm in the industry today? Or is it more like the studios like Disney, Sony, Paramount etc more own the properties and simply pay producers and showrunners a mostly upfront cost to make shows for them. For example does Beniof and Weiss own a chunk of GoT, or did they just get paid (handsomely) to make the show,  but now Discovery Warner gets the bulk of future earnings going forward."
21 Again,"One caveat is that while Stranger Things and Star Wars belong whole to respectively Netflix and Disney, there are parts of MCU that don't belong to Disney (Spider-Man, Incredible Hulk), while in case of Witcher and Rings of Power companies have TV filming rights and own each TV series, they do not own books, movies or games publishing rights."
21 Again,"So are you saying because Disney actually owns much of the Star Wars IP, it is still much cheaper for Disney to keep streaming Star Wars than Netflix? As in say the residuals cost 10%, and Netflix goes crazy and say we'll pay 10 billion a year for streaming rights, Netflix would actually have to pay Disney 10 billion dollars, and then Disney takes 1 billion as residuals to pay the creators. But if Disney wants to match that and keep Star Wars, Disney would essentially just need to pay 1 billion as residuals and sort of ""pay itself"" the other 9 billion dollars? Which means it would cost 
Netflix prohibitively more money to try to stream a property like Star Wars?"
21 Again,">  LONG TERM income

That depends on contracts.

People like the South Park guys keep selling pieces of the show.

Someone with less clout might not be able to do that.

Someone like the Game of thrones guys - who are hired guns - probably make much less than George R R Martin, who can sell and resell and sell and resell.

I can say that if you look up certain creators + contract + like Variety you can find out details of big contract.

Ex:

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/george-rr-martin-hbo-deal-b1824207.html"
21 Again,"FYI it appears undetermined if Netflix actually owns Stranger Things. They have distro rights, but who owns the underlying IP and such might be 21 Laps (production company)"
21 Again,"More or less.  But Disney needs to make up that $9 billion somehow.  They need to maximize shareholder value, and if streaming it on D+ is only worth $1 billion, then they're not maximizing it and should sell the streaming rights to Netflix.  They can do creative accounting to say it's worth $9 billion to grow the D+ brand or whatever, but they need to have some logic to do so."

Motherland,They'd better not change the theme song.  The British version's is absolutely perfect.
Motherland,"My does everything need to be remade for a US audience, when the original works so well.

Have any US adaptions of US shows ever worked out? While The Office was good by the third season is lost the charm and became a generic US sitcom. Taskmaster, Ghosts, Shameless (US went on way to long), Skins, Inbetweeners, Gavin and Stacey, Bad Education, The Great British Bake Off, Miranda, My Country were poor attempts."
Motherland,"Based on casting announced so far this misses a lot of the charm of the UK version for me, the people in it are kind of ordinary looking folk, Judy Greer is wonderful but hard to picture as the mother who's kind of pretty but not nearly as attractive as she thinks she is, Ellie Kemper is IMHO much more attractive than the lead mother in the UK version even without makeup."
Motherland,"It's an American version of a British show.  

They'll change most of what's good about it.  

I say this as an American."
Motherland,"Ghosts was rough at the start but it found it's footing eventually.

Only negative I see in it is you can tell they are just gonna milk it until it's dry instead of letting it end like British shows tend to. I think if they are going to keep it going much longer they are gonna have to shoehorn a way in for the husband to see the Ghosts too."
Motherland,"Having watched both, I think the US version of Ghosts is a really solid sitcom, different to the British version but not inferior."
Motherland,"I love Ghosts US more than the UK one, and I watched the UK one first. Welcome to Flatch (My Country remake) I watched its whole 2 seasons but it was never better than just okay despite having the great Aya Cash and the Stiffmeister. So I guess Ghosts is the only good US remake in a long while, IMO."
Motherland,"another thing for me is the ‘familiarity’, the actors in the UK version already inhabit their characters so perfectly. but to be fair I guess the US version isn’t aimed at us!"
Motherland,"The Office, Veep, American Idol if you are into that, Whose Line is it Anyway, Stanford and Son, Shameless, Early House of Cards, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, Kitchen Nightmares.

Not everything is Bea Arthur doing Faulty Towers. There are some good shows based on British shows.


That said, what's the point? Motherland is at its essence just about a group of mothers (and one dad). There is nothing particularly unique about that premise. There is only 19 episodes, so they will probably run out of plots they can adapt in a single season. They aren't getting the actors, they aren't getting the writers. They are paying for some name recognition and the flimsy premise, which again isn't particularly unique. In truth they could do a similar show without pointing out it is based on the British show.  Some might point out the similarities but you just need to look at The Office to see how far that show veered from the source."
Motherland,I have mixed feelings about this. The original is one of my favorite dark comedies and I like Showalter but imo most US remakes of British series fall flat.
Motherland,As someone who likes Ellie Kemper I have some hope. She's funny and super likeable.
Motherland,"despite the great cast in the uk original, I couldn't get into it, and I tried twice, something I very rarely do with all the shit to watch. ellie kemper is a huge plus, but even she couldn't make kimmy schimdt watchable towards the end (s1 was among my absolute favorite things), so we'll see."
Motherland,if this goes ahead i won't be making the mistake of watching it like i did with their broadchurch remake. i can't see an american version of this show because the comedy isn't very american.
Motherland,"I feel like similar to the US Inbetweeners remake, American shows struggle with ""unlikeable"" leads like Julia/Will. The casting of Kemper would lean into softening the character who's played quite sweet previously"
Motherland,I'd rather have a series 4 than an US remake.
Motherland,Her blowjobs are dry and toothy though.
Motherland,She was so good in Bones. It will be nice to see her in something else.
Motherland,"So does that mean the other show she was going to do isn't happening or was that just *another* pilot that didn't get picked up (The Hug Machine, a musical comedy from the Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist people about a struggling rockstar whose career finds new life in the world of children's music)"
Motherland,"She was in For All Mankind for a couple episodes but massively underutilized. 

Excited to see her in something new, slightly concerned how they’ll translate the British show to be suited for the US, as the original is fantastic, but very excited to see how this show turns out."
Motherland,Cool – looking forward to the final season of this one.
Motherland,YES!!   SO excited for this season!!!...................i'm sad it's the final season.  although i assume they wrote the season knowing it would be it's last and will be able to wrap things up in a satisfying way!
Motherland,This show got so much better in Season 2. I’m looking forward to this
Motherland,"Yeah, that's unfortunate it won't continue on. They have a nice piece of world building there, I would have gladly explored it more."
Motherland,"Glad to see this show will get a chance to wrap up properly. It is just a pity three short seasons seem to be the limit nowadays! 

Freeform does not seem to be making much of an effort in the scripted content market lately. With the recent axing all they have is the Cruel Summer anthology show as well as Good Trouble and Grownish and both of those shows are likely on their last legs. I guess scripted is just dead on basic cable."
Motherland,"IMO, this is the most undermarketed and underestimated show in many many years."
Motherland,F\*\*\* yeah!!  😃
Motherland,Is this a good show? Thinking about starting
Motherland,"YES! YES! YES!! 

SO excited for this news! i can't wait for tomorrow night's 2nd season finale!"
Motherland,"I love this show. 

Maaannnn….sad news about Everything’s Going to be Okay. Really loved that show, too."
Motherland,"thats nice, not really a show i think about between episodes but would've been disappointing if they would not have been able to end the story properly and based on episode title i cant see the next episode being a good point to end a show"
Motherland,"Freeform, figure out your audience and deliver the goods. Why is the Fosters season 12 their only long running show? Cruel Summer was dope, bring back Greek and reboot Kyle XY / Huge. Wouldn’t turn down another Big Wolf on Campus / 10 Things I Hate About You / Middlemen / Bunheads sequel show."
Motherland,Love that show!
Motherland,Arh I hope they expand on the wall fugi entity.
Motherland,"That's a bit of a shame, It's gotten a lot better since Season 1 and I'm quite enjoying it now."
Motherland,I absolutely love this show. I hope Netflix picks it up.
Motherland,Part of me wonders if Freeform is winding down to just being a movie channel
Motherland,"I heard Cruel Summer was kind of a hit though? Although it's worth noting that like all of Freeform's shows it's also on Hulu the same day as broadcast. 

Feels like those deals are useful for getting eyes on television shows, but it makes the offerings of FX, Freeform, and ABC less unique"
Motherland,"> It is just a pity three short seasons seem to be the limit nowadays!

If it’s not a sitcom or a procedural that’s probably for the best. The need to always be building toward the next big thing seems to be what kills a lot of shows.  And it keeps the odds of someone hitting it big and leaving having to justify some character’s sudden disappearance from the plot lower."
Motherland,It’s so much better than I ever expected it to be.
Motherland,"IMO the show is very well acted and there is a lot of great stuff, but the story suffers from the fact that seasons are so short.

There is just no time to explore the most interesting parts of the world they built. 

This is the kind of show I would love to see get picked up by another network and given the resources it needs to be a top show."
Motherland,"Yes, it is – it's actually shockingly good at story/world-building.

This may actually be my second favorite show after *The Expanse*, and that's saying something. This year maybe the only thing I thought that was close to it was *Cruel Summer*..."
Motherland,"Because it's on freeform there's the teenage drama aspect but they've done a fantastic job of world building. Every episode makes you want to know more of what's happened and happening around the world. The world is unlike anything I've seen in another show.

I compare the worldbuilding to that of the Snowpiercer tv series. Both shows didn't simply lay out everything at the start, you keep wanting to know more as each episode is released."
Motherland,"yea its good. It wont win awards, and i dont know anyone that would even consider it for their top 10 but its absolutely good enough to keep you entertained for the two seasons they have released so far if you dont set your expectations too high."
Motherland,Season one can have a bit of excess of teen drama but nothing extreme. Season two has been great so far. This is a series that I wish was based on books or maybe they continue it that way. The world they have built is very interesting and something I want to learn more about.
Motherland,"I recommend it. It's a low fantasy world with some creepy elements to it that's really well done. There's some drama, but not the cheap soap opera type like on CW shows.  Great acting, great production values, satisfying pacing. There are some lazy copouts here and there to advance the story, but it's forgivable most of the time."
Motherland,"Not good, just ok."
Motherland,I think they are definitely winding it down. It will be lucky to offer 4 to 5 scripted shows in 2021. I miss the days when they offered more than a show a quarter!
Motherland,"Cruel Summer was definitely a big hit. It got 7 million viewers and episode over the season. That matches what The White Lotus got for HBO and HBO Max! The problem is it was a limited series and the story wrapped up. They are going to bring it back because it was a massive hit but like The White Lotus it is looking at a new cast and story under the same format. 

I think sharing content with Hulu definitely hurts FX, Freeform, and even ABC but it is all good for Disney. Basic cable has basically got out of the scripted game and FX is one of the few networks still delivering a whole bunch of TV shows and I think that is thanks to them being propped up by being a prestige content supplier for Hulu. I’d like it if they kept a decent Freeform slate as well since that can only boost what Hulu has to offer and make it seem better value. Freeform also helps them with solid YA branding on Hulu."
Motherland,"Im honestly still surprised at how good they are presenting their fictional world and it's alternate history. Now mind you I wouldn't mind if they elaborated a bit more, but in the limited amount of episodes they have they're doing a great job :D"
Motherland,Yes! We need @netflix to pick this show up.
Motherland,Fantastic. I'm really happy you said Snowpiercer because I love that show. Thank you for giving me something else to watch
Motherland,"The way I heard it is that the creator did originally intend to make this a book series, but they developed it as a TV series instead. If this is true, I hope he eventually writes the books after the TV series wraps."
Motherland,"I love this show and it's the one I'm mostly looking forward to that's coming back this summer. Like someone else said, the worldbuilding is really unique: a world in which the U.S ended the persecution of witches three hundred years ago and has since then used them to serve in the army. Witches are born with enhanced vocal cords that can produce ""seed sounds"" and through the mastery of that technique are able to affect the nature around them. It's also a very thematic series with morally grey characters and based on the trailer it looks like the story is going to grow and get even more compelling.

Definitely deserves more people watching it!"
Motherland,"As a nerd for worldbuilding, I didn't know how they could make it better but they did. I'm so excited for this series to drop soon!"
Motherland,"Enjoyed the first season of this very much, light on the bs drama, good world building."
Motherland,"Hyped for this, the worldbuilding is so clever!"
Motherland,I was expecting to see a trailer about distressed stay-at-home Mums in the UK.
Motherland,YES YES YES!!! i love this show and this new season looks fantastic! i'm a big fan of Taylor Hickson's as well!
Motherland,"Having watched the first... five? episodes of this show, I'm astonished it got a second season. It just felt like a very ham-fisted attempt at a YA fantasy series without much beyond the general setting premise to keep it going. 

Also, what kind of military organization has their recruits sneaking away with that much regularity? Like, you'd think they'd do something to stop that."
Motherland,"LMAO, I’m sure these comments are all organic and real too since they all mention the exact same words in the comments"
Motherland,\[[***Mirror***](https://streamable.com/q7pb0r)\]
Motherland,[removed]
Motherland,"They're not wrong. Worldbuilding is fantastic.

Production values are cheap, acting is Freeform, and the writing of the characters themselves is very YA, but the concept and world are interesting enough that I'd recommend someone at least try it out on that basis alone."
Motherland,i'm not sure if all the comments are real or from the same person or whatever but personally speaking i loved season 1. season 2 looks even better (fingers crossed!).
Motherland,"Hey could you hire some people to make Reddit comments to make this show sound good?

Sure what should I say?

Idk just make sure it includes “world building”

- 7/10 comments all mention “worldbuilding”,  I’m sure that’s a coincidence"
Motherland,"I see what you did there...good job. You sneaked in ""world building"" cleverly.  How much did they pay you for this comment?  🤔"
Motherland,"I just tried the pilot and seriously, that aspect is the most interesting thing about it. Its natural it gets mentioned, not everything is a conspiracy."
Motherland,I actually liked this show but what bothered me much of the time was I didn't understand how witches were any better than using a conventional military.
Motherland,The fungus wall. Will they now explain what that was?
Motherland,YES!! i loved season 1 and can't wait for season 2!
Motherland,That is a premise wasted. Ill not bother with the second season the first was already barely watchable. Ill rather do a rewatch of Saga of Tanya the Evil.
Motherland,Was this show any good?
Motherland,"I don’t think they were exclusive. There’s a scene where you see the head witch and other generals iirc, that suggests that the witches are just one more branch of the military."
Motherland,how funny is it?
Motherland,"Yeah, the witches were like a special ops team."
Motherland,It's not a comedy
Motherland,Yes it is. One of the best BBC comedies in a long time.
Motherland,"That's Motherland though, I think the person above me was asking if Motherland: Fort Salem is a comedy which it's not."
Motherland,Is it funny though?
Motherland,You could watch the show and figure out if it's funny or not
Motherland,This is the stupidest show and I loved season one so much.
Motherland,Excited
Motherland,This BBC comedy turned dark....
Motherland,Cool.
Motherland,Was that show actually good?
Motherland,These are my exact feelings
Motherland,"I watched the first ep yesterday. I don't hate it, but I feel no real drive to keep watching it.

I think the idea would be MUCH better as a book, as it was originally intended."
Motherland,"I am not sure it was good, but it was enjoyable."
Motherland,No it wasnt.
Motherland,"I watched season one early in the pandemic. I think the time was ripe for me and the series. It is so absurd and insane and ridiculous. It was what I needed. 

It would have been a good book cut there are some great visuals. And a weird dance orgy."
Motherland,"Enjoyable is what entertainment should be at least, fine"
Motherland,"Quite fond of the first series of this, but something about the second series didn't really click for me."
Motherland,love Purdey.
Motherland,Now there’s a show that needs a reboot!
Motherland,I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS. PLEASE BE GOOD
Motherland,I'm skeptical but will give anything that involves VVitches a look c...
Motherland,I have a bad feeling about this show's quality.
Motherland,i know this show's entire premise sounds absurd but i am actually excited for it!  i just think it looks like a fun show! plus i'm a fan of the show's star Taylor Hickson!
Motherland,The premise is weird enough for me to check it out at least
Motherland,The style of this reminds me a lot like  Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch

MasterChef: The Professionals,"Where do you stand on Top Chef, because I hate most cooking competitions aside from that. "
MasterChef: The Professionals,yeah ive always been a big fan of it and one of the few reality shows ill follow. they do put the drama on times though. I have to catch up a bit on it
MasterChef: The Professionals,"We try to watch all versions of MC. Most of them are on YouTube. Canada is pretty good too.  
It seems like The Professionals is really anal about getting theirs pulled off as soon as someone posts them. For a couple seasons we could watch them on BBC US, but they don't show it anymore."
MasterChef: The Professionals,It's wierd that the author seems to totally dicount that Top Chef has been hugely popular for a decade. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"it's up there but bit too much drama for me

some of the seasons food have been really poor though"
MasterChef: The Professionals,I haven't watched it. Isn't that on Bravo or something?
MasterChef: The Professionals,"yeah it is painful to find the old seasons as well, and it is not like the bbc can make money off them since you can find out the winner by accident

should stick them all online or something

bbc should have foreign access player with ads, i'll be happy to sit thru some ads for them"
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Thats because Top Chef has never really aired outside of obscure channels here in the UK (The Guardian being a UK publication), nor does it quite have the reach that Masterchef has in general."
MasterChef: The Professionals,"yeah its on Bravo, all chefs with a fairly decent state or local reputation and many who are award winning looking to go further in their careers. "
MasterChef: The Professionals,I agree
MasterChef: The Professionals,"I remember when cable tv was supposed to bring all sorts of local programming. I had hopes that programs like those shown on the food channels would have local affiliates. It would be fun seeing local chefs in programs like chopped, master chef, etc on local tv. Even the local talk shows are pretty much gone and have pretty much become AM talk radio."
MasterChef: The Professionals,Is this a U.S. Show?  I only see a Brazilian one.
MasterChef: The Professionals,I'll look for it on Hulu. Thanks for sharing
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Huh.  I find them the worst part.  They seem too scripted and over-acted.   

I'm pretty sure they do all the reaction shots after the days shoot and they've developed a 'story'.

"
MasterChef: The Professionals,"I had a brief period as a gentleman of leisure (ie. unemployed), at which point I was desperate for shit to break up the days. This happened to coincide with a season of this show, and I got super into it.

My favourite thing was the technical challenges they were doing. Sometimes they just did off-the-wall shit that there was a fair chance they'd never even contemplated before (even if they were classically-trained, which many weren't). One I remember was the sea urchin. Like, what fraction of chefs worldwide do uni? And then they were commenting on the cutting quality and shit. I was just cheering the guys who knew which was the edible bit."
MasterChef: The Professionals,Will take a watch. My favorite Masterchef is the Australian version. Really watch people learn and get better. The American version is crap compared to it.
MasterChef: The Professionals,The Professionals I'm watching is British BBC. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Oh I don't know if Masetchef Professionals is better than Australia, I've heard good things about Australia and only seen one episode which was good. But Professionals, at least season 9 I've been watching, just has some of the best reaction shots to copy out if you're looking for gifs."
MasterChef: The Professionals,"I like both. Being a pro baker, I find it interesting when I see the amateurs & what they aspire to.  But the shows with the pros can be just as interesting as not all of them are in the same level. Take Top Chef-some quit their jobs to go on the show. Some own their own restaurants, while others are sous chefs & so forth. I see the ratings for that are as high as any other show. Chopped hasn't stayed on the air because no one watches. I think there are plenty of people for either/both. It depends on the show & what it offers-more actual cooking/baking versus design."
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Umm... CHOPPED (USA) is still produced and aired in the USA. From what I read, CHOPPED CANADA was canceled four years ago, and India has been receiving their own two versions of CHOPPED."

MasterChef: The Professionals,How long before this is on facebook with a claim it's a legit compilation of Ramsey shouting at kids?
MasterChef: The Professionals,People say Gordon is so much nicer on Masterchef Junior but on one episode he threw an entire pan full of scallions off a cliff into the ocean while screaming at the kids.
MasterChef: The Professionals,This was fucking amazing. And I don't feel bad at all for laughing.
MasterChef: The Professionals,YOU FUCKING DONKEY lolol
MasterChef: The Professionals,Hey that's me at 0:00!
MasterChef: The Professionals,Where's the lamb **SAUCE** ^ಥ_ಥ
MasterChef: The Professionals,[deleted]
MasterChef: The Professionals,This is gonna be trending on facebook as real within the week
MasterChef: The Professionals,This should be in /r/oddlySatisfying
MasterChef: The Professionals,I want more. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,This is the kinda thing that will end up on my moms FB feed and she will think it’s real. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,They just need to find one group of really resilient kids and make this happen for only one season. I would pay for that shit hard.
MasterChef: The Professionals,"This needs to be longer.. much, much longer. "
MasterChef: The Professionals,"""Where's the Lamb SAUCE?!"" 

I damn near died laughing."
MasterChef: The Professionals,This show is great except for Joe Bastianich... what a piece of shit racist that guy is.
MasterChef: The Professionals,Fucking gold. Its one of those things were i wonder how this wasn't thought of sooner.
MasterChef: The Professionals,Please make a 10 minute version of this. For all that is good in this world...Please 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Not gonna lie, I think I would actually crack up if Gordon Ramsay called me a ""f*cking donkey"" in the middle of his tirade against my mashed potatoes."
MasterChef: The Professionals,I feel obligated to say: Gordon Ramsay needs to be on Hot Ones. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,Now someone do the reverse of this please
MasterChef: The Professionals,This is what the world needed. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"""What the fuck are you doing?!"" (At the kid rolling dough) My favorite!"
MasterChef: The Professionals,Anyone have a video compilation of Gordon's best outbursts? 
MasterChef: The Professionals,Gordon seems so happy doing that show.
MasterChef: The Professionals,Can we please send this to gordon some how? We can get this done
MasterChef: The Professionals,This reminds me of that commercial Brett farve did with the backyard football game with some kids. Lol
MasterChef: The Professionals,"""You fucking donkey!"" will forever be the greatest line ever aired on TV. "
MasterChef: The Professionals,"""You fucking donkey,"" has become one of my favorite insults."
MasterChef: The Professionals,Now somebody needs to do the inverse! 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Haha, why am I finding crying children getting screamed at hilarious"
MasterChef: The Professionals,Something about shouting on children makes me all happy inside.
MasterChef: The Professionals,If he acted like he usually does on hells kitchen on masterchef Jr I would love it. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Get your shit together, children. "
MasterChef: The Professionals,Thank you for this. It's beautiful.
MasterChef: The Professionals,Doesn’t Gordon have a Reddit account? Someone should make sure he sees this. Haha.  
MasterChef: The Professionals,It should take no longer that 2 fucking seconds to upvote this!
MasterChef: The Professionals,"I prefer this one

[Gordon Ramsay's Crispy Pancake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyL_cYxV6QA)"
MasterChef: The Professionals,"I can't watch the American versions of his shows after seeing the British ones. Gordon definitely has a temper but it's played up to absurdity for American TV. He is actually a very kind, caring and reasonable man.


Go on Hulu and watch Gordon Ramsey's Ultimate Home Cooking - he prepares food with his children and his mother and you can tell he's more earnest and that's his true personality. Going back to hearing him scream and cuss just sounds so put on after that. I don't doubt he gets pissed and he's got some epic insults under his belt but that's not him most of the time."
MasterChef: The Professionals,I'd watch that show.
MasterChef: The Professionals,"You scummy fucker!



"
MasterChef: The Professionals,Is it weird that Gordon Ramsey hurling insults at children is arousing me... I need to bring this up with my therapist 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"“IT’S BLACK!”
*camera focuses on the black kid*"
MasterChef: The Professionals,A great concept. Horribly executed.
MasterChef: The Professionals,Wot the fook these kids cryin lel. Also I've never seen the kid version 
MasterChef: The Professionals,Is this legal work?
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Best laugh I've had all week, thanks"
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Too short
"
MasterChef: The Professionals,Oh my goodness I needed this
MasterChef: The Professionals,"Damn it I just had this idea Friday in food's class :/ 

Still funny tho"
MasterChef: The Professionals,Gordon Ramsay is a national treasure...!!! 
MasterChef: The Professionals,I want to see an entire episode. 
MasterChef: The Professionals,"shit fuck shit fuck shit fuck shit fuck shit fuck shit fuck 

Great video"
MasterChef: The Professionals,"I have a good friend who was on Hell's Kitchen, I showed this to him and he couldn't stop laughing"
MasterChef: The Professionals,this is the best thing ever
MasterChef: The Professionals,That's fucking hilarious.
MasterChef: The Professionals,I need a longer version of this.
MasterChef,It's always funny to me when I see shows get a second season and I was not even aware there was a first season.  This is the first I have heard that there is a new Fantasy Island series.
MasterChef,"In the year 2022, a 0.26 in the demo is all you need."
MasterChef,Excited for Duncanville
MasterChef,"- May 1 - Duncanville (Season 3)

- May 18 - So You Think You Can Dance (Season 17)

- May 23 - Don’t Forget the Lyrics! (Series premiere)

- May 23 - Beat Shazam (Season 5)

- May 25 - MasterChef (Season 12)

- May 31 - Lego Masters (Season 3)

- May 31 - Fantasy Island (Season 2)"
MasterChef,"They had a Christmas special episode as well. For someone that watched the original....yes, I am that old, it's good."
MasterChef,"I, too, watched the original when it first aired. We're both old."
MasterChef,Isn't this just like normal UK slang? People like to go out for dirty burgers or whatever?
MasterChef,"Seems like its social media trying to manufacture some outrage here.

Saying that it might have been better had she said refining street food."
MasterChef,">Clarence Kwan, creator of ""Chinese Protest Recipes,"" a cooking zine about antiracism and Chinese food, posted a screenshot of the bio to his Instagram Stories, where he expressed his dismay.

Yeah that sounds like someone who makes a living out of being angry."
MasterChef,"They had an issue with using the word ""clean"" as well.  And what about dirty rice? People need to look at what is actually being said instead of taking a word here & there & coming up with their own version of what's being said."
MasterChef,This is akin to “hole in the wall”
MasterChef,TBP fans love a dirty burger. Its a pretty common food word lol.
MasterChef,Its just slang
MasterChef,"I'd take ""dirty food"" over that overpriced gentrified shit."
MasterChef,[deleted]
MasterChef,">Armitage-Mattin [issued an apology on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIMEvgInFxA/), writing that she had ""never called Asian food 'dirty' in a derogatory manner"" and instead meant ""indulgent street food; food that comforts you as in 'going out for a dirty burger.'""

I have never uttered the phrase ""getting a dirty \_\_insert food\_\_, want anything"" in my life. This asshole is just covering her ass."
MasterChef,Well if your food can look back at you or smack you cause it’s still alive......
MasterChef,[deleted]
MasterChef,"That's the impression I got from the article - she said she just meant it like ""street food."" 

Glad that people are out for her head because she just used slang. Very reasonable. /s"
MasterChef,"Yup, it doesn't actually mean dirty it's just an expression of eating something that's a bit naughty/cheeky."
MasterChef,"I don't know about UK, but I've heard it used in Canada and the US. We have street vendors that sell bacon wrapped hot dogs and we call them 'dirty dogs'. It's just the way you describe street food made in a cart or truck that goes for flavor over pretentiousness. There's other foods like 'dirty martini' of course. And restaurants literally [named Dirty Food](https://www.dirtyfoodto.com/)."
MasterChef,"Yeah, usually woke nonsense. Just ctrl-f for 'problematic' and close the tab and do something useful instead."
MasterChef,Nope. You might be thinking of Cajun food.
MasterChef,Social media is always doing that
MasterChef,Same. At least you get a full serving instead of four bites on a white plates with a spoonful of sauce artfully dripped across it.
MasterChef,"Calling that kind of food dirty in the UK is completely culturally appropriate, I'd imagine most people upset by this are from the US applying their own cultural standards to everyone else"
MasterChef,"We use that phrase a lot in the UK to refer to food that is high in calorific content, not exactly good for you but perfect after a night out or when you are just in the mood for some greasy, unhealthy food.

'Dirty' burger, 'dirty' kebab'.. commonly used phrases that have no racial connotations whatsoever."
MasterChef,I've definitely said I'm getting a dirty burger or the like before.
MasterChef,"I mean it’s a UK saying, not a Texas thing. You’ve never dined at a “hole in the wall” place?"
MasterChef,"Oh, well I have. It’s pretty common actually lol"
MasterChef,Good for you I guess? That doesn't stop it from being a common phrase
MasterChef,Americans assuming their cultural norms are global is just fucking excellent
MasterChef,"It's almost like the person in question is from a different country than you are, which they are. you dingus"
MasterChef,Ok? Me and everyone I know have. There’s literally a restaurant down the road from me called dirty burger
MasterChef,"You're not a fan of Cajun food I guess, your loss."
MasterChef,"I'm sure a lot of line cooks wouldn't consider the term ""dirty burg"" bad at all. It's a US thing too, ""dirty"" is like a replacement for greasy these days. Why would someone request literally dirty food? If someone on a food show is asking for dirty food I don't think it should be seen as anything more than asking for a greasy street or mom n pop type food."
MasterChef,"Lmao, I only know that Trailer Park Boys had a burger food truck called Dirty Burger"
MasterChef,"... and in Toronto we refer to our hot dog vendors as ""street meat."""
MasterChef,Thanks Norm
MasterChef,"I can see why some people would be insulted by just calling Asian food in general ""street food"" and implying it's all low class or unrefined. 

There is a long tradition fine dining in Chinese cuisine, she doesn't need to ""refine"" it. I think there's a desire by some Asian chefs for people to stop seeing their food traditions as on the same tier as dirty or greasy street food. It's an overly simplistic generalization that doesn't do justice to the diversity of Chinese food. It'd be better if she clarifies it's a refinement of cheap Chinese take-out instead of just saying Asian food."
MasterChef,I'm getting downvoted coz no one's heard of Cajun Dirty Rice ? You bunch of ignoramuses.
MasterChef,[deleted]
MasterChef,Ride the wave of outrage to the promised land of feeling relevant!
MasterChef,the us does love imposing their standards on everyone
MasterChef,"Thank you for the explanation, although I don't imagine the downvote brigade was all British"
MasterChef,americans do it a bunch
MasterChef,Is the cajun food you eat particularly dirty?
MasterChef,"She's a Masterchef contestent she absolutely does need to refine the dishes she cooks. How would she be showing that she has the potential to be a world renowned chef by doing a traditional dish the same way 10,000s of chefs in China could?

Normal dishes cooked in a typical way are not Michelin star worthy, nor should they be."
MasterChef,Yeah because Cajun food is massive in the UK; definitely what they were thinking of!
MasterChef,It’s not gonna go awhile anytime soon. I’ve honestly hated cancel culture for awhile
MasterChef,In the end it’s just angry mob mentality and which lead to them always looking for a fight to keep that feeling of relevance
MasterChef,"Pfff, ISO and SI all the way"
MasterChef,"You think 29 downvotes on r/television over you posting a lengthy comment being wrong about common british slang is ""brigading""?

No, they didn't all get funneled here from r/HitokirivaderHate, they just thought you sounded dumb.

Honestly, I think that there's already too much of a response being given to this nonsense.  It's like if one journalist got upset over someone saying ""I'm feeling blue"" is insensitive outside of smurf culture.  It's one twit being upset because they're job is to be upset."
MasterChef,Are they ever not doing it?
MasterChef,I just looked up the recipes for Dirty Rice and a Dirty Martini and neither recipe calls for dirt.
MasterChef,"Not the same way 10,000s chefs in China would do it but how three Michelin star chef [Zhang Yong's Xin Rong Ji](https://tastytrip.com/en/xinrongji2020/) does it or how [these two Michelin star winning food stalls in Singapore](https://www.foodandwine.com/travel/singapore-hawker-stands-michelin-stars-where%3famp=true) does it. That's literally Michelin stars street food right there done using standard traditional recipes. No flashy gimmicks or high prices, only top quality skill and ingredients.

These traditional recipes can still be award winning if done right. You can still innovate and add your spin to it while still respecting tradition. When people talk about sushi or pasta or French cuisine they are often much more respectful to culinary tradition but they don't show the same respect to Chinese cuisine. I think that's what bug some Chinese chefs, that she seems to have only a very surface level understanding about Chinese food traditions."
MasterChef,"Except that these ""Michelin"" star chefs basically go to other countries to steal their recipe and flavors and call it their own. But I guess that's UK for you,  take another's countries cooking and calls it their own"
MasterChef,ISo and SI ?
MasterChef,"Look, I was just surprised because in my nearly 8 years of using Reddit it suddenly became my most downvoted comment by far. Looks like I was unaware of some UK colloquialism in this case, but my comment was on her 9-word non-apology after claiming that she was completely unaware of a genuine issue that Asian Americans experience and long talked about before this chef hit the news, issues that spiked up dramatically this year along with hate crimes against Asians and the Asian American food industry, things I've personally experienced. So even if this chef meant no offense, her apology felt half-assed and only made her situation worse, and no one here but /u/Haslinhezl was making it clear why they disapproved of my issue with her apology."
MasterChef,"even the most left wing americans are still bloody cultural imperialist's.

and its weird they focus on minor non harmful things and ignore cultures that have so much fucked up shit"
MasterChef,You can get them dirt cheap in some places
MasterChef,"And you think they cook the exact same dishes as a typical food stall with no refinement? The first article talks even about how the restaurants put a twist on traditional foods by cooking them in non-standard ways.

You don't think they refine pasta dishes in top restaurants? That you get the same pasta served the same way from a bowl from a street vendor that you get in a £50 a course fine dining restaurant?"
MasterChef,"the tomato comes from the new world
noodles came from china.

both things are a major part of Italian cooking.

thats literally how food culture fucking works
shit gets passed around"
MasterChef,"Yeah! Everyone should just cook cuisine from their ethnicity! 

/s"
MasterChef,"So they should not use potatoes, sweetcorn, squashes, chillis, vanilla, turkey, chocolate, beans, peppers, pineapples etc. 

Get real"
MasterChef,For what it's worth I believe that the production crew eats most of the food.
MasterChef,A supermarket probably wastes significantly more food at least in the US. Usually crew can take whatever at the end of the day on these shows and these shows have big crews.
MasterChef,"Are you new to the food industry or something? Do you think food taken back at restaurants is fed to someone else every single time?

Also I would say if your food is garbage, you wasted it rather than the person who didn't want to eat it. It's bizarre and nitpicky to choose this of all things to get upset over when it comes to wasting food. Also most uneaten food goes to the crew anyway. It's hardly wasteful, you're just singling out when the food is thrown away rather than when it's fed to others."
MasterChef,"I understand the issue you have with food waste, though I'm doubtful that's a concern of theirs. If you wanted see changes, you could possibly tweet at them and Gordon? Personally it doesn't bother me but I can see why that would frustrate other, more conscientious viewers."
MasterChef,I hated that egg challenge simply because what they think is enjoyable and a perfectly white egg isn't appealing to everyone.
MasterChef,"That doesn’t sound like the point of Masterchef either. In the U.K. at least, it’s just about making the nicest plate of food, the combinations and skills.

Frying as many eggs as possible is like a game show task."
MasterChef,"Lol, I always had a bad taste in my mouth from Joe, because he did that so often. Yet this past season where he comes back....not one dish thrown in the garbage. Someone must have said something to him....perhaps mom."
MasterChef,"Masterchef US lost me when they had a fucking scrambled eggs challenge. It's Masterchef, it's implied everyone can make scrambled fucking eggs. Watch Masterchef Australia instead. The cooking is on another level, the contestants aren't just there to be personalities and the challenges are actually tests of skill."
MasterChef,"Just think about Iron Chef, too - so many ingredients available and chopped and cooked to make just a few plates (I know it's not just the 4 we see) - food waste doesn't bother Americans...we tend to have the opposite issue!"
MasterChef,"If it's a union crew, they have their own crafts service."
MasterChef,At least the good stuff. Some of the stuff those chefs cook deserves to be in the trash.
MasterChef,"The extra stuff can be used though, & plated extras-the crew get-different from actually throwing something in the garbage."
MasterChef,"The ""there's no prize"" comment is absurd. The Most popular show in the UK is 'The Great British Baking Show"" or whatever its called, and it literally has no prize except a cheap looking trophy. No money. No promise of their own show or cookbook. But the winner's go on to make a name for themselves. Thats the same for this show. The chef that wins will be known and recognized by the world's greatest chefs and food critics. In the Chef world, that's gold. 

And I REALLY resent this show being compared to Masterchef or some drama filled show like hells kitchen. Those shows feature amateur chefs, while this show features professionals, some with Michelin stars. No one wants to watch Michelim starred chefs bickering. We want to watch them cook.

Anyways, I love this show. Already on the Italy episode :)"
MasterChef,Personally I found the show good but the host needs to be replaced.  He’s emotionless and has an irritating voice. In my opinion at least. 
MasterChef,">This brand-new culinary competition takes place in a soundstage on a spaceship that hovers above earth: sometimes over cities at twilight, and sometimes over the entire planet. At least, that’s what the giant wrap-around LED backdrop makes it look like.

Yes, the set is gorgeous. The lighting and camera work give a refined, classic look to the show. Even during the cuts to local areas and personal backgrounds, the cinematography retains the elegance of the studio scenes. I don't understand this person's objections at all. 

>Yet it’s hard to shake how much this casting and format comes across as a transparent Netflix mandate: *Make the show interesting to watch in other countries so more people will subscribe.* 

This is problematic why? Seeing people from other cultures is precisely what international cuisine is about! It's one of the unique strengths of modern culinary competitions, so leveraging that to *make the show interesting to watch* is a really good idea! 

>It's so long. 

There's so many chefs and so much going on in the kitchen that obviously it can't be condensed into 22 minutes. It seems like this critic doesn't care about the food at all. Is their attention span too poor to enjoy a longer cooking show without ad breaks to let them look at their phone?

>Lack of drama. 

I don't want divas in my kitchen shows. I come for the professionals who can do things I'd never even dreamed of, and I enjoy seeing them act professionally when pitted against one another. I suppose that's a personal taste, but the shouting and crying you get on some other cooking shows is a major turnoff for me. 

>The host. 

I admit, the host is lacklustre. I miss Alton Brown's piercing commentary. I think Iron Chef Gauntlet, which had Brown as commentary and judge, was perfect. But with such great chefs, merely adequate commentary is not enough to put me off of the show. 

>There's no prize. 

So what? The chefs are sincerely trying, so who cares if they get a million bucks or not? There's professional credibility on the line, and none of the contestants hold back, so the show does just fine without a concrete award at the end. 

tl;dr - this critic is a peasant with a provincial, proletariat palate. I'm enjoying The Final Table a lot. "
MasterChef,"Masterchef? These are James Beard and Michelin Star quality chefs, not home cooks. "
MasterChef,"Does anyone know if this was filmed in one day? First, their clothes never change until ep. 5 (I watched up to this.), second, the contestants look increasingly tired as the show goes on. "
MasterChef,I hated the finale. No disrespect to the winner. It just didn’t seem like his dish was the best. But well we’re not there to taste so maybe I am wrong. 
MasterChef,I do not like they way this reviewer writes
MasterChef,MasterChef US or MC UK or MC Australia? Because one is crap and another was nominated for an International Emmy and influenced the GBBO.
MasterChef,Was anyone else pissed off when they kicked shin and Ronald because the judge didn’t like the presentation but enjoyed the plate.
MasterChef,"Just finished the series. Overall it's good but the set is too unnecessarily extravagant and distracting at times. It would be been better without the crazy light show, elevating judging panel, annoying host and audience. "
MasterChef,"Omg. Within 10 minutes I can tell this show is a joke. No pinache, no draw, heavily scripted and very poorly executed. Is this created by American Ninja Warrior people? Lame on the highest of levels. "
MasterChef,"Yeah, crazy right? Only the time allotted to cook mounts up to 20h. They couldn’t have worked 20h+ straight though..."
MasterChef,"I’m watching it now and the host is so obnoxious, and his voice isn’t suited to hosting. Otherwise it’s a great show! It’s a shame, the host is so boring"
MasterChef,[removed]
MasterChef,">Those shows feature amateur chefs, while this show features professionals

This is the key. You're spot on. Hell's Kitchen contestants are basically line cooks from middle America. MasterChef contestants are all home cooks. The contestants on The Final Table are actually chefs. Real, professional, industry-respected, trained culinary artists. They are on a completely different level."
MasterChef,"Super old post, but what did you think of the eventual winner? Well deserved or no? It’s hard to compare dishes with editing and different technique "
MasterChef,[deleted]
MasterChef,Same - he didn't make the show feel welcoming at all. 
MasterChef,I agree! Everything else about the show is wonderful but the host needs to change his way of presenting or be replaced. 
MasterChef,"At first I thought cringy 100%, now I've finished the season I think he's Annoying. It's his attitude, you can't hide something that's from the bottom of your self of how you treat people other times outside of the show. Just guessing that has something to do with his food critique editor job. I really disliked the way he questioned things or his terrible jokes wanna-bes...snobby aggressive irritating.

In the last few episodes I am not sure if it's true but I saw team Timothy and Darren, especially Darren was getting impatient whenever the host approached and you could feel they noticed that too and weren't enjoying the host much."
MasterChef,Yes agreed. I don’t know how he possibly got this job.
MasterChef,"He just keep repeating the same things whit a rather annoying voice.
Can't stand hin"
MasterChef,I completely agree with your counter argument to the critic’s review. I think what I enjoy the most out of the show is that there is no drama. Everyone is polite and professional. 
Humans,"> Italy’s 2,500 dubbing industry workers are on a protracted strike demanding higher wages, less frenzied work conditions, and protection against digital dubbing devices, which they claim threaten their jobs.


> The country’s unions representing Italian voice actors and dubbing directors have been on the war path since Feb. 21. On Tuesday they announced the strike will continue for at least another week.


> The unions are demanding that standard contract wages that have remained unvaried for the past 15 years be raised. But they are also clamoring for the right to be able to work at a slower pace, claiming that “current production rhythms are not conducive to [good] quality of work and of life,” according to a statement issued by Italian dubbers’ union ANAD. 


For people who might be wondering about 'Andor' thumbnail..


> Bianchi, a voice actor, is the regular Italian voice of international stars including Stellan Skarsgård. He most recently featured in the “Star Wars” series “Andor.” Bianchi said the time crunch prompted by more Hollywood movies going out day-and-date along with the increase in product that needs to be dubbed for the Italian market have been causing “an insane work rhythm where it’s impossible to maintain our quality standards that have been steadily deteriorating for a long time.”


> Italy, where local audiences until recently rejected subtitles en masse, “once stood out around the world for the level of excellence of its dubbing quality,” said Bianchi who as a dubbing director recently oversaw the Italian version of Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans.” “We want to work better, with more time at our disposal,” he noted."
Humans,"A few years and AI will be able to completely translate movies with the voice of original actors. Good luck fighting for higher salary against a cheaper and more reliable option.

One of the first casualilty, AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore."
Humans,"They haven't seen anything yet, with deepfake video/audio technology, in 10\~20 years you will have on demand dubbing in actors voices and with lip-syncing."
Humans,"This will be a hard fight for them, Italians speak with their hands too."
Humans,"I’m not very optimistic on this issue. The Luddite movement wasn’t able to secure any kind of job security, this won’t be any different."
Humans,Is the tech good enough to replace them yet? I was under the impression it was close but not quite there yet.
Humans,"I’m gonna leave this here:

https://youtu.be/YajBa5PO1Hk

Why Obsidian uses AI voices for game development



This is terrifying"
Humans,AI making music. AI making posters. AI doing translations. It does seem like AI could end up taking over everything. Does that really benefit humans though? Maybe the rich executives. But everyone else? It seems like there should be limits on this.
Humans,"Saw some article the other day taking about AI screenwriting, but AI can't generate ideas. To me, this is the real threat to writers - all of the non glamorous, non creative work. The day jobs. And not just for writers either, there are going to be hundreds of people who get put out of work because the computer can do it now. What will a day job look like in the future? Will everyone even be able to get one?"
Humans,"That's just the direction we are going though. Why would I want to pay someone for one job when I can buy a program and have it do all types of jobs for me forever? 

Imagine how much we could get done. 3D printing for construction, automated vehicles, ai for education and a wide range of other things. 

Honestly there's no turning back."
Humans,"We need to start enacting some form of measures to protect jobs regardless of how good AI is at doing them. I’m in support of protests like these. So long as we’re going to live in a capitalist world and jobs are going to be necessary, we need to take steps to protect them. People think AI taking jobs will happen slowly and will be resolved by it miraculously creating new jobs. This is only somewhat true. It will create *some* new jobs, but overwhelmingly it will delete entire career paths and this threatens to *massively* destabilize global economy. Companies and governments need to start enacting policies to protect those jobs or OTHERWISE abandon a capitalist system and start developing an infrastructure that can support people who can not work because of their job being replaced"
Humans,"Oh wow, it’s almost like AI has no place in creative fields and will only realistically be used to screw over actually talented *people* because it’s cheaper.

What a goddamn surprise."
Humans,"Yeah idk if not working is the solution to stop something that’s taking their jobs. But I side with the dubbers. It’s inevitable that studios will choose the cheaper option, but the use of AI needs legislation and fast. Either through taxation or general devaluing if AI is involved, something like a limiting MSRP on AI involvement, the free market never corrects things for the betterment of the disenfranchised. If it’s cheaper to produce, it should be cheaper to consume."
Humans,"And typesetters lost their minds when digital printing gutted the industry. 

Good luck with that boys, you're better off looking for your next career than chasing the scraps of the last one."
Humans,Video killed the radio star...
Humans,"It sucks, I hate that AI just happened and all of sudden millions of people’s jobs are threatened. We need legislation to protect workers from AI and to limit the reach of AI products. Otherwise we’re going to lose a lot of potential creatives who are going to give up before they even start."
Humans,I remember when I heard the story of elevator operators going on strike when the automatic elevator with buttons was invented and being installed in select places. Going in strike like this might make their jobs more obsolete
Humans,We live in a dystopia without all the cool blue/pink neon lights.
Humans,The dubbing industry sounds like they are reading actuarial tables. I would rather just read the closed captioning than listen to the dubbers deliver the lines without any emotion.
Humans,I’m just excited for AI to start impacting r/Antiwork
Humans,"It’s shocking people only discussing this now, this has been a long time coming as we have seen automation take over. But I guess those in the creative industries thought they would be immune and didn’t care. Now it’s too late and their loosing their jobs"
Humans,The fuck does Diego Luna have to do with this
Humans,Time to adapt.
Humans,this is the exact reason why big studio prefer robots
Humans,"i kind of feel this is like mathematicians going on strike because someone invented the calculator, ai is a tool, not a replacement, and at the end of the day the world doesn't give a shit if ur out of a job if it means easier and more effective means of getting shit done, dont get upset because the world is changing and you are becoming obsolete, adapt or die its simple evolution"
Humans,"There goong to be jobs replaced by AI, that just what it is."
Humans,"It's the cotton gin all over again.

If it's crested by humans, it's human."
Humans,As someone who is Italian and has worked in the Italian dubbing industry: they are pathetic. Hope they'll start looking into new careers :)
Humans,VO actors go on strike against AI? Sounds like a perfect time to double down on AI!
Humans,"Hey guys, if you really want to see and hear something more interesting Italian or want to create italian video by using dubbing software use https://wavel.ai/solutions/dubbing/"

I don't care how good the AI gets, as a human I want to see and listen to other humans. I crave human connection, and I want humans to tell me their stories and feelings through media.

Humans,So It sounds like automation can help lighten the load so they don’t work as much?
Humans,"Who cares. Italians, just use subtitles like normal people"
Humans,"There are already demos out there of software that can not only output text in the original actors’s voice but also change lip movement to match.  In ten years, dubbing will likely be a dead occupation."
Humans,"A lot of streaming services already use machine translations for subtitles, and the result is often absolute trash; sloppy, mistranslations and mixing up words, direct translation of idioms, etc.  
  
Just yesterday I saw one show on D+ translate ""headshot"" into the ""shot in the head"" meaning rather than the ""photography used in the entertainment business"" meaning, saying a guy had shot his cat in the head many times (""he has many headshots of his cat""), which changed the tone of the scene rather drastically."
Humans,"Yep. I'm a writer for a fortune 50 and pump out press releases, been doing it for ten years now. If I'm already testing AI to make by own job easier, you can bet your ass that my days are numbered.

Humans,"It can't match human quality, but it's decent enough in many cases that bottom-line companies will go with that since it's vastly faster and cheaper. 

If you read ""AI""-translated stuff, it's generally about ~~80%~~ 90% ~~indistinguishable~~ raises no eyebrows, 9% correct but reads a little weird, and 1% things that are just not accurate or that haven't translated properly. For an exec or someone who is more concerned with the bottom line than conveying the spirit of the text, that's usually good enough. The problem then becomes, are enough people willing to pay for that extra level of quality to sustain an industry? The programs are being trained on the work of translators, but those translators are not seeing economic benefit from it. They are, in a sense, competing with their past work in a system where the bottom line is all-too-frequently the final word.

Economic concerns aside, the real killer is that iterative learning will always (at least so far as I've seen) favor textual fidelity over the voice of the text, and doesn't have the ability to make executive decisions based on outside knowledge. One of the benefits of a really good translator is that they understand the stuff that isn't being said, the metatext of language that accompanies and accentuates our diction and syntax. For example, *Les Misérables* (which has been translated into English at least 4 times, and possibly as many as 8 depending on how derivative a work can be before being considered its own translation) was written in the vernacular French of the mid-19th century. Victor Hugo was intentionally writing for a universal audience, but by modern standards his prose would be considered significantly elevated (in no small part because the style of writing he used became seen as respectable thanks to his work). One issue that translators have grappled with is, where do you split that difference? (Notably, Hugo hated the first (Wilbur) translation of the novel, he is reported to have declared upon reading it that ""translation is censorship."")

Of the translations, the three I want to look at are Norman Denny (1976), Julie Rose (2007), and Christine Donougher (2013). These are generally agreed to be the best available (fun fact, an 1863 edition had the anti-slavery parts excised so it could be sold to Confederate soldiers during the Civil War!) and anyone looking to read Les Mis in English is generally steered towards one of them. (Maybe less so Denny these days, but of the 20th-century translations his is the best-regarded)

However, they have vastly different approaches to the language and structure of the story. Denny chose to make editorial alterations to language and remove parts he considered irrelevant to the overall story being told, an interesting choice considering Victor Hugo's insistence upon the importance of his digressions. He favored an ""old-feeling"" voice, to make the novel feel its age. [The opening page as per Denny, including a somewhat representative phrase:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-denny-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was said of him that his father, intending him to inherit his office, had arranged for him to marry at a very early age, about eighteen or twenty, following the custom that was fairly widespread in parliamentary families.""

Rose, by contrast, kept everything in but ""modernized"" the language, stating that she wanted it to feel to a reader like they were relating to the text in the same way that a 19th-century French reader would have. [Her first page, with the same line quoted below:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-rose-les-miserables-1.png)

>They reckoned his father had put him down to inherit his position and so had married him off very early in the piece when he was only eighteen or twenty, as they used to do quite a lot in parliamentary families.

Donougher seeks to find a middle ground, updating the cadence to be accessible to readers without using the same level of explicitly modern language. [Her introduction to the bishop, and that same line:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-donougher-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was reported that his father, intending that his son should inherit his position, had married him off very young, aged eighteen or twenty, a fairly common practice among parliamentary families.

The same information is being conveyed in all three of these, but the voice of the translator is evident.

Now, imagine you want to do an ""AI""-driven translation of Les Mis. How on earth do you begin to parse this? Do you train it exclusively on French from the 19th century? Exclusively on Hugo? Do you feed it every Les Mis translation we have, or the collected works of a single translator? Issues of ownership aside (and I would argue that any translator would have very solid grounds for legal action if their translations were used to create a new translation that did not include them in profit-sharing), the voices are not just divergent, but actively trying to do different things, and no program can even come close to matching that."
Humans,"I don't think it's there yet for dubbing, because you need to also match the other person's lip movements.

But it's just a matter of time."
Humans,Well there’s this thing called “precaution”.
Humans,decide for yourself: https://twitter.com/zachsilberberg/status/1626665046175539224
Humans,"It's depressing because instead of being democratic and making all of our lives easier, AI seems to already be going to direction of empowering corporations over people and fortifying their grip on people's time and labor.

Time is the most valuable resource any of us have, and yet the vast majority of people have been losing it while the elite few reap the value of that time, turning it into more money than they could spend in many life times."
Humans,"Terrifying? More like fascinating.

They use it in the stage of the game where it would be economically impossible to use real voice actors. When you are creating the dialogues and doing tons of re-writes and all kinds of changes... you cannot have the whole cast of VAs behind your back reading the lines. But now with AI the writer can actually hear what they are writing with the correct expression and emotion.

Also, it's fascinating that the AI voice company in the video chose a route that still gets the VAs involved paid. Noone is losing anything in this scenario. Only gaining."
Humans,Why is this terrifying? It doesn’t seem like a bad thing to me.
Humans,"i think it sounds like shit, honestly. if i had heard it without knowing what it was, i would be remarking on how crap these voice actors are."
Humans,It would benefit humanity if we change our economic system.
Humans,"Not trying to be glib, but who do you think will be using/purchasing it? It will probably take over some areas because it will be in demand. If people mostly decide to not consume it, then it won't."

Humans,"I don't think I'd want to watch an AI created series even if it's good. Who knows though, maybe that will change. I wouldn't want to buy AI artwork either because it loses all appeal to me. Maybe as a wallpaper but that's about it.

Wonder if that will be the popular opinion going forward or not."
Humans,"> AI can't generate ideas 
 
People used to say ""AI can't draw like a human"" and see where we are now."
Humans,Then there will be no use for humans and it will kill us off
Humans,"Fully agree. All techbros can say is just ""lmao just stop doing your obsolete job and get a better one"" but HOW are THOUSANDS of people going to, what, become programmers and nurses? This is absolutely ridiculous."
Humans,"Good luck with that. 

The advent of useful AI systems is no different than the mass adoption of the internet. It will be disruptive, some people will lose their jobs, but entire new industries will arise that nobody has yet even conceived. 

The sun will rise in the east, babies will be born, things will go on."
Humans,Ai creative writing continues to be disappointing and soulless. The only worry I have is if people fall for the astroturf and fake pr campaigns that accompanies the shitty writing.
Humans,"I can’t believe that in the first year of having AI, the main things I’ve heard it threatening are artistic fields… art, music etc… the one thing that I thought wouldn’t be able to be emulated by a robot.    
Where are the robots taking real estate, banking, finance, law and management jobs!"
Humans,"it's pretty much already too later. There's a ton of communities generating thousands if millions of high quality AI art. and it's only getting better. it really does suck.

one thing though is that it does have to learn styles and you can tell a ton of it is pulling heavily from just a few dozen or less styles. Like a ton of it just seems like it's drawn by the same person.

And even when you take AI out of the equation, Chinese ""artists"" have been tracing real artists for decades and selling it as original art. They for example, will trace art of Sailor Moon and change the hair to make it look like Misty from Pokemon and copy the painting style and then make 5+ variants of that artwork with Misty in different stages of undress.

But then thing is they do this in a sweat shop type setting where they have dozens of people churning out these traced drawings every month and they're all pretending to be one person, typically a pretending to be a girl to get more willing supporters that'll pay ""her"" a lot of money because they know people are more likely donate to a female artist than a male artist who draws quality NSFW art.

It's no different from the AI art. AI makes it worse, maybe...I'm sure there are people selling AI art as if they're making it themselves, but it'd be pretty impossible to fool other people who just use it as a hobby, which a lot of these communities do. From what I've seen, they like using it make stuff they want to see...which might seem obvious, but most don't seem to be using it for any business reasons. Seems to be a lot of it's done for a laugh and...of course...porn. Some really questionable porn (as in deep fake type of stuff where they have the AI make nude paintings of celebrities) and less questionable, of their favorite cartoon characters. 


It's probably really gonna suck in like 10 years when people can more easily do it. Right now, installing that stuff and figuring out how to run it is hard for the average person, so you have to spend money monthly using websites or use free websites that do it for you, but they're limited.

Eventually one of these people is gonna make a user friendly version...maybe...they seem to be completely unable or unwilling to do that which might be for the better I guess...and a lot of the people who like to post AI art that ""they create"" are unwilling to share how they create it because they want to remain unique and special. If everyone starts ""making"" AI art, they wont feel special anymore. So it's being held back to some extent at least...but...yeah, it's already at a point where it makes really great looking images and wide spread."
Humans,"Every company activity needs to have an average monetary value attached to it equivalent to the monetary cost of having a skilled human do the same task.

Humans,"I see the exact opposite. AI creating content as good as, or better, that a lot of people can use/consume and thus improve their situations/realities. We just need to relocate people that have their jobs immediately replaced, they will benefit from it too.

And do what with that information?"
Humans,"That's been happening for several year now, but not for the purpose of helping dub studios. It's because streamers tend to launch titles globally all at once, and strive to have all the dubs ready at title launch. Whereas in the olden days, you could spread out the dubbing work because regional launches were on different time frames."
Humans,"Sounds like they just need to be okay with distributing subtitled versions day-and-date and releasing the dubs later, when they're ready.

Of course, that still poses a challenge for localization and subtitling teams..."
Humans,Film production doesn't work like that and rarely will
Humans,How did you manage to fit that many grammatical into this short of a sentence?
Humans,"It could, but we live under capitalism, where automation is used to help the bottom line of the owners."
Humans,"I'm afraid it's going to be much sooner than that but that's definitely a safe guess. We'll also have CGI indistinguishable from reality.

H,"Series creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted M*A*S*H broadcast without a laugh track. Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. ""We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,"" said Gelbart in 1998. ""It's hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody's guts being sewn up.""

Seasons 1–5 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6–11 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (""O.R."", ""The Bus"", ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"", ""The Interview"", ""Point of View"", and ""Dreams"" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen""."
H,"It's helped by the fact that it wasn't really filmed with pauses for laughter. That's what makes clipes like the ones that remove the laughter from The Big Bang Theory or Friends so cringy, the actors are doing their scene, not waiting for the audience."

H,"Still one of the best shows I've ever seen and often the first il recommend to ppl. Me and my father watched reruns for years as I grew up, and it'll be something I show my kids one day"
H,My father named me after a character on this show.
H,Watched the show for the first time last year and other than a few things it holds up really well. I think the middle seasons are probably the best ones.
H,Ah Bach!
H,"I prefer Trapper John, MD"
H,I still find it weird that the US version of the show seems to have a laughter track
H,"Really amazing TV show. You can watch it on Hulu now. On the positive side, they remastered all of the episodes, and they look amazing. On the negative side, they changed the aspect ratio, and cropped the top and the bottom of the picture, so they’re unwatchable to me. Fortunately, I still have my DVDs which maintain the original aspect ratio so there’s nothing lost."
H,"Hey Frank, why don’t you pull yourself up by your own jock strap!"
H,"I really liked the experimental episodes like 'A War for All Seasons' which covers the events of an entire year in just one episode. """"Here's to the New Year: May she be a damned sight better than the old one, and may we all be home before she's over...""

or the 'Point of View' episode"
H,SUicide is painless
H,I’ll say it - set in Korea but about Vietnam. An extended apologia for US complicity in Asia.
H,I never found it funny. Always felt it was dated in its approach to humour
H,"The final episode broke me, and made us see the horrors of war through Hawkeye’s therapy with psychiatrist, Sydney. He recalled the time their bus picked up some South Korean refugees, and then some wounded soldiers who had information about an enemy patrol on the move nearby. The bus pulled off the road into a grove of bushes, and everyone is told to stay completely quiet to avoid being spotted by the NK. One local woman carried a live chicken that started clucking. Hawkeye, quietly but angrily, told her to “keep that damned chicken quiet!” And she quiets it, but … damn, that scene still haunts me."
H,Wow what a rough headline.
H,I watch this show almost every time I visit my dad.  Grew up watching reruns.  Great show except for the laugh track.
Unsolved Mysteries,"I think the original Unsolved Mysteries had a general air about it that ""this is a mystery that urgently needs solving, please help"", while a lot of modern true crime shows are ""this is a mystery that happened and ended brutally, how could someone do this."" I mean a lot of true crime stuff these days is already solved so it's more of a sort of psychological spectacle of a criminal mind, whereas the original UM was more like ""help us solve this."" Not to mention plenty of the original show wasn't even really true crime, a lot of it involved ""this old man died and wants his closest relative to inherit his will but it's 1989 so we don't know who that closest relative *is*"". Also all the supernatural stuff.

Also there's just something way more thrilling about watching Unsolved Mysteries and hearing ""UPDATE"". Also I'd like to say that they apparently do regularly add ""UPDATES"" to the syndicated version of the show. I was watching one episode a year or two ago and the UPDATE was for something that had happened *a month earlier*. So they still update the show when there's something to say even into 2020 or so! 

But anyway other true crime shows, like I said, often they're already solved anyway so you don't get the interest of seeing a case presented on a show from 35 years ago get an UPDATE."
Unsolved Mysteries,"I think it's the multiple stories in an episode. You can go into as much detail as a story needs without dragging it out. There's also something so charming about the reenactments, like, they're dated sure, but the show was low enough budget and they used so much of what was around them that it looks like a genuine glimpse into another time."
Unsolved Mysteries,Better? Child me would get scared shitless at the “update” banner they had for some stories 😅
Unsolved Mysteries,Because no drones existed for long fucking pan shots.
Unsolved Mysteries,"I love the original 1987-2003 UM, and it’s one of my favorite shows, reminds me of my childhood, and is a large influence on why i love true crime. 

I think 3 things really made UM great. 

1. Robert Stack was a great narrator/figurehead for the show. His voice was raspy and his presentation was great. He said enough to properly narrate while blending in the segments and interviews. They also filmed his lead-ins or narrations in creepy locations like foggy woods or darkly lit temples to heighten the creepy factor.

2. The music. That theme is iconic, and most Americans raised between 1975-1995 know it. As a child, whenever I heard that theme, I knew to leave the room or I would have nightmares. The show also had iconic bumper music for things like updates and even sometimes, they would score certain key scenes in re-enactments with music cues like a synth pulse or bass when something happened (someone got stabbed, the camera cuts to the killer at the scene). It drew your attention, but also scared the shit out of you too. 

3. The re-enactments and cinematography were almost news broadcast like (despite the show having a disclaimer it was NOT a news broadcast). They were not quite film quality, but rather grainy especially the early seasons. An underrated but hella creepy thing they did was often tilt the camera shot during certain parts of re-enactments or zoom in on mugshots/composite sketches. It just made the re-enactments that more unsettling especially when coupled with the music. You didn’t feel like you were watching a movie or tv show when watching UM, but rather a special urgent bulletin or horror movie."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Because True Crime is really, really scraping the bottom of the barrel now.

I'm just not convinced that [this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11324406/) is really interesting enough at base to justify existing.

And for Brits here, [this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22751880/) is just pathetic."
Unsolved Mysteries,"It also had Robert Stack, dude's voice was iconic.

Edit to add: [clip](https://youtu.be/ALFhHF91g9c) from Baseketball, they leave out one part from [the end.](https://youtu.be/esB7WnCY1kk)"
Unsolved Mysteries,"I absolutely loved the original Unsolved Mysteries and will frequently watch episodes on YouTube for comfort.  I've often thought about what the original has and is very much lacking in the newer incarnation.  Here are my thoughts:

1. Unsolved Mysteries needs a narrator. Obviously no one is going to replace Robert Stack, but it needs a host to distinguish it from the hundreds of other true crime shows on ID, Oxygen, etc.

2. Multiple stories per episode. I've seen a few of the new shows and they mostly consist of shitty filler.

3. Proper reenactments. I hate how they present the cases in the new series.

4. Very much a product of the time, but the soundtrack added a lot to original series.

5. Finally, and I'm sure many won't agree, but I would love it if they used grainy film, similar to the original.  I think it would really add a lot to the show's atmosphere and allow it to stand out from the competition.

As it stands, the new series is piss poor and barely memorable. The fact that it calls itself Unsolved Mysteries is a travesty to the original."
Unsolved Mysteries,"This is one of my favorite shows. Robert Stack's voice, the creepy music and the cheesey reenactments are all iconic and I love a good mystery."
Unsolved Mysteries,"I may be the wrong person to ask; I sometimes put classic Unsolved Mysteries on to go to sleep. 

But, I really think you answered your question in your first paragraph. No padding, no experts, good pacing, and Stack’s voice. I would add that when they did have “talking heads”, they were the family and friends who were involved in the original cases, which creates much better emotion. And of course there’s that awesome theme music."
Unsolved Mysteries,OG Unsolved Mysteries was about the facts and trying to solve the case.  The new stuff is all about drama and clickbait to draw in the viewers.  More about getting views and selling adds than it is about being good.
Unsolved Mysteries,91510-1449
Unsolved Mysteries,"The incorporation of true crime, fraudsters, paranormal/unexplained, and updates satiated the hunger for just about everyone. My mom loved it for the true crime, I loved it for the ghost stories."
Unsolved Mysteries,Robert Stack was just on a whole different level. He didn't need all the extra hoopla. His voice is truly 1 in a billion. I could listen to him talking about marshmallow recipes and I'd find nothing more compelling 😂
Unsolved Mysteries,"I feel that Robert Stack had a huge part, he was the perfect narrator for that show. 

It was also great that Unsolved Mysteries didn't only focus  on kidnappings and murders, it was refreshing to know that there were other sorts of mysteries (supernatural, religious, shoot I remember one of them was about a child genius)."
Unsolved Mysteries,[deleted]
Unsolved Mysteries,"If you, or anyone you know has any information regarding this case, please call r/HoffyTheBaker

IMO the dumb paranormal stuff was silly fun couched in between actual stories, and I suspect the writers knew it'd play well for one segment. There were also heartwarming stories of (for instance) foster siblings separated by circumstances being reunited as old people and what not, and then of course the meat was have you seen this person? Typically a bad person, but again they gave enough clues for the the nice stories as well."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Because back then you didn't have the internet or feel like you were connected to the world so closely. You felt more isolated and stuck wherever you lived. Mysteries and folklore went a lot farther when you weren't bombarded by information online 24/7. 

It was a different time."
Unsolved Mysteries,"It wasn't just true crime. It had other unexplained phenomena featured as well. Ghosts, aliens, cryptids, etc and it took it all as seriously as it did the homicides and disappearances. To me that's what sets it apart and elevates it and why I just toss it on on Pluto every so often."
Unsolved Mysteries,"The original UM is amazing and has a lot of diversity in stories. It's also interesing to see how some of the mysteries are solved after the episodes air.

Watching the newer series I saw a lot of suicide cases that people interpreted as murders because ""They would never commit suicide!""."
Unsolved Mysteries,"The great narration and quick pace was compelling. Same reason Forensic Files holds up. 

Some of the current shows drag things out to fill an hour, or in the case of Dateline they'll sometimes go two hours. And then sometimes they'll make a whole limited series out of something that doesn't deserve it, like that Hotel Cecil documentary. 

But there are still some good shows on the air."
Unsolved Mysteries,Because it’s that’s fucking jammer of an intro song.
Unsolved Mysteries,"The worst is when you forget it’s called unsolved mysteries and you get really into a story and then BAM- no resolution, lol. I’d say 80%!of the stories where great but some of them where real snoozefests"
Unsolved Mysteries,I went to kindergarten with a kid whose family was featured on it.
Unsolved Mysteries,"I think Stack's irreplaceable voiceover has a lot to do with it, though I actually like the reboot a lot and I think they made the right call in letting the story tell itself.

Part of it though is that it's just harder to find and present the huge spectrum of horseshit the old show had to work with nowadays - I mean, we know by now she wasn't abducted by aliens, her toothless drunk husband just murdered her - and that means you're stuck trying to find new ways to tell the same few basic stories all the time."
Unsolved Mysteries,Current True Crime shows feel much more melodramatic.
Unsolved Mysteries,Ah...the music and Robert Stack. Scared the shit out of me as a kid but i just loved it to death.
Unsolved Mysteries,There was no streaming. All the great writers worked in movies and TV shows.
Unsolved Mysteries,"There are a few things I feel about this that I believe a true.

1. TV shows in the past had to hold themselves to a higher standard of quality than they do today. It wasn't a guarantee that a show would be successful, so they had to put in a lot of effort to make it interesting, exciting, and keep up the viewership. Viewership. Today, a remake of unsolved mysteries is going to be popular just because it has the name of a previously successful show. Ever notice how some shitty shows are apparently America's number one show suddenly? Today, you can just include a popular celebrity and have enough promotion and air a show on a popular channel, and it's got a guaranteed level of viewership. Television did not have guaranteed viewership. When the original unsolved mysteries was coming out, there was quality or failure.

2. Unsolved mysteries had very little competitors at the time. I believe forensic files was the other big one (which I highly recommend you watch if you've never watched it) and so there wasn't really much of a comparison. Shows today are all trying to keep up the hype and mimic the feeling the previous shows had, but just by copying things you immediately start to lose some of the quality because it's no longer an original idea. 

3. Somewhat similar to the first point, the quality of TV show writing has generally just gone down. Again, it has to do with the lack of need for competitors because some people just get huge budgets for their shows and the success is guaranteed, and even if it's not, there's guaranteed profit for those involved so it doesn't really matter. There is also just a generational gap in what people expect in regards to entertainment, and so today's shows are geared towards modern desires and expectations, while the older shows were geared towards previous expectations and interests. Interests. I'm 30 years old, which makes me young compared to the show, but I still watched it when I was a kid and found it very entertaining. Entertaining. People making shows almost 40 years later are not going to emulate what we found exciting or attention grabbing from back then.

TLDR: quality of shows are generally down, since they don't have to be popular to make money. You can't remake a show and expect it to be as good as the original. Our taste in television has not changed but the design has."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Stack was that show, he was a phenom."
Unsolved Mysteries,I've found that this sort of show has 10 minutes of entertainment cram packed into 45 minutes plus ads.
Unsolved Mysteries,"The original Unsolved Mysteries had that ""America's Most Wanted"" feel to it in that, the purpose was to solve the mysteries but without widespread access like we have now, the show provided that outreach. True Crime shows now are more about ratings and analytics and ""experts"" getting their camera time. I watched the UM reboot and I liked the first season, but I watched some of the latest episodes and it lost me. Particularly the episode where the girl went missing and was found after she was hit by a train a few miles away."
Unsolved Mysteries,"There's been a couple good ones relatively recently, I personally like Joe Kenda: Homicide Detective.  But I don't think TV focuses much effort on true crime anymore because podcast have largely taken over that space."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Effort. They tried to do a good show, they pulled it off."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Because of how verbose, needlessly elaborate the format is now. Unsolved Mysteries was, by comparison, short sweet and to the point while still masterfully adding atmosphere to the stories. Contrast to this parody, and you realize how ridiculously over the top the whole concept is now.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BUrNe3Vhtk

I think Forensic Files is another great example; a murder, a mystery, and a solution, wrapped up in a tight but engaging twenty or so minutes. That, more than UM, really made me realize how needlessly bloated ""true crime"" has gotten now."
Unsolved Mysteries,Audience participation in a way that no modern true crime docuseries even tries to craft.
Unsolved Mysteries,I liked that they had so many stories in each episode.  Now it’s drawn out way too much
Unsolved Mysteries,That show scared me as a kid for some reason.
Unsolved Mysteries,"UM was the scariest thing I watched growing up. There’s a story about a boy, his mother and his grandmother catching a glimpse of a ufo and then growing boils that stuck with me for years."
Unsolved Mysteries,"As good as the original ""Unsolved Mysteries"" tv show is, you should watch COLUMBO with Peter Falk. So much 70's nostalgia."
Unsolved Mysteries,TV shows are shitty now. A lot of effort has been put into making them shitty.
Unsolved Mysteries,"Please list other crime shows it's better than, and other crime shows that it's worse than to back up your 90% claim."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Yeah this was at a time when local police departments had pretty limited reach. Meanwhile everyone in the country was watching the show. So for the first time you had amazing outcomes, with people being found that would never have been otherwise. That creates a pretty amazing cultural impact. Also Robert Stack and the theme music strike such a unique emotional balance. Truly unique across several generations"
Unsolved Mysteries,They updated when they caught the Golden State Killer. I love that they’re still updating the mysteries when they’re solved.
Unsolved Mysteries,"UPDATE: We still have no clue where this fucking guy is.

Gonna have to rewatch Baseketball now, thanks."
Unsolved Mysteries,Yes! The reenactments were so sincerely done on UM. I feel like current true crime shows make the reenactments either intentionally cheesy or just plain bad.
Unsolved Mysteries,It was the update coupled with the creepy ass Casio synth music and the 90s basic ass computer graphics.
Unsolved Mysteries,"Child me got scared shitless at the blue girl ghost turning her head in the opening credits and would always close my eyes at that part.

I REALLY hated when it popped up unexpectedly during a supernatural-only Halloween special =("
Unsolved Mysteries,"They were grainy because in the early seasons the show was shot on film, it looks pretty cheap now but it did give it a more respectable presentation at the time"
Unsolved Mysteries,"The genre is also just super saturated right now. 

Unsolved Mysteries had little real competition aside from news shows like 20/20, Dateline, etc. that all had a very different feel from it.  Now you have all sorts of D-tier networks like Investigation Discovery pumping true crime out around the clock and thousands of podcasts with different levels of amateurishness doing the same."
Unsolved Mysteries,"As someone who’s not really into true crime, but might try it:

If they’re scraping the bottom of the barrel these days, then it’s probably better to watch older true crime, from a few years ago? 

What are some of the best true crime series, from the height of its popularity a few years ago?"
Unsolved Mysteries,"That‘s not true crime though, that‘s drama series based on true stories."
Unsolved Mysteries,Baseketball doesn't get the love it deserves.  That film is comedic gold.
Unsolved Mysteries,"""Open dammit, open!"""
Unsolved Mysteries,There is an Unsolved Mysteries channel on Pluto TV.
Unsolved Mysteries,"You’ve summed up a number of my criticisms with the current iteration. I was so excited for the new reboot and watched season 1, but dear god it has been a massive disappointment. Didn’t finish S2 or even bother with S3. 

I think the fact it went from 4-6 8-10 minute segments to one long form 40+ minute documentary style really hurts it. It’s too documentary style. No i don’t care about what kind of pancakes the victim made on the day of or how their house was a 1890s farmhouse. It just ends up with a lot of irrelevant information and rehashing details over and over again. The old UM, i think because they had to crank out so many segments with quick turnaround really understood how to be succinct and brief but convey enough information to describe a crime and the suspect."
Unsolved Mysteries,"I still watch the new show, but you hit the nail on the head. It misses a lot of what made Unsolved Mysteries special imo."
Unsolved Mysteries,You fall asleep to it? Unsolved Mysteries chills me to the bone in broad daylight.
Unsolved Mysteries,"Winner winner right here.   
Had that as my ringtone years ago."
Unsolved Mysteries,What was the story?
Unsolved Mysteries,Better than anything that HLN/CNN/Investigation Discovery has put out in the last 20 years.
Unsolved Mysteries,The theme music is fantastic
Unsolved Mysteries,Might as well re-watch orgasmo also which is just as ridiculous.
Unsolved Mysteries,I feel as if I have read/seen some actors talk about how they had early gigs doing UM reenactments.
Unsolved Mysteries,"Don't forget that occasional ""grifter"" music that they played usually when someone was swindled. It was basically a saloon piano tune that would play during the reenactment. The synth music could definitely be unnerving though."
Unsolved Mysteries,"The aforementioned original Unsolved Mysteries (which can be seen on PlutoTV and Peacock and even YouTube). 

Forensic Files

Americas Most Wanted (if you can find it?)"
Unsolved Mysteries,I think podcasts are the best way to get into true crime right now. Tv stuff is dramatized now and doesn’t feel true
Unsolved Mysteries,"Have you ever seen Orgazmo? Also Matt and Trey, also hilarious."
Unsolved Mysteries,Right?  That shit used to terrify me as a kid. I could not watch it in the dark back then. I’m not even sure I could watch it in the dark now. Creepy AF.
Unsolved Mysteries,"Yeah, it doesn’t make sense to me either. His voice is just soothing, I guess."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Their first kid died, showed signs of poisoning by antifreeze, mom is convicted of the murder. She gets pregnant during the trial, while imprisoned the second kid is poisoned with the same symptoms, obviously can't be the mom. Turns out both kids had a one in a million genetic defect that looks like antifreeze poisoning but isn't.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Stallings"
Unsolved Mysteries,"Oh I got no problem with that, but Robert Stack isn't in it."
Unsolved Mysteries,One of those was Matthew McConaughey.
Unsolved Mysteries,"I was delighted when, in a mystery that happened in the late 1800s, they overlaid a harmonica cover of one of the usual musical themes. It was very well done!"
Unsolved Mysteries,"I’ll be honest, I think I remember that story! If it wasn’t that one, it was a different antifreeze story."
Unsolved Mysteries,"That poor woman.  Jesus, what a sad story."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Daniel Dae Kim (Lost, 24) also was kind of an extra in one reenactment."
Unsolved Mysteries,"The Midnight Club, Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities, and now another volume of Unsolved Mysteries. Netflix is becoming THE source for spooky October stuff."
Unsolved Mysteries,Finally! I was starting to fear that they canceled the show
Unsolved Mysteries,How are the first 2 seasons?
Unsolved Mysteries,Needs Robert Stack in a trench coat.
Unsolved Mysteries,Gonna need someone to tell me what nine stories are being delved into so I can do some pre reading
Unsolved Mysteries,They just need something for the second week and they got something for each week of the month.
Unsolved Mysteries,"fantastic, but they are much different than when Robert Stack was hosting them. Instead of short multiple episodes, they have 1 hour long episodes that are more in-depth."
Unsolved Mysteries,"The first one is ok.

The second was trash."
Unsolved Mysteries,"I can't really think of another actor who would have the same voice and gravitas, and who would also be willing to do it."
Unsolved Mysteries,Me too. But not too read into the mysteries before watching. There’s just some that freak me out way too much haha.
Unsolved Mysteries,"I remember someone posting about how, out of all the new episodes, the only one that was truly special had to do with UFOs. I haven’t seen the new series but is there a UFO episode and is it actually that great?"
Unsolved Mysteries,Ray Wise is the closest I can think of.
Unsolved Mysteries,Lance Reddick is my go-to pick.
Unsolved Mysteries,"We have the ability to deep fake him, so why not at this point."
Unsolved Mysteries,"I didn't actually think the UFO one was that great aside from an unintentionally hilarious re-enactment, but I thought a couple other episodes were pretty strong."
Unsolved Mysteries,Yes there is a very good episode on a big sighting with multiple witness accounts.
Unsolved Mysteries,"> I haven’t seen the new series but is there a UFO episode and is it actually that great?

It was the worst episode of the entire two seasons..."
Unsolved Mysteries,"Luckily for us, he is willing to do absolutely anything."
Unsolved Mysteries,"I think Dennis Haysbert (Allstate guy, not mayhem) would be good"
Unsolved Mysteries,Because that doesn't come with his voice and gravitas
Unsolved Mysteries,I heard it was the best episode of both seasons….
Unsolved Mysteries,I started watching the series back when it originally aired. So it was nice to get some answers from the creator of the show. If you like classic Leap this is definitely worth watching
Unsolved Mysteries,Great tidbit re: Lee Harvey Oswald I never knew.
Say I Do,I imagine she's not looking forward to spending another 7 months alone in Romania shooting season 2.
Say I Do,"She's not making any friends in the writer's room, I'm sure, but everything quoted in the article about Wednesday is accurate.

The show is infinitely better during the first, Burton episodes, the love triangle is forced and stupid, some of Wednesday's dialogue is completely facile, forced, and out of character."
Say I Do,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

Hell, that is some bad writing, kudos to her for not just going along with it, despite her young age. But now she seems to become the next big thing, so I guess it worked out."
Say I Do,I don't like how much this sounds like the Witcher writing room.
Say I Do,Her criticism about the writing actually reads pretty mild. Sounds like she had to rein some thing in because they just didn't fit right.
Say I Do,Wednesday didn’t feel like the Addams Family. It felt like they used it as a skin to do a typical teen mystery show.
Say I Do,"I thought it was weird that they had a forced love storyline and turned Wednesday into a hero.

In the first episode she dumps piranhas in a pool. She should've stayed chaotic evil."
Say I Do,"Good lord, she's not holding back. It's a shame that the show that got her so popular wasn't as enjoyable to work on as she probably would have hoped. Hopefully her reputation leads to projects she's more passionate about though, because she seems a lot more interested in bigger projects than teen drama, which, y'know, good for her."
Say I Do,"I'm always curious as to why certain shows blow up the way they do. 

I thought Wednesday was pretty average to be honest."
Say I Do,Listening to interviews with her you can tell she’s really into film. If that’s what she wants to do then all the power to her
Say I Do,[deleted]
Say I Do,"It's a real shame this article fails to mention she's been bumped up to executive producer on Season 2, which is a big deal."
Say I Do,It's great to see an actor so aware of the character to help improve the show.  Disappointing that they have to do it secretly.  I imagine The Witcher would be a better show if Henry Cavill's input was taken more seriously than the show runners who don't like the source material.
Say I Do,"I guess she's trying to go the robert pattinson route, the problem is wednesday was way better received than twilight, and she's the sole face of the project. I don't think it will end up going well for her, to be honest."
Say I Do,The writers just wanted to make another 08/15 teen highschool drama out of wednesday.
Say I Do,"Legend. The show needed to end after 1 season, and now it can."
Say I Do,She's probably still pissed at them for making her keep working when she blatantly had COVID and was just just waiting on the test results
Say I Do,"All this ""controversy"" is so cringe. The show isn't a masterpiece, it's a decent tween drama with a solid premise that falls into classic tropes.not only that but it's clear they want to franchise so hard.


An actor is allowed to not love the work they are a part of, and not want to sign on to being a single character for the next 10 years BCS execs want to churn out an endless line of spin offs for an attempt at an infinite money glitch"
Say I Do,"I was so underwhelmed with Wednesday, I was expecting something darker not some teen mystery shit.

I have enjoyed Jennas other work and do look forward to her films."
Say I Do,Talk about confidence. I'd have taken the first offer to be in a Netflix show.
Say I Do,Let’s acknowledge the possibility that this is all just marketing to blur her character and public persona like they did with Aubrey Plaza.
Say I Do,It's so crazy how after hype dies down everyone is so willing to say the show isn't as good as everyone originally tried to make it sound like it was.
Say I Do,"It's unfortunate that her lack of workplace experience is showing in these exchanges. Her popularity exploded thanks to this show, but the public's love is fickle. They don't take kindly when they think you ungrateful.

Jennifer Lawrence learned the hard way that it's a small trip between internet darling to internet boogeyman."
Say I Do,"Given that the WGA are negotiating a new contract and may strike in May, it was incredibly ill advised to make these comments. She may find out sooner rather than later how hard it is to make a tv show without them."
Say I Do,If she didn’t want it to be a hit she shouldn’t have made it better by pushing back against the insipid teen drama shit they were trying to pull off.
Say I Do,I’m sure George Clooney would have preferred Movies as well when cast for E.R.
Say I Do,">“Everything that Wednesday does, everything I had to play, did not make sense for her character at all.""

Netflix writers and not understanding the source material, name a more iconic due."
Say I Do,"TV is such a communal endeavor, and having input from actors on the scripts and their characters is invaluable. Disagreements on creative are going to happen and its good that Jenna had a POV and told the writers as such for the betterment of the series. That being said, dragging the writers and other crew like this in such a public way is really unprofessional and simply unnecessary. Other cast and crew could go their entire lives and never work on a show as popular as Wednesday, and now knowing that the star hates it this much, looks down on it in many ways, and wishes she was doing something else is an unbelievable downer. It's completely fine for Jenna to feel this way, I have no issue with that. But repeatedly discussing it in the press is wrong and ultimately hurtful."
Say I Do,Even Katherine Heigl is rolling her eyes at this one.
Say I Do,Ironically anti-Ortega article that explains why she is right
Say I Do,"Not being successful; that’s a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it plays out for her."
Say I Do,Glad to see people see this show for the overrated teen schlock that it is
Say I Do,Just don’t do season 2 then.
Say I Do,I did not like the show tbh. Didn’t get the hype at all. Just seemed like another angsty teen Netflix show with a recognizable brand and director attached to it.
Say I Do,"Some of these actors are unbelievable. A starring role, millions of dollars and still they are not happy."
Say I Do,"One of the writers is responding to her on Twitter, calling her out. But with the things she said she changed I feel like the only way it will play out is that writer won’t be able to return for next season. She’s much more important to the show and I feel like it was a mistake on his part to respond publicly.

https://imgur.com/a/Fyl5BPS/"
Say I Do,"Oh sure, she hates all the success lol. She’s young and dumb like all of us at that age."
Say I Do,I gotta be honest... I'm a little shocked that the show was as popular as it was. I grew up with the original movies and the cartoons and didn't think it would really be such a hit with the modern crowd.
Say I Do,It’s obvious she’s already over doing scary/horror.
Say I Do,The Honest Trailer for Wednesday really nails this
Say I Do,Jenna Ortega; I didn’t ask for this 🥴
Say I Do,"Honestly, the series felt really corny.  The writing and plot were so teen driven and predictable.  I watched it with my 8 and 10yr old.  They loved it, it worked for a family show.  But it wasn't written well at all.  I guessed every silly plot point the entire way.  Jenna carried this thing on her back.  I kind of hope they wrap in s2 and she can go on to do better things."
Say I Do,I am always surprised that she is just 1.55m.
Say I Do,"Can’t blame her. She’s really talented. Wednesday’s fun, but move on."
Say I Do,The Henry Cavill syndrome. Love it.
Say I Do,"I'm honestly surprised by how many in here dislikes the show, or only likes the first two episodes, because ""Burton"".  
 I had no Idea he was only involved in the first two episodes. I think the show was quite good, so does everyone else I have talked to about it.  
Also in this interview she's so ""in character"" that I would guess it's part of marketing for the show. It seems like everyone in here is taking it at face value? Am I missing something?"
Say I Do,Sometimes it’s scheduling…a movie requires them to shoot for 6 weeks and maybe a few reshoots but a tv show requires a lot more time
Say I Do,And look because of the show she's starting in a Beetlejuice sequel with Michael Keaton.
Say I Do,"My niece loves this show so that’s cool, but I can’t see myself ever watching an episode of this."
Say I Do,Probably doesn’t wanna be trapped for 7 seasons
Say I Do,"Thank God, because I know I can’t live without the stellar acting in films the like of SCREAM 10

/s"
Say I Do,"As someone with really specific tastes in show that usually hates mainstream things, I absolutely loved Wednesday beginning to end. Something about it just felt like a geniune effort from a team to make a fun show with a teen thematic. It felt like discovering a super fun show on TV back in the 2000s, not just another entry in the endless things under either DC, Marvel or weird solo actor projects that end up big only because of Controversy. Ironically, for all the teen dialogue, Wednesday actually made me feel quite young and innocent again while watching it, despite some of the dark subject matter.  


  
I honestly feel much of the people hating on Burton and his writers for this show just shows how much differently they approached this show compared to other modern hits. Their writing wasn't focused on tying it into weird worldbuilding and lore, or shocking viewers with random deaths, etc. They just went it at from a very clear goal and aim for the kind of things Wednesday as a character would work with and the stuff she wouldn't. This is especially fine considering that contrary to what most people are saying here, almost NONE of the Wednesday family members have ever had any sort of consistant characterization, especially Wednesday. They're all ""weird"" but the way in which they express it in their dialogue has never been a standard in any of the versions of the family. Wednesday here I feel actually did by far the best job of combining the aspects of a loving family with one that is weird not just because of their gothic style, but because they're geniunely involved in fucked up shit like murder plots and more. Wednesday herself felt interesting to watch as her dialogue wasn't just a gimmick. Her constant bite at other characters ends having both small and big consequences, from pushing people away even when she doesn't want to, to almost killing one of the people she actually considers a friend.  


  
This show honestly feels old in the best ways possible while still being awesome in terms of camera work and pacing and I really hope they stick with it instead of just forcing itself to be new and hip like people in these comments want it to."
Say I Do,She is really putting her foot in her mouth recently isn't she?
Say I Do,Loser didn't even eat real chicken on hot ones.
Say I Do,"I really dislike her attitude and demeanour. I know a lot of people are loving her “girl boss” nature - which is a weird trend right now where people are celebrating female celebrities for being rude and off putting for some reason. 

I just really don’t need to hear celebrities whinging. The gall she has to criticise the writing team and complain about it proves how untouchable she feels and how lucky she is. The average population has to do things they don’t want to do at work. Instead of whinging about what you have to do, why not express gratitude. She has plenty of films on her resume and can keep doing it in the future. She will not struggle to be booked, and she knows it, which is why she has such an asshole attitude. 

She is pretentious and I’m completely over hearing about her interviews. I’ve never seen anything from her except for frowning and bitching, or just being unbelievably rude to interviewers. 

Her attitude has deterred me from viewing things she is in because now her acting just annoys me. 

She is ridiculously cocky and the complete opposite of down to earth. See Brendan Fraser and  Ke Huy Quan at the Oscar’s the other day - imagine Jenna in their place. I’m tired of celebrating celebrities like her and would much rather celebrate the ones who are grateful"
Say I Do,"They can change the whole writer's room, and it would probably benefit the show. They can't change the lead actress without tanking the show. JO knows that. I don't blame her for not wanting to get stuck on some mediocre CW show and watching her career get tied to that kind of junk. She is right to speak out. Wednesday is mediocre, but has the potential to be good. Let it be good."
Say I Do,The first mistake is thinking she’s not replaceable. Everyone is.
Say I Do,Really looking forward to her no longer being the flavour of the month.
Say I Do,"This is starting to give me shades of Jennifer Lopez' ""Movieline"" interview back in 1998 when she was first blowing up (basically trashed a bunch of actors & scripts as she felt pretty untouchable at the time).

&#x200B;

I get that Ortega might be unhappy with some of the writing - I get that she may prefer film to TV.  She may regret playing it out in public as much as she has been."
Say I Do,"Girl, just be happy you’re an artist getting a hefty paycheck to do something you love for a living."
Say I Do,😭 I’m too popular and have too much money- Her
Say I Do,"I do feel bad for actors giving shows a chance, trying to pad their resume, and the show becomes this cultural phenomenon and now they have to spend the rest of their life playing and reliving that character and acting like it was this great experience. Even if they go on to do work they love and are proud of, its that one character they'll be asked about."
Say I Do,"So girl get popular but wishes she wasn't on popular show to do film to become popular?  

Did I get that right because from what I've seen, she's everywhere now and doesn't seem to be not enjoying the spotlight?"
Say I Do,This must be her 15 minutes of fame that she's being plugged roughly every fifth article.
Say I Do,the fandom for this girl hasn't even formed yet and she's already alienating the hell out of everyone
Say I Do,She's kinda starting to annoy me and she's to young for that. Quit it.
Say I Do,"I liked this girl (as in public person) at first, but after seeing some recent public appareances, I feel she believes she is entitled.   


Just my feeling."
Say I Do,So tired of hearing about this actor and how the show supposedly revolves around her decisions (and not the showrunner/writer/director/studio). Such PR nonsense.
Say I Do,"Sounds to me like she wants to be on that Robert Pattinson, Daniel Radcliffe abstract film actor in a rush. She’s barely been famous for a year and she already wants what they spent about a decade of work doing and building a reputation and their acting skills. Girl needs to chill out and just ride the wave and fluff her resume"
Say I Do,"People are so negative. I thought it was a decent show. That being said, Ortega obviously helped a lot."
Say I Do,"She’ll eventually gain a reputation of being hard to work with.

We really need another monotone, blank actor?"
Say I Do,"In another universe she could be a waitress in LA trying to land a commercial

In this one she's a 20-year old multimillionaire"
Say I Do,She is sounding more and more insufferable every time she talks. Hate to tell her but Hollywood history is littered with young starlets just like her.  There are 50 girls waiting in the wings to take her place.
Say I Do,"I mean people are sucking her off now, but I’ve seen Scream this weekend and it was meh, but her performance was a standout in terms of how bad it was. Like shockingly bad. In Wednesday she didn’t have to emote, but I reckon the more she stars in projects where she actually has to act, the more people will realize that she’s not all that."
Say I Do,"She sounds very ungrateful. Not every show is a great experience, but a lot of people didn’t know who the hell she was before this. I only knew of her from the Scream movie and Wednesday. She isn’t doing herself any favors by saying stuff like this ( I’m sure writers aren’t happy)"
Say I Do,Girl has one hit show and thinks she is Streep.
Say I Do,She sounds like a spoiled brat.
Say I Do,"the show is good and all, but Wednesday herself seems like from a different world than everyone else. That's the point, yes, but if she's so obsessed with death and pain and loneliness how... is it... that she's the most popular girl in school with all these friends and love interests? it just doesn't fit.  It's incredibly CW.  I wish there was a bit more ACTUAL gothic odd-ness going on in the story."
Say I Do,"I never watched it, seemed overrated."
Say I Do,"She is right though, the plot is beyond stupid and full of tiktok baiting scenes."
Say I Do,">There was a line about a dress she has to wear for a school dance and she says, ‘Oh my god I love it. Ugh, I can’t believe I said that. I literally hate myself.’ I had to go, ‘No.’”

""Oh my god, I love it"" is never something Wednesday Adams should say. Fire the writer who wrote that line for her."
Say I Do,I like how everyone that films a Netflix show comes out of it and talks like they were serving time in a POW camp.
Say I Do,Ahh tv is so much better than film these days… you’d think these kids would get that.
Say I Do,She uh... really wants to just tank the goodwill she gained in the last year hm?
Say I Do,"I get where she is coming from (not wanting to be stuck doing this show for years) but she has got to stop slagging off the thing that has brought her the success she is now enjoying.

She is a professional. There is a way to handle frustration with a project and slamming it in the press ain't the way to go about it."
Say I Do,She better be careful or she’ll end up like Constance Wu if she comes off as too ungrateful.
Say I Do,Man if i had a nickle when an actor who got famous thanks to some  tv show thought they should do movies and are for movies. I'd have lots of nickles.
Say I Do,Wow starting to really not like her
Say I Do,"I liked Wednesday, but Ortega gave off an off putting vibe on SNL."
Say I Do,"Haven't watched the show, but the headline immediately made me think of Krusty the Klown.  

Basically ""They asked me to do their crappy show, and I threw those phony suits out on their ass!  Then they came back with a dump truck full of money...  and I just had no choice."""
Say I Do,I still can’t figure what it was people liked about that show. She’s clearly an It girl but damn that show was not good on any level.
Say I Do,Such an annoying face
Say I Do,She sounds like An absolute stinkin brat
Say I Do,"Sound a littel douche for a relative newcomer. 

On the other hand, yeah, amazing films like Sream 8 & Scream 9 surely “prove herself”."
Say I Do,I wish I got famous so I could whine about it
Say I Do,She is definitely not movie star caliber.
Say I Do,"Oh, she'd rather be making little money doing obscure indie films and having to scrap for each new role instead of having a massive hit propel her to huge paydays and producers throwing prime roles her way? 

Shut. The. Fuck. Up."
Say I Do,[deleted]
Say I Do,"I'm sure she's crying herself to sleep every night on a huge pile of money.  

Meanwhile my students are struggling to afford gas for their cars to come to class but You Da Real Victim, Jenna."
Say I Do,Her explaining how she had to sometimes say no to the original script makes me happy as I recall exclaiming how good she was at her character at a few points during my watch. Good for her.
Kingdom,Trailer does not include anyone yelling “SHIELD [long pause] WALL!!”. Deeply concerned.
Kingdom,"Uthred son of Uthred is a great character. 

I am really looking forward to this. In my opinion, this was the best show dealing with Viking theme."
Kingdom,So hyped for more Uhtred son of Uhtred
Kingdom,I am Uhtred son of Uhtred
Kingdom,"Fuck yes.  I finally got around to watching the final season of The Last Kingdom over the past couple of weeks, so it must be... *destiny* that this is coming soon."
Kingdom,"One of my favorite shows of all time, really looking forward to this. Destiny is all!"
Kingdom,Anybody misread the title as Stephen King must die?
Kingdom,"Trailer needed more Finan, but excited nonetheless."
Kingdom,The modern day James Bond. Every season begins or ends with his previous missus dying and him immediately shacking up with a new lady. Be hard pressed to fit that cycle into a 2 hour movie.
Kingdom,"Uthred the Ageless - outlived young Edward.

Pretty hyped tho, ngl"
Kingdom,"well, that's a lot of kings to assassinate"
Kingdom,Best Viking show/movie I’ve ever seen
Kingdom,"Also astonishing how many can't read 

Maybe not so surprising in a tv sub tho"
Kingdom,I was disappointed with the final season but I’m excited to see this
Kingdom,"Anyone else read the title at first glance as, ""Steven King Must Die""?"
Kingdom,Used to be one of my favorite shows till season 3. But season 4 made me lose all interest and killed my love for it. Did it get any better afterwards?
Kingdom,"Anybody else misread the title as ""Buttvirgins #24""?"
Kingdom,Yes! One of my all time favorites Shows! Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"I read this as Steve King’s Must Die — The Last Kingdom sequel — and was simultaneously confused and excited. I’m a bit let down, but still excited to see Uhtred son of Uhtred."
Kingdom,It is my destiny to watch this.
Kingdom,"I know it's good but I just don't have the time to watch The Last Kingdom. So my question is, do you guys think I can watch this without watching the series? Can the story stand alone?"
Kingdom,"Ahh. 

Was hoping it wouldn't be him vs uthred after rewatch recently..but of course"
Kingdom,"At first very brief glance I thought it said 'Steven King Must Die' and was like hm, what's all this? 
(Yes I know it's Stephen, that's just what my brain initially did)"
Kingdom,"It''s not cinema movie, right?"
Kingdom,Thought this said Stephen King Must Die
Kingdom,"Another one of  the ""everyone in medieval time wore brown or black, even the noble´s, it,s dark and  muddy and whitewash for walls surely is a 21th century invention"" style movies.

Kingdom,"I can't help but think of the railway station in London.

Kingdom,"
No but I’d watch that too"
Kingdom,I did!
Kingdom,"Not really, it sort of just found its level and stayed around that for the most part."
Kingdom,Probably but you’ll regret it.
Kingdom,The show doesn't make any claims to be historically accurate
Kingdom,Fate is inexorable
Kingdom,Uthred of Bababba
Kingdom,Yes the nostalgia!
Kingdom,You forgot Uhtred brother of Uhtred.
Kingdom,[deleted]
Kingdom,"same, last thing i remember is there being a huge plague plotline right in the beginning of covid lol"
Kingdom,I see. That's a shame. Was one of the best shows around in its first three seasons.
Kingdom,"Im not really criticising that. Even if it looks like , i will give you that.

It´s just lazy filmmaking. Apparently film people think this drab boring costume and prop stuff has been conditioned onto the audience and they can get away with it. Probably way cheaper than paying some guys to design and make some nice looking stuff.

Any basic bbc history documentation has better looking costumes and set."
Kingdom,Did 5 get better? I watched 4 episodes and was bored. The original magic seemed gone
Kingdom,"The action felt better than GoT at times. Writing and acting was obviously a long way distant, but as a show I preferred it to GoT S4+"
Kingdom,Who knows why Hollywood decides to do what it does. My theory is the producers think it looks cooler haha
Kingdom,"I am ready for some I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred, father of Uhtred, grandfather of Uhtred, great grandfather of Uhtred.

also if Uhtred gets with Eadith in the movie, then RIP.  

you had a good run Eadith."
Kingdom,Maybe Uhtred will finally get a grey hair
Kingdom,Can't wait for this. Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"Can’t wait. The finale to s5 was an incredible closing to the story, but I’m really excited to see where this movie goes. One of my favorite series ever"
Kingdom,"I watched all five seasons in about three weeks few weeks back. What a ride, amazing show overall. Can't wait for the movie, but sad it will be the last thing made from it."
Kingdom,Uhtred son of Uhtred!
Kingdom,Awesome!
Kingdom,If you like the show then I 💯recommend reading the Books if you haven’t already!
Kingdom,"Fuck you, now I'm remembering >!Aethelflaed's death!< and how it emotionally destroyed me."
Kingdom,Destiny is all!
Kingdom,Awesome though shame to see it ending.  Best show on Netflix.
Kingdom,"Let me guess, he wants to retake Bebebbanbnburhg

Some new evil guy shows up that has a new schtick

His wife dies

Just when he's about to set off on his quest, he gets pulled into the King's politics and he has to either do him a favour, or avoid making him an enemy."
Kingdom,"hah love this show, it ain't no big masterpiece but surprisingly solid all the way, which is far more than many so called *prestige shows* can say since they turn to shit after the third episode. Also, Uthred and Young Uthred always made me think about Blackadder's Pitt The Younger and Pitt the Even Younger"
Kingdom,"Such a great show, and stayed strong till the end, I hope, unlike some others."
Kingdom,Probably the best show Netflix has ever put out.  Although I think it was a bbc show initially
Kingdom,That's some good news for once
Kingdom,Now do an adaption of the warlord chronicles
Kingdom,I had no idea this was coming. Can't wait now!
Kingdom,I need to watch this. I have read most of the books. No idea what I am waiting for.
Kingdom,SHIELD WALL
Kingdom,"Love the bit were he jumps over the shield wall and cuts them all from behind, bad ass af"
Kingdom,"would you recommend this show? How would you describe it? (ex: thrones meets the sopranos)


Also if you recommend this show can you tell me some other shows you like"
Kingdom,The series that just won't die. Strange it's on Netflix.
Kingdom,Last season blood CGI was so ugly. Please stop using bad blood CGI. Ruins it for me.
Kingdom,"Friendly reminder, nothing made by Netflix requires a Netflix account to access."
Kingdom,"Shit, keep forgetting to pick this back up."
Kingdom,Cant wait!!!
Kingdom,Destiny is all!
Kingdom,"NGL Alexander Dreymon was a bit of an acquired taste for me. Not sure why but am glad I saw it through. 

Will be looking forward to this even if half the movie is just him reading a genesis for all the Uhtreds."
Kingdom,"Funny, I was just talking about this the other day."
Kingdom,I swear the beginning of each episode with the recap and he always said that. Lmao.  That got planted in my head that if he didn't say that on the next episode. I would be disappointed lol
Kingdom,">	Also if Uhtred gets with Eadith in the movie, then RIP. 

I used to watch a show called Chicago fire with a character named Kelly Severide. For drama purposes they’d kill a character every season. I realized you could predict who it would be by whoever started dating Severide. If a character started dating him you knew they wouldn’t be around by the end of the season. They’d unintentionally made him the most tragic character in history."
Kingdom,How dare you! Uhtred will never show glimpse of age
Kingdom,"For real, it's been a while since I watched but doesn't the series cover like 40 something years?"
Kingdom,*Loud lamenting singing begins*
Kingdom,I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg and password sharing will no longer be tolerated!
Kingdom,DESTINY IS ALL
Kingdom,"I really, really hate that translation. In the books, it’s translated as “Fate is inexorable.” Which is a slightly shortened quote from the Old English poem “The Wanderer.” It has a very different meaning."
Kingdom,Wait … there’s a fifth season?! How did I miss that!?
Kingdom,"I agree! What I loved about the finale to S05 is that honestly, it could pickup for a season 6 or end right there. The Last Kingdom is, to me, a perfect show."
Kingdom,Wait a fucking minute....S5 came out ?!?!
Kingdom,Amazing finale
Kingdom,"And the the Warlord Trilogy, and the Archers tale. And Azincourt, etc. but especially the Warlord Trilogy."
Kingdom,"I recommend the books even if you don’t like the show! I couldn’t get into the show at all, it just wasn’t the same world as the one in my head from the books. Was still cool to see that there was enough interest to turn it into such a long running show!"
Kingdom,"lol, I enjoyed the show but this is pretty accurate."
Kingdom,"I hope, yeah."
Kingdom,What happened to Bebbanburg?  The show ends with him taking it.
Kingdom,You will absolutely not be disappointed.
Kingdom,It’s a great show from start to finish. Not many shows stay good and even have a great finale.
Kingdom,"The Last Kingdom kind of ruined Vikings for me because TLK is so much richer and more detailed. There is a pattern of rug-pulling in the storylines that does become annoying, but it is a phenomenal series and easily one of the best things on Netflix."
Kingdom,Show is so good. The only show that I’ve watched through beginning to end several times. Highly recommended
Kingdom,"Absolutely. It's historical fiction, compared to GoT fantasy but both have that gritty element so if you liked that about GoT...

I think of it as Adventure television, like Robin of Sherwood, Uhtred is heroic but not always likable 

The closest comparison is probably Sharpe (which I've never seen) because Bernard Cornwell wrote both series. It's also synonymous in my mind with Poldark but that's because it was always shown about the same time of year.

What I appreciate about the show is the secondary characters, especially King Alfred and his family. There's good story arcs and relationships develop in interesting ways."
Kingdom,"It goes downhill after season 3 (after a certain character exits the show), , but overall still enjoyable with a conclusive ending."
Kingdom,"I’m also curious.  The books were great fun, and I’m a bit hesitant to watch the show in case it doesn’t live up."
Homemade,"> “I expect to see a flat disk up there,” he said months after his 2018 launch. “I don’t have an agenda. If it’s a round Earth or a ball, I’m going to come down and say, ‘Hey guys, I’m bad. It’s a ball, okay?’”

Wonder what he saw"

Homemade,"I can't understand why he trusted those rockets. The video for 2014 it's made of 110% NOPE. Chunks falling off, recovery chute that looked like it was made in the 50's and left to moths. Said chute held on with tie-downs. And I saw the video of his death. Rocket launches a you can see his chute detach immediately. That's kinda oversight was literally deadly."

Homemade,"[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uTvGLuA4dE)

It appears that the recovery parachute got loose and deployed on launch and ripped off, so although the launch trajectory wasn't too bad, it was doomed.

I see something about this being a ""steam"" rocket, and the exhaust does kind of dissipate like steam.  I'm confused how you can generate sufficient propulsion this way, though.  Tried to find some details on what he did and coming up empty.

I mean you can boil water to a high pressure and jet it out, but you have to heat it.  Water is heavy and high pressure high temp water requires a thick, heavy vessel to contain it.  So... WTF is this.

My best guess is this uses a hydrogen peroxide fuel like the Bell Rocket Belt ""jetpack"", which decomposes into water/H2O+a lot of heat and produces a high temp steam/O2 exhaust (which is in most cases invisible and does not make steam fog), and injected in some water into the nozzle that flash-boiled into lower temp but higher pressure steam?

If it's peroxide, you actually should be able to get more thrust by adding combustible fuel like kerosene to consume the generated O2 and make more heat and thrust, *and* add water to turn the heat into extra pressure, but I don't see any plume of flame from that.

I never could tell if Flat Earthers actually believed that, or just said it ironically, for attention."

Homemade,"He really wasn't a flat earther. That was more for publicity. Watch the documentary ""Rocketman."" He was a stunt man and in a lot of ways not all there but it's sad that his life ended this way. In the video you can see the parachute fail upon launch. I can't imagine what those who were working with him felt when they knew he was going to crash. I pray that they find peace.

I want to say too. Not to get all high and mighty but please think twice before putting some sort of comment about how he deserved it. Yeah, he knew the risk but we shouldn't glorify a man's death."

Homemade,Interesting how adjectives become much more flattering posthumously
Homemade,Homemade IDIOTS!
Homemade,He's now pan cake flat.
Homemade,Idiot.
Homemade,I'm really curious if his thrust and vector control relied upon flat earth math.
Homemade,"At least he died doing what he loved. 

&#x200B;

And, appearantly, he loved falling 500 feet to earth in a shitty 'rocket'."
Homemade,">  ""The Flat Earth thing is like everything else to me,"" he told CBS News months after that mission, saying he had built the rocket by ""trial and error.""

So I guess he considered ""everything else"" delusional and stupid."
Homemade,Why the every living fuck was the Science Channel giving money to someone who was trying to prove the Earth is flat?
Homemade,"Whoa, did he hit the firmament?"
Homemade,More like ‘dumb ass’ Mike
Homemade,"Instead of proving the world is flat, he proved a fall to it would make him flat."
Homemade,"He did prove there’s gravity, though"
Homemade,In other news. Duh
Homemade,They give this dipshit a tv show?
Homemade,"Looking to discover more about the circumference of the earth, Mike Hughes instead learns more about gravity.

Fixed your headline"
Homemade,"""...his crudely built contraption propelled him on a column of steam, spiraled through the air and ***cratered into the sagebrush*** outside Barstow, Calif.""

That's some poetic savagery right there.

BTW, there's [a documentary about this idiot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8372368/) available on Amazon video."
Homemade,When stupidity actually kills you.
Homemade,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOPBP9vuZA

The end."
Homemade,Astronaut? More like Splattronaut.
Homemade,He hit the ceiling. The sky is flat.
Homemade,"It's difficult to have a more charitable take on this than ""He's dead because he's a moron who did stupid things in the name of stupid, easily disproven beliefs""."
Homemade,"Well, he definitely created a “flat earth” where the rocket came to rest"
Homemade,"""Earth is still round, Mike Hughes is flat.""

Gotta love Twitter comments."
Homemade,"I hope that this man's family, friends, and the Science Channel are all held responsible for enabling this man's delusions. Shame on each and every last one of them."
Homemade,So if he could make his own space rocket what’s stopping someone from making a murder rocket?
Homemade,"""Dipshit dies doing something dumb trying to prove a point that has been known for centuries."""
Homemade,Has no one made a Nike meme? believe in something even  if it costs you everything.
Homemade,Space is hard.
Homemade,This is why I don’t follow my dreams.
Homemade,Where was Hillary during all this?
Homemade,"I feel bad for this guy for losing his life over something so pointless and frankly stupid.  His plan was to go into space to prove the earth was flat, but obviously the truth is that space doesn't actually exist.  NASA invented the space hoax to justify their purported fake trip the the moon.  Yes, NASA did sabotage his rocket to cause his death but not for why you think.   If he went too high he would have bounced off of the sky ceiling and revealed the truth that he would have went straight into heaven if he could pass through it.  Only souls can pass into heaven."
Homemade,One less dumbcunt in the world.
Homemade,"Regardless of what he believed, right or wrong, a man died.. you people are assholes."
Homemade,"Said this in another post, but big globe must of sabotaged the rocket to keep us from the truth, but it's out there!

#FlattenedLikeTheEarth"
Homemade,"I'll never forget his last words.

""What the..."""
Black Clover,Don't even like Anime that much but I really liked my hero
Black Clover,"i love my hero academia, season 3 was so good (very plus ultra)."
Black Clover,"Considering all the hurdles One Piece has faced for years on it's way over to the US, this is a big deal. Good for One Piece!"
Black Clover,My Hero has so much heart.
Black Clover,"Y'all need to discover the greatness that is Overlord. Although, the first season was removed from Crunchyroll recently for some reason. You can still see it on Hulu"
Black Clover,How is Dragon Ball Super not up there. It literally broke the servers every week
Black Clover,"Go watch Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai, you fools."
Black Clover,No JoJo
Black Clover,"Is Boruto worth watching?

Not so fun fact, Boruto can autocorrect to abortion. I’m glad I proofread before posting..."
Black Clover,"In other news, Vanilla Ice Cream still very popular."
Black Clover,"Really enjoyed Black Clover, really scratched an itch thats been there since Naruto ended"
Black Clover,">Citrus

😏"
Black Clover,Is it safe to use Crunchyroll?
Black Clover,"Funny how One Piece is on that list, even though it's not available for most of us."
Black Clover,"Too bad Megalobox didn't make it, but I understand why.  And I'm sure Goblin Slayer will make the list next year.  It's basically just started, but it's sooo good!"
Black Clover,"Black Clover season ending without notice had me reeling. 

Edit: Hulu has 51 episodes presently."
Black Clover,"I enjoyed My Hero too, but my god, did Bakugo quickly become annoying. We get it, you're angry all the time dude. "
Black Clover,"It was 50/50 for me. 

I liked the pacing and how they didnt take forever to get through everything like lots of other anime does.

I didnt like some of the characters. I got really annoyed after a while that the show kept trying to convince me that Bakugo and Stain were cool when theyre just edgy teenager idols.

I liked All Might as a well meaning but flawed mentor figure. 

I didnt like how the worldbuilding felt kind of weak and unbeleivable.

Id say its a solid 7/10."
Black Clover,It started getting really good around the internships. Tournament arc was good but internships took it to the next level 
Black Clover,Still can't believe that manga has been in place for nearly 20 years. That's crazy even from an American comics stand point and he does the strip *weekly*
Black Clover,"I just started watching it from the start a few weeks ago. I’m like 30 episodes in. I can tell it’s pretty old. There’s like 15 seasons and 600 episodes on Hulu, is that the entire series? Or does it go longer?"
Black Clover,It's a worse version of into the spiderverse
Black Clover,"I think that is because Super ended in like April, so it is basically 16 episodes of Super vs almost 30-50 of Black Clover, Boruto, One Piece and MHA. "
Black Clover,"Servers on both CR and Funi were always down when the new episode went live, I would have to wait 3 hours until I could watch it without the stream crashing."
Black Clover,"Depends on your age. It seems aimed at a younger audience than most shounen anime. It's also rather generic. I'd only advice you to watch it if you're a huge Naruto fan.

There's much better anime"
Black Clover,They try too hard to make it Naruto(with less interesting characters) instead of it's own thing most of the time. Some parts are pretty cool but they were mostly covered in the movie.
Black Clover,"Nope, it's full of fillers. Boruto's fillers are better integrated to the main story than Naruto's but they are fillers regardless. Manga is worth a read though."
Black Clover,"If you really like epilogues and seeing what happens after the main storyline, I'd definitely recommend it.  There are definitely parallels with the earlier arcs of Naruto, but they're fresh and interesting.  My only gripe is that none of the villains are as great as Orochimaru was.


You also get to see how reliable Shikamaru has become as an advisor and Naruto's relationship with Boruto has some real emotional weight to it."
Black Clover,"First arc is good, second arc is decent (and it's based off of Naruto Gaiden which was created by Kishimoto), everything after that is meh aside from their graduation from the academy and episode 65 (seriously, if you're going to watch any episode, watch episode 65). "
Black Clover,"Short answer - No. 

Longer answer - If you're a fan of Naruto and Shippuden, it's genuinely interesting to see the world and characters 10+ years into the future. But the plot moves at a glacial speed, and it relies too heavily on the previous shows. It just doesn't succeed as its own thing.  "
Black Clover,"If you’re a fan of Naruto I’d recommend that you read the Boruto manga as the show is 95% filler right now as the manga only comes out monthly, and the filler stuff kinda sucks. Look up the Momoshiki fight on YouTube and you’ve seen the best thing we’ve gotten so far in the Boruto anime. Manga is pretty interesting though. "
Black Clover,"That depends, did you like the filler arc of orginal Naruto? If yes then sure, otherwise do not bother... oh also all characters are either more annoying or less interesting than their counterparts in the old show. "
Black Clover,"Its worse then Naruto, thats for sure. Every 15-20 episodes has one good fight scene and the rest is pretty much trash. I still watch from time to time when I dont have anything else but you have to be a fan to enjoy this show."
Black Clover,"I use Grammarly, it autocorrects to brutal lol."
Black Clover,"Really? I *hated* Black Clover, it was like every awful Shonen trope rolled into one. "
Black Clover,"Its a legal streaming service, it doesnt get any safer."
Black Clover,Yes
Black Clover,"They're legit now

They started out as a way to pirate streams but they switched to legitame deals with the copyright holders and nowadays they're not any shadier then any other service"
Black Clover,"goblin slayer has a few good moments but overall it could be better, especially the characters the only interesting one is the mc really and compared to overlord where almost any character is interesting its quite weak in that regard"
Black Clover,The season hasn’t ended. There will be a new episode next week. 
Black Clover,Does he keep screaming like a person with hemorrhoids getting a colonoscopy with a lime juice coated pineapple? 
Black Clover,You scared me for a minute. Always watch on Crunchyroll
Black Clover,I dislike the terrible monologuing the villains do. The show is good but the writing is sometimes very meh.
Black Clover,I fucking love Bakugo. When you realise that the angry persona is just his character and not just another setup to turn him into Sasuke 2.0 he becomes super enjoyable. 
Black Clover,Same here. Hearing him shit on Deku is really hindering my enjoyment of the latest season. People say Bakugo develops. But I'm not seeing it yet...and it's really turning me off the show.
Black Clover,Not big on Bakugo either. I find him to be a bully no one seems to hold accountable. He's def one of the parts I don't care for. But then again I didn't care much for Sasuke either.
Black Clover,Fire Sasuke
Black Clover,He's not as bad as Deku
Black Clover,"What kills it for me is that it's just another never-ending ass-pull anime. In episode 2 Deku says it's a story about how he becomes the best hero in the world but that's like saying One Piece is about Luffy getting *the* one piece.


I prefer stories with a beginning, middle and end instead of money grubbing longevity but hey people fucking love 1,000 episodes One Piece so what do I know."
Black Clover,"All Might is great, he's so well rounded.

If anything, I watch for everyone but Bakugo and Deku. I would love to see more of all the side characters and lore of the world. I'm kind of tired of one guy bullying another who is also some kind of mix of a friend/rival. I just don't get that appeal. But I'm 28F so maybe I'm not the target demographic.

But man is it reassuring to hear I""m not th eonly one iffy on say Bakugo. I get skewered if I voice dislike of him on the BNHA sub or even Askreddit."
Black Clover,"All the seasons were good, the lowest point for me was the preliminary license test, but even then it wasn't even that bad.

Season 4 will take it to a new level though."
Black Clover,"It's insane how long One Piece has been running. Especially when the story and art are mostly done by one guy, almost every week (give or take a few breaks), since *1997.*

Same thing for JoJo, except that's been around since at least 1986. These manga runs are crazy.

I was also pretty shocked to find out that Dragonball is actually older than JoJo. It predates JoJo by two years (came out in 1984). JoJo just feels like it's older (I guess mainly due to the art style of the first couple parts). Dragonball's art has a timeless quality to it. Plenty of manga/anime art styles show their age, and you can tell what the style was for shows in the 70s/80s/90s/etc. but Dragonball's art is just....Dragonball. And the later parts of JoJo (I'd say starting with Part 4) are so unique it's unlike anything else you've seen in manga/anime. It can't be anything else but ""JoJo"".

Boy, that was a tangent."
Black Clover,"*Waaay* longer. It currently has 866 episodes.

I had to tap out after 300-something episodes. Also, I heard later episodes try to keep from overtaking the source material by padding each chapter out to fit a whole episode."
Black Clover,"There are currently 866 episodes according to Wikipedia. It's still on going though, and probably has at least 3 more arcs left.

However after the time skip or so, I'd recommend switching to the Manga if you are ok with that format. At some point they stopped doing filler arcs and instead just stretched each anime episode to cover less than one chapter so the pacing becomes painfully glacial. There's also a fan made recut that cuts out about 50% of the runtime, might be worth checking out."
Black Clover,How do you like it? I’ve heard good things about it
Black Clover,That makes no sense but ok
Black Clover,I think this is a reply to the wrong post?
Black Clover,"Naruto is like the main quest, while Boruto seems like the optional bonus dungeon after you beat the game. You can go for it if you want, but you don't have to."
Black Clover,"It has themes of war, death, and indentured servitude.  I would not say it's aimed at a younger audience than most shonen anime, as it might give people the impression that it's a fluffy slice-of-life anime with a ninja twist.  It's very middle-of-the-road for shonen anime."
Black Clover,"Part of the reason for that is the Manga only comes out monthly, so 90% of the anime is filler.  

Read the Manga if you want to see the story.  "
Black Clover,yeah it has almost nothing original but I guess as long as they dont start with fillers and flashbacks like they did in naruto its still watcheable
Black Clover,"> Really? I *hated* Black Clover, it was like every awful Shonen trope rolled into one.

Agreed, and I was fairly astounded that Asta's VO was approved for such a heavily-marketed production. Just *constant* nails-on-chalkboard."
Black Clover,"Cliche shonen tropes is *exactly* what I look for in anime, but I can see why a lot of people don't like it because of that.

Personally I vary rarely find myself enjoying anime that isn't tropey as hell"
Black Clover,"Yup. That's exactly how it's written. It's like fairytail, but with fewer fan service moments. "
Black Clover,"Well, yes, that would be the itch that Naruto scratched. "
Black Clover,Overlord is unnecessarily fan-service-y.  It's like an edgy otaku's fantasy.  With lizard people sex.  I am so done with that anime.
Black Clover,"Apologies, Hulu hasn’t given me a new episode in months. "
Black Clover,"With the right skills and charisma, Stain would've been a great podcaster/radio host. Too bad he's too busy murdering people."
Black Clover,"I was really shocked when I was on Youtube and saw a bunch of analysis videos claiming that Stain actually had a good point and made sense. I dont know, he just seemed like a dumb poorly written villain who wasnt meant to be taken that seriously, but apparently the character who murders the equivalent of firefighters because they sold out was actually supposed to be a legitimate critique of society or something."
Black Clover,I love that his mom is exactly like him and his dad is super docile.
Black Clover,"How far are you?

The big development for him, at least in terms of deku, happens in season 3.

Edit: you will see him start to care a little more about his other classmates, albeit it’s still dealing with angry yelling stuff. "
Black Clover,Except Sasuke had the decency to be the edgelord that barely talked. Bakugo pretty much only screams and I hate it.
Black Clover,Dollar store Vegeta is what I call bakugo
Black Clover,"Mean Naruto

https://youtu.be/UbPT2lxR2iY"
Black Clover,Who the hell thinks Deku is annoying?
Black Clover,"But in One Piece you can actually see their progress, the reason its so long is because of the world One Piece built. It has so many fleshed out characters with their own agenda and goals, it even has its own political system."
Black Clover,"Well JoJo starts in the 1800s whereas Dragonball is a more futuristic fantasy thing, so maybe that's why it feels older?"
Black Clover,You know the name of that recut? I might search that out when shit slows down. 
Black Clover,"So I think I’m like...90 episodes in now? It’s good, but I’m not binging it just cuz there are. So. Many. Episodes. I watched maybe the first hundred and fifty or so episodes of naruto as a kid before I got bored. I feel like one piece has a really similar vibe in how an arch will be about 5-15 episodes each with a bottle episode in between arch’s. It’s corny like naruto, but less cringe worthy. I also feel like it does a way better job of world building. Also it makes me laugh sometimes. I never thought naruto was funny whenever it tried to be. I recommend it if you have a lot of time on your hands. "
Black Clover,Nope
Black Clover,"It is for a younger audience though, maybe not by western standards but by Japan's standards as long as there isn't outright nudity or gore then it is a okay. "
Black Clover,"that lizard sex scene was like what 10-20secs long, to the rest I dont really understand that Sword Art Online is an edgy Otakus fantasy with lame boring character motivations. Overlord is quite unique in the anime world or where else do you have an almost omni potent villain as the maincharacter. But if you dont like it your loss I guess."
Black Clover,[deleted]
Black Clover,"Actually he doesn't even do that, considering he also crippled Iida's brother who is one of those heroes that are like All Might, that do their best to save people, they haven't sold out. He is purely a villain and it surprised me that in universe people empathized with him, and ignored how he crippled one of those non sellout superheroes because of his autism telling him to do so or something. "
Black Clover,"His mom being exactly like him was the moment his character started to click with me, they have handled him great recently. "
Black Clover,His dad definitely has a kink. 
Black Clover,"I'm about halfway through S3. But him caring would be good to see. In the movie, he wasn't too grating so I'd like to see more of that. "
Black Clover,How is he not
Black Clover,"I think part of it is that the first three parts have a ""Fist of the North Star"" look to them, which was a popular style for Shonen manga back in the 80s.

As for Dragonball, I heard it's initially cutesy, cartoony look, and it's adorable kid protagonist who wasn't the brightest bulb made it something of an anomaly back in the day (at least in Shonen Jump). Stuff like that was seen more in Gag manga, like Toriyama's previous work Dr. Slump. Though DB was kind of a gag series at first."
Black Clover,One Pace
Black Clover,"Protagonist as the real person inside a video game has been done to death and him being an overpowered villain makes it less interesting, not more. 


It would be more tragic and interesting if he was a low level scrub trying to survive in a fantasy RPG getting shit on all the time but that's better than his real life so he stays anyway. Having scantily clad women at your beck and call while being the strongest in the world is a lame power fantasy."
Black Clover,"Gate and Log Horizon are both better than Overlord.  Overlord is a really bad example for a well-done fantasy anime.  I don't know why you picked Overlord to compare Goblin Slayer against.  The premise is interesting, but Overlord really gets Ready-Player-One-ish about all the ridiculously overpowered items and skills(and custom-tailored succubus NPCs) he's brought over from the MMO game."
Black Clover,"No, I get that. I love villains with good motivations. Or even better, villains with bad motivations but where I can understand the mindset that led to them thinking things in such a wrong way. Like Sephiroth in FFVII. He doesnt have a good point at all but I at least get why hes that particular kind of crazy.

I just didnt get that vibe from Stain at all. He didnt feel to me like he was supposed to be that kind of bad guy, he was supposed to be more like a thug who killed Batmans parents, where theres no real explanation that makes much sense, its just a demonatration of how stupid and cruel fate can be.

But then its like Im the only one who thought that and everyone else took Stain as a straight man despite how ridiculous everything about him is."
Black Clover,See Korra
Black Clover,"Keep going user!

It’s worth it and only makes you want to see more in the future. "
Black Clover,"You're the one calling him annoying, it's on you to explain first why you think so."
Black Clover,"You should watch Re:Zero then its pretty much that what you describe even tho its also similar to groundhog day and the mc dies over and over again. I just like the characters in Overlord and the anime design/dialogue is really great compared to all the other lame isekai out there, which they fill with so much mindless dialogue even tho overlord also has its share but the episodes with some action/fights are really nice. Atleast its pretty obvious that the mc in Overlord has plotarmor because he is that strong. Not like in most over anime of this kind where they get either super lucky or get saved by deus ex machina, then I prefer the op MC who uses handicaps to have his fun/entertainment."
Black Clover,"I dont think so but I havent watched those 2, I checked a few clips but it seems those are those kind of animes where they use still images and lots of dialogue as place fillers. Guess I just have a thing for those power fantasies even tho I also liked Re:Zero where the mc died over and over again."
Black Clover,GATE is basically pro Japan nationalism JSDF propaganda.

All For Love,Did anyone else's heart skip a beat thinking for a second that ***the show was coming back***?
All For Love,IGNORE ME!
All For Love,Eat the pennies
All For Love,Honestly Hank where do you come up with this stuff? I never see you read a book. It’s like your channeling dead crazy people
All For Love,"What cemented my love of this show was the episode in which Rusty was complaining about someone posting pictures of him making out with Lydia Lunch and Stiv Bators at CBGBs


Edit: And when Hank exclaimed, “The guy from Labyrinth just turned into a bird and flew away!”"
All For Love,Great show!
All For Love,Strange. I just went on a rabbit hole of looking up this show last night. Wanted to see if the movie was still on track.
All For Love,"Yes it is. Go Team Venture.

*sheds tear"
All For Love,"I just finished a rewatch of the entire series not too long ago and I knew I liked the show, but I forgot just how truly amazing it is. It's *really* well written, has super sharp dialogue and it has some of the best recurring jokes and call-backs I've ever seen in any show (here's a fun little game while watching; see how many times ""The Viceroy"" comes up).

It's honestly is up there as one of my favourite TV shows of all time."
All For Love,"Best show on TV, sad that they didn't get an 8th season, hopefully the movie provides a good send off for a show that really deserves it."
All For Love,"Hands down the smartest, most lovingly-made animated tv show of all time"
All For Love,"I mean, there's a movie in production."
All For Love,"‘If I knew you could just call the cops on him, I would have done it years ago! Because I'm no sissy, no sir. I would just pick up that phone and... ""Officer, there's a man in a butterfly suit shooting my robot with a laser beam.""’"
All For Love,Just eat the pennies
All For Love,"[""you...think it's a cry for help?""](https://youtu.be/3Gnh8laMgew?t=203)

easily one of my favorite quotes of the whole show."
All For Love,"For me it was the scene where Molotov gives Hank mouth to mouth, causing him to get an erection. Dean tells him ""don't panic. But I think the Apaches are back. Teepee in your trousers."" (After the previous joke about the compound build on an Indian burial ground as we see ghosts running around) The next scene is inside as Molotov talks to Dr. Venture, Hank runs by screaming ""my pants are haunted"". 


The show itself though is INCREDIBLE at world building and every rewatch you catch new throwaway background things that later came to the foreground. I love throwing it on for background noise from the adult swim app- you can marathon the episodes in order there"
All For Love,"Hullo, I’m David Bowie."
All For Love,James Urbanik tweeted that he had finished all of his voicework last June which seems to indicate the movie should be coming out this year. But not counting on it coming out this year (or even ever) until I hear a solid release date considering all the stuff going on with WB Discovery nowadays. Don't want to set my expectations high and get crushed.
All For Love,The show is so well crafted it is honestly my favorite TV show of all time.
All For Love,Squeeeee!!!
All For Love,"Considering it was 2+ plus years between season, that move could be 8+ years away"
All For Love,TIL! I did not know of this.  Thanks!
All For Love,did it get axed when hbo max purged its scrolls?
All For Love,WBdiscovery's window for write offs closed at the end of 2022 from what I understand.
All For Love,oh yeah I totally believe what those guys say
All For Love,"If he can make selfies and post them on Instagram that's good sign. Get well, Jeremy."
All For Love,wonder what that chest pad is under his shirt? big surgical bandaid to keep any sutures or wounds from sticking to his clothes?
All For Love,"One tough SOB. He’ll undoubtedly take his time but, man, his comeback film or series is going to garner a lot of eyeballs. Hope he’s given the space he’s needed to heal because there’s no doubt he has top notch care."
All For Love,What happened to him?
All For Love,[removed]
All For Love,Apparently it's like a gigantic chest bandaid thing that doctors use after surgery in that area. Makes sense since he had major chest trauma in addition to a fucked up leg.
All For Love,"Snowplow accident, it ran over him. The article has all the details."
All For Love,"Im not saying it was Yelena, but it was Yelena"
All For Love,"Damn, that's rough"
All For Love,This is Reddit. Do you think anyone reads the article
All For Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
All For Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
All For Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
All For Love,People are so stupid.
All For Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
All For Love,Good. What a POS.
All For Love,What a gross thing to do.
All For Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
All For Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
All For Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
All For Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
All For Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
All For Love,I hate everything about this headline.
All For Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
All For Love,Good. Fucking loser
All For Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
All For Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
All For Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
All For Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
All For Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
All For Love,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
All For Love,Who and who?
All For Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
All For Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
All For Love,Never heard of him.
All For Love,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
All For Love,As he should. If not more…
All For Love,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
All For Love,[removed]
All For Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
All For Love,Nasty bastard
All For Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
All For Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
All For Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
All For Love,*Sigh*
All For Love,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
All For Love,See ya
All For Love,Loozah!
All For Love,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can’t help themselves.
All For Love,Good
All For Love,"Surely that should be ‘celebrity’ Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
All For Love,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
All For Love,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
All For Love,What a douche.
All For Love,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
All For Love,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
All For Love,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
All For Love,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
All For Love,Picture checks out
All For Love,Disgusteng
All For Love,Neck tattoos…
All For Love,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
All For Love,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a “celebrity?”
All For Love,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
All For Love,Both of them are a waste of space
All For Love,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
All For Love,Lame.
All For Love,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
All For Love,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"

All For Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Home Game,That's not how separation anxiety works Amazon
Home Game,"Thanks Tubi, your ad made my father start yelling at me because he thought I changed the channel!"
Home Game,"The gimmick this year seems to be multiple celebrities in the same commercial. They open with one celeb, which doesn't surprise anyone, but the stinger is that they have another celeb in the same commercial!
  
Like all gimmicks, it gets old pretty quick. The ones that aren't relying on star power look good in comparison."
Home Game,Tubi: Home of all the weird movies your old off-beat video store used to carry.
Home Game,Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul love being Walt and Jesse so much.
Home Game,"Did they decide to save the funny commercials for the fourth quarter?  Sarah McLachlan in a Busch beer commercial, parodying her ASPCA ads was pretty amusing."
Home Game,Recreating old movie scenes seems to be the new trend

Also, is U2 behind all these damn balloons? I see...."
Home Game,"If they don’t tell me what that QR code is for, I’m not fucking scanning it. Fuck right off with that bullshit."
Home Game,Whatever happened to the guy who used to compile all the ads in one comment thread? I miss that.
Home Game,Dunkin commercial has been the best so far. That’s not saying much.
Home Game,I liked that commercial with Adam Driver but I've already forgotten what the product was.
Home Game,Miller vs. Coors vs. Blue Moon was fun in the moment! ...but then depressing when you realize all the beer brands are owned by the same company
Home Game,Did *not* expect that one to be a commercial for Remy
Home Game,no fuckin way they made an unidentified balloon ad
Home Game,That tubi menu got me (I thought something went wrong!) - though the transition straight into a Fox Nation commercial was really confusing
Home Game,Why is Rhianna wearing boob armor?
Home Game,Really thought they put Matt Damon in a shoe commercial. Not that it was a movie about shoes.
Home Game,"Glad that dog ad stopped when it did. 

I was pretty scared there for a minute."
Home Game,"Lol, Tuco in the Breaking Bad commercial. Was just missing Jesse calling Walt a bitch."
Home Game,Is Rihanna pregnant again?

Home Game,"I’ll give the Workday “rockstar” commercial this, they had good enough judgement NOT to use Gene Simmons."
Home Game,"So, uh, do we think the U2 commercial with the giant floating sphere was made before the whole China spy balloon thing? Because that's all that I was thinking when I was watching it"

Home Game,Thanks for hanging out everyone! I included as many commercials as I could find!

Home Game,The RAM REV commercial did get a chuckle out of me.
Home Game,"Okay, an ED pill mock commercial is funny, but it being for an electric truck is interesting..."
Home Game,Tubi probably has the most effective one. I've never hooked my TV up to the internet and the remote was on the coffee table but it had like 7 people screaming at me for about 10 seconds lol
Home Game,"Just got told to not do my taxes on national TV, what a world"
Home Game,"Well, that Tubi commercial wasn't *at all* creepy."
Home Game,Best so Far... Will Ferrell bravo

If I didn't just see the trailer, I would've never believed that premise was real."
Home Game,Anything with Ben Stiller in it cracks me up for some reason. Loved that Pepsi commercial.

Madlads."
Home Game,I watched Jane dine on some delicious Pop Corners

Home Game,Ngl that bud light commercial was extremely cute
Home Game,The Farmers Dog was a sweet commercial. Gotta go wake up my 14-year old dog and give her pets now.
Home Game,"That Farmer’s Dog commercial really hit home with me. Had a 15 year old chocolate lab put down a few years ago and still not over it.

Really great commercial."
Home Game,They're really pushing this farmer dating show lol.
Home Game,Am I the only person who wishes Mr. Peanut had a mid-Atlantic/British Accent? The idea of him having an American accent always felt weird to me.
Home Game,"Way too many ""Scan the QR"" code commercials"
Home Game,Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch jumpscare
Home Game,That Prime drink is DISGUSTING
Home Game,"Wait, was that Michael Keaton?"
Home Game,Damn they really paid to air this Animal Control ad twice?
Home Game,Nice of U2 to float balloons in commercial space to promote a concert tour.. I like it. Viral baby.
Home Game,Anyone else wondering if the balloons being shot down in Canada were just a few stray balloons from U2's Vegas concert?
Home Game,"I dunno about Ben Stiller or Steve Martin, but those guys in that Menard's commercial *definitely* weren't acting"
Home Game,"/scans list/


Damn. No Clydesdales?"
Home Game,"Well, that Fast X trailer knows exactly what it's going for...surprised to see Jason Momoa show up there, I didn't know he was going to be in it!"
Home Game,Are you still a rock star if you're doing a commercial for finance software?
Home Game,Who is the black guitarist in the “Rock Star” commercial?
Home Game,"For me, the Bud light one with the couple dancing to the hold music on the phone, that cracked me up. I've jammed out to that hold music before lmao and Miles Teller's(?) moves were great"
Home Game,Holy shit I thought Air was a fake commercial or going to be a parody. I can't believe it's a real movie.
Home Game,Jesus commercial worst commercial of the night
Home Game,The Jesus ad is cringe AF. Can't have a pro cannabis ad but let's have a Jesus ad.
Home Game,I am shocked they didn't get either Bill Murray or  Chevy Chase for that Michelob commercial.
Twogether,Netizens? Is this 1994?
Twogether,"That is one of the shortest, least coherent articles I've never seen.

Twogether,I'm talking about the term netizens I have not heard that in forever
The Secrets,Stress can't age you if you're literally never stressed.
The Secrets,"Eating Greens, that funny bastard."
The Secrets,"**Let’s talk about Daemon. I’m still not sure if I’m supposed to think of him as a full-on sociopath or a lovable rogue. He’s keeping me guessing, in a good way. How do you see him?**  


>SMITH: Exactly as just described. It depends on what side of the bed he gets out on. I think he’s just an agent of chaos in many respects. One of my favorite books is “The Master and Margarita.” It’s magical realism — I like that. This character Woland comes back to, essentially, cause chaos. And it reminds me a bit of that. I was trying not to be too black and white about him.

**Right before he chops off Vaemond’s head, Daemon has a tender moment where he helps his ailing brother up the steps. That was Paddy Considine’s last episode. Tell me about filming that.**  


>I was just there admiring Paddy. I think you can see there’s a lot of stuff added that wasn’t really in the script. Over the course of the season, because we’ve worked so closely together and developed a relationship with one another, we were able to be spontaneous in certain moments.  


**Daemon does not seem to age. What’s his secret?**  


>He’s always eating his greens. Gets lots of sleep. And doesn’t give a flying f—."
The Secrets,and what about Ser Criston who also doesn't seem to age at all lol
The Secrets,Bless Matt Smith. The man is a champ
The Secrets,"I was clowning him on those pre-release pics of him in that wig, but man... He's really won me over."
The Secrets,"> He's always eating his greens

I want to believe that's a pun."
The Secrets,Aging is caused by stress. And stressed is caused by problems in your life. And you can't have problems in your life when you're the problem.
The Secrets,"Daemon looking 40 when he was supposed to be 23 also helped. Now that he's 40 and looks 40, it checks out. Also, I had no idea Olivia Cooke was only 28, she doesn't look older at all, but her performance as the Queen/mother carries such a mature quality I don't even see the age issue."
The Secrets,"""Eats his greens""

*laughs in CDI Zelda*"
The Secrets,"Also, a Timelord."
The Secrets,Matt Smith'S portrayal of Daemon is going to be legendary in TV history by the time its over
The Secrets,He’s the Paul Rudd of Westeros
The Secrets,"Or. To put it simply.

They casted Matt Smith to play Daemon during the Dance and decided to not hire another actor to play Young Daemon."
The Secrets,"Characters now have the same appearance they will have until the show ends, so by the time the next seasons release we will forget how some characters didn't seem to age.

Also, not counting the 2 minutes of prologue, ""only"" 17 years have passed since the show started until now (112 AC to 129 AC). People are behaving like everyone should look 30 years older.

In conclusion, don't think too much about it because it won't be a problem anymore."
The Secrets,The real reason is that he’s from Gallifrey.  It’s a secret from everyone.
The Secrets,"Yeah, but he still hasn’t uncovered the secret to growing eyebrows."
The Secrets,"He also forget the most important part  


""-He's a timelord"""
The Secrets,"He also poops his pants, have sex, Ekse"
The Secrets,"Kinda wondering what Greens means in this context, could be veggies could be................"
The Secrets,I thought it was because he was the doctor lol
The Secrets,So this is what the Doctor does nowadays
The Secrets,"Also he's a Time Lord, that's definitely a strong point. :-D"
The Secrets,Is this the man from the hit movie morbius
The Secrets,He looks like he’s in his 50s and doesn’t get enough sunlight..
The Secrets,"They really did a bad job with aging some of the cast. There's that one guy in the closed council that's also stayed the same age for like 20 years, and he was old in the first episode too."
The Secrets,"He would be a great curator, he'd be great at curating what with all that sleep and not giving a f***."
The Secrets,Matt Smith trolling at every turn like the absolute lad he is
The Secrets,MATT DAEMON
The Secrets,"The answer is Daemon is rich 

When you're rich, you have the luxury of not giving a flying f***

You can afford to eat healthy and get lots of sleep"
The Secrets,">Daemon

Brother get the flamer. 

The heavy flamer."
The Secrets,EATING HIS GREENS
The Secrets,Such a goofy looking guy.
The Secrets,And being a Timelord helps alot
The Secrets,"But he fucks, right? He doesn’t give a fuck but he still manages to find time to fuck?"
The Secrets,Not enough mentioning of rheanys. She’s been the same age longer than daemon
The Secrets,"To be fair, he doesn't seem to have aged since he was in Doctor Who"
The Secrets,Daemon sure eats his fair share of greens ;)
The Secrets,Plus the occasional jammy dodger.
The Secrets,That's actually good advice
The Secrets,I want that hair back
The Secrets,And fucks like a dragon.
The Secrets,Aged? The guy is still maturing
The Secrets,I think Viserys isn’t supposed to actually be old. He has leprosy which makes him deteriorate much faster. He’s probably only 50 something when he dies even though he looks like he’s 100
The Secrets,"This is an excellent answer. Very ""Just repeat to yourself 'It's just a show/I should really just relax'"" energy."
The Secrets,I’m tempted to watch this show because Matt Smith is a good actor. But I don’t think I’ll ever trust another GoT related show.
The Secrets,Matt Smith was a bad choice for this role.
The Secrets,"Matt Smith is a UK treasure and if the Brits aren’t careful, we’ll snipe him as one of ours"
The Secrets,The inconsistent aging in this series is ridiculous
The Secrets,This dude looks like if Malfoy and Doogie Howser had a kid
The Secrets,LOL so quirky and random. He's literally me guys XD
The Secrets,The subtle art of not giving a fck - Daemon Targaryen - ^(Mark manson)
The Secrets,Astroturfing much?
The Secrets,"Good genetics,  my mother is 71 and barley looks 50. Has never wore makeup, its just how it is."
The Secrets,I love this man. (Choose your own adventure if you think it’s the actor or the character I’m talking about here 😏)
The Secrets,"The aging on this show is so fucking stupid. The disparity between who ages and who doesn’t is so implausible, that I had to take a break from the show as it was starting to frustrate me."
The Secrets,"hes got a point, hes probably the least stressed person from the royal family"
The Secrets,"And there goes my theory that he was the one who did something to Viserys that somehow made Viserys sick, sapping his lifeline to boost Daemon’s life & health.

Ok no, I’m still maintaining that theory."
The Secrets,Not true. There's no way he hasn't fucked while flying on a dragon
The Secrets,"When you’re born with a shock of white hair, you just don’t care."
The Secrets,He looks like a grown up Joffrey.
The Secrets,Daemon also does a lot of fucking. It’s good for the soul.
The Secrets,I mean sir Christensen too
The Secrets,The Paul Rudd Diet
The Secrets,"Sleep is the most important/ overlooked aspect of maintaining your health. Eating healthy is great but getting enough sleep is far more important. Personally  I have met 40-50 years old who look like 300 year old wendigos all from gettin 1-3 hours of
sleep for the last 20 years."
The Secrets,Flying Fuck should be the name of his dragon.
The Secrets,Matt Smith has the best facial expressions. His eyes rule me
The Secrets,They should cast David tennant as a lanester or something…
The Secrets,Eating. Flying. Hmmm
The Secrets,If Daemon grows old I pray to any and all gods he is played by Peter Capaldi. Please let this be a thing.
The Secrets,He’s an alien 👽
The Secrets,What greens?  They seem to get around one sunny day per year.
The Secrets,And he’s also a time traveller
The Secrets,"I always wondered what possibly could they feed those massive dragons with?

Now it makes sense, they give all the animals to dragons, and all that is left is some vegetables for humans."
The Secrets,"Off topic but I read a twit that went something like this : Criston Cole is a salty man and salt is a  preservative,that's why he still looks young after all these years"
The Secrets,Something about his lack of eyebrows freaks me out
The Secrets,"Daemon has been my favorite since ep 1, I was the only one out of 10 people who liked him, and now they all love him lmaoo"
The Secrets,woah man epic!
The Secrets,I love it when actors become their characters 🤣
The Secrets,I just see a hotter Gordon Ramsay
The Secrets,I wonder if Matt Smith knew he was signing up to be a sex symbol when he took on this role.
The Secrets,What a pointless question to ask the actor and what an even more pointless article to write.
The Secrets,He seemed to really age in this last episode
The Secrets,Am I the only one who thinks this guy looks like he escaped from some government run weaponized albinism program?
The Secrets,he's hot as hell
The Secrets,Can confirm these things don’t help much.
The Secrets,Oh bahahahahahahahhaha it’s a joke quote. So funny I love funny thing and funny quotes so this is totally up my ally. Grandma you always post the best stuff.
The Secrets,Impressive. Lets see Ser Cristons  secret.
The Secrets,"I never really thought about how he has the same actor, while certain characters have three. At least he keeps changing his hairstyle unlike that fuckhead Cole."
The Secrets,[deleted]
The Secrets,"Lmao it’s literally incredible how everything about this production is so much more enjoyable than ROP. 

like the actors in HOTD are more entertaining than the characters in ROP"
The Secrets,I read the title as 'Maggie Smith'. I'm slightly disappointed.
The Secrets,Obviously he gives a fuck about eating greens and getting sleep…
The Secrets,I feel like this could have been a more defining moment for him as a feminist…
The Secrets,I think a lot of people are comparing him with Viserys. Who went from thirty to ninety over the course of the series. On the other hand Daemon went from his late twenties to his late forties. Which is much more reasonable.
The Secrets,He leans too much to carry any stress. He passes it onto all the walls he comes across.
The Secrets,"And eat your greens. Maybe stress-eat some greens, kill two crows with one stone."
The Secrets,literally all 3 of his suggestions are predicated on you having enough money to get all of them
The Secrets,"I don't know, the battle in the step stones might have been stressful. I'm sure he had ""fun"" with it, being kinda crazy, but it seemed like he was really desperate for a win. Had to mess with him some way. 

But when the king offered help, that's when he went all or nothing by 1v1000 the triarchy. When he won, he had fun. If he lost, he would die.

We are past that now. But I think he is more stressed about this than we know"
The Secrets,And insanely rich. You know he’s got maesters whipping up next gen night creams
Black Widow Business,"“One of the most groundbreaking shows I’ve ever seen, 7/10.”"
Black Widow Business,"I loved the first few episodes, but they rushed to slap together an “Avengers-level event” for her to defeat that ended up being pretty lame. I would’ve loved to see more of her day-to-day family life and trying to thwart a few “street level” crimes and whatnot. That said, I get that they had a lot about the character that they wanted to establish with only 6 episodes, but the pacing was kinda bad in the latter part of the season. I’d still put it at an 8/10 though just because of how much I liked the character and her family/adolescent struggles."
Black Widow Business,"My father, who just recently passed, was a geography teacher and when we were kids every once in a while he would bring home some of the films he showed in class and one of those was Blue Men of Morocco.  It was a travelogue style film but I always was curious about the difference in cultures and that was one of the starts and Ms. Marvel took me back to that time.

Ms. Marvel as well as Wandavision and Hawkeye were my favorites on the Disney package."
Black Widow Business,I like how >!Zoe ends up nice the entire time with Kamala  having been more of a bully.!<
Black Widow Business,"If you like the show, I would recommend the first run of the comics. The show gets everything the comic put out right. Kamala is just a loveable character. She is the adorable geeky little sister that everyone wants. MCU lucked out with finding Iman Vellani to play her. She was born to play the role."
Black Widow Business,It took me to the second paragraph to realize I had misread the title and this wasn't about Ms. Maisel.
Black Widow Business,"I thought the show started off really slow but finished strong.  Do I think it is ""groundbreaking?""  No.  But that is pretty much my opinion on all shows / movies."
Black Widow Business,I thought the time traveling was weird.  Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson.  We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures.  I just want to see powered people fight.
Black Widow Business,"It probably is groundbreaking in terms of providing a realistic portrayal of pakistani-american culture to a mass audience. Groundbreaking in the art form of making good TV shows, probably not."
Black Widow Business,"""groundbreaking"" doesn't have to necessarily mean 10 out of 10 to be honest."
Black Widow Business,He's probably a reviewer from 7GN*.
Black Widow Business,It has flaws but it does feel like a gigantic step forward. You can really like something but be aware it has problems. Ms. Marvel gets so much right that while it does has some issues but those issues weren't enough for me to hate it. But I also can't say it's perfect.
Black Widow Business,"You can tell at what point where the showrunner told the story they wanted to do and where Fiege came in to make the show fit in with the rest of the MCU. Because the Jersey part was so alive and well thought out. The Big Bad was almost an afterthought. Like you can hear the, ""Sigh....fine. Here are your MCU fight scenes. Now can we get back to Jersey already?"""
Black Widow Business,They should have deleted the weird Clandestines storyline and made Damage Control the true villains instead.
Black Widow Business,I'm definitely considering it now. Is there an app that has all the old marvel comics?
Black Widow Business,The fact that Spidey is a New Yorker is a *huge* part of the character.
Black Widow Business,">Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson. We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures. I just want to see powered people fight.

Um...okay. 

It's a show about a Pakistani American Muslim superhero. What made of that made you think we wouldn't at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?"
Black Widow Business,How dare they expose you to other cultures and religions!!
Black Widow Business,"But 7/10 ain't ""groundbreaking"" at all lmao"
Black Widow Business,I mean wouldent that atleast warrant a 8 or 9.
Black Widow Business,It's like why do these superheroes have to use super powers? Just focus on a teenage girl and her real life struggles not some comic book powers
Black Widow Business,I mean they were. Kamala beat the aliens with TNJ
Black Widow Business,"Marvel Unlimited.

10 bucks a month, IIRC.

You'd be looking for the 2014 and 2015 series. 19 issues for 2014, 38 for 2015, I believe it was."
Black Widow Business,That's just a setting.  We don't focus on Jersey in ms marvel.
Black Widow Business,"""at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?""

Some is different from it being the main focus.  We don't get much from Fury, Rhody or Sam.  

I don't assume all Asian characters will get magically teleported into a history lesson ."
Black Widow Business,So you thought the time traveling back to old Pakistan via powered bracelets was a natural consequence of the story?  I found it weird.  It's so different from the other marvel projects.  I'd find it just as odd if spiderman wasted time going to church and teleporting back to the war of 1812 for a history lesson.  I liked Kamala and look forward to seeing her in the marvels but just found the show to be a bit of a bore.  The love quandranle was a bit YA for me.
Black Widow Business,Not necessarily. I don't like the first Black Panther or Get Out very much. Both are a solid 5 for me. But I'm also very aware of how they broke new ground and pushed the envelope forward.
Black Widow Business,Thank you! That's very helpful!
Black Widow Business,"Man... it is absolutely not ""just a setting"" with Spider Man. He is about as culturally infused as a character gets, it's just a culture invisible to you because it's so familiar."
Black Widow Business,Did you not Sam's show? His entire story arc was about reckoning America's past with the future that he is supposed to be sent to take up the mantle for. The series pulls from actual Black history like the Tuskegee experiment. If anything this is what makes these projects a lot more interesting than just a bunch of roided dudes punching each other.
Black Widow Business,"> So you thought the time travelling back to old Pakistan via powered bracelets was a natural consequence of the story?

Yes."
Black Widow Business,"Your scale seems really weird.

A 5 is a movie on the line between being worth watching and not.

A good movie that has some issues is like an 8"
Black Widow Business,"Also, if you are an American with a library card, you can download hoopla. That will link you up to your local libraries where many of them have Marvel titles online for you to read. Doing so will support your local libraries and, plus, it's free."
Black Widow Business,New york isn't familiar to me.  To say that new york or chicago are cultures the same way being Muslim is a culture seems asinine.
Black Widow Business,"I thought it had a bunch of weird mixed messaging.  It brought up racism a few times but didn't have anything to say about it.

They have Sam defend someone who murders innocent children saying ""she's not a terrorist, we need to think about why she was upset"" but the show didn't establish what the government was doing wrong."
Black Widow Business,"What, in the story, set up the possibility of time travel?  Did anyone think, before it happened ""Yep, the story naturally sets up that she'll be magically teleported into the past""? 

Do you just expect every character to get sent to the past and get disappointed 99.99999%$ of the time?  Were you upset that Shang's magic rings didn't send him back?

&#x200B;

You are so disingenuous."
Black Widow Business,"""A 5 is a movie on the line between being worth watching and not.""

depends on the scale.  True for 0-10.  I've rated thousands of films on IMDB which uses a 1-10 scale, so there's no middle score.  To me 5 is a tiny bit bad, not worth watching.  6 is good enough to say I like it.  I like that I never straddle a line"
Black Widow Business,"I can recognize if something is really swinging for the fences and going for something big but it not really landing the way it intended. For example, Eternals is a movie I personally love but I can see why others couldn't. It has some pretty large flaws that I'm willing to address but overall that doesn't make me enjoy it less. But I can't give it an 8 or 9 simply because I liked it. There were things that bothered me but I can also recognize that it's trying to go for something new. It's a mixed bag. Ms. Marvel, especially in the first half, was a pretty enjoyable experience for me that was both unlike and similar to what I've seen before. The biggest problems come towards the middle but it brings it back to focus towards the end. I really love what they're doing for most of this but there are parts that upon a rewatch I'll just fast forward through. A 7 seems fair to me."
Black Widow Business,"Because Islam is a religion, not a culture."
Black Widow Business,">> What, in the story, set up the possibility of time travel?

The one that cracks me up the most is Bruno dressing like Marty McFly in episode 2, but the most relevant clues would be the constant references to past events. Nearly every episode (with 2 and 4 having the strongest connection) references Kamala’s family history in some way.

With that being said, I DID exaggerate my response a little. Sorry about that. The **natural** thing to expect here, given all the references, would be a detailed flashback sequence, which is exactly what we got. Time travel just happens to be one way to visually do such a flashback."
Black Widow Business,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic\_culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_culture)

&#x200B;

You don't think religions have cultures?  I can't tell if you agree or can't follow the point.  I don't think putting spider man in Chicago changes much.  He's in Europe for the 2nd film.  Changing Kamala to a Mississippi Christian would change her completely."
Black Widow Business,"The point I’m trying to make is that a religion and a culture are not the same thing. Of course nothing changes when you put Spider-Man in a different culture, culture doesn’t directly change his character. But making Kamala, let’s say a Christian changes things MASSIVELY because you change her religion, which is core to her as a character."
Black Widow Business,That was my point to the other guy too.  To compare Kamala's religion to spiderman's setting is asinine.
Black Widow Business,"Ah, my bad, read the situation wrong."
Black Widow Business,[deleted]
Black Widow Business,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Black Widow Business,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Black Widow Business,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Black Widow Business,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Black Widow Business,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Black Widow Business,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Black Widow Business,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Black Widow Business,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Black Widow Business,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Black Widow Business,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Black Widow Business,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Black Widow Business,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Black Widow Business,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Black Widow Business,🙂💕
Black Widow Business,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Black Widow Business,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Black Widow Business,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Black Widow Business,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Black Widow Business,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Black Widow Business,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Black Widow Business,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Black Widow Business,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Black Widow Business,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Black Widow Business,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Black Widow Business,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Black Widow Business,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Black Widow Business,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Black Widow Business,"I think what really caused this as TV going truly international. In the pre-streaming era, TV shows only released domestically at first - and only on certain channels at certain timeslots. They'd take X months to get to Europe.

Now, most TV shows of acclaim are international basically on day 1."
Black Widow Business,"The format allows for what’s basically an 8-10 hour movie.  People like longer arcs now, even a lot of films are set up as multiple releases."
Black Widow Business,"You mean how paying $80+ to drive to movie theater, stand in a line and be surrounded by loud strangers during the movie lost it’s appeal."
Black Widow Business,"I barely watch movies or go to the movies anymore. Tv imo is so much better now, drowning in content old and new"
Black Widow Business,"Popcorn is less than $10 a box at my house. That’s the main thing.

Bought a projector, a retractable screen and reasonable sound system and saved a fortune on taking the family to the movies. Who the fuck can afford four tickets + snack gouging? 

And now I get to stream stuff early and watch HoTD on a 3 metre screen too. 

Fuck the damn cinemas"
Black Widow Business,"When a TV show is good, it’s amazing but there’s a lot of filler content in series. 

Nothing really beats the pacing and feeling of a magnificent 2 hour movie for me. It takes me out of the world and makes me present in the moment like a tv show doesn’t really do until 4-6 hours in.

It took 8 episodes for me to actually get into HotD."
Black Widow Business,The jump in quality of recent tv shows coupled with covid really knocked out the movie industry.
Black Widow Business,"TV is great at providing a lot of quality content and has a lot more opportunities for mid-budget stuff, but most TV is not great at exploring themes. It may start and end with a theme, but that theme serves mostly as bookends to entertainment (sometimes filler). 

Take something like Succession, which I love. It said what it had to say about high society, capitalism, and power dynamics by the end of season 1, and will probably conclude with some other observation, but until then it’s just (very interesting and captivating) plot and characterisation.

That’s fine, but as an artistic medium, I still feel like film is more efficient. In a good movie, every scene should drive the theme because there is a time constraint. 

You’ll get way more out of 4 great 2-hour films than an 8h season of a great show."
Black Widow Business,Movies need to stop thinking they're the grown up novel of this industry.  They're the short story or play equivalent.
Black Widow Business,">Check the IMDb Starmeter, a fairly reliable tool designed to gauge the most famous people in the world. Just three of the Top 10 at time of writing are movie stars, with Brendan Fraser at No 2, Austin Butler at No 5 and Florence Pugh at No 7.

... Who the fuck are Austin Butler and Florence Pugh? Is Brendan Fraser really #2?"
Black Widow Business,Similar to your point about streaming: tv failed to me because I could NEVER watch all the episodes front to back. I’d have to wait for marathons to see how shows that I like began. With streaming I’ll never have that issue again.
Black Widow Business,"That's where mini series come in, can be best of both worlds"
Black Widow Business,"100% agree. 

There’s very few tv shows that can ever compete with the best movies out there. There’s so much filler that it gets watered down into just a series of events. 

Movies have to be so excessively precise with how it spends its time that they have the ability to be more razor sharp with what they want to say. 

Not to mention the camerawork is nearly always so much worse on tv. Euphoria and Better Call Saul and maybe a few others can maybe compete with film cinematography but storytelling through camerawork is basically nonexistent on tv. 

The rule with great movies is you should be able to understand what’s going on in a movie just by its camerawork and character blocking and that’s almost never true with tv because there’s no way to get that precious with its cinematography when you need 10 hours of content. So it just amounts to a lot of over the shoulder shots and the occasional master shot with flat lighting. Aka what marvel blockbusters do. 

I’m very selective with tv cause the quality just isn’t there for me and it always feels too padded out. Like the show Normal People knocked me out by how great it was. Just one of my favorites seasons of television ever but it was too padded out to really zero in on the theme of socioeconomic classes hurting the central relationship even though that was the main theme of the show. It would’ve been much better as a movie."
Black Widow Business,I would say they’re still the novel. TV is more like the pulpy book series since writers tend to shit out whatever is on their mind for 5 years before trying to tie it all together (if given the chance)
Black Widow Business,"> Austin Butler

Have you heard of the Elvis movie at all? And how dare you, Brendan Fraser is having a renaissance."
Black Widow Business,"> Florence Pugh?

Ever heard of Midsommar?"
Black Widow Business,"Not to worry you, but Florence Pugh is actually pretty fecking popular right now."
Black Widow Business,"Yeah ""designed to gauge the most famous people in the world"" is kind of misleading, as far as I can tell it's designed to gauge who most people are looking up on IMDb recently, which obviously isn't the same thing as ""most famous"" at all

Having said that, it's bizarre that you've managed not to hear of Florence Pugh"
Black Widow Business,how do you not know florence pugh? she's been in so many hits the past few years
Black Widow Business,[deleted]
Black Widow Business,[removed]
Black Widow Business,"> Ever heard of Midsommar?

I wish I hadn't that movie was awful."
Black Widow Business,Probably because all of her movies are awful and are mostly aimed at women.
Black Widow Business,"Florence Pugh is regarded as one of the best young actresses in the world. She starred in a TV show helmed by Park Chan-Wook of all people, absolutely carried *Midsommar* on her shoulders in her breakout role, was in the Oscar-nominated *Little Women*, starred in *Lady MacBeth*, is going to be in *Oppenheimer* and *Dune: Part Two*, and was just in a movie with one of the noisiest press cycles in a while.

Oh, and she’s a huge Marvel star. You’re insane."
Black Widow Business,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted. She's everywhere right now (don't mean that as a bad thing either, she's a phenomenal actor)."
Black Widow Business,Terrible take.
Miracles,This is a child actor going off the rails done RIGHT.
Miracles,I'm still amazed this show hasn't been cancelled yet. Not that I want it to be or anything. It just seems like one of those shows that would be cancelled by now.
Miracles,Can't wait for the next season
Miracles,I fucking love Daniel Radcliffe.
Miracles,"I love that he has that Harry Potter money and he can just do whatever the fuck he wants now. 

Be free man!"
Miracles,"I watched the first season and enjoyed it, but from there it seemed to be a different conceit each season, at least looking at the trailers. Is there a link between the first season and the others, or is each it's own stand alone thing? I'm guessing Buscemi doesn't return?"
Miracles,Without context this scene is something. What is going on in this?
Miracles,yeah she came alright
Miracles,MISTER POTTER!
Miracles,Show was way different and more broad after Simon Rich left but it’s still funny as hell!
Miracles,Harry fell on hard times after the whole “defund the Aurors” movement.
Miracles,[deleted]
Miracles,[deleted]
Miracles,rumor has it that this coming season will be the last. :(
Miracles,Each renewal has been as surprising.
Miracles,"If only that you have no idea why the first season is about some angels trying to convince a god not to destroy the world on a bet, and then the second season is the same actors in medieval times shoveling shit and not working miracles."
Miracles,"For real, I fucking love that he does shit like this, Swiss Army Man, Guns Akimbo and the Weird Al Movie was probably the best movie I watched last year."
Miracles,"It is the anthology comedy. First season is about God, second season is about medieval time, third season is about the Wild West. The fourth season is about the Judgement Day.  I really hope that they can do a Star Trek or Star War parody.  BTW, the first and second season were based on the books written by the creator of the show."
Miracles,"Buscemi is actually in this clip! The one that makes the ""oh"" face and yes he's in all 3 and the upcoming fourth seasons. Each season is based on one of Simon Richs short stories, so different stories every season but recurring themes and character dynamics/relationships. For instance, for two of the actors their characters always end up together. I think the 3rd season was the best so far."
Miracles,The second season is my favorite!
Miracles,"Its an anthology series, same actors each season with different stories and settings, in season three Radcliffe plays a reverend on the Oregon Trail who has feelings for his best friend, a married woman. Here he is drunk on snake oil dealing with his feelings in the best possible way."
Miracles,First time ive seen it. Not everybody lives on Reddit man.
Miracles,Yes
Miracles,"Reply that to every ""Wednesday"" post."
Miracles,"Don’t fool yourself, the UK had plenty of issues with how they treat children on TV — just look at Jimmy Savile."
Miracles,"Nah, it comes down to your parents. For example Rick Schroeder only went off the rails in his 40s because of a divorce. as a child actor his parents did not live off of his TV salary so he was never the breadwinner or the one paying his parents."
Miracles,"> Emma would be building an apocalypse bunker

I mean who’s to say she isn’t?"
Miracles,"In the UK they have wonderful people looking after the children, like Jimmy Saville. I heard he shared a special bond with many children."
Miracles,"He is an executive producer, so I think he will be in all of it."
Miracles,‘Drunk’
Miracles,[deleted]
Miracles,Didn't he mistreat children *off* TV?
Miracles,What other word would you use?
Miracles,"I see what you are saying, ""Those are okay because they are corporate shills, but this thing that people like is wrong."" Sound logic."
Miracles,Nah it's just the only one that works without context.
Miracles,"Bro, the last time it was posted was a year ago. Also I'm just rewatching the show and this is one of my favorite scenes, thats all there is to it."
Miracles,"Uhhh, yes."
Miracles,Both
Miracles,The snake oil salesman says the next morning it wasn’t effective snake oil. So it was just him being himself. So it wasn’t in reference to the word and more in reference to him letting loose while assuming he was getting ‘drunk’ or ‘drugged up’.
Miracles,[deleted]
Miracles,"Well I mean he is a snake oil salesman, it isn’t really a prop using opinion from him that it isn’t “effective”, like what is the end goal of snake oil? I’m pretty certain it isn’t dressing up as a flamboyant wwe wrestler pelvic thrusting to she be coming (cumming in the version?) around the mountain and so maybe he meant that Zeke suffered bad side effects."
Miracles,"This 2013 account poster is not botty, he's previously talking about non-binary fetuses and his own personal stuff. Is this the Sadcliffe you're going to die on? ;)

I also might leave /television, it's really nothing but instructions telling you what to consume."
Miracles,"Not sure I follow. From my perspective it not having any impact on him played into the plot with Zeke and Prudence. That his prolonged repressed feelings being let loose was relieving for him and let Pru see his wild side, yet also all at once made him go too far to the point of offending her. And it just being himself, not drunk/drugged, makes him vulnerable the following morning to own it and open up to Pru about his feelings for her."
Miracles,"See and I think it did have an effect on him. Snake oil wasn’t a legit medicine, they through in some things they new was healthy and a bunch of other shit. The salesman might have believed it would cure an illness but not cause someone to be high as fuck when using it. So it is either a case of bad writing, which caused Zeke to go too far off the deep end or they made him do shit like see satan when in reality it would’ve been better to tone it down a bit but make him cocky and flirty."
Miracles,"Delayed to TBD, but yesterday somehow HBO Max in Europe (accidentally??) released the first episode lol"
Miracles,Episode 1 of season 4 was released somewhere in the world because it is available thru illegal means.
Miracles,"My guess is theyre doing exactly what they did to ""Chad"". Finish producing it as obligated and then try to sell it. The difference is they likely cant do a write down anymore so still airing it might be an option."
Miracles,"""I have never tried real rat before, thank you so much""

Reaches for a filthy fork next to the plate.

""What are you doing? Thats a cockroach fork, thats a rat fork"""
Miracles,"Dana White slapping his wife has affected all of TBS's schedule, not just his Extreme Slapping show"
Miracles,Run by a bunch of clowns.  TNT(same company) just decided not to air Snowpiercer s4 even though it's done filming.
Miracles,It's available on a couple of illegal sites
Miracles,Anyone seen episode 2? Cant find it anywhere.
Miracles,[deleted]
Miracles,"I’m still salty about Chad. Season 2 is complete, just release it already or sell it cheap to a service that’ll stream it or something. It’s a unique, hilarious show and deserves to be released."
Miracles,Same thing happened to Franklin and Bash
Miracles,It's not available the first episode was released on accident it seems like
Miracles,"Good news, thank you!"
Miracles,"It was sold to Roku, theres no air date yet though."
Miracles,Yes right? I saw the date for episode 2 was 23 January or something. So it just stopped?
Miracles,Glad to hear it!
Miracles,I really hope they don't vault this last (probably) season of Miracle Workers  I know that might seem like an overreaction but Warner is just doing so much wild stuff right now. I'm also wondering what will happen with Tacoma FD
Miracles,"I adore Miracle Workers but if it gets cancelled after this season, I am fine. Each season is a self contained story with simply the same set of actors. Yes, like American Horror Story. But a comedic version of it. And the cast seem to have such fun with it and with each other. 

Sad that we will never see a Ancient Greece or Roman version though. I think that would have been fun to see. I like the idea of Steven Buscemi of playing a Julius Caesar type character who is just too thick to realize that everyone wants him dead. With Radcliffe playing a hapless general trying to prevent his assassination and Viswanathan playing his wife trying convince him that an assassination is exactly what is called for because Caesar is too stupid to rule."
Miracles,"""I have never tried real rat before, thank you so much"", Radcliffe

Reaches for a filthy fork next to the plate.

""What are you doing? Thats a cockroach fork, thats a rat fork"", Buscemi"
Miracles,"Huh. But the first episode of Miracle Workers is up on HBO Max (in Europe, at least) since a few days ago. So it did premiere… just not on TBS."
Miracles,They've given no one any reason to trust that they will ever actually air
Miracles,ep 1 of Miracle workers was a good start. looking forward to this season
Miracles,With any luck TBS is shopping miracle workers to someone else that will carry the torch.
Miracles,Was hoping for a hard Sci-fi setting for MW S5 but that's a mere pipedream now.
Miracles,"I'm pretty convinced Miracle Workers somehow finagled a S4 out of thin air and now regret is setting in from Warner since they drastically changed formats and this doesn't fit anymore.

 I think the show is fun as hell and wished more people saw it, but even getting this season (eventually) I'm happy about. So, I'll take what I can get and be happy I get to see Daniel Radcliff as Mad Max"
Miracles,"TBS is just the distributor.  They can't shop it anywhere because they don't own it or make it.

It's made by Broadway Video, the company that Lorne Michaels owns, and since they have a relationship with NBC, it's not completely out of the question that a fifth season could end up on Peacock."
Miracles,ah!  thanks for for info! anywhich way I really hope we get to see season 4 and hopefully get a season 5 and beyond
Miracles,"This is such a silly, silly show. I love it to pieces. I would love to be at the first table read of each season just to see the look on the faces of the actors when they find out what the season's theme is going to be."
Miracles,"Since TBS got rid of the rest of their original scripted series, this will probably be its last season unless HBO Max picks it up."
Miracles,i looooove this show. it’s got so much heart.
Miracles,Will we get another wacky singing session by Daniel?
Miracles,This show just keeps getting more ridiculous and I am loving every minute of it.
Miracles,I hope they can do a Sci-fi setting like a Trek inspired thing.
Miracles,I still think the show is going to end with it being revealed that every season was just God and the workers from season 1 acting out things for his amusement
Miracles,Oh my God a mad max style season. Ive been waiting for this
Miracles,Yay! I didn't know it had been renewed
Miracles,"I watched season 1 and thought it was just OK.

Then a couple of months back I shared season 2 with a friend who likes the medieval theme and we had a great time.

But we didn't jump straight in season 3, was it any good?"
Miracles,"I don't know why, but I really want them to spend the last 5 minutes of this season wrapping it back around to the first season some how. I think I just want 5 more minutes of Buscemi playing God."
Miracles,This show fell off after season 1
Miracles,People who work on the show have already confirmed they've been told this is the final season.
Miracles,"If that's the case, they should subtitle it accordingly. Maybe something like ""End Times""."
Miracles,And hbo max ain’t spending any money right now so I doubt they will snatch anything up for years.
Miracles,"Yes. The third season is The Oregon Trail. Bandits, pioneers and Radcliffe having a really fantastic moment in a saloon. (You'll know it when you see it.)"
Miracles,"Season 3 they get real weird with it, in a good way. I'd say all the seasons are about on par with each other, but get more ridiculous as they go on (in a good way). They are leaning into it more"
Miracles,"S3 was my favourite, though I know people who disagree."
Miracles,"I loved season 1, season 2 threw me off because it wasn’t related at all to season 1 so I stopped watching."
Miracles,Damn really? That’s such a shame. One of my favorites but I’m not surprised and am just glad we got this many episodes out of it.
Miracles,"[For anyone who wants to be spoiled, or just rewatch lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ9C1U_SPoA)"
Miracles,"I’m not sure why you are getting downvoted. It’s a very valid reason to lose interest. 

My wife and I are watching it for the first time and I vaguely knew the premise and it was a new time period every season, but my wife didn’t and she really enjoyed S1, but has lost all interest in S2."
Miracles,"Having completely forgetten this show had a season 3, this seals the deal on what I'm binging the next few days."
Miracles,"I was so stoned the first time I saw this episode and was mesmerized. 

I am so appreciative of Daniel Radcliffe’s career choices. He never disappoints."
Miracles,I will always rewatch this when I see a link.
Miracles,"I mean it could’ve been fairly simple to tie them together. Have an excuse to send them down to those times to live through someone else’s perspective.

Which is what I thought until I googled that they’re just anthologies."
Miracles,It's really good. I really enjoyed the premise.
Miracles,I generally recommend it to folks who need a methadone show to recover from *The Good Place* addiction. :)  I'm just sad they only had the one season.
Miracles,Anecdotally it seems Portuguese fits in more words per minute than the average language. The subtitles are flying by far faster than I’m accustomed to. Great show though! Hopefully it comes back for a season two so the cliffhanger is resolved.
The Salisbury Poisonings,"It's not an AMC show. It's an AMC+ show.  You have to pay the sub to view it, which means nobody's going to see it."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Such a shame, along with ""Gangs Of London"" - they're seem like really good shows, but way less people will see it because it's exclusive to the streaming platform - why couldn't they just air it on AMC as well?"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"My sentiments exactly.  Or at least let us know it's eventually going to air on AMC and not take more than a year to do it. *Riviera* S2 hit Sundance Now back in June 2019. It has yet to hit Sundance Channel.  S1 was on Sundance Now in Sept. 2017. It only hit Ovation February of 2019.

It's not like cord cutters have cable access. And if it weren't for cable and cable viewers  there wouldn't even *be* any AMC networks (AMC, BBC America, Sundance Channel, Shudder, IFC, etc.) to conglomerate into a streaming service."
The Salisbury Poisonings,A Queen Margot prequel?
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Catherine,  lmfao"
The Salisbury Poisonings,A Starz period drama? No thank you
The Salisbury Poisonings,Black Sails is damn near great
The Salisbury Poisonings,Da Vinci's Demons was on Starz and its old favorite of mine
The Salisbury Poisonings, it works two out of three times
The Salisbury Poisonings,The problem was he didnt strike a pose or put much effort into his presentation. Amateur
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Kite Man, hell yeah!"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"He kept the fucking mask on.

I'm dead.

Hell yeah."
The Salisbury Poisonings,[deleted]
The Salisbury Poisonings,Trying to fuck the plant lady who hates almost all humans and could probably kill you with toxic spores in her body. Bold move Kite Man.
The Salisbury Poisonings,This show is hilarious. Is Kite Man an actual DC comicbook character?
The Salisbury Poisonings,Frank was the best part
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Episode 2 was infinitely better than episode 1. 

Also, Alan Tudyk was born to play Joker. Best part of the show."
The Salisbury Poisonings,Kite man and bane were hilarious in this episode
The Salisbury Poisonings,"That explicit reference to having sex kinda threw me.  I would've figured an animated about super-heroes wouldn't reference that at all, so I assume this is more of an adult animated sitcom?"
The Salisbury Poisonings,That extra zoom on the briefs got me good.
The Salisbury Poisonings,"JB Smoove as the plant caught me completely by surprise and I had a laughing/coughing fit on the bus. This dude is funny, he killed me as Dat Frog Kurtis as well"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Is this how you get laid other Barry? 

Guess not."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Hahaha, Kiteman’s briefs are like little boy whitey-tighty briefs where the fly and waistband are a different color. Not a sexy single colored briefs..."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"This is a fun show. Not for kids. I really like Alan Tudyk as Joker. Lots of people would know him as Wash in Firefly, but he does some great voice work. He did K2 in Rogue One among several others. He's linked to DC for Mr. Nobody in Doom Patrol."
The Salisbury Poisonings,I found him and Bane to be hilarious.
The Salisbury Poisonings,"I didn't even know this show was a thing, going to check it out now."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Kite Man, hell yeah"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Everything I've seen of this show redefines ""trying too hard""

But this did make me laugh."
The Salisbury Poisonings,I like how he kept the helmet on.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Was that JB Smoove as talking plant? Lol
The Salisbury Poisonings,"It's kind of jarring that this has the voice acting, design, and cheap animation style of a kid's show with this dialog."
The Salisbury Poisonings,Where do I watch this show?
The Salisbury Poisonings,What is this show?
The Salisbury Poisonings,What a kite tease
The Salisbury Poisonings,I loved the banter between Kite Man and Ivy. I thought he would stick around in the end and sneak a kiss when she was reviving those kids.
The Salisbury Poisonings,"60 percent of the time it works, every time."
The Salisbury Poisonings,This show is hilarious
The Salisbury Poisonings,"He's clearly not doing the naked man, he's covered"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Heheh. He's got a point at the end, though. A cab would've been faster."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"I've never even heard of this but the dialogue sounds very, very natural"
The Salisbury Poisonings,This is awful
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Is this on/going to be on Hulu at some point? I don't have cable, but this looks hilarious."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"i didnt think this was creative or funny at all, do people upvote this because it has batman characters?"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Every clip I see of this show makes it look worse and worse, yikes"
The Salisbury Poisonings,wait where is this airing i need this!
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Have to admit, i was surprised at the adult humour."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Kite Man, Hell Yeah!"
The Salisbury Poisonings,Ok this has been kind of driving me crazy the animation style reminds me of some other show and I can't figure out what it is. Anyone have any ideas? (Been thinking Venture Bros but its not 1:1)
The Salisbury Poisonings,This is the first I'm even hearing of this series but I would watch it just for Frank the plant.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Okay so I had no idea this was Batman at first and I pictured a guy on a hang glider completely in the nude descending on a large poison ivy patch and skimming his junk along the top of the leaves before crashing full on into the patch.
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Ok maybe I should give the series a shot. Been off and on about it (and the fact we're not getting Ivy/Harley Season 1 pushed me off), but I like how they did this without making kiteman dislikeable."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"So like a certain type of dude.  /smh  

Dude: ""But, but...she SMILED at me.""

Everyone Else: She's a store greeter, it's her JOB.

Dude: ""Nah, I can tell.  She TOTALLY wants me!"""
The Salisbury Poisonings,"The problem was he covered his schlong, so it didn’t catch her off guard hard enough."
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Holy crap that was probably the shittiest dialogue I've heard since I was forced to watch an episode of Riverdale.

Yeah I'll be skipping this series. Unless they get new writers. God damn."
The Salisbury Poisonings,Big venture brothers energy
The Salisbury Poisonings,"You people are super easily amused.

""Haha! Comic book characters that don't usually talk about sex stuff are talking about sex stuff! Haha!""

Edit: OP 100% works for DC. No doubt."
The Salisbury Poisonings,Looks like a great show
The Salisbury Poisonings,This show is terrible and you should all feel bad for watching this.
The Salisbury Poisonings,I really want to watch this show - how do I legally do that in the UK?
The Salisbury Poisonings,This is like venture bros with superheroes. Love it
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Yo, she didn't kick him out or seem disgusted. I think she's down. Just not now. 

Am I wrong?"
The Salisbury Poisonings,Sorry but this show is pure shit. It feels like it was written by edgy 13 year olds to make other 13 year olds laugh.
The Salisbury Poisonings,"I haven’t watched any of this, is it any good? Looks like it"
The Salisbury Poisonings,Are people actually enjoying this show? I just don't see the charm.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Sold. Hell yeah.
The Salisbury Poisonings,What show is this and why have I never heard of it?
The Salisbury Poisonings,Where can i watch this?
The Salisbury Poisonings,"If he pulled the Costanza pose he would have had success.  Big mistake just laying there.

The Salisbury Poisonings,Is this a new show?
The Salisbury Poisonings,I feel like the opportunity for a good pun was lost here...
The Salisbury Poisonings,Haven't watched this yet but from the reactions this episode inparticular got they said this show is like a worse Venture Bros.
The Salisbury Poisonings,There's a Harley series? I gotta check that out.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Need to start watching this show. Every clip has me dying.
The Salisbury Poisonings,What show is this? Looks amazing!
The Salisbury Poisonings,We all know a cab would've been faster
The Salisbury Poisonings,Watched this yesterday with my brother. Kite Man is and always has been a tool.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Hell yeah!
The Salisbury Poisonings,Ivy's plant sounds like Leon Black
The Salisbury Poisonings,Glad to see Mark Lilley doing work
The Salisbury Poisonings,What series is this?
The Salisbury Poisonings,What is this
The Salisbury Poisonings,Where is this show available
The Salisbury Poisonings,I thought kite man was plastic man?
The Salisbury Poisonings,I am so lost
The Salisbury Poisonings,Just watched episode 1 after seeing this. I like the show so far.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Where does this air?
The Salisbury Poisonings,IHE is throwing up somewhere
The Salisbury Poisonings,This is not the batman cartoon I remember
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Uh, what show is this!?"
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Was he originally supposed to be fully naked, animated dick and everything?  Because him covering up with more blanket in order to not be anymore covered up was kind of odd."
The Salisbury Poisonings,So if a villian comes on top of him while flying he'll never see him coming because he has a giant kite on his back...
The Salisbury Poisonings,This show is surprisingly funny. I didn’t really know what to expect but it’s good for the first two episodes. I feel like all the DC Universe stuff is good tv. I watched the first season of Titans and swamp thing. I enjoyed those a lot.
The Salisbury Poisonings,Hello fellow whites
The Salisbury Poisonings,"Neat, where do I watch it?

""Streaming from 'DC Universe', available only in North America.""

Oh. I guess I don't."
The Salisbury Poisonings,Where can I watch this?
The Salisbury Poisonings,"I can see this working for a guy, and I can also see the look on his face when the girl asks him later where he got the move."
The Salisbury Poisonings,Soni take it this is an adult series then
The Salisbury Poisonings,Where can I watch this?
The Salisbury Poisonings,why do all these clips have burned in subs...
The Salisbury Poisonings,what streaming service is this on?
Crazy Delicious,John Early is just a fucking godsend. He’s been so good in everything from Wet Hot American Summer First Day Of Camp to The Characters and all of his comedy bang bang appearances are so great
Crazy Delicious,It has good ratings as well. I guess I found another show to watch. Thanks!
Crazy Delicious,Watched only 2 episodes and didn't like any of the characters.
Crazy Delicious,I believe we have one of these posts each week. I tried to get into it but just couldn't. I didn't like any of the characters and it just didn't click.
Crazy Delicious,"I loved it, but the the ending of 3 season was underwhelming for me."
Crazy Delicious,I'm still working through the first season and I love it so far. The actors all do a wonderful job and the writing is super sharp. It also nails the trendy hippy yuppy millennial culture that's popular in cities in a fun lighthearted satire way. Solid guest appearances too!
Crazy Delicious,"I remember seeing ads for it when the first season aired, and I was skeptic because it was on TBS, and they’ve never really struck me as the place that would have profound shows, but the show did look intriguing. I unfortunately skipped it first season because it was hard to find. Then, when the second season aired, they put all the episodes back up on their site, so I watched it. 

God damn, it was so good. The wait for season 3 drove me insane. I’m just glad season 4 had gotten most of its filming done before the pandemic, so I doubt it’s gone be nearly as long of a wait"
Crazy Delicious,"I just watched season 3. 
I find this show to be super solid overall. It didn't have a sophomore slump like a lot of shows do. 
The acting is great  and so is the dark comedy. The characters aren't likable but they were never meant to. 
One of season 3's highlights was the lawyer. Too bad she got fired."
Crazy Delicious,"I'm interested, but maybe take out the 'ends in tragedy' spoiler? :( like, I'm gonna go in now knowing that the whole first season is going to culminate in failure, which takes some of the tension out of it"
Crazy Delicious,"Seasons one and two made me believe that a regular world was inhabited by these trash people. Then, the ""Arrested Development"" style absurdity of the trial left a sour taste in my mouth."
Crazy Delicious,So does no one in the Search Party universe have any kind of security locks on their phones or computers?
Crazy Delicious,I just heard today he’s in the show Hollywood too! Though I haven’t gotten around to watching it yet I hear it’s supposed to be right up my alley 😏
Crazy Delicious,Just don’t watch any trailers.
Crazy Delicious,I think this is by design. It's similar to Girls in that way. But I can understand if that's not palatable to watch.
Crazy Delicious,"I can say that I often abandon shows because I don’t like the characters. I left Mad Men at season three. I’ll probably go back at some point. 

But this show is personal to me because of the Elliot character."
Crazy Delicious,"Wait until you watch more and *hate* them! But really, Search Party is a far darker show than it lets on in the very beginning. It is social commentary, and not just of Brooklyn hipsters."
Crazy Delicious,"Yeah the show reminds me a bit of You’re the Worst in that the main characters are shitty people. I enjoyed it for the humor, but I never found myself rooting for anyone except Portia at times"
Crazy Delicious,"Same here. The last bit of S3 left me with a really sour taste in my mouth. S2 remains the high point for me personally, but S3 still had great moments and I LOVED Shalita Grant."
Crazy Delicious,"Shalita Grant was great, but just the way the trial ended up was really underwhelming."
Crazy Delicious,[deleted]
Crazy Delicious,"I agree. I loved the snack gag, but a lot of the stuff like the “breast implants” line and the show of hands bit were just bad. They didn’t land comedically and they really hurt the realism of the show.

Fantastic show, and season 3 was great despite a few missteps."
Crazy Delicious,"If he's in it, it's not credited on his IMDB 🤔"
Crazy Delicious,"Nah, I don't do trailers. I always read non-spoiling reviews. Thanks for the heads up though"
Crazy Delicious,"Absolutely! I read before and now agree it’s supposed to be an unflattering take on the rich hipster Brooklyn types. I know people that can’t get into other shows for similar reasons (like Succession characters being unlikable and my friend couldn’t be bothered to care about rich people problems), and I can agree to an extent but I’m here for the story, and for me anyways, I don’t have to like the characters to like the story, though I know some people like to have someone to root for."
Crazy Delicious,Are you an Elliot or know an Elliot lol?
Crazy Delicious,"The ending scenes weren’t so bad that it ruined it for me at all! I still think over all, episode to episode, it’s my favorite season. And YES Shalita Grant fucking knocked it out the park! I had to rewind multiple of her scenes because I’d start laughing so hard and miss the next thing that was said. Best comedy take on a tv character lawyer I’ve ever seen!"
Crazy Delicious,"I will, I just know that I won't be as invested in season one, because the tension of 'will they save this person' is gone."
Crazy Delicious,"Oh ya, I don’t see him there either. Maybe I misremembered or my friend was mistaken? Sorry for false info!"
Crazy Delicious,Perfect! I hope you enjoy it :)
Crazy Delicious,"I used to be an Elliot. It took years of therapy, meditation, and major life changes to learn not to. It’s almost like being an alcoholic. I have to catch myself still to this day. 

Honestly, it felt good to see someone like him on television. I’m hoping he finds some real redemption."
Crazy Delicious,[deleted]
Crazy Delicious,I’m glad you chose to better yourself :)
Crazy Delicious,[deleted]
Crazy Delicious,"I know of at least one close friend in a former friend group who made efforts not to hang out with me after awhile. 

Part of my recovery was realizing that most people saw through me. I felt really bad about the people over the years who tried to tell me. Part of the problem is that I’m a very nice and friendly person who always treats people with respect. Heck, my best friend of several years was completely tuned into it and I didn’t realize until I started confronting the problem. He never stopped loving me, though. 

Elliot’s story is so tragic. I’m very glad someone showed a character like this. I feel like this needs to be talked about more. There are people - I’m tearing up right now - who, like me, are wasting their entire lives trying to keep their stories straight. It’s really tragic and they’re doing it to themselves. 

I will tell you that I did save my stepdaughter. She always told tall tales, almost as soon as she learned to talk. I was very sympathetic and caring as we broke her of the habit. She has grown to be a wonderful, confident, and successful woman. She thanks me all the time for it. Her Facebook post to me on Father’s Day was mostly about thanking me for putting her on the right track. She tells anyone who will listen that I am the reason for her being who she is. 

It’s my greatest achievement. And that’s the truth."
Crazy Delicious,[deleted]
Crazy Delicious,"Well, that’s the same for me, except it was 12-35. 

It may be harder for a teenager, for we started when she was around nine. Let’s say her name is Robin (it isn’t). We created a place called Robinworld. Anything that felt like a lie was from Robinworld. It’s ok to think it, just know where that thought stays. Soon she learned how important honesty was in the real world.  Again, she was young and she did it because she had an overactive imagination, so this played into it. I don’t know about you or your sister, but mine started from the trauma of being a poor black child in a smallish city who was transported across town to a gifted program that only had rich white kids. It started small. “Have you read this new X-men comic?” “Yeah.” Crap like that. Eventually I was inventing a whole backstory that made me more interesting, or so I thought. Always being the odd man out and trying to compensate for it became my MO. I spent my young adulthood moving from place to place. Once I’d lied my way too far into a corner, it was time to leave. 

If anything share her that story. A gifted child leaves the hood. He could have been anything, but his lies kept him chasing his tail for his entire life. Now he lives with a severe heart condition and nothing but regrets for a life that never was. Luckily I met Robins mother. It still took years for me to change, but eventually I did. 

But, I’ll be perfectly honest with you, I cherish everyday I have with my wife, but I hope for reincarnation, because I need a chance to try again."
Crazy Delicious,Am I really the one pissed off at the beginning of the last episode? Why on earth would they arrest Luther for murder of Ripley and attempted murder of Mary? That didn't make any sense whatsoever. 
Crazy Delicious,"I am still haunted by the way the killer in the first episode of season 3 slithered out from under that women's bed. NOPE. 

Now I need to check under my bed before going to sleep, thanks Luther. "
Crazy Delicious,"The antagonists - Paul Ellis and Marwood were clichés. Paul Ellis as a serial killer is setup beautifully in episode 1, but doesn't live up to in episode 2. Marwood doesn't even come close to being a believable character. When you compare  them to Cameron Pell and the Twins from Season 2, you will realize how relatively bad Ellis and Marwood were, as characters.

Stark - all bark, no bite. There was no investigative work done by him. All he was interested in was turning people against Luther. As compared to 'Luther' standards, his attempts were rather mediocre and he seemed like a rather unintelligent character, failing to piece together simplest of things. Like in the last episode, how easily he and Erin went outside to look for Luther, without caring about exit points and how easily Alice was able to get in and escape with Mary.

Schenk and Ripley were absolutely wasted this season. I would have preferred on main antagonist for 4 episodes - pursue him to the fullest - more interaction between and the supporting cast - some solid police work and investigation, accompanied by the twisted ideas of Luther to catch the said antagonist.  



"
Crazy Delicious,Can't wait for the rumoured movie.
Crazy Delicious,"I was very turned off by this season, I felt like the writers cut corners when developing the plot that make no sense when scrutinised.

This is only really apparent in the last two episodes, but the biggest one for me was the very end of episode 3. When Marwood is trying to escape from Ripley but arbitrarily can't get past the fence, then as soon as he's murdered Ripley, he's able to move the fence and get away. It really killed any sense of believability in that episode and the finale. Really disappointed with the lacklustre writing effort."
Crazy Delicious,"I agree: 1>3>2. This season was particularly emotionally wrenching, and that would normally be good, but I think the death of Ripley was pretty unnecessary. I suppose it makes sense in that particular scene, but I think we could've gone without the quarreling then the immediate murder (I'm looking at you, Neil Cross)! 

I did really love the return of Alice. And yeah, she did nod at Luther on that rooftop. She was willing to die for what Luther thought he wanted, because she loved him that much. I also loved the ambiguity of Luther's response when Marwood asks him to choose one. He chooses Alice, but then more clearly shouts for him to shoot Alice. You could see the confusion even on Alice's face. I thought his responses showcased his complete uncertainty of what to do. I don't know if I'm interpreting the scene correctly but the glances they exchanged were enough for me to be on board with them going on the run together. "
Crazy Delicious,"there will be no season 4, neil cross hath spoken - 

> During a BBC Radio 4 interview in March 2012, co-creator Neil Cross revealed that plans were being made for a Luther film that would begin production at the conclusion of the third series, the show's last."
Crazy Delicious,"Ripley dying sucked, I always liked his character and he was already tortured in Season 2! Poor guy just couldn't catch a break. I was disappointed that they just glossed over the aftermath of Luther finding out about his involvement in the investigation and then hearing the tape of Riley defending him. I guess that's what makes his death all the more tragic, the poor guy being manipulated into turning against Luther, but came to his senses in the end and spoke up for him.

The beginning of the finale felt rushed, the reasoning being Luther getting arrested was rather ridiculous and I doubt would have ever been approved, but then Alice appeared and it all got better. Not much else I can say about the finale that OP hasn't already been said, I think that the nod Alice gave was a sign of approval towards Mary, whom ended up saving her live afterwards. The cut scene that ran during the credits was a nice touch, I always loved the relationship between Luther and Alice, as much both of them might want to take things further, it would never work and they knows that.

I don't think there will be a Season 4, but I wouldn't count out the Alice spin-off being shot for a single season, leading up to a Luther movie bringing the series to a close. As long as everyone is willing to return and BBC is willing to fund everything, there's no reason for it not to happen."
Crazy Delicious,F*ck I didn't know it was over! I thought there were still 2 eps left like the first season! Loved it. and Ruth Wilson oh god Ruth Wilson
Crazy Delicious,"I'm surprised by some of the comments in this thread. While I found the first season mildly enjoyable purely because of the lead performance by the always great Idris Elba, I found not much else to latch onto. I thought the second season was where it became a good SHOW, not just Elba stretching his acting chops. Is this the common feeling around the show? 

I have not seen anything from the third season but I'm still anticipating it because of how much I enjoyed the second season. Especially the last two episodes. Anything that's less like a normal procedural I'm all in favor of which is what the first season felt like to me. "
Crazy Delicious,"Great show, good season.

That bullet thing at the end of ep4 is prime material for Mythbusters, though. But I liked it nonetheless...

Just a small note I want to make: I loved the way they edited the ""on the next episode""-bits after the end of each episode (on the TV version, not sure if it's available on the DVD version). I hate those bits in American shows (like Dexter) because they completely ruin the suspense of the next episodes by revealing too much. Here it was beautifully done, just a tiny tidbit of action here and there, or an intense stare by Idris Elba, making you want more, but not showing too much (although they did show Alice Morgan in one of them).

Can't wait for the movie!"
Crazy Delicious,I didn't even know it finished and you've given me something to watch all day tomorrow. Thank you!
Crazy Delicious,"I felt the final episode was good for pace as opposed to logic. I had a hard time figuring out why both Luther and Alice confronted Shotgun Man, just before he shoots Luther in the leg. I mean, they seemed genuinely surprised when he pulled out another gun. Why, at the very least, would Alice not just film from the balcony? Still, it worked in spite of that because it didn't let up. 

I did find the bullet-in-the-door sequence very odd, though. They seemed to have a million freaking years to run off somewhere else instead of doing something that didn't work at all. 


"
Crazy Delicious,"I agree with almost all of OP's points, especially in that the first episode felt a bit lacklustre at times. But then they bring on those fantastic teaser montages at the end credits and I just can't wait to watch the next episode. Those 30 second snippets are almost better than the episodes they follow. Incredible musical choices too. Whoever their music researcher is deserves a bloody medal."
Crazy Delicious,"Great season, Luther is fast becoming one of my favourite tv shows. Intense, great-written and BEAUTIFULY shot. I mean, the visuals are sometimes the best thing in these series although the drama itself is still spectacular. BBC's doing it right, can't wait for next episodes and other shows to continue like Sherlock for example. "
Crazy Delicious,"I loved Luther and thought that the penultimate episode was excellent.  Loved Alice and love Luther.  I do agree that the writers were a little sloppy in places - the whole running and hiding thing irritates the shit out of me - I would be running while screeching for help at the top of my lungs.

Finally, although I am to see Luther come to an end, I think it was ended at the right time.  These shows can have the arse dragged out of them."
Crazy Delicious,"It was a fantastic season. I loved every moment, except for the part when I realised that it had only four episodes."
Crazy Delicious,"I loved it, not as solid as the previous series and it needed more Alice but it is still a phenomenally acted, written and directed show and it is absolutely must-watch TV."
Crazy Delicious,"My biggest complaint was how obvious it was that Ripley was going to end up like that.

He might as well have said ""well, only 2 days until retirement"" just to cap it all off.

That and the guy shooting him dead when he could have just winged him."
Crazy Delicious,"im looking down at the keyboard when i type this so i dont see spoilers, but does anyone know where/if i can watch series 3 in the U.S. before it comes out on BBC america? i think i saw it wasn't gonna premiere until september.
"
Crazy Delicious,"Loved the season as a whole. 

I actually thought the final episode was the weakest, plot wise. Felt rushed at times and had many plot holes, but that's not something out of the ordinary for Luther.

Episode 3 was perfect, maybe my favourite episode of Luther.

Has anyone read the Luther book by Neil Cross called 'The Calling'? Worth a read, it's great. Apparently it's supposed to be a trilogy, but I can't find any further information about a second book. "
Crazy Delicious,"This has always been a series where the character is better than the show, like House. This season proved it. The other characters can be terrible, the plots ridiculous, the surprises lame, and the dialogue sub par, but I'll still watch 'cause it's John Luther."
Crazy Delicious,"Ok, so I didn't read any of the posts here, just need some help. I started watching luther and fount the first episode to be pretty boring. Can you convince me to keep watching? I LOVE Idris Elba, and will probably watch it anyway, but its gonna be more of a long slog unless you can get me excited for it..."
Crazy Delicious,"Season 3 is over? Good, now I can watch it all in one go. I've been saving them up."
Crazy Delicious,"New to Luther and I’m finishing up season 3.

Erin and George makes zero sense on any planet. Building a case with information that’s already shows that he’s innocent. The only person that could’ve implicated him died a couple seasons ago. Ripely already vouched for him on tape. So they have nothing anymore. 
Vigilante kills his partner , goes to his house and shoots the place up and they dream up charges even though all these cops are here?? 

No idea who thought any of these things were plausible. Erin and George would’ve already been out on their ass. I enjoy the first 2 episodes, the next two sank the season."
Crazy Delicious,"I thought how stupid arresting Luther for the murder of Rippley, he just happened to have a shot gun in his coat and the attempted murder of Mary, how when he was next to Justin he couldn't physically be there, dumb!! And he has a message from the guy saying it's all his fault he killed him. And the two idiots trying to get him arrested I have had enough of those two.😩"
Crazy Delicious,"I must be the only one to hate Alice.  Her appearance (hair colour, turned up nose, pale and thin, heck, even her voice) distracts me and her acting seems ridiculously wooden - all she does is say supposedly dark or sarcastic lines with a smile.  I just don't care about her at all and don't see how people are attached to her.

I didn't like the change of pace between the first two episodes and the last two with the different story arc.

I really didn't like that they killed Ripley, but I guess they were going for some shock factor.

I did like Luther's new gf, but her fumbling for the key to get out of the house was annoying, as was the speed at which Luther decided to tell her everything and give her access to his place.

Getting rid of the two detectives who were investigating Luther by having the antagonist shoot them was SUCH a cop out.  

Arresting Luther for Ripley's murder - it was far too obvious they were going to pin it on him, and completely unbelievable.

I dunno, I just felt the pacing and the story were really off this season.  I didn't remotely enjoy the last episode and am kind of glad there is no season 4.  I'll stick with fond memories of the first 2 seasons and the first 3 episodes of season 3."
Crazy Delicious,Why is this on the frontpage? People still actually watch Cable television?
Crazy Delicious,I was totally expecting that to happen but somehow it still scared the ever-living shit out of me.
Crazy Delicious,This Friday :)
Crazy Delicious,I suppose he couldn't get past the fence with Ripley still on him? He would need to turn his back and would be unable to defend himself as he goes through. I don't know. I haven't really looked at that scene again because Ripley's death was a bit too painful. 
Crazy Delicious,[deleted]
Crazy Delicious,"Yeah I love Idris Elba and was really looking forward to S3 but there was some damn weak writing this season, quite a let down."
Crazy Delicious,"See I would go 2>1>3. This season was incredibly disappointing, especially Stark and his partner from season 2, their decisions just made 0 sense in the last 2 episodes."
Crazy Delicious,"Nooooo!! I thought there would still be a chance because Idris mentioned the possibility during his Pacific Rim press junket. I guess I kinda figured anyway since the series ended with not much reason to continue... Idris had mentioned that he thinks the film should be a prequel - I think that would be interesting. Plus, Indira Varma!"
Crazy Delicious,"Yeah I saw that too, but that was way back when, and tentative plans like those change all the time so, for me at least, until I get a studio officially announcing production has started and then see a trailer for it and wikipedia/imdb says it's in post-production, I won't get my hopes up too high."
Crazy Delicious,I'll hold out hope for season 1 of Alice.  
Crazy Delicious,"I just watched the third season, compared to season 2 and even 1 it is really bad imo. Some of the characters are ridiculously stupid."
Crazy Delicious,"> That bullet thing at the end of ep4 is prime material for Mythbusters, though. But I liked it nonetheless...

The best part about it was how he was entirely unphased and had no visible blood or hole in his jacket afterwards. 

Why even include it? "
Crazy Delicious,Same here no idea season 3 was even on. There was no ads no buzz.......oh yeah its a UK show. 
Crazy Delicious,"I forget if it was the preview for the last or 3rd episode, but when they started playing 'Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down' which I recognized from being the Boss theme, man oh man.

Also, the Six Feet Under final montage is the end-all-be-all use of Sia's ""Breath Me,"" but Luther's use of it in the preview for the s1e6 finale definitely rivals it imo"
Crazy Delicious,"Yeah, every once in awhile I'll see a shot and I'll think 'I'm glad they took the effort to shoot that, they didn't have to but they did'

For example when Luther enters Alice's apartment they had a distant shot from another apartment and you just see them entering w/o any audio and they didn't *have* to have that shot, but it was very nice. Also at some point in s3e4 2 of the police are talking and it's a distant/mid-range shot of the 2 and there's just snow blowing and I enjoyed it. Those are just the 2 that pop into my head right away"
Crazy Delicious,"Yeah, or the guy could have just gone through the fence and drawn it out a little longer to see what Ripley would do. Killing a cop should have been more of a last resort but, I guess, he did have mental issues."
Crazy Delicious,I'm in the U.S also and I just use [Expat Shield] (http://www.expatshield.com/) to watch shows from the BBC player. It will assign you a U.K ip so you aren't blocked from watching it from their website. Enjoy.
Crazy Delicious,"105 and 106 are my favorites of the entire series. I think by 103, the Alice/Luther dynamic starts to get a bit more interesting as well. "
Crazy Delicious,"I actually feel the same way and I have stuck with the show through all three seasons.

Idris Elba *is* wonderful, as is Alice as a supporting character. But I find all of the regular characters on the show to be terribly boring and one-dimensional compared to either of them. And most of the villains were uncompelling to me as well (though a few stood out as somewhat interesting)."
Crazy Delicious,"That's what I did, fuck me it was glorious. Fantastic season."
Crazy Delicious,">I must be the only one to hate Alice. Her appearance (hair colour, turned up nose, pale and thin, heck, even her voice) distracts me and her acting seems ridiculously wooden - all she does is say supposedly dark or sarcastic lines with a smile. I just don't care about her at all and don't see how people are attached to her.

Alice is weird. We know this. The strange thing is that I met a lady once who was very intelligent but coming from a very religious family, she was more than a little weird. I do not believe that she ever had Alice's murderous tendencies, but definitely raised various abnormal flags (and had been hospitalised). She seemed very similar to Alice though."
Crazy Delicious,"Huh? What's the problem? Cable television brings some of the best TV, although in this case it doesn't make any sense considering BBC1 isn't cable."
Crazy Delicious,"Totally agree with both of you. That was the beauty of those first 2 episodes, it did the PERFECT amount of lingering on shots, like it just held steady shots and you KNOW it's coming, but then nothing happens and you slightly questions yourself and it's just nerve-wrenching.

Also I had just gotten over the trauma of the Hannibal episode with that girl doing the same thing, damn you TV! Stop using that trope!"
Crazy Delicious,Oh hey a fellow time traveler
Crazy Delicious,"I think that was the idea here, that if he tried to open the fence, Ripley would have charged at him and possibly taken him down. 

While it was fairly unbelievable, why couldn't he have turned back and gone another direction? Or shot Ripley in the leg or just hit him with the butt of the shotgun to the nose? I mean, he had the gun and it's not like there was a swat team currently pursuing. Neither Ripley nor Luther had the firepower advantage nor did they want to kill him to bring him in. "
Crazy Delicious,"He has a pretty reasonable amount of time to move the fence, which only takes him a couple of seconds as seen when he does escape. Very poor in my opinion."
Crazy Delicious,"The flimsy case for arresting Luther in E4 never even occurred to me, but you're right. It's like they came up with the plot, then decided to try and stitch it together afterwards with almost no effort."
Crazy Delicious,"> how the fuck did they arrest him in E4? I mean, what evidence did they have? It was just a huge, ridiculous leap.

What bothered me less than them arresting him was the fact that Erin immediately pinned him the bad guy. I can see Stark, the bulldog that he is, deluding himself into believing that this was all an elaborate plot by Luther, but Erin? She was even warming up to the idea that Stark was possibly in the wrong in the last episode and trying to make amends with Ripley who clearly viewed Luther as more than just a partner. For her to flip face like that made absolutely zero sense. 
"
Crazy Delicious,"> how the fuck did they arrest him in E4? I mean, what evidence did they have? It was just a huge, ridiculous leap.

This. A thousand times this."
Crazy Delicious,i pray to the old gods and the new that you are right!
Crazy Delicious,"I kind of liked that, actually. It would have been too predictable if it had killed him or stopped him from getting to them. They tried it and it failed... Move on to something else."
Crazy Delicious,Yeah... I couldn't sleep without a lamp on for a few nights after watching that Hannibal episode. Luther didn't have the same lasting effect on me but I still freaked the fuck out at the time. 
Crazy Delicious,"I get that they wanted to try and fail something, but its not like you can just shrug off a gunshot, when it clearly wasn't a grazing shot. "
Crazy Delicious,"I was more surprised by Luther's ability to continue walking, running and driving a car after having his knee and/or tibia shot off... Poetic license, I guess."
Crazy Delicious,At least he was *limping*.
Borgen,"> Sidse Babett Knudsen, star of returning Danish political TV drama Borgen, has rejected the idea that the series may continue past its brand new fourth season, set to debut in the US and UK on Netflix on June 2.


> While its creator Adam Price, who wrote the hit previous three seasons as well as the forthcoming return, remains ambivalent, telling The Times of London, “Never say never” when asked about the prospect of carrying on, its female star remains emphatic. “No way. Birgitte is done.”


> ‘Birgitte’ is the politician at the centre of Borgen, a subtitled drama about Danish coalition politics that became an unlikely hit following its debut in 2012. Nine years have elapsed since the third season aired, but Price and his team were seduced by the lure of Netflix and the fourth season was announced back in 2020."
Borgen,Borgen is such a fun watch. I've been cautiously optimistic ever since I heard Netflix picked it up that it might turn into the type of show that the third season addressed in one of its sub-plots.
Borgen,"So looking forward to this, my favorite political series since west wing."
Borgen,"I'll take one more season, but Netflix, please revive Spiral with Ali taking over the squad."
Borgen,"On my Netflix I saw a separate entry for the Netflix season ""Borgen: Power and Glory"" with a ""season 1"" title on it. But it seems this will also be the last.

I think Netflix only provided funding, the whole team is still linked to the original seasons made for the Danish DR channel, so the quality is similar."
Borgen,"That episode called 'the last worker in the Labour party' really spoke to me on an emotional level. I retroactively can't stand this show even though I know that it's well made, but that one episode is on my mind every time I think of it."
Borgen,[deleted]
Borgen,"I love season 1 and to a lesser extent season 2, but found season 3 to be unwatchable. hoping it will return to form but not holding my breath for this."
Borgen,That was one of my favorite episodes. Watching that party tear itself apart over the direction it wanted to go in was captivating to say the least.
Borgen,"You know they just fund the shows, right? The original creatives and production company continue to produce them."
Borgen,"Just finished S4. 

I found it sad that they tried to nicely wrap up (almost) all the plot lines during the eighth and final episode.  And then there was a major plot line that wasn't even properly dealt with!

It's probably stronger than than S3, but it doesn't come close to either S1 or S2.

I wish I could have had those 8 hours back!

There was no reason to re-boot Borgen and I hope that they don't sully even further the reputation by making a S5..."
Borgen,"There is no such thing as “Just fund the shows”

Netflix funds a show with millions of dollars & in return they expect to have creative control over the final product. 


[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-animation-shakeup-executives-fired-shows-canceled-staged-data/) ran a story about that process at Netflix.


> One producer, whose show on Netflix wasn’t renewed, said that when they got to Netflix, Rynda, who served creative roles on groundbreaking animated series like “Gravity Falls” and “Adventure Time,” told Netflix creators, “We want to be the home of everybody’s favorite show.” By the time the producer left several years later, there was a “new thesis statement”: **“We want to make what our audience wants to see,” Reed Hastings, Netflix’s Co-CEO, now told animation talent**. As far as mission statements go, those are vastly different...


> Ito and others have complained of being presented with “staged data,” data meant to prove a point that Netflix has and squash conversation around it. Ito described the data as explaining, for the first time, “**What they should have gotten for what they spent on the show.” (Netflix confirms their decisions are made using data, which takes into account viewing versus cost.)**"
Borgen,"Thanks for writing this, now I know I can safely skip it"
Borgen,">Netflix funds a show with millions of dollars **& in return they expect to have creative control over the final product.**

This is not what the article you quote says. Canceling and renewing shows *just* based on data is not good, but it's not the same thing as having ""creative control"". 

A show's producers always have some influence on the show itself, but I see nothing that indicates Netflix messed with the writing or directing of Borgen directly. If it turned to crap (and it's not a budget issue) that's on the production, not Netflix"
Borgen,So basically taste clusters lol?
Borgen,"It is true Netflix have started to produce a number of their own fully owned original shows but shows like Gravity Falls and Borgen, produced by outside studios and production companies, are still far more common. 

There was actually a recent article mentioning how Netflix feels their own homegrown animation has been a disaster and so they have recently pulled a lot of funding from the endeavour, and cancelled projects, so they can go back to funding more Gravity Falls and Boss Baby show produced by outside production teams where they feel the ROI is better. 

Netflix will not be making Borgen. The original production company and creatives will. Netflix are not even the only network funding the show. They will share that with the Danish Broadcasting Corporation. You have an issue with the show then blame the folks who will be producing it. Netflix are notoriously hands-off compared to any rival major American network."
Borgen,"Btw, there is a really good scene which clearly references this in the current season of the show Barry."
Borgen,"> 1- You have an issue with the show then blame the folks who will be producing it.


> 2- If it turned to crap (and it's not a budget issue) that's on the production, not Netflix


It’s a bit weird how you and other redditor are so defensive about this.


First of all, the 4th season is not even out yet. So, no one is blaming anyone for anything. 

Second, I’m talking in general. When a company, be that Netflix or HBO Max or other, funds a show with millions of dollars, they don’t just sit back and have zero creative input in the final product. 


> This is not what the article you quote says. Canceling and renewing shows just based on data is not good, but it's not the same thing as having ""creative control"". 


“**What they should have gotten for what they spent on the show.**”

[Ted Sarandos](https://deadline.com/2016/09/netflix-ted-sarandos-peter-morgan-the-crown-1201826936/) himself said that creative input at Netflix is always “Collaborative”, not that they have no creative input at all.


> Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos has rejected any assertion that the company is showing signs of hindering the creative freedom of its producers and said it is on track to double its original programming output

> He pressed that any creative involvement on Netflix shows was “always invited.” “That’s what I want to impress upon people,” he said. “If you aren’t collaborating on the show by the time it is in production, then we have failed in some way that we haven’t been invited into the process. We don’t enclose ourselves from the process creatively, we are very collaborative absolutely.”


The idea that a company will spend millions of dollars with no creative input is just not realistic."
Borgen,">It’s a bit weird how you and other redditor are so defensive about this.

Lol what? I mentioned that because it was the thread's origin, I don't even know the show

>**“What they should have gotten for what they spent on the show.”**

What is this supposed to tell me about creative control? This is a quote about needing to reach certain metrics and err.. ""taste clusters"" to get your show approved/renewed.

>The idea that a company will spend millions of dollars with no creative input is just not realistic.

I agreed that they have influence, but like I said there isn't going to be a Netflix exec co-writing a show about Danish politics.

Netflix gives production teams metrics and tells them what gets views and doesn't. Even your own quote on ""collaborating"" is meant to give the impression that Netflix never (or rarely) actually *forces* changes in one of their productions."
Borgen,"I’m a few episodes in and this show is excellent. If you like political dramas you should definitely give it a shot. Although it says “season 4” it’s a revival of “Borgen” after a 10 year hiatus and you don’t need to have seen the previous seasons to enjoy this. 

It’s a bit frustrating that a lot of the best foreign shows on Netflix (or other streaming sites) hardly get a mention here. I don’t know if it’s an aversion to subs, or because the current trend is to shit on Netflix, but for example I can’t remember a single thread about Clark (one of my shows of the year) and I posted about the renewal of the excellent Alrawabi School for Girls, and basically no reaction. Whereas there’s about 10 threads on the first page about various Disney shows. 

Is there a sub Reddit that does more holistic recommendations of interesting but maybe hard to find steaming shows? Or is it all “hey guys you ever heard of this one hidden gem called Peacemaker?”"
Borgen,"I was happily surprised to find that this wasn’t a total botched remake as Netflix has done with other shows. 

I’d say it’s probably some of the better political tv drama I’ve seen in a while. Just outlandish enough to give you house of cards excitement, but grounded enough to keep the west wing realists content too."
Borgen,"I liked the original Borgen, but this is a whole new level. While it could be watched on its own it is made far more powerful by the fact that we know these characters from before, Power hungry Birgitta and pressurized Katrina show all the nuances and complexities of what it’s like for women at the top. There were times I had reactions that I had to catch myself on, realizing I would not be reacting the same way if the characters were men and if they did what they were doing. Really helps that this one is hinged on the environment vs the economy as the core topic. Layers and layers of personal and political drama all woven into the key question of “how far is too far?” and eipitomized by “Birgitta, I don’t recognize you”. I loved every minute of it."
Borgen,I am on Borgen Power and Glory episode 7 - fantastic..cannot say enough good words.  Agree wholeheartedly with your assessment!
Borgen,Never watched the initial 3 episodes but binged then new season in just over a day. Good watch.
Borgen,"Excellent. 

I loved Borgen, especially as it seems every TV station that shows Scandinavian TV only shows murder mysteries/police procedural stuff which I find generally a bit dull regardless of where it comes from so seeing a great drama that wasn't like that was a breath of fresh air."
Borgen,Third season was in 2013. I wonder why they are bringing this back 9 years later.
Borgen,Wow. Nice. I loved Borgen .
Borgen,I cant wrap my head around how their bringing this show back almost ten years now but this show is INCREDIBLE so I'll be waiting impatiently
Borgen,The most amusing thing about that series was learning that TV news interviews in Denmark are conducted standing up at a small table that makes them look as if they're in a pub in London.
Borgen,"Good stuff. Hopefully better than the third season which dropped off in quality a bit.

Now do The Bridge please. I need more fast Porsches."
Borgen,Thats great news but 2022 is a long time to wait.
Borgen,"I watched couple episodes from season one. They were a bit interesting but then I found the idealistic storylines underwhelming and stopped watching it. 

I might go back and finish the season now."
Borgen,Great news. The husband in the series was also in the final season of Broen Broen. Watching a different ecosystem of actors is refreshing and broadens one's knowledge of television shows in general.
Borgen,You will be assimilated
Borgen,This is the greatest news I’ve ever heard. One of my all time favorite series and I had to wait years to watch it in the US.
Borgen,"oh wow, i thought it ended.

Nice."
Borgen,Amazing!!
Borgen,Can we bring back West Wing as well? I could do with a little President Bartlett!
Borgen,"Lost's final season was the equivalent of driving headfirst into a brick wall.  They spent two years righting the ship and going into a specific direction only to completely kill it and tell the world that they had no idea what the ending was supposed to be when it started.  
  
Edit : I posted this in the ""worst final season thread"" what the hell?"
Borgen,They always said they would think about a reunion after a decade
Borgen,"I wonder if it was Netflix that pushed it over the edge. Price appears to have a strong relationship with them lately, doing *Ragnarok* and Netflix streaming *Ride Upon the Storm*. If those were successful, why not do another thing together: ""Here's a lot of money, how about it?"""
Borgen,$$$
Borgen,"Take note, Firefly"
Borgen,"What was amusing to me and my biggest takeaway was while here in the US we use the term ""spin doctor"" as a derisive euphemism for a ""press secretary"" or ""spokesperson"" , the Danes just go ahead and actually call them ""Spin Doctors"" ."
Borgen,"... And the incomparable Saga. ""Do you want sex?"" 

Damn the foreplay, get yer tackle out."
Borgen,"It left Hulu, feelsbadman"
Borgen,Another series that dropped heavily in quality after the first 2 seasons imo.
Borgen,I'd love to see how The Newsroom would be taking things on now.
Borgen,[deleted]
Borgen,And that relates to this thread how?
Borgen,Yeah no. DR which owns Borgen is not a commercial entity.
Borgen,*Way* too late for that.
Borgen,"It's not actually their official title to be fair. When they're employed by a government minister they're usually titled ""Special Advisor""."
Borgen,I liked the partner who replaced Kim Bodnia.
Borgen,Damn donkey wheel.
Borgen,"They still make money off of it. It's free for a period of time for Danes. But if anybody else wants to watch it, like on netflix, it will cost money. It will most likely cover production and future shows in DR or even money for Dansk film. They make it for danes but if they can sell it, they will."
Borgen,If they own it then that means they can make money off of it by selling the international broadcasting rights. Just because they are a public broadcaster doesn’t mean they don’t take potential profits into consideration
Borgen,So what.  I can fantasize
Borgen,That doesn't change the fact that the point isn't to make money. It is a public service first and foremost.
Borgen,Does [this](https://www.nme.com/news/tv/fox-considering-revival-joss-whedons-firefly-2594433) help your fantasies?
Borgen,Yes it is public service first. But other considerations are being taken into account when choosing what content to make.
Borgen,very much so.
Borgen,One of the best political shows out there
Borgen,Such a great political show. So damn good! I'm so sad that I watched it years ago...haha
Borgen,"Sidse Babett Knudsen who plays the lead role of danish premier minister Brigitte Nyborg is an incredible actress, even [Tom Hanks agrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9zbhSdGPfA)"
Borgen,I am watching on Netflix. Subtitles are bloody lighting fast. Wtf!  And I am a very quick and proficient reader.
Borgen,"'Borgen' is the Danish’s version of ‘The West Wing’.  Years ago, I watched half of season one, might go back to finish the series. 

The events in the episodes that I watched were too idealistic & predictable to some degree."
Borgen,"fuck yea, 20 year old me binged this shit and i only know english and french."
Borgen,Are the subtitles to fast for it to be watchable
Borgen,"Anyone know if there are better (i.e. more complete) subtitles versions than what's on Netflix? ie via a Danish site or dvd box set or whatever?  


Seems like Netflix version doesn't get all the words across ..."
Borgen,Great show!  Watched it years ago.
Borgen,Netflix is resurrecting it for a season 4!
Borgen,"yeah and they don't even capture everything that is said, I switched to dutch subs because they were slightly better"
Borgen,It has nothing of TheWestWing imho. „borgen“ is more realistic while Aaron Sorkin’s „The West Wing“ is definitely over the top with dialogues and pathos
Borgen,"im french, reading subs in english, not too fast for me"
Borgen,"They both show the main political players (The President in WW and the Prime Minister in Borgen) as idealistic politicians. They usually manage to overcome one crisis after another without sacrificing their principles.  


Now, I’ve only seen half of season one of ‘Borgen’ so things may have changed later in the season/series. Also, can’t say that I’m familiar with Danish’s internal politics so what may seems too idealistic to me might be the norm over there."
Borgen,In that regard i guess you’re right! To me they just feel very different. Like a Brigitte Nyborg seems more authentic and realistic to me than a President Bartlett. (Because his monologues etc are so great that they’re not that realistic... :D )
Borgen,Borgen's coming back? Nice
Borgen,Isn't the lady Barnard Choked out? I was wondering what happened to her
Borgen,Oh shit more Borgen.
Borgen,"I've been watching this over the past few days and really enjoy it.  Its like Danish West Wing, and that's the kind of TV I really enjoy.  

I do wish the subtitles on Netflix were better.  I wouldn't be able to verify the content, but they didn't handle multiple people speaking at once, and the punctuation was messed up more often than not."
Borgen,"Hopefully they get new people to do the subtitles, they were barely correct."
Borgen,Agree.  Watch the English dub with the subtitles on and they often don't line up.  Feels like there's nuance missing.
Borgen,I had the same experience. I found that the closed captioning subtitles looked better than the plain subtitles.
Borgen,Likely just Apple TV: https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/kugasf/netflix_reversed_subtitle_punctuation/
Borgen,"Ha! I just discovered the show myself last week and am beyond hooked. I really loved the show Occupied, which came out of Norway, and this was recommended by a search for shows like it. There’s just something wonderful about Scandinavian shows.  

I had the same problem myself. Then I discovered that there’s two options for English subtitles. For some reason one of them is really screwed up. Look for the one that says English CC. I was worried for a bit that I’d have to watch it dubbed into English and you just lose so much of the experience that way."
Borgen,"I watched this show back in the day and I found it deeply unrealistic because all the politicians, the protagonist and also her opposants, try to defend their vision for the good of the country and never for personal gain. As if..."
Borgen,"very belatedly replying to your comment to say thank you so much - i have been rewatching **borgen** on netflix (u.s.) after watching the original that aired on the bbc.  i noticed the subtitling seemed to be leaving out *a lot*.  i found the bbc version of the same episode online, and, sure enough, whole lines were being omitted.  i was on the verge of writing a rant to netflix when i decided to search this sub and came across your solution - which has totally fixed this issue!  

i am ever so grateful as i always want to see as much of what is being said as possible when watching with subtitles."
Borgen,Yuup. Watched it all last year. Easily one of the most interesting foreign dramas I saw.
Borgen,I really like the first two seasons of Borgen. Will have to check this out. Thank you.
Borgen,"Can you please explain what the hook is? What drives the narrative?

The trailer doesn't seem to show much plot. Just lots of the main character shouting to the heavens and the rest of the family looking fairly glum."
Borgen,"It's a story about a family, and how truly dysfunctional it is. But that is all buried beneath the skin of the (Danish protestant) church, which the father runs and apparently has been running for ages. It really focuses on the dynamics between the preacher father and his two sons: the younger who is supposed to follow in his footsteps and succeed him as preacher, and the older, prodigal son who abandoned this life a while ago and eventually tried to seek ""enlightenment"" elsewhere. Yet all the members of this family including their mother are battling inner demons of desires so contrary to their church obligations and mission. It examines how their choices affect them, people around them, their church and community. 

To be sure, this is a story about a family that happens to run a church, but it's in no way a religious story. Plus it's a very typically 'slow' Nordic TV drama so you'll really have to take your time to follow it. And though a vast majority of the story takes place in Denmark, they do well to go well outside of it, following the characters to some other parts of the world at times."
Borgen,Doesn't sound great tbh
Borgen,🤷‍♂️
Borgen,"Hard pass, can't imagine that being anything but super depressing."
Borgen,I personally don't mind but I can definitely see people getting upset about this since it hasn't been long at all. 
Borgen,Sounds good to me...
Borgen,"“In the making of a crime series like this that is built on real events and the life of real people, I cannot and will not act alone. The cooperation with Jens Moller, and Ingrid and Joachim Wall are therefore imperative,” said Lindholm. 

“I don’t want to make a crime series that is beguiled by the perpetrator or the crime. I am, however, interested in the processes and the people who solved the crime, as well as the people who must go on with their lives despite it. It’s therefore a fully conscious decision that the perpetrator at no time will figure in the series.”

Greengrass should learn something from Lindholm."
Borgen,"Just read about it on Wiki. Yeah, it could be a very exausting show."
Borgen,"How would this work though? 

As tragic and sad this was I just don't see a story that can run a miniseries in length."

Step 3: The Riverlands are ruled by family Sansa's family.  The vale is Run by Sansa's family. The Westerlands are run by Sansa's former husband/ally.  The Storm lands are run by Jon's biggest non-Sam/Tormund/Ghost BFF, Gendry Baratheon.

Step 4.  The Lord of the Reach/Master of Coin is loyal to his own self-interest.  The Grand Maester on the Small Council is loyal to Jon.  The head of the Kingsguard swore an oath to Sansa.

It's been Sansa's play all along since she found out about Jon's parentage."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I hope his sequel comes out and is good, I’ll never get over how bad Jon got fucked over in season 8. Basically the main character of the entire show devolved into like 4 repeated lines and his entire 8 season buildup with the NK was stolen by his sister who had nothing to do with that plot line. And the fact that he was the rightful king and no one, not even Tyrion gave a fuck when that trial bs happened. 

The character should’ve been so much more interesting and the ending of the white walker story should’ve been so much more satisfying but they botched it so hard. Ugh 3 years later and it still annoys me thinking about it."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Must be hard going from the worlds greatest hero for 5 yrs to normality

Who says it's over.

Fucking continue on and just be great and everyone will be happy again."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"The thing I hate about his ending in GoT is that it took all agency away from him. 

I’d have much preferred that he became king, but then dissolved the Seven Kingdoms (granting them all independence, not just the North) and then headed north of the Wall by his own choosing."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,He dun wannit...
Its Okay to Not Be Okay," Tolkienesque dialogue: ""Ya okay, Jon?"" ""Nah man, I'm pretty fucking far from okay"""
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"So is this sequel series 100% going to happen now. I had last read that they were thinking about it, but is it now no longer just an idea?"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Honestly I just want a buddy cop show of him and tormund just cruising the north rescuing drunken wildlings from frozen lakes and stopping bungie jumping on the wall
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"After the success of the 1st season of House of the Dragon, if this Jon Snow show turns out good too the entirety of r/freefolk might commit a Jonestown level mass suicide."

Its Okay to Not Be Okay, Will never forgive him for not patting the dog!
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Neither am I.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Muh queen

Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Don’t worry. Neither of us are okay after that disaster of season….
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Apparently he did want it.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,He blew me away in Criminal. Best episode by far even if it hurt a lot of people.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Neither are we, Kit"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,He has been though alot. Trauma for sure. He needs a therapist
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I like the Crusader Kings mod fanfic story where Jon becomes King Beyond the Wall (although show Jon might have some different title, or no title) and spends his days rebuilding Free Folk society and resettling the land left vacant by the White Walkers. Then it turns out that Bran has turned into a tyrant who uses his magical powers to spy on the nobles and people of the realm and enforce compliance. Players have the choice of coming south to topple Bran and stake Jon's claim to the throne. It would definitely be in Jon's character that duty compels him to go south and deal with his brother/cousin for the good of the realm. It would also be a cool redemption arc for Jon."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Can relate it was really hard on me too when my ex committed genocide out of the blue

Its Okay to Not Be Okay,I’d rather they just called the cast back and remade the last season.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Game of Thrones 2: Snow Holds Barred
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"if anybody fucked their Aunt and then killed her, they'd wouldn't be okay either."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I will never understand this choice. Why have a show about Jon when you could have one about Arya exploring west of Westeros? She could use her powers, get embroiled in a new political system, etc. It's also the perfect way to break off from the awful GoT ending since it's only got one link to the old series."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Just like Kits career post GOT, not okay"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"If they made a spin-off show, it’s an interesting starting point for the character. But I’m having trouble imagining where they go with the plot. Like the Night King is dead so what’s the point of the Night’s Watch (other than a place to send misfits as Tyrion said). Maybe there’s more to the North, I dunno, we’ll see I guess"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Despite the last few seasons being fan fic, the very thought the Unsullied/Dothraki wouldn't have killed him the instant they realised Daenerys was dead is absurd.

I'd rather see a sequel where Hot Pie, Gendry and Brienne take a road trip."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Why, is he remembering season 8"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"The 3 eyed raven was the dark lord and now its in Bran. He made the ""mad king"" go mad and he was also responsible for Dany going mad. What if John Snow is ""the promised prince"" reincarnation of the legendary hero from 8000 years ago that defeated the dark lord with his  ""fire sword"". Only a Targaryen was suposed to really kill the dark lord and Arya is not one! The rightfull king will have to once again unite everyone for one last battle.

The sequel can fix up some shit from the main series and explain why Dany went bonkers so quick as apparently mind control drives people into madness, but usually right away kills them."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,He still has nightmares about how GoT ended
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Yeah I’d be pretty upset how the writers botched the ending if I were John Snow too
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,I could not be less interested in them continuing his story.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I can't believe they are doing a Jon Snow sequel show. Of all the options it seems the least interesting but I guess the story put on the table somehow beat off,

- Roberts Rebellion
- Fall of Valeria
- Arya travelling into the unknown
- Nymeria
- Children of the Forest and the creation of the Night King."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Nobody cares about Jon thag boring ass vanilla character. Gives us a different part of the universe. I loved House of the Dragon but I have a feeling the Jon Snow - centered show is gonna suck balls. Kit is not a good actor and Jon Snow is a boring ass character. He’s Jim Halpert of Westeros.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Most of us weren’t brother.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Still don’t know how he got nominated twice for acting.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Neither are we.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,This may be an unpopular opinion but I don’t see any universe where this sequel series improves upon the ending of Game of Thrones. I’ll actually take it a step further and say it only can make the show worse.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"They’re not actually going to make this sequel, are they?  God it’s going to be the Walking Dead in snow."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Probably one my least favourite characters in the entire saga played by who I would say was one of the least charismatic actors innvolved in the project. I just don't see how a sequel about him would be interesting at all.

Then again, a lot of people supposedly liked him for being the ""hero"" of the story in the classic sense."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Got a feeling this show is gonna suck. But who knows.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"One of the least interesting characters in GoT gets his own show.

More fake snow and ice. I'll probably watch, but this is the least exciting possible continuation of GoT for me."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don’t think Daenerys is, either."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Jon Snow spent all that time protecting the realm from white walkers when he should’ve been protecting it from bad writing.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Welp, we got our Andor, now it's time for our Obi-wan."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"We know he isn't, he got hit on the head or something.

Just like Hodor can only repeat ""hold the door"", now Jon Snow can only say ""but she's mah queen"""
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Show sucked. But we’ll never get a real ending.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Jon should have been beheaded for murder & treason
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Yeah, right. Jon Snow, you know nothing."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Are any of these GOT shows ever going to get into the whole 'years long winter' thing?
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,I have a feeling that this show will suck ass.
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Drogon sends Dany to red priestess, she bringsDany & the Baby (true fire & ice) back to Life, the birth kills the Night King magic & Brans and she becomes queen.

I dont care about Jon Snow.

Where is my Arya Show??????????"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I don't want to watch a Game of Thrones show about ""grief"", cut this shit out immediately."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Don’t blame him. Sister let him get exiled so she could be queen of the north, brother is a weird tree god king, Arya is gone, he killed his loved and the guy who convinced him to do it got no punishment. I’d not be okay too."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Shit, I would be. You kill hitler queen and her people are just like “eh, I guess you’re free to go, kthxbye!”"
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,Dude wants that Game of Throne money back.

Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"I literally just finished watching GOT before I read this. Well, I went to the restroom and then read this. But stil."
Its Okay to Not Be Okay,"Wouldn't be much of a story to tell if he was doing fine and dandy, living his best life."

LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Undone was the shit
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Anime Watchers: What gap??
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Huge gap??
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,This show is so amazing
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are 🔥🔥🔥
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,So many better shows than vox.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,What gap ?
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I’m really enjoying Vox Machina, but it’s not “filling a huge gap” when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn’t shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It’s either comedy or fantasy action, that’s it."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Best show of the year so far
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Second season is even better than the first one.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It’s genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn’t care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2’s humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It’s definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I’d easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"To it’s credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk… not this."

LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,What’s the show about?
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn’t just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Arcane is amazing.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Primal was fucking great too
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it’s platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,[deleted]
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"They didn’t pay for an article, fuck em."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,RIP Pantheon.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Arcane?
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Don’t forget King of the Hill
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge…"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are “hundred year old demons” or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end “but it was a boy in a girls body.” Fucking pervs."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Shows that don’t have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show’s total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Cartoons
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren’t corpo shills telling them, “no, we can’t have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.” They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"See I’ve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn’t expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that’s exactly what it delivered."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero’s moving through still shots? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,This is true the animation isnt great
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Let’s be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it’s the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn’t The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it’s a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they’ve made flop, so they aren’t even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
LEGO Jurassic World: Legend of Isla Nublar,I never watched role (but i do follow a different unrelated dnd group) and enjoyed it so its not  a prerequisite for enjoyment.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,The lighting and camera are weird.  It feels artificial because they didn't simulate real world lighting or camera effects like they did on the other [Lego films.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cQgQIMlwWw)
LEGO: CITY Adventures,They're 3 for 3 so far on these. I can't wait
LEGO: CITY Adventures,My daughter wants more BMO.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I've always been interested in the magic in  Ooo. I don't expect this to top the last one but it should still be good.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Where can I watch these?
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"When did Youtube disable the annotations toggle? I literally couldn't read the show's logo at the end. I know it's on the thumbnail, but I clicked into the video fast"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I'm a little disappointed that it's kid Peppermint Butler to be honest but so far these have all been great. The last one was a perfect 10!
LEGO: CITY Adventures,HBO Max
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Thought so, thanks"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
LEGO: CITY Adventures,This was a great read.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Delta state was the shit!
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Dragon Ball was on YTV
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,It was on both actually
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Well, as much as I love Andor, Empire Strikes Back is not the right comparison for this.

Andor presents a completely new genre and style than the mainstream Star Wars. So comparison is just not the way. Andor is exceptionally different. It is simply the first of its kind in this franchise."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"It reminds me a lot of the EU stuff we got during the period between RotJ and TPM. More serious takes on the Star Wars universe told over several novels. I think I grew up on THAT Star Wars more than the films which came out when I was a little kid and the prequels that came out when I was in my 20s. The EU kind of aged up with Star Wars fans. 

It's why when the prequels came out aimed at much younger kids I felt so let down I think.  Andor feels more in line with those stories and characters."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,It also makes it that more painful that we're only getting two seasons.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"It's damn good. I think whether you're a fan of this show or not, what I love about the SW universe is that it's so vast that you can create content forever. The original genius of Lucas with Ep. IV is that he created a blue collar science fiction film that made us all believe this was a real place. People have mundane jobs and live hard lives. Ships are dirty and worn. This is REAL just in another place in the universe.

That gritty reality premise is kind of one of my favorite aspects of the SW universe and this show in particular. I love that we're getting a deeper look into the lives of those who work for the Empire in a way that we haven't really seen before. 

Ultimately I'm thrilled that they green lit this project. In many ways this is a more ""adult"" Star Wars and feels much more like a darker, crime/war drama and I'm all for it. Don't get me wrong, I love Mandalorian and SW Clone Wars & Rebels but I love this as well."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I don't know if it's better, time will tell on that. But, it's by far the best Star Wars content there's been in years. It's an incredible show so far"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I recommended it to a friend of mine and described it as if Star Wars met Mad Men/House of Cards. The most recent episodes get away from that slow burn those other shows have, but the scenes with Mothma and Luthen are prime drama."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Just caught up on the episodes released so far and I am \*astonished\* by how good it is! Not just for the SW universe but tv in general

&#x200B;

* Creating interesting, non canon characters from nowhere
* ""Realistic"" plotlines and believable actions in a futuristic fantasy/scifi society
* A lot of relevance to current societal issues
* Great acting all around
* Gorgeous cinematography"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I definitely love about to show how each single character really got its unique and interesting personality. And there are many interesting characters.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I've only seen 1->7. Is there anything I should be watching before Andor?
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"The best parts of Star Wars for me were the parts away from the Jedi or the Sith.  The stuff that painted a world beyond monks of different colours fighting.  

The world where a person decided to not shoot a escape pod thats empty for some reason.  A world where people stand controlling a giant laser with no guard rail.  A world where a Sleasebagio walks up to a very clear Jedi in a club and offers them drugs openly.  The Jedi must have a massive drug problem; because they had only been in there for a few seconds before a drug dealer came up to them and offered them something.  They were very clearly jedi, and this guy seemed to think it was a sure thing to offer space cops, drugs.  This implies so much about the world and the jedi order specifically in a few moments.  

The Clone wars also had a lot of awesome detail in the world.  The Commerce guild sold the same ships to both sides of the Clone war.  This was a specific deliberate detail that Lucas wanted in the show, to highlight the profiteering that was going on.   

Andor has done so much to give us detail about how things work.  It shows us what everyday like is like, and how people live and get around.  The single beam of light shining into Karns house did more to portray the existential nightmare scale of Coruscant than any massive ship over an endless city ever will."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"It's like they took the whole lump of everything that is Star Wars, put it in a tub with some acidic solution, and dissolved anything pretty, cute, silly, cheerful, took what's left and hammered out a show that feels like ""what if the Star Wars universe was a real place."" It feels fresh, what an adult that grew up with SW might want in a modern SW show."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"After Kenobi I was really not looking forward to anything else, but man this has impressed me so much."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Feels like an odd comparison. 

I'm very impressed by Andor, but it doesn't have the same sort of adventurous, fantasy elements I love in the Star Wars movies. It's more of a straight sci-fi. 

People keep saying ""thank God we've gotten away from the Jedi and the Skywalkers"" and I really disagree. Would have loved to see the same care and quality of writing applied to the mainline movies."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,So its a good Star Wars show bc it's NOT Star Wars.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Not making fun of OP, but I'm not awaiting the eventual ""Should Andor be allowed in the Oscars?"" Or ""Can Andor Be Star Wars Emmy Breakthrough?"" thinkpieces."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"It’s not necessarily a good comparison.

Firstly, ESB was a film whereas Andor is an ongoing TV series.

And second, while ESB did expand the lore and go in a bit more dark/emotional route, it was still a space opera at the end of the day.  Andor feels like a VERY different type of story, not even in the same genre almost."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Certainly slower than ESB. I am loving Andor but you have to just allow yourself to watch it and enjoy the pacing because it's not a movie nor is it like the other SW shows where shit is blowing up every 5-10 minutes.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"It has everything that made rogue one great. Dark gritty setting with the empire being oppressive.
I've always said all starwars needed to do is make some characters and a goal and set them out in the universe. It doesn't need to be big universe ending cataclysm. They have such a vibrant and distinct universe they've built. Go play in it"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"""How many guards on each floor?""
I literally was up on my feet, pumping my fist. This show."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Apparently all I needed to enjoy Star Wars is for the Star Wars property to barely have anything to do with Star Wars.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I'm noticing I'm loving it but my nephews aren't really. I think it's the lack of lasers phasers and Pew pew
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"The same franchise that had Jar Jar Binks in it.

\>Dark Jar Jar watches you now through your window."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,You shut your trash mouth ! Nothing is better than Empire
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"i feel the same way, it's taken them 30 years but they finally made a Star Wars worth watching again.

the show just exudes quality, from the sets, to the actors, the writing, the directing/producing, it's all on point.

and i like how you have to pay attention, it's not like you can walk away for five minutes and not miss a thing, like so many other shows."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Well hell. Now I have to watch it. Lol ;)
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Andor is just good space opera. It doesn't try to be a jedi-filled action. If you didn't know if was in star wars you could easily forget it was anything star wars related. The pacing and plot is well done. Just good television.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I'll be a little bit brave and say that it absolutely is.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Hyperbole+
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I guess you just have to have your showrunner not be a fan of Star Wars 😂 At least that’s what Tony Golroy said about his time making Rogue One.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Agreed, this show reminds me a lot of Blake’s Seven as well."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I feel it's them trying to do a Battlestar Galactica. I don't think it's quite at BSG level yet, but it's really good so far."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I am not joking when I agree.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"There’s a shot from the eighth episode, right before it cuts to Saw and Luthen chatting, where the camera pans across the guarded perimeter of a Rebel cave base, where a gas-mask wearing sniper stands as a sentry. The production design in that shot alone is downright staggering.

In the tenth episode, a character venting about the immense sacrifices they’ve made as a deep cover spymaster utters the line “I’ve made my mind a sunless place” and I sort of had to do a double take because it felt like I was watching an episode of *The Americans* or something.

The show is just so, so good on a myriad of levels."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"This series really has grown on me. The acting alone between Serkis and Stellen Skarsgard has blown me away! I mean the tension in the last episode alone, incredible."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Put some respect on Rogue One my man. We were on the verge of greatness. We were this close.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I want to agree. More specifically the ISB actors/scenes along with Luthen/Mon mothma political scenes are exactly how I’ve always wanted the empire to be shown on screen. The efficient oppression and calculating careerists. Brilliant.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Oh I feel confident in saying that Andor is better than ESB, I mean just imagine you've been tasked to write  next Star Wars show for Disney + and you decide to watch 'Andor' on for the 1st time, I swear I'd probably lose my shit watching that and  knowing I'd never write a 'Star Wars' series as good as that."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"The OT was the Star Wars universe's legendary fairytale of the chosen hero, Andor is a kafkaesque exploration of the inner workings of a fascist state and the birth of a resistance movement. Completely different genres within the same fictional universe. I'm very happy that the people in charge realized that you cannot keep telling the story of the chosen hero over and over again without sucking the life out of the franchise. If the Star Wars universe is to have longevity, it must be willing to go to new places, and it is very wise of them to realize that new places benefit greatly from different visual and narrative styles. The dreary world of Andor makes the epic, larger than life adventures of Luke Skywalker feel all the more special and magical."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I feel like I'm watching a different show from everyone else. Andor is *okay*, I don't hate it, but I do find it very slow and too soap opera-y. And you see stormtroopers every once in awhile to remind you it's Star Wars. Is this what people wanted from Star Wars all along?"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,This is the silliest Andor thread yet.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"The first two episodes are boring. And I have problems understanding things. Im not doing binge (I hate binge) and I have no problems with slow series (I prefer them). But Andor... ufff

I dont know why but is too slow. And confusing. But I read that is interesting and dont have jedi stuff and have more ""realistic stuff"" so the next sunday will watch the 3rd episode.

If Kassa is Andor why there are not subs when they are talking in his home planet.

I have find more interesting the officer than Andor as a character.

(P.D: I have problems remenbering names IRL, but that is not my problem with the series)"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I've said this elsewhere but honestly my biggest problem with Andor, if you can call it that, is that the Empire us portrayed so well, so brutally repressive and bureaucratic, I honestly don't believe it would collapse just because the Emperor was killed. The machinery of state will turn regardless of any irrelevant sith nonsense, and crush anyone caught beneath the gears.  Hell in the old EU that was the whole point of characters like Thrawn."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Honey wake up, daily new Disney+ show ad post just dropped"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,[deleted]
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I watched 3 episodes, they were good . I'm just tired of Starwars."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I don't think it will, but lets entertain the idea that the next two episodes suck, the show doesn't stick its landing and all hype dies for it during the wait for season 2.

Even if THAT happens - and again, I don't think it will - the show would've gotten us, for a few episodes, the best writing and acting the IP has ever had in any form or medium. That's not my opinion, it's just an objective fact at this point.

So yes, no matter what you thought ""peak Star Wars"" was, Andor is better."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,You're on crack or meth. No way is Andor better than ESB.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Andor has been slow to get going, imo, but it also has the most potential of any of the Disney series so far.  There’s a real possibility of prominent Imperials showing up, which I didn’t think Disney would do.  For that reason alone I’ll keep watching."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Boo this man!
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"So far, my ONLY gripe about Andor is: Why can't they ALL be this good! I mean, the Bobba Fett nonsense of him just walking around town acting tough and then hiring the Lost Boys on Space Vespas was just bad."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Schill
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Empire Strikes Back is great, I love it. That said, it's overrated. It's not as good as everyone remembers. The storytelling is antiquated by today's standards. People would (undeservedly) tear it apart if it came out new today."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"While it is ""better"" I suspect that longterm it will be far less remembered and loved because it doesn't have nearly as much of the cool Star Wars stuff fans love and remember fondly.  Space battles, lightsaber fights, or even things like the iconic AT-AT attack that still enthralls fans 40+ years later.  What do you think will be remembered about Andor 40 years from now?  Probably not nearly as much as something like ESB.

Don't get me wrong: I love Andor and I think it may be one of the the best stories and productions in the SW universe.  But while high quality it is also more conventional and less Star Wars-unique, and so more forgettable."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,What episode does it get good?
LEGO: CITY Adventures,[deleted]
LEGO: CITY Adventures,It may be better given all its praise but I’m not enjoying it more.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,Nope
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Yeah, sure buddy"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I see you liked the political stuff and some good storyline filled in. There's soooo much dialogue though, it's difficult to ""hang in there"". I will say the prison scenes and spy shit is great. 

Very well done!"
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"no fucking way, not even close is all i'm gonna say."
LEGO: CITY Adventures, CRack is a helluva drug
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I agree with nearly everything you say except saying that ""It's for kids"". Don't age gate entertainment, and make me feel weird for liking something that's ""for kids"""
LEGO: CITY Adventures,I believe you're not joking. But im 100% sure you have very poor taste.
LEGO: CITY Adventures,It's 100% better this shit is AMAZING
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Please do not go off the deep end. Andor is a good show and it may be some peoples favorite Star Wars media, but the praise for ""Disney Star Wars: Prison Break the Mature/Dark/Grownup Show"" is becoming laughable."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"I really agree with this.  I grew up with Star Wars, it was a huge part of my childhood but damn....some people take it waaaay too seriously.  Like ease up, it's called STAR WARS.  Got to be one of the the dumbest movie names of all times.  Luckily they didn't go with Planet Battle I guess."
LEGO: CITY Adventures,"Ep 10 was the last of the season right? 

Idk the season was super slow moving for as long as the rest will take to air. The writing is pretty good. Fight scenes are kinda subpar but they normally are outside phantom menace"

ninjago,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
Rhyme Time Town,"Fucking A man, totally agree with all of this. The anime is incredible, as is the manga. I’d recommend it for anyone **especially those who don’t like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime. It’s more comparable to a David Fincher film.

The story is just too good to never be adapted, so we’ll get it someday. But yeah, Del Toro would’ve been an ideal person to oversee an adaptation. He said they were shopping it to networks after the HBO deal fell through, but nothing ever came of it, so idk why no one would be interested in a Del Toro written and directed pilot. It hits the exact same demos of something like True Detective."
Rhyme Time Town,"I remember the main problem at the time was the setting.  HBO wanted to chance the setting to US instead of Germany to make it more accessible and for their audience which doesn’t work story wise.   I think today this issue would be moot.  There have been a lot of internationally set dramas that have found a wide audience.

The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.   That just doesn’t fly in Hollywood.   Maybe if it became del toros passion project but nobody is putting up that much time and money without the rights."
Rhyme Time Town,"Here is the opening and ending of the anime, to those that are interested.

Opening - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msTB5r8nUHU)

Ending - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ughzNttzA78"
Rhyme Time Town,"Monster is one of the, if not *the*, greatest anime of all time. I highly recommend it. It draws you in with the suspense and tension and then you stay for how amazing and layered the characters are."
Rhyme Time Town,"If you've never watched Monster, please, go watch one of the best pieces of media put out. Don't judge it because it's an anime. It's a long discussion about the nature of evil, the impact of genetics versus society on the formation of the individual, the rippling consequences of evil . . . I could go on. Johan Liebert is genuinely a frightening villain, and for a long time in the anime, I was truly debating whether he was the antichrist. An incredible show.

Edit: I just remembered the final scene and I'm haunted."
Rhyme Time Town,"Now that i think about it, the manga/anime reminds me of Zodiac, Mindhunter and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from David Fincher.

It explores a lot of darkness within humanity and the ways in which we judge morality."
Rhyme Time Town,This knowledge that you’ve given me that this adaptation was in the works but canned has depressed me. Excellent anime and manga in my top 5. Would’ve made a killer series
Rhyme Time Town,"I just don’t know that the animated Johan translates into live action, for numerous reasons. There are so many incredible characters that I think *would* work in a live setting, but I’m just not sure you could adapt the twins in a satisfying way."
Rhyme Time Town,"To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption. It's not like they don't have the talent to do it; all they lack is money, but if they were to work with some big streaming service that would give them enough freedom and a decent budget, then it should be fine. 

HBO and Del Toro would certainly do a good job, but they would also adapt it to the western taste. I'd rather have someone like Kurosawa do it.

Anyway, it will probably never happen, but at least we have a great anime adaption."
Rhyme Time Town,Considering all the other live action adaptations Hollywood has done over the years a Monster  live action series seems like the one with greatest chance of doing well.
Rhyme Time Town,Wish someone could do a live action of any Naoki Urusawa's works.
Rhyme Time Town,"I think now more than ever would be the perfect time to adapt it. Streaming services such as Netflix have proved that international productions work, and so if it were to be a German production (or perhaps Czech co-production) it would still likely find a pretty large audience. But I also wouldn't mind an English-language version so long as it's faithful to the setting (like Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). And whereas in the past you'd likely get a whitewashed version of Tenma's character, I'd think these days studios wouldn't forego an Asian lead."
Rhyme Time Town,Sounds dumb
Rhyme Time Town,"Honestly, that is also how i tried to convince some of my friends to watch it.

The **anime for those that don't like anime** and that is comparable to a David Fincher film/series, as pretentious as that may possibly sound.

HBO would have been the best network for it, beyond a doubt.

They could probably make 3 seasons of this, 10 episodes each.

The week to week releases as the mystery gets darker and darker would be great to witness in a live-action format."
Rhyme Time Town,"Unfortunately the tv spending spree is coming to an end. That said, Monster would be a much less expensive production than 98% of other anime adapted projects out there. There could be hope if there are people who really want to get it done."
Rhyme Time Town,"
>I’d recommend it for anyone **especially those who don’t like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime.

Haha,  that was me! I wasn't into sci-fi, ninjas, robots, or goofy comedy animes, but my friend showed me the 1st episode of Monster when it came out, and I was hooked. I'm a big Fincher fan too.

That was the gateway for me to get into Urasawa's other works (20th Century Boys, Billy Bat), plus other dark/psychological animes like Satoshi Kon's work (Perfect Blue,  Paranoia Agent)."
Rhyme Time Town,"IIRC it was an interview with Del Toro in the past couple years, but I think I remember him saying it’s still on his list of dream projects. With Pluto getting an anime adaptation (*fucking finally*) I could see him revisiting trying to push Monster given the author is in the limelight again. He’s at the point in his career where he’s in his right to approach a studio with an IP or concept with genuine enthusiasm from the studio.  

Also yeah today things could be done in the US given the current political climate, but I also think HBO would be more receptive to having the series in its original setting nowadays."
Rhyme Time Town,"Who in their right mind would want it set in America? The setting, the story is German with literal nazi’s and eugenics."
Rhyme Time Town,">The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.

Good for him for having the balls to make that play. Hollywood has a horrible track record for live action anime adaptations, worse than video game adaptations. More mangakas should be way more protective about their IP when Hollywood comes knocking."
Rhyme Time Town,"Yeah, i guess the behind the scenes of this production would be a little more tricker than i expected.

The US setting would be a big No No.

I could see the german couple that did Netflix's Dark making a good adaptation.

Dark had a lot of 1980s Germany scenes in it and there was a lot of good character drama and exploration of the human psyche, alongside some philosophies of what it means to live and die."
Rhyme Time Town,"The character studies in this are incredible. There is this short story told by this old man when he used to be a sniper. He was assigned to kill this businessman. He observes the man from distance, ready to kill him. The man is putting sugar in his coffee and the sniper thinks he'll pull the trigger when the man finishes stirring his coffee and take a sip of it. But the man keeps on adding sugar in his coffee over and over again and the sniper simply can't shoot anymore and quits his job. There is this another story of his man who killed a guy in a park and from that day on birds won't come in the park anyone. Or that story of the old couple going to visit their son.  Even the one-off characters are so layered."
Rhyme Time Town,One of the captured serial killers reminded me a lot of Ed Kemper too.
Rhyme Time Town,">To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption.

I feel like Japan would be one of the worst countries to adapt this given the material. Like the entire cast is white besides Tenma and a few minor characters, and the story being set in Germany is a pretty integral aspect of the series (there’s a whole subplot in the show about neo-nazi’s that wouldn’t make sense if they were played by a bunch of Japanese guys)."
Rhyme Time Town,so do most drama shows when you try to think about them.
Rhyme Time Town,"I think 4 seasons would be ideal, just because there are natural season finale endpoints in volume 4 where >!Tenma is tied up in the loading dock by racists and the building is set on fire!< , and in volume 9 where >!Tenma sees Johan at the library and tries to kill him!< 

It would be so cool because although he’s the protagonist, Tenma goes in and out of the series a lot while you follow other characters. If they did 4 seasons, they’d likely have to do one season where the lead character is barely in it! 

It’s funny, because regarding THAT choice >!Tenma!< has to make at the end, I could see what he decided to do being extremely controversial nowadays and massively hated similarly to The Last of us 2 or The Last Jedi. But I thought it was great!"
Rhyme Time Town,"Good for him making an unreasonable demand? No show will ever get made like that. 

I could see saying that if he simply said “no” to development partners he didn’t like or trust. But you can’t just ask people to spend millions of dollars making something before deciding to sign off or not. It’s unreasonable. At some point you have to have some faith in the people you are choosing to work with."
Rhyme Time Town,For sure.  I’m torn now - I’d have loved to see this a decade ago on HBO with.  But these days Netflix is more likely to pick this up - theyve had more success with international shows and the 3 season maximum is a draw for their model - But I feel like a lower budget Netflix version would make me sad when this should get the HBO Last of Us/Westworld/GoT production value.  But I guess these days Warner/Discover is having their own $$ issues…
Rhyme Time Town,Well said. Plus every single minor character has a role to play and some payoff. There isn’t a single episode of filler.
Rhyme Time Town,"Yep. 5 scoops of sugar, same as the sniper."
Rhyme Time Town,"I was mostly referring to the potential team behind it: the writer, director, composer etc. Japan has a lot of talented artists and it would be great if they took part in a potential global hit.

The best option imo would be a collab between Japan and Germany. That would make the most faithful adaption."
Rhyme Time Town,"yeah, i won't deny that"
Rhyme Time Town,"I don't think the ending would be as controversial as those 2.

The Last of Us Part 2 and The Last Jedi have to deal with the fact that they are dealing and removing past and lovable characters from the story, while the Monster ending would simply end things."
Rhyme Time Town,"People make demands like this instead of saying no. There was probably some weird clause in the contract giving them rights based on other contingencies but you can weasel out of it by demanding too much.

It’s way more common than you think."
Rhyme Time Town,you are bonkers if you think netflix has a lower budget than hbo
Rhyme Time Town,"I said 10 years ago.  Maybe it’s closer to 12 now, but yes.

Edit: No a decade was perfect House of Cards was 2013."
Rhyme Time Town,This show was soooo different than anything that was on TV in 1990. It like a Everest in the middle of the Sahara
Rhyme Time Town,"The week before TWIN PEAKS premiered, three teenagers in my town went missing and days later their bodies were found in a submerged car pulled from a local creek. It had been an accident. I still remember shuddering while watching TP, especially as the word of Laura Palmer’s death spread. The girl running and screaming through the school courtyard. Laura’s mother screaming as she stared in terror looking up towards her daughter’s empty bedroom. It was a too real/unreal television moment."
Rhyme Time Town,"In undergrad this was prestige TV. 

I went and bought my first TV for this show, a 20 inch VHS combo unit. I grew up with TVs but my folks had always purchased them. In my circle of friends at least 4 people would connect every week to watch Twin Peaks and STNG, and of course to do lots of bong hits."
Rhyme Time Town,"Best theme song ever.

This show is so nostalgic."
Rhyme Time Town,greatest tv show of all time
Rhyme Time Town,how big of a hit was this back in the day?
Rhyme Time Town,"Amazing show. Probably, the most emotional show I’ve ever seen (in cinematic history really). The whole cast will forever be some of my favorite actors due to this show. Simply, awesome."
Rhyme Time Town,And for THEEE LAAAAAAAST TIIIME.
Rhyme Time Town,"If you haven't watched it, do. This show single-handedly changed the look and feel of television forever. Prior to this show, everything looked like VHS. Think Beverly Hills 90210, Simon & Simon, Knight Rider . . . that fuzzy low-res camera look. Twin Peaks brought cinema, with major music, phenomenal camerawork, great acting, and more to television. Without this show, there wouldn't have been The X-Files we know today as well as anything from this new golden age of TV. Check it out!"
Rhyme Time Town,"Because I am sad, a few years back when I was on a road trip up the Pacific Coast Highway to Seattle.   I managed to get a detour to Snoqualmie, Washington.

On the Drive up I quoted the line ""I've never seen so many Trees in my life, As W.C. Fields would say, I'd rather be here than Philadelphia""

My wife had no idea what I was talking about.

I resisted the temptation to murder her and leave her in a local river, wrapped in Plastic."
Rhyme Time Town,"Clean place, reasonably priced."
Rhyme Time Town,30. Years. Holy shit.
Rhyme Time Town,"Friggin $6 for a sandwich, coffee, and desert.

Different times, man."
Rhyme Time Town,"I was born two days later. My mom fell in love with this show. Never realized it came out so close to my birth. I’ve never given it a fair shot, but I suppose I should.

Similarly, The Simpsons debuted two months before my birth. My dad fell in love with that show. I’ve watched far too much of it. Mom hated it."
Rhyme Time Town,"I tried to watch this show, I really did. I got through season 1. But Season 2 having 24 episodes all an hour long kills me. I can't make it through that"
Rhyme Time Town,Deadly Premonition was the closest to Twin Peaks games have ever gotten.
Rhyme Time Town,That was a Saturday. Fred Savage hosted SNL with musical guest Technotronic. Twin Peaks actually premiered on April 8th.
Rhyme Time Town,same with the Return too now I think about it
Rhyme Time Town,Can never forget her mother’s face. It was the worst(best?) cry I had ever seen in my life on tv.
Rhyme Time Town,"Finding Twin Peaks years and years ago always made me sad I never got to experience that with my friends growing up watching it all for the first time. 

Then with season 3 I got that experience. Truly something I’ll never forget"
Rhyme Time Town,until you get to season 3 which is very anti-nostalgia
Rhyme Time Town,The whole album is so surreal. Angelo Badalamenti at his best.
Rhyme Time Town,"come on man.

this show has some real low points, that prevent it from being one of the best ever. like,the entire middle section of season 2."
Rhyme Time Town,"the show had the greatest promise of a TV series of all time, I'll give it that.

I think the formula of a long, drawn out TV series wasn't a milieu conducive to Lynch's best efforts. A great setup, but the years that followed... not good."
Rhyme Time Town,[deleted]
Rhyme Time Town,"Initially it was hugely popular.  The promo with 'She's dead, wrapped in plastic' aired all the time.  Interest dropped off pretty sharply though."
Rhyme Time Town,It was a big water cooler show when it aired.
Rhyme Time Town,"DVRs, On Demand, and streaming weren’t around, but we’d literally leave a dinner out with friends at a restaurant if we forgot to set the VCR.   It was our first Must See TV.  I don’t recall a large quantity of friends watching it, but those that did were fanatic.  Part of the fun that is lost today are the artifacts of not being able to binge TV.  It was glorious."
Rhyme Time Town,"Game of Thrones big, but available to everyone and not behind a subscription paywall. This was prime time television. 

It already started to fade come season 2, but the first 12 episodes was watercooler stuff. ""What do you think?..."""
Rhyme Time Town,"The most emotional show?
*Ahemahem* have you ever heard of The Leftovers?
Leftovers rips away my soul countless times , irrespective of my rewatch count"
Rhyme Time Town,Starring Kyle MacLachlan
Rhyme Time Town,90210 came out the same year
Rhyme Time Town,"I also managed to take a detour to Snoqualmie and North Bend while on a trip to Seattle. Fortunately, the weather was perfect for atmosphere, cold and misty, and we were able to stop in at the diner (Twede's Cafe) when it wasn't *too* busy. All in all, cool experience."
Rhyme Time Town,How much would that be now in the states?
Rhyme Time Town,Season 2 definitely drags in the middle but if you can push through it the ending is pretty great and then Season 3 might be the greatest season of television ever made. The movie isn't bad either
Rhyme Time Town,"I just finished watching for the first time and I totally feel you on this. For the first half of Season 2, it felt like a chore that I had to force myself to watch. But if you can manage to make it through, it does eventually pick back up and I think it’s worth it in the end!"
Rhyme Time Town,Same I wanna get back into it but it's been so long since I've last watched it that I need to go through season 1 again and I just can't do it lol.
Rhyme Time Town,"This is legit what killed it for it, half way through season 2, the murders been solved and theres still like 12+ episodes left. Still havent finished it to this day."
Rhyme Time Town,"Do you not watch any other shows that have hour long episodes? I thought you were going to say that you had trouble getting into it because of how surreal and wild it is, which would be understandable because Twin Peaks isn't something that's going to vibe with everyone. If the barrier for you is the fact that season two has 24 hour long episodes then I'm not really sure what the issue there is unless you simply don't watch anything that has episodes that long."
Rhyme Time Town,Alan Wake also had a little bit of Twin Peaks going on.
Rhyme Time Town,"But, in the show it was February 24th. That's what is being referenced here."
Rhyme Time Town,I was 22 and it was a unique experience in television at the time. Especially living in the PNW. 80’s and 90’s was an explosion of indie films.
Rhyme Time Town,"> I never got to experience that with my friends growing up watching it all for the first time.

Yeah it was really wild that Lynch was going to be on network TV."
Rhyme Time Town,"I did not *like* season 3, but I appreciated the unapologetic stance of ""the whole point of the show is that trauma lasts, we can never replace what we lost, and closure is a narrative illusion,"" which turned season three into basically a white-eyed doppelganger of the original series."
Rhyme Time Town,I think season three shows how corrosive nostalgia can be.
Rhyme Time Town, the high points far outweigh the low points. def has my vote for greatest tv show of all time.
Rhyme Time Town,_For about a year_. Don't over-sell it. It was a brilliant show but once the murder was wrapped up in S2 the audience tuned out and then it nose-dived for a year into cancellation.
Rhyme Time Town,I was a preteen and would watch it so I could talk to the older teenage girls at family parties.  It really was a huge hit.
Rhyme Time Town,"I love the Leftovers! Yes, very emotional (I mean it’s a show basically about grief), but Twin Peaks just gets a weird innocence-loss type of feeling. It’s strange. But yes, Carrie Coon and Justin Theroux are awesome. I do think the show itself in terms of writing, direction, and acting is as good (if not better) than Twin Peaks (and most shows)."
Rhyme Time Town,And “The Returned” - French Season 1
Rhyme Time Town,In NJ probably $10-$15 depending on if you did a cheaper diner vs. somewhere more expensive.
Rhyme Time Town,">The movie isn't bad either

One hell of an understatement there"
Rhyme Time Town,dont miss out on the movie and season 3 if you havent watched them yet
Rhyme Time Town,"Season 1 I find incredibly easy to rewatch tbh and it’s only 8 episodes, and the first half of s2 is great. It’s the latter episodes of s2 that are a struggle then the finale is amazing"
Rhyme Time Town,"I dunno, I adore Buffy and its one of my all time favourite shows but seasons that are 20 or so hour long episodes do feel excessive, even for something that’s tightly written, and Twin Peaks S2 meanders a LOT. I get the struggle with that one."
Rhyme Time Town,"I can deal with slow burns, but 24 hours of it is too much. I do watch hour shows but these days seasons are 10 to 12 episodes. This being 24 is a little too much"
Rhyme Time Town,I know.
Rhyme Time Town,"Back then, network TV was where it was at."
Rhyme Time Town,"Yeah, ABC forcing the reveal (that was never going to happen) really screwed the pooch."
Rhyme Time Town,still a pretty long time for a show that weird to be discussed so widely
Rhyme Time Town,And I'm guessing the salaries didn't double.
Rhyme Time Town,I try not to oversell the movie too much. I love it but it definitely isn't in my top 3 Lynch movies. I think if you go in expecting Mulholland Dr or Blue Velvet you might be a bit disappointed
Rhyme Time Town,"Wow.  You are one of those who have been brainwashed by our current viewing formats.  Seasons of 6 or 10 shows are common nowadays, whereas ALL shows had 22-26 shows a season just 10 years ago.  Back in the 60s some shows had 34.  Batman was on twice a week and had a huge season order.  The downfall began with ""winter breaks"" and ""fall finale""s.  A show like Bones would be on for 10 episodes then disappear for three months.  I'd forget it was even on anymore, assume it got cancelled, and forget about it.  Then it's back after a space as long as what used to be between seasons.  Once they put one season on over two years.  Hey guys, that's 2 short seasons, not one.  Shows with 6 episodes a season I don't even bother watching, because by the time it comes back I'll have forgotten the last part and have to rewatch it just to understand what's going on.  Mary Kills People was a great show, but altogether it's not a lot of screen time, and it wasted years getting it over with.  If this had 22 episodes a year I'd consider it one of the greatest things ever on TV.  Instead it's just a few hours to pass an afternoon, then move on."
Rhyme Time Town,"Carry on, then."
Rhyme Time Town,"I gotta say though if they hadn’t revealed the killer I do think it would’ve been something of a disappointment, especially with the reveal being one of the scariest moments of the whole show"
Floor Is Lava,[deleted]
Floor Is Lava,I’m halfway through S2 and it’s about as enjoyable as the first season. Most of the entertainment value comes from seeing people bite it and me thinking “could I make that jump?”
Floor Is Lava,"My favorite part of the first season was that when people fell in, they'd disappear for the rest of the episode. It was funny in a dark way.

 Now they appear on the walkway to watch the other contestants. Small difference, but a break in a small goofy element I cherished."
Floor Is Lava,It's still just a stupid gameshow. With that being said. Everything is so dramatic and I binged watched it in an afternoon.
Floor Is Lava,Really good show
Floor Is Lava,This is me and my wife's guilty pleasure haha. Watched the first season super baked.
Floor Is Lava,I’m just annoyed I thought some AEW guys were gunna be on it.
Floor Is Lava,"Its a dumb fun kinda show, take it for what it is"
Floor Is Lava,"Ridiculous that they force a successful team of three to cut one player from the volcano final, though. Figure out something for all the successful team to do — Didn’t like that!"
Floor Is Lava,"I like the idea of a final challenge but I feel like the final one seems to easy and not enough stakes. 

They couldve made it like an attempt to get balls back and forth from one spot to the next but have collapsible stuff or obstacles they have to go through.  Plus they'd be more prone to make mistakes if they wiped out.  Once you're out, you're out and down a person.  That'd be higher stakes."
Floor Is Lava,I like it but it bugs me that so much of their bodies can touch the lava now. It's call Floor is lava but half their bodies are getting dunked. Season 1 was definitely better in it's stricter approach to the rules imo
Floor Is Lava,"I can see that point, I do feel the final round was a needed addition to make it feel more cohesive. But maybe they can change up what the final round environment is? I like it because it reminds me of the GUTS Aggrocragg"
Floor Is Lava,"> Most of the entertainment value comes from seeing people bite it and me thinking “could I make that jump?”

And can they!?!?!?!"
Floor Is Lava,They are in the second batch of episodes. I think they said late summer or fall.
Floor Is Lava,"It's not for every episode, which is weird. I think its like 2 or 3 episodes that only have two team members at the end. Some other people posted that maybe its because of injury or something."
Floor Is Lava,"Yep, found that out with more viewings — weird!"
Floor Is Lava,"Something that irked me about the show was that the rooms start to repeat 1/2 way through. I'm not so into the contestants as I am into the rooms themselves, so when they started to repeat I kind of checked out. Also, the rooms felt too samey. There'd always be something on the left wall to shimmy across, and there'd always be some secret key on the back right side. It just felt like it could have used a lot more variety.

I think that gameshows on netflix all share the same primary problem: they explain the rules too much. Nobody is watching the episodes out of order, so you don't need to recap it in every single episode. It just feels like it's there to pad out the episodes. I feel that the episodes could have been a tight 30 minutes."
Floor Is Lava,It so strange seeing Rutledge host a show that has nothing to do with cars
Floor Is Lava,"They should have the skin melt off the bones of the people who fall into the 'lava.' Or at the very least animate it and have the survivors really ham it up - like screaming, tearing at their faces with their nails, openly weeping. Right now I do not believe that the floor is actually lava."
Floor Is Lava,"Unfortunately, Rutledge is the worst part of that show."
Floor Is Lava,"The show was a hit? I couldn't make it through one episode.

Half of it is listening to people yell and chitchat. The other half is them doing a course that was clearly explained to them. Was hoping for ninja warrior, got interviews with random nobodies instead."
Floor Is Lava,"This show is very fun but I hope in future seasons, they don't reuse rooms. I feel like using each room for two episodes make it a little less fun for the viewer.

Also, I wish the interview went into more detail about how this is shot. Rutledge said they only filmed the winner moments 10 times but they are always so dry and untouched. Is that moment filmed hours later? Is it filmed on another day?

Also, I'd love to see a blueprint of the sets. How deep is the ""lava"" and where do the participants go after they've been eliminated? Do they sink down for their ""dying"" moment, production pauses so that they can come back up, leave, and then resume the game?"
Floor Is Lava,"Only thing that bothers me is when he says, ""that's a six feet gap"" when clearly it looks smaller than the contestant.  No way is it six feet if the can extend their leg to it."
Floor Is Lava,"I only watched the first episode. It isn't my thing but I am happy for the creator because it is a fun show, he seems to have a blast doing it and he got his project on Netflix!

Well done him."
Floor Is Lava,[deleted]
Floor Is Lava,The announcer on this show is terrible. His phrases and inflection reminds me of Gene from Bob's Burgers
Floor Is Lava,i see alot of comments on how Rutledge is terrible. I'm not sure it's him....it feels like he's being provided bad writing for commentary voice over. It feels unnatural and forced.
Floor Is Lava,"This show is completely terrible, it sucked the fun out of something I didn't think possible."
Floor Is Lava,"Great concept, but ruined by all the obnoxious American contestants."
Floor Is Lava,"I played floor is lava well into my twenties but I couldn't get through the first episode.

The room was some artifacts looking room that seemed pretty simple.

The mother, her kids, and host were all annoying.

There was so many replays and angles, so unnecessary.

Netflix should just get the streaming rights to MXC and not bother making their own shows like this."
Floor Is Lava,"I'm pretty sure they did reshoots of the contestants going under the ""lava"", because there was a couple occasions where the dramatic replay would look totally different from what actually happened."
Floor Is Lava,"I literally have no idea who the host of the show is. I’ve never seen Top Gear, and thought he was slightly charming.
The show itself is so repetitive, you’re gonna guess what happens in almost every room. I mean it’s fun, it’s just missing the factor that’ll keep me watching."
Floor Is Lava,I enjoyed the show but I leaned heavily on the +10 button because there was too much repeating of the rules and too many action replays.
Floor Is Lava,"I didn't think the rooms seemed challenging enough and, yes, was really disappointed they repeated them.   I also hate the clip show BEFORE the episode starts of what is going to happen.  I also felt like the contestants knew exactly where the hidden keys and stuff were, like they'd been told beforehand. 


I love the theme though and their dedication to it, liked that when a contestant was gone you didn't see them again.   I liked what small challenges they had.  The contestants were interesting, but I could tell in just about every episode who would make it and who wouldn't. 


I hope they improve it for season 2."
Floor Is Lava,"I feel the same about Ultimate Beastmaster, they just keep explaining the fucking obstacle course to me. I get it. I've seen it for an hour now. 

That and Floor is Lava also lean so heavily on the ""getting to know the contestants"" segments and that's honestly the fucking worst."
Floor Is Lava,"I always wonder if maybe Netflix is hedging their bets and making these shows watchable on normal TV. If shit hits the fan they could sell off their originals to different channels, and the format would barely need to change."
Floor Is Lava,"Explain the rules and recaping what happened. Basically they're doing like they're on regular TV with ad breaks, people joining in whenever and such but they're on Netflix. People watch when they want there and mostly in order. They could actually build game shows and TV reality that isn't absurdely padded by this stuff (so better)"
Floor Is Lava,The same reason I can't even get through a single episode of American Ninja Warrior.  Just the same course over and over and over and over and over and...
Floor Is Lava,"You have moved from cynicism to psychopathy.


*And I completely support it.*


* *She jumps left, she jumps right, ooo tough break for Gretchen.   She's gonna miss those legs.  Let's go to the Family Reaction Isolation Booth.  Its tears & screams all around for this non binary family...wait, except for her wife.   I'm guessing Lisa popped ""The Secret insurance Button"" earlier,  which would have wiped out all of their winnings had Gretchen succeeded. Smart move on her part.   So the couple lost a pair of legs & the big prize of $500,000 but at least they're going home with $50,000.  Remember folks, the floor really is lava!*"
Floor Is Lava,The fact that the contests' blood isn't boiling underneath their own skin due to their proximity to lava really takes me out of it.
Floor Is Lava,It's so true. Nothing against him personally. I just always hate when hosts of these kind of shows attempt being funny. We're here for the game.
Floor Is Lava,Replace him with Kirk Fogg from Legends of the Hidden Temple
Floor Is Lava,Are you sure it's not the loud contestants?
Floor Is Lava,">  I couldn't make it through one episode.

I couldn't make it throught the first 5 minutes. Endless explainations of the game show. I mean, it's a concept that's played by young children, why do you need to explain it to me over and over again as if I were stupid? Get on with the show! Just say ""Contestants have to get from one door to another without touching the floor"". And that's it. Let people discover the different obstacles and game elements during the show itself and not explain it to death. Show and don't tell!"
Floor Is Lava,It was a hit among 8-10 year old boys at my house.
Floor Is Lava,"It looks quite deep, right? Because they seem to always go under. Its got to be waist height at least.

I always thought they must have kept going pretty immediately to keep the momentum going. I'm presuming the person just wades out and they keep rolling."
Floor Is Lava,I bet they measure from the center points of the objects or some sneaky jazz like that
Floor Is Lava,"That was my guess as well.

The announcer is awful.

The contestants are awful.


The dialogue feels forced and scripted. The courses aren't really that interesting.


It was a good concept, but it needs to be about a third the runtime with better rooms. Whoever decided 'yes, let's hang from a net as someone slowly spins a wheel' needs to be removed from the show.


After the first contestants I skipped at least 70% of the next episode."
Floor Is Lava,"I mean... it's not NOT him. With a show like this, you're as good or as bad as your writers."
Floor Is Lava,"Agreed. I lasted 10 minutes into the first episode and gave up. The contestants were annoying, the host was more annoying. 

And if I heard someone shouting ""The FLOOOOR...is..LAVA!"" one more time I would have climbed a tower and started shooting. (With a camera, of course. That's how I relax.)"
Floor Is Lava,We are being entertained to death.
Floor Is Lava,"This, I still retain some attention span I don't need a recap of someone falling over, also the voice over is atrocious."
Floor Is Lava,This show was perfect for me to have on in the background (on my tablet) while I was playing video games. I can look over every now and then and really not miss anything.
Floor Is Lava,">I hope they improve it for season 2.

I think one way they could try to improve would be to have competing teams in the room at the same time. Maybe have a rule that they aren't allowed to have physical contact with each other, to prevent fighting. But it'd be fun to see people having to make strategic decisions on the fly that would block certain contestants on the opposing team to move forward."
Floor Is Lava,"I need a Gladiators reboot in my life. With absolutely none of the contestant backstory just the challenges.

""Here's two contestants, one of them is now about to face off with a Gladiator and they both have massive fucking sticks they'll try boink each other off the platform with, enjoy"""
Floor Is Lava,but as a telestreaming executive I know what people watching these shows want......sob stories
Floor Is Lava,And replace the rest of the show with Legends of the Hidden Temple.
Floor Is Lava,"Not only do they tell you, the viewer, but they also tell the contestants. They all go straight for the ""secrets""."
Floor Is Lava,"[In this vid, you can see the production designers testing the lava in tank and how it works with the various bubblers, lights and whatnot](https://youtu.be/XzuGPPrHV3I?t=268). 

[And at this part in the same vid, you can see them testing the obstacles in a pool](https://youtu.be/XzuGPPrHV3I?t=114)

Both look to be waist height, so I'd say you're right."
Floor Is Lava,It's likely built into a diving pool. They are usually about 10ft deep for a majority of the pool.
Floor Is Lava,Right? I was actively rooting for the rooms to win.
Floor Is Lava,I don't mind a rewatch of a good face smash.
Floor Is Lava,Never watch Korean variety shows then haha
Floor Is Lava,"They tried rebooting it a couple years back but it didn't ""take"" for some reason, but you're totally right.  Just show some dude excited to get a chance to run their obstacle course while Malibu shoots goddamn tennis balls at him.  It's not rocket science."
Floor Is Lava,"It's honestly the fucking worst. 

I love the Great British Bake Off and it saves most of that shit until the last episode, getting to see their home life is like a reward for making it to the final three. They talk about why they're on the show throughout, but it's not these heavy handed sob story packages. 

The obstacle course ones are the worst when they show a highlight package of a man who's wife killed herself and then she gave birth to quintuplets, each with a different life threatening heart condition, and how this heroic man lost his legs in Iraq while raising his quintuplets and putting himself through night school... and then he fails on the first fucking obstacle. Fuck off. Why did I even watch all of that?"
Floor Is Lava,A legends of the hidden temple reboot is something I’d watch in a heartbeat.
Floor Is Lava,lol that style has flooded TV in South America too
Floor Is Lava,"The 2008 reboot? That was actually my first exposure to the show and I loved it. Was my absolute favorite show at the time and some of the games were inspired. Though I did feel the American counterpart was noticeably more backstory heavy than the English one at the time.

For reference I'm Irish so I've watched the English version of the show a hell of a lot more than the American."
Floor Is Lava,"Normally I'd agree with you but...it is being rebooted for Quibi.  So hard pass

https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/12/legends-of-the-hidden-temple-returning-quibi/"
Floor Is Lava,"Oh man, you GOTTA go back and check out the version from the 90's.  That's the real winner."
Floor Is Lava,If you have pluto tv there is a channel that only shows American Gladitors.
Floor Is Lava,Ain't that a treat?
Floor Is Lava,Community already did this
Floor Is Lava,3 comments and two of them mention Community as if they came up with the “floor is lava” game.
Floor Is Lava,"The fact that Community is trending well enough on Netflix that they’re making shows ripping off specific episodes gives me hope for that movie 

Or at least brining the Joel McHale Show back. It keeps showing up in the “popular on Netflix” queue even though all the jokes are years out of date. Is there a chance we get it back?"
Floor Is Lava,Sounds a bit better than competitive tag...
Floor Is Lava,Insert Mario lava death noise here
Floor Is Lava,Community didn't invent this
Floor Is Lava,Community fans are more annoying than Rick and morty fans
Floor Is Lava,"You really think they produced an entire reality show within the month it’s been since Community was added, in the middle of a global pandemic? “The floor is lava” has existed for a much longer time than Community. This would be like saying that every paintball match is a reference to the show."
Floor Is Lava,"As a Community fan, you’re not necessarily wrong."
Floor Is Lava,"Maybe it's just Dan Harmon fans, I say as someone who likes both of these shows."
Floor Is Lava,I hope it has a Shirley’s Island.
Floor Is Lava,"Man just bring back that Temple game show that was for kids that was awesome! he had to run around and find a golden monkey, man it's been a long time since I watched it but I always wanted to go on the show as a kid."
Floor Is Lava,I hope they play True American.
Floor Is Lava,I cannot wait to get high and watch this
Floor Is Lava,Knock knock!
Floor Is Lava,Legends of the hidden temple?
Floor Is Lava,"I am sorry to have to let you down:

> On December 16, 2019, it was announced that a reboot aimed at adults will premiere in April 2020 on Quibi. No host has yet been announced. Casting for the reboot was announced on March 10, 2020 in a tweet by Quibi."
Floor Is Lava,Check out Jedi Temple on YouTube. Star Wars just launched a very similar show but Star Wars themed.
Floor Is Lava,That sounds right
Floor Is Lava,[deleted]
Floor Is Lava,"I agree with this article, Holey Moley is vastly superior in all ways."
Floor Is Lava,To me it's not surprising really. It's just Wipeout in a different format. I thought it was good but it never let me skip the intro for some reason and I wish they didn't explain each course so I could discover things along with people.
Floor Is Lava,"It makes me laugh. When someone falls into the lava and sinks right under as if they actually FUCKING DIE and their friends go *""NOOOOOOO CHAD, NOOOOOOO!!!!""* it's hilarious.

I do make heavy use of the (10+) button though, as there's lots of action replays."
Floor Is Lava,Why do the contestants take forever to make their moves?
Floor Is Lava,"did you never play that game as a kid?  get from the kitchen to the living room without touching the floor because ""the floor is lava"".  i thought that game was pretty much universal. I know now I was wrong."
Floor Is Lava,"It’s the most popular show *on Netflix* in America. That’s not marketing speak, Netflix has the actual data."
Floor Is Lava,Holey Moley's announcer team is perfect. Tessetori plays a great straight man to Riggle.
Floor Is Lava,mini golf is more fun than watching people fall into lava? lol ok
I Want to Get Married,"The writers: ""so you want the Dexter ending, got it"""
I Want to Get Married,"He's needed what was coming to him since season two at least, let's be honest."
I Want to Get Married,"Jfc, if Joe doesn’t get what’s coming to him, imma be ticked off. 

His character makes me so mad. I know Penn is tired of Joe, but he plays him so well.. there is a look that Joe has that just crawls under my skin."
I Want to Get Married,Penn is tired of being joe
I Want to Get Married,"It’s hilarious to me how everyone just falls in love with Joe even though he’s shady AF and kinda boring without the inner dialogue. Also, no one recognizes him when he wears a hat. It’s a freaking hat, not a mask! Either way, his way of life cannot last very long. He needs to get what’s coming to him eventually."
I Want to Get Married,"You know you’re so over work shit when even the bags 💰💰 don’t matter anymore (I wish I had that problem, lol)."
I Want to Get Married,What’s about the piss jar?
I Want to Get Married,"Honestly it’s getting more and more ridiculous how Joe keeps getting away with everything.  The plot is having to twist itself into more and more pretzels.  And everyone else has to be written as stupid constantly.

Also the characters in Season 4 weren’t a good/interesting as in previous seasons either imo."
I Want to Get Married,I liked it
I Want to Get Married,"I don't want Joe to win, but I also don't want his downfall to come out of nowhere, exactly like in this season >!Nadia suspected of him out of the hat!< because the plot required so.

He's an incredibly clever individual, has a sharp criminal and anaytical mind, and now is more deranged than ever because he's embraced his more psycho aspect rather than the empathetic one. He is dangerous, and now has endless resources to act as he wills.

He'll fall, but the person (or people) who will take him down will need to do so because they proved themselves to be as smart or more, have a good plan and not just get OP because the plot required him to be defeated. He needs to face his nemesis in this season, an anti-Joe, it's the only way his demise will pay off the fans."
I Want to Get Married,"They made a huge mistake by >!killing off Victoria Pederetti's Love!< in Season 3. That dynamic between the two of them could have been stretched over two more seasons and they let that opportunity go.

I liked the first half of season 4 but the second half was a mess. They made so many non sensical choices."
I Want to Get Married,"Considering 'You' is an almost-sequel to 'Gossip Girl', I wonder what show they will make for Penn to play a creeper in next."
I Want to Get Married,Wait I thought this season is supposed  to be the last. What happened?
I Want to Get Married,[deleted]
I Want to Get Married,"This could have been great if it was just one season, adding a wife and baby was the most moronic shit I have ever seen."
I Want to Get Married,"I tried to watch Season 4 with my GF and this show needs a B plot. Joe cant carry the whole thing. He needs more interactions with that female student, she’s good"
I Want to Get Married,I really hope that it would be the last too. I feel like the move of splitting this season into 2 parts didn't work either. Maybe they wanted the audience to theorize and stuff about the whodunnit but the payoff was not worth it at all.
I Want to Get Married,why is everyone so afraid of letting a bad guy win for once
I Want to Get Married,I liked most of season 4 except for the last episode or two. It seems like they just no idea what direction to take it in
I Want to Get Married,"Just finished season 4 and ugh, worse than season 3. Easily gets away with shit done in broad daylight and some lame twists."
I Want to Get Married,"Sounds like they have a plan and knows how the show should end. I hope Netflix listens and gives them a fifth and final season, rather than pushing for more. 'You' deserves a good ending while the show is still good


Considering where season 4 ended, I think they can squeeze out 10 more good episodes of Joe... joe'ing his way through love, murders and mayhem. Anything beyond a 5th season would probably end up feeling tired and repetitive"
I Want to Get Married,AGREED.
I Want to Get Married,So can anyone explain why Kaye is perfectly fine being with a serial killer?
I Want to Get Married,The newest season was fucking terrible. I couldn’t even finish it :(
I Want to Get Married,I couldn’t finish season 4 after 4 episodes.
I Want to Get Married,Should’ve stopped at season 1
I Want to Get Married,Plus the show gets worse with every season
I Want to Get Married,I wanted season 3 to be the last.
I Want to Get Married,"Season 4, at least the first part has been the best since season 1. Season 3 was clearly quite weak"
I Want to Get Married,He hates this show. Every interview he gives his disdain for the character and everything around it is so palpable
I Want to Get Married,"I’m about to be done with season 4, so I’m not really reading most of these posts. While I don’t like Joe, any hope of “redemption” is out the window when I look back and remember he straight up murdered that woman in the first season."
I Want to Get Married,Can I stop at Season 3 or 1 as series finale?
I Want to Get Married,"US shows that star a vilain always end with them getting punished. I get why, but this certainty has become lazily redundant."
I Want to Get Married,"Honestly, S4 is dreadful when compared to the first three seasons and it’s well and truly gone beyond suspension of disbelief. S4 should have been the last."
I Want to Get Married,"There's going to be *another* season??? I thought 4 was the wrap. I forgave many things in those last 3 episodes just because i was convinced it would be ending.

I have no desire to see Joe/Love redux. I'm out."
I Want to Get Married,They've been trying to make Joe look good by having him run into people crazier than him and making him out to be some kind of Dexter. He's a creepy serial killer that preys on women.
I Want to Get Married,"The way this show treats this horrible monster of a protagonist is just gross at this point. It’s not remotely self aware. They will continue to milk the sexual intrigue and glamour as long as they can, go deeper into cartoonish depictions of mental illness, yeah. I have never understood how people enjoy this show, it’s like a trashy soap opera/reality TV/true crime hybrid."
I Want to Get Married,Yeah 5 season of the same shit. I'll say 1st season was suspenseful. After that it's just a money grab.
I Want to Get Married,Honestly couldn't even really finish the third season. Not even sure if I made it halfway... Saw previews for the fourth and thought wow the same bullshit...
I Want to Get Married,Been watching the new season and near the end and disappointed as I liked the first half they released. I was like really....Mr. Robot vibes and not feeling creative.
I Want to Get Married,"Wtf kinda spoiler bullshit is this 

I got 2 episodes left of this season. Not everyone watches the entire show the day it's released.

God damn"
I Want to Get Married,Unpopular opinion : This season is TRASH .
I Want to Get Married,"I was very relieved that that one person survived, but how is she going on with her life knowing that young lady that helped save her is locked up in prison for things Joe did???"
I Want to Get Married,I wish I still had Netflix 😢
I Want to Get Married,Love the show but yeah it should probably end next season with Joe seeing the chickens come home to roost.
I Want to Get Married,Are they making 5?
I Want to Get Married,And so he can play Reed Richards in the MCU
I Want to Get Married,God damn it!! Articles like this spoil the fact that he doesn’t die at the end of S4!!!!!
I Want to Get Married,not watched the 2nd half yet but I thought this was gonna be the last season...that maybe he was moving on to errr bigger things like possibly fantastic 4
I Want to Get Married,Season 4 was the best season yet! Love this show.
I Want to Get Married,"Didn’t they say 4 would be the last?!? I’m in shock. But yeah, the way Joe won and got his “dream” & “love” happy ending left me unsatisfied. Joe does need to get what’s coming to him and I hope Marianne is the one to serve it to him on a silver platter."
I Want to Get Married,HE CAN’T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT!!!
I Want to Get Married,It's time
I Want to Get Married,Isn't he like a pedo or smtn how is he still like staring in a show
I Want to Get Married,What do you mean? I never said that!
I Want to Get Married,Can't believe Netflix granted a final season for this show when it has a perfect ending in Season 4.
I Want to Get Married,Which Dexter ending?
I Want to Get Married,"I mean he's needed what's coming to him since season 1.

This season has kinda just taken away the allure of Joe I guess."
I Want to Get Married,>!I think a lot of the twist this season was a way of reminding folks Joe is the bad guy.  Spent so much of the season acting like the hero and thinking he was trying to save lives and then BOOM.!<
I Want to Get Married,"The impression that I got from reading the article is that he's actually pushing for another season, which has not been confirmed yet. Did you gather something else from the article?

Second paragraph:

*""It feels to me like we need to do another season. It feels to me like Joe needs to get what’s coming to him, and now he has further to fall because he has all this power and wealth,” Badgley said. “But of course, that’s not up to me. I don’t know where it’s going. But to me, with this concept and with this character, we always wanted to be responsible and it’s not just the kind of thing we can let keep going because it’s doing well.”*"
I Want to Get Married,[deleted]
I Want to Get Married,Does this add to the rumours of him being cast as Reed  Richards?
I Want to Get Married,"Which is fair. 

Season one was great when he was a villain but then the show decided “wait, what if we just keep sticking him with worse and worse people so he can be our protagonist”. It’s so stupid and kills the whole point of the show."
I Want to Get Married,He's may have signed a 7 season deal though so he may not have much choice.
I Want to Get Married,Penn Badgley said a few years ago that the show was about how far people will go to forgive an evil white man
I Want to Get Married,"Yeah, he probably makes more in a year than most Americans make in their life."
I Want to Get Married,Yeah. >!he's managed to find two separate women who can basically buy off the entire police department for a city who also have no qualms about dating someone like him. It's absurd at this point.!<
I Want to Get Married,Me too! I know it gets difficult to continue a story when the main actors or creators are just burnt out. But I’m here for it whatever they do and hope they keep going for more than one more season. I love this show.
I Want to Get Married,"Will probably get downvoted hard (I know there’s a lot of fans of her out there) but her character started to get on my nerves in season 3 and I felt it was a blessing to have her killed off. I think season 4 should have been last, especially when >!Joe jumped in the water!<"
I Want to Get Married,The show should have wrapped up there.
I Want to Get Married,"they seemed terrifed to change the status quo.

But going from the lead being a stalker dude
to him and his murderous wife dealing with shit  would be a great move"
I Want to Get Married,I was hoping he died and she became the protagonist. Would be a cool twist.
I Want to Get Married,"Loved the first half of season 4, hating the second"
I Want to Get Married,Yeah the ending was pretty disappointing
I Want to Get Married,"Show was definitely fraying bad this season. Is 5 just going to be 3 all over again, or...? 

He can't keep getting away with it!"
I Want to Get Married,I feel like >!rhys!< could fill that role pretty well
I Want to Get Married,Agreed and honestly not creative to me. I was immediately like wtf the plot foundation regarding his mental health like Mr Robot.
I Want to Get Married,Yes! It was super bizarre and the two sections didn’t make sense as a whole.
I Want to Get Married,"I like season 4. Good change in direction, the whole murder mystery angle freshen it up. It just needed the writers to tighten up the plot holes and it would have been so much better."
I Want to Get Married,"The fight club twist in s4 upset me, like poor writing to a pretty well written show"
I Want to Get Married,"True. People want everything to be sunshines and roses, they want the cliché ‘happy ending’ where the bad guy finally gets what’s coming to him and all the people he wronged (the ones still alive at least) get redemption. But that’s the thing, in real life sometimes (maybe a lot of times), the bad guy gets away with it and comes out looking like the hero, or the victim. It’d be interesting to see a show where they actually parallel reality for once and stop pretending the bad guy always gets caught in the end.. because most times, they fucking don’t. And it sucks, but that’s the harsh reality."
I Want to Get Married,Yeah I felt it was very weak as well.
I Want to Get Married,"At this point, I suspect the plan for season five is “back a money truck into Jenna Ortega’s driveway and have her come back to be the one who kills Joe.”"
I Want to Get Married,because she's a weirdo
I Want to Get Married,Because of her own past she feels like she is just as bad as he is
I Want to Get Married,Seems like they are gonna build her up as another Love
I Want to Get Married,"The second half is a little better. It solved the problems of the first half while creating new, different problems and potholes."
I Want to Get Married,"Same.

I just went and watched the YT channel ‘The Recaps’ to finish off the season, summarized."
I Want to Get Married,SAME! I even tried to go back for the first episode of season 4 and couldn’t get into it.. my coworkers said the same thing
I Want to Get Married,Fr would have been great as a limited series. But Netflix gotta Netflix and milk the cash cow until it runs dry. You can only write so many clueless idiots until it gets boring
I Want to Get Married,you can hate the character without hating the show. it would be weird it anyone playing Joe didn't hate the character
I Want to Get Married,Did you miss all his other murders
I Want to Get Married,Which one?
I Want to Get Married,Like Ozarks?
I Want to Get Married,[deleted]
I Want to Get Married,"It would be better if it ended here. Sometimes the villain wins, that’s just how life is"
I Want to Get Married,You have to finish season 4
I Want to Get Married,"You just list three genres that a very large and devoted population of the United States adore. 
If you went to pitch a show and said it’s a trashy soap mixed with reality mixed with true crime all the investors would hear is a “cha-Ching”."
I Want to Get Married,"I feel like season 4 was very self aware. 
It did the about face at the end that joe was the killer regardless of him being unaware. 

It really was a way to show viewers he is just a murderer. 
There’s no absolution for that."
I Want to Get Married,worse than S2?  Hoo-boy..

I don't see any entertainment value in someone reciting details of sexual crimes, particularly those where children are the victim.  I like a good mystery.  I enjoy most procedural dramas but SVU has a seedy sort of voyeurism to it that I find disturbing.  I just won't watch it."

I'd rather watch shows that are about people working together to achieve some kind of common goal.  Conflict and mistakes are fine,  but I want to see people and situations generally get better. That's why I like Star Trek, The West Wing, Parks and Recreation, and so on."

Do You Like Brahms?,"*Parks and Recreation*.

Loved it my first time around, but watching it a second time made me realize how annoying and toxic so many of the characters are, with just a few exceptions. This isn't a *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia* kind of self-aware humor either; we're meant to see these characters as lovable and relatable in spite of their exaggerations. More than them, though, is the show's unwise portrayal of local government. It's sort of apt and mostly forgivable in the first season, but they just get more brazen and stupid with it as it goes on."

I watched the first season and all I could think by the end of it was, ""Am I supposed to root for this guy or hate him? And if I'm supposed to hate him, why does this show have four seasons all revolving around this guy?""

There's a reason *Dexter* works: it features a serial killer specifically targeting (for the most part) other serial killers who have gotten away with murder, and Dexter works to bring them to justice.

In *You*, we follow a creepy stalker who ends up killing innocent women. How am I supposed to feel compelled to watch that?"

Do You Like Brahms?,">>Okay, what do you call a happy ending?  Any show that features a raped and murdered child as a key plot point is not going to have a happy ending for me.

Wel for one there’s the fact they solve most cases and put those guys away more than in real life…. Another happy ending could also be the fact it helps educate parents on things to look out for for their children. 

>>""Tackle heavy topics.""  I did this for a living.  I worked on dozens of child murders and rapes and this is not entertaining for me.  

Ok. 

>>I don't find any entertainment value in it.

It just grosses me out.

That’s on you for not separating that. You’re acting like it’s showing the children being assaulted. It’s a network television show. They can’t even show that? I would say the amount of “grotesqueness” they show is directly countered by how much they educate the audience, which is a lot. This show has helped a lot of people put pieces together of what’s happened in their childhood, seek help, feel comfortable talking about their own experiences to someone they trust and knowing where to start. Which btw you’re wildly overstating how much of it involves children. Most are just run of the mill adult SA cases. 

>>And it makes no difference what Mariska Hargitay does in her spare time.  Good for her.  I wish her all the best.  That doesn't at all change my mind about this show.

Then you’re kind of ignoring that she does that BECAUSE of the show…. You’re trying to paint it as this bad thing and it’s not. You’re just ignoring that because you personally don’t like be subject matter, but I would argue seeing something like that in TV is important. It happens in real life. It’s important people see it and understand why and how it can happen."

>>It's not an hour long special on recognizing predatory behavior.  Most of the predators on that show are cartoonishly obvious.  

Yeah it’s not a college lecture but it’s not just gratuitous rape and abuse like you’re painting it out to be. 

>>Most predators in real life are coaching soccer at your local middle school.  

And no shit… That’s literally most of the ones on the show. The episodes are hardly about an unknown assaulter. It’s always someone the kid knows, 9/10. 

>>As much as you think it's weird that I refuse to watch it because I consider the subject matter distasteful, it's a little bit weird you're defending this like it's the Sesame Street for avoiding child predators.

I’m really not… I’m merry pointing out you’re speaking as if it’s a gratuitous rape fest when it has positive qualities that more than outweigh the difficult subject matter. Would it be on for 24 seasons if it wasn’t…? If it was as distasteful as you’re saying it would’ve been cut a LONG time ago.

Do You Like Brahms?,"I remember a Neil Patrick Harris interview from years ago where he was asked about his old “Doogie Howser” show. The interviewer was kind of goading him into trash talking the show for being lame and a little ridiculous. Harris wasn’t having any of it, because there were a lot of people working on that show that worked hard on costuming, editing, lighting, etc. and did a very good job. He didn’t think it was fair to shit on all the work they did just because the show didn’t age well. I have a lot of respect for that sort of attitude."
Do You Like Brahms?,"The Delta Flyers, a Star Trek: Voyager podcast, is a great example of this.  The two hosts are Garrett Wang (Harry Kim) and Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris) and they review and critique each episode.  Wang is the more forgiving of the two, but they'll definitely point out or criticize things (including their own performances at times) that don't work for them in the episode.  McNeill has had a prolific post acting career as a TV director and producer, so his production insights are great as well.

While they seem to have a good grasp on canon from their own show, they definitely have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Trek lore from the other shows/movies."
Do You Like Brahms?,"My take is i want them honest to an extent is how I'll say it. If you're proud of the show generally and want to look back and critique both the good and the bad, I love to hear it. Will Friedle said of boy meets world that for them it's like growing up and finding out your parents are full people with positives and negatives, you don't love them any less its just a different relationship. And I like that, it really fits i think.

But if you hated your time on a show, thought it was stupid, hated the writing, hated your character, and you're going to review everything like it's the worst thing ever, keep it mostly to yourself. If something traumatic happened, of course they can talk about it, I dont wanna say they aren't allowed to tell their story. But if the extent is you thought the dumb show you were on is dumb, keep it to yourself and let fans enjoy the dumbness"
Do You Like Brahms?,"It's always a bit jarring when you're reminded that most actors don't care about their characters and/or the show as much as the more ardent fans do. Like, when fans pick up on a pattern or a subtlety and then you hear the actor talk about not realizing that at all. Or like when some of the Marvel actors did an interview and couldn't answer some of the more basic questions about the lore, and it made me realize that I was spending way too much time/energy trying to understand every little thing."
Do You Like Brahms?,"Oh absolutely. I want to know it all. I think the only podcasts I’ve listened in the past 12 months is from the people who work/have worked on tv shows. 

Which is weird, a few years ago I would not have listened to stuff like that and would rather listen to content that teaches stuff. Now I’m all for it.

Do You Like Brahms?,"It’s childish I know, but I get a little bummed out when actors on “hang out” shows say they don’t care about the show or even don’t like it. A good example is Jason Segal (and Josh Radnor come to think of it) on How I met your mother, both of whom seem a little embarrassed by the show. 

A counter example is Seinfeld— the main cast on that show all seem to be genuinely proud of what they made and think back on it fondly."

I watched a podcast were he talked about how brutal filming for Reacher was, he explained how they underestimated how long filming would take so everything was rushed and the fight scenes were choreographed in between takes then filmed after. How he was so exhausted and injured from the 16+ hours days 7 days a week that he was taking so much ibuprofen that his testosterone tanked which made him even more exhausted. 

On a different podcast a few years ago he also talked about how badly he got screwed with contracts for the Ninja Turtles movies which resulted in terrible filming conditions for the turtles."
Do You Like Brahms?,It's a mistake for an actor to do this because any future producers will naturally wonder if their show will be criticized.  Even the cheesiest show has its fans so why ruin their pleasure?
Do You Like Brahms?,"They're actors. Even better actors if we the viewers think they absolutely loved their show/character and it turns out they didn't. I'm sure they're are plenty who hated, loved, were ok with when it came to their shows/roles.  The more they're in, that's what is going to happen. To me it is far worse, when you really like an actor, & that actor is a complete a-hole in real life :) Honestly that is why you should never make someone you really don't know, into some kind of giant/hero. They are people like you & me, with a job to do."
Do You Like Brahms?,Does Wang mention how he was a shit actor and basically was saved because he was named sexy in TV Guide or whatever?
Do You Like Brahms?,"Going along the Voyager train: Robert Beltran. I don't know if he did their podcast, but he was absolutely Savage when it came to how he was used in Voyager.

I'm guessing they offered him decent money for a half an afternoon to record his lines in Prodigy.

They'll probably have to offer him more if Season 2 continues what they set up for him."
Ginny & Georgia,I think people forget how much laugh track is in that 70s show. I've seen a lot of comments around that That 90s show uses it excessively. I rewatched that 70s show not too long ago and found it comparable in terms of how much laugh track there is in both shows.
Ginny & Georgia,"My wife and i are both enjoying that 90s show. 

Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

I guess the producers learned to use generic music to not have the same music problems that 70s show and Wkrp had. Its fun going oh this kinda sounds like Primus."
Ginny & Georgia,"Look, all I'm saying is if Leia turned 15 in the summer of 1995, then she was conceived while Eric was still in Africa."
Ginny & Georgia,"My only real gripe with That 90s show is the lighting. Everything seems way too bright and the shadows are distracting. I don’t remember that being a problem in the original. 

Other than that it’s nice to see the gang back, hopefully the younger actors get into more of a groove if they get another season."
Ginny & Georgia,"The 90's show was just dumb fun. It was just enough 'memberberries' mixed with something fresh. It isn't changing cinema history, but its enjoyable if you liked the 70's show."
Ginny & Georgia,"I just finished that 90’s show today. I liked it! If you’re a fan of that 70’s show it’s definitely worth watching. Kitty and Red are great, good cameos, just have to get past the so-so script"
Ginny & Georgia,"Context from the article.

> That ’90s Show made its entrance onto the Netflix Top 10 for the week of January 16 to January 22, **after only three days on the service.**"
Ginny & Georgia,"I didn’t watch That 70s Show but I really liked That 90s Show. I’m not usually a fan of these multi cam sit coms but as someone who grew up in the 90s it’s extremely nostalgic. Not just the references (which were smart in the appropriate for the time but modern audiences will still get them kind of way) but in the way it’s shot, edited, the way the sets look etc. 

I laughed a lot too- I think Sherri was my favourite. The kids took a couple of episodes to click but I wanted to see more of them by the end. If you’re “of a certain age” like me and are in the mood for something fun and lighthearted I’d recommend it even if you haven’t seen the original (from the audience reactions it’s obvious who is a returning character - felt a bit bad for Leia who came in to complete silence haha)

Edit- Looks like James Iha from Smashing Pumpkins wrote the music too!"
Ginny & Georgia,"Pretty enjoyable binge, liked it way more than I anticipated. I was a fan of the original. I thought it was weird how they did the cameos from that cast, except for Chong, he was epic as always."
Ginny & Georgia,"I found that 90’s show okay… few things were off, but I would watch another season easily. I don’t think it’s 70’s show quality yet as even the 70’s show wasn’t that in the first season."
Ginny & Georgia,"As expected this is the first week since November 14th-20th that no show has hit the 100,000,000 hours mark. It signals the lowest week in engagement for Netflix in over two months! 

Ginny & Georgia’s third week topped in raw viewership hours (87,400,000) but only hit second top in the more comparable equivalent complete viewings metric where it did 9 million. Which was a -46% drop between weeks 2 and 3. Analysts cite an over 50% week 2 to 3 drop as a potential harbinger of cancellation. At this point Ginny & Georgia looks pretty good for a third season. 

One interesting thing to note about Ginny & Georgia was the fact that Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted it this week in an interview by stating it did “very well” domestically in the US but was not great internationally. 

That 90s Show was the surprise hit of the week. Its 41,080,000 hours worked out at 10.6 million to top the equivalent complete viewings chart for the week! It is the first new 30 minutes comedy in ages to top 10 million in a single week. It also ensured Netflix had the one show over 10 million with G&G and Wednesday dipping below it and Vikings Valhalla s2 not getting a second week boost. Last week I predicted zero Netflix shows going above 10 million and That 90s Show has proved me wrong. Fair play to That 90s Show. The overall numbers are not great by any stretch of the imagination but I’d argue they are pretty good by Netflix 30 minute comedy standards. 

Not a good second week for Vikings Valhalla s2. It did 8.7 million (+1%). It is trending for around 24-25 million over 4 weeks which is cancellation numbers. Lucky for Vikings Valhalla fans it was ordered for 3 seasons upfront. This just means the third season will definitely be the final season. 

Wednesday only dropped -21% to garner a fantastic 9th week haul of 6.8 million. It is the gift that keeps on giving for Netflix just like Squid Game! 

Kaleidoscope (between 28.4-30.4 million), The Glory (25.9 million), and Alpha Males (between 8-10.1 million) finished their 4 week runs on Netflix. Very solid for The Glory. Disappointing but not a total flop for Kaleidoscope and OK for Alpha Males. Treason also finished its 4 week run be we cannot give an accurate estimate as it missed the chart in 2/4 weeks. It did deliver 21.5 million in the two weeks it did chart though so it probably performed similarly to Kaleidoscope. 

It was another quiet week for the other new shows. Woman At War (3.6 million), Fauda s4 (1.4 million), and Shahmaran (2.5 million) all charted with low numbers while shows with lower runtimes Represent (less than 3.5 million) and Shantytown (less than 3 million) missed the charts. Bling Empire New York (less than 2.2 million) just flopped and missed the charts. 

The big show next week is Lockwood and Co but I have to admit I’m not expecting it to do above 8 million. With That 90s Show also due to fade in the second week as shows with short runtimes tend to do I’m again calling a week where Netflix will not have a show hit double figures in equivalent complete viewings!"
Ginny & Georgia,Ginny & Georgia is definitely getting another season.
Ginny & Georgia,These kids look too young to smoke weed
Ginny & Georgia,I really enjoyed that 90s show. I’m hoping for a second season.
Ginny & Georgia,I've been really enjoying That 90s Show. It's not perfect but neither was 70s

Ginny & Georgia,"I’m two episodes in, it’s pretty good for what it is but I cannot stand the Asian kid for the life of me."
Ginny & Georgia,I think it’s fun.
Ginny & Georgia,It’s far from perfect but I’m definitely loving that 90s show(as a die hard that 70s show fan)
Ginny & Georgia,"I wasn’t expecting to even like it and I LOVED it, totally what I wanted!"
Ginny & Georgia,"I was surprised by how decent ""That 90's Show"" turned out to be. 

I thought everything involving the original cast was gold! I didn't like the new kids at first, but they grew on me by the end."

Ginny & Georgia,"I watched the pilot, went to that 70s show for a few episodes which helped me get in the right mood, came back to watch the rest of that 90s show and enjoyed it"
Ginny & Georgia,All I know is that I laughed at the show and absolutely loved it!
Ginny & Georgia,"Only 5th, time to brace for that cancellation."
Ginny & Georgia,Only 41m hours watched? Well looks like Netflix is gonna cancel it next!
Ginny & Georgia,"Good, maybe that means they'll get a bigger budget for set design and costuming for future seasons."
Ginny & Georgia,"It really stinks that Danny masterson is a piece of shit because I could totally see Hyde owning and running the Hub and being integrated in the show there

And if Lisa Robin Kelly stayed away from drugs, and dying, i feel like she would be the Sherri character"
Ginny & Georgia,"I hope they can find a way to bring the older characters back more honestly. Their small moments were the best parts. The kids were fine but I think they're too young collectively. They're all 15-18 whereas the original crew was like 15-22 lol. 

Maybe they'll be better when they've gotten more experienced but as it is they feel a little awkward. Half of them were on Nickelodeon kids shows and you can tell by the way their timing is."
Ginny & Georgia,"The kids just don't have ""it"" like the first group. The original cast just seemed so natural like they weren't even acting. The new group's acting got a little bit better towards the end, but most of the time they just weren't very good. I am also still confused why they had to have two ""dumb"" guys that are really similar. Whyyyy? Really wish they had just created some new personalities instead of just reworking the old ones."
Ginny & Georgia,"This show is worth the watch if you were a fan of That 70's Show... Red and Kitty are 100% the draw here.  The new cast of kids was lackluster.  Representation was the goal, not the acting.  I could have used 4-6 more episodes to try to find the bond with the new cast.  The guest appearances were all pretty good.  Also, it has been said before, but the laugh track may have been slightly overused."
Ginny & Georgia,I went in thinking is was going to be another awful sequel/reboot series. But I really enjoyed it a lot. I really would want to watch another season of this. Plus Red And Kitty were fantastic!
Ginny & Georgia,I thought “That 90s Show” was going to end up another annoying teen drama that makes them learn all the lessons and become better people but it truly does mimic the feeling of it’s predecessor and was truly funny.  I was going to skip but my husband put it on and I thought it was great.
Ginny & Georgia,">debuts at No. 5 on Netflix

Well, it had a good run. Hopefully they get a season 2 to wrap up the storylines nicely."
Ginny & Georgia,Is The 90s Show any good?  I watched like the first few minutes but the constant shrieking of the studio audience every time a member of the old show walked onto screen really grated me.
Ginny & Georgia,Gina and georgia is overrated imo
Ginny & Georgia,That 70s show Cameos were better than the actual show
Ginny & Georgia,"I couldn't stand Ozzie, the over-the-top melodramatic, deadpan, gay character. I just don't think he had a reason to exist in the show, he didn't do much and his character could be incorporated into one of the _other_ characters to give them more depth.

I just think it would have a better impact on/in the show (as well as the LGBT+ community) if the lead actress (Leia) was gay or bi. Plus I thought there was instant ""clickability"" with Gwen as opposed to Jay.

But at face value it was a good enough time. More of a time-killer show but this was only the first season."
Ginny & Georgia,Found it cringy and horribly acted.
Ginny & Georgia,I tried that 90s show but I can't get past the first episode. It's so awful.
Ginny & Georgia,That 90s Show isn't Velma levels of bad but it's not particularly memorable in any way other than the cameos from the original cast. The love triangle thing they try to pull at the very last minute was VERY weak. The new cast doesn't have the same level of chemistry. They all just come across very cringy.
Ginny & Georgia,"That 90s show wasn't good. I wasn't a fan of the original either. The kids acting did not win me over. 

Also, I'm just weird and like to pick things apart. My example is the lazy prop design. When they get the tap for the Keg they are in a store with Doritos that have today's design... Not the 90s design othat Doritos was using back then. At the video store they had the new Sour Patch kids logo with the candy kids when it should of been the older design of the blonde kid. Also Jurassic Park: The Lost World was sitting on the shelf. That movie came out in 97... this was set in the summer of 95. I mean there were a lot more prop errors, but those were a few I remember. If you are going to make a ""period"" piece, you should at least go all out on the props and make them resemble the time period that the show is set in."
Ginny & Georgia,Loved That 70s Show. Could hardly watch That 90s Show. Felt like I was watching Full House with some weed jokes.
Ginny & Georgia,Couldn’t even make it through 10 minutes. The writing is awful
Ginny & Georgia,"This show sucked until I got high, then it was okay. 

It’s missing something, maybe it’s legs, maybe the fact that the 90s is somewhat hard to spot in todays 90s revival that’s been in vogue for a bit."
Ginny & Georgia,Oy That 90's Show was horrible. Kitty and Red are okay but the original vibe is gone. The original actors who ran in seemed super forced. It won't last as a show.
Ginny & Georgia,How many episodes are people watching? That's what I want to know. Slogging through all of them seems painful.
Ginny & Georgia,Couldn’t finish the first episode
Ginny & Georgia,Netflix Top 10 is a useless list.
Ginny & Georgia,I could not get through the first episode of Ginny and Georgia. Does it get better? I wonder if I should give it another try
Ginny & Georgia,"None of this matters, as Netflix cancels super popular shows constantly."
Ginny & Georgia,The gay Asian kid steals the show
Ginny & Georgia,"Honest question, why is Hollywood always promoting gay Asian boys? It's disproportional to IRL stats."
Ginny & Georgia,Uh... So Ginny & Georgia is one of Netflix's 5 biggest shows?
Ginny & Georgia,Another show with the gey agenda shoehorned in
Ginny & Georgia,how do people watch shit like ginny and georgia
Ginny & Georgia,Unwatchable. Utter garbage.
Ginny & Georgia,"First time I've heard about Ginny & Georgia, but from seeing what it is, ""Ginny Miller, an angsty fifteen-year-old"" yeah I don't think it would be recommended for me either, nor would I care if it was. 

I'd imagine most of the top shows I would not know tbh. There's so many of them crappy (i mean actually crappy, not just by my estimation) romantic bullshit shows/movies that do insane numbers. But then again, I like some shitty action bullshit too. So to each their own."
Ginny & Georgia,"That 90s Show is going pretty bad. The kids characters are completely vanilla and the actors can’t act for shit.
They also forgot the jokes.

The fact Ginny is beating it and remains at no1 after a month illustrates just who is watching Netflix most of the time these days - middle aged housewives"
Ginny & Georgia,"Welp,  must be time netflix cancelled it, if it's doing so well......."
Ginny & Georgia,I left it on and watched like 20% while it played the entire season
Ginny & Georgia,I got halfway through the 2nd episode before I realized how awful the show was
Ginny & Georgia,It sucks and it's nothing like the 90s were.
Ginny & Georgia,"I remember liking That 70s show, but I couldn’t even make it half way through the first episode of That 90s show…"
Ginny & Georgia,"Not that bad of a show. I never wanted to turn it off at any point, but it didn't scream anything special. I would expect for it to do well they'd want to do 6 month cycles sort of idea just to have enough 30-minute episodes to go with the ages of the actors.

Seasons for these are usually much longer, and it feels super short otherwise. If it was an hour long episode series, then I would see the justification of just 10."
Ginny & Georgia,"I watched it, mostly out of nostalgia and wasn't impressed"
Ginny & Georgia,I just feel like they really missed the mark and kinda Disney-fied it? Shit was grunge and depressing and we liked it that way and talked about dying a lot and womens empowerment especially through powerful women singers and too much black eyeliner that always looked like you slept in it and there was definitely weed and drinking.
Ginny & Georgia,So it will be canceled in 3 seasons instead of 2
Ginny & Georgia,"That 90's show is not good, sorry. I also did not like that 80's show either. Stop messing with the original. Next they will do a That 2000's Show and it will also not be good either."
Ginny & Georgia,"Red and Kitty are a delight, but the rest is atrocious."
Ginny & Georgia,"That 90s show was way better than I expected. I was not expecting much, but it got me to watch the entire season. I did enjoy it, and I am sure the characters will grow on me if it continues. My only gripe was age of the teenagers and not expanding personalities a little more. Jay and Nate are too similar. The girls are fine sometimes a little much, Ozzie needs time to expand a bit. He’s just kind of the deadpan silence breaker right now. Would like to see him expand a bit. Show wasn’t amazing but I can see myself sticking around for more."
Ginny & Georgia,"That '90s Show was really good; I just wish it was 22 episodes long rather than 10. It feels over before it's even began.

Hopefully it ends Netflix's sitcom dry spell; if you can call it a dry spell as remained unbroken since their inception. Even Kimmy Schmidt wasn't originally meant for Netflix."
Ginny & Georgia,If there was an award for the most unfunny group of teenagers they would be taking the prize. Not even Kitty and Red could save this disaster
Ginny & Georgia,"I haven’t seen it but I’ve heard there’s no reference to Hyde, who was an integral part of “That 70’s Show” due to baseless accusations being lobbed at him."
Ginny & Georgia,ginny and georgia debuts at number 1 again and still people do not think netflix is a woman tv station lol
Ginny & Georgia,Are Netflix releasing streaming numbers now or is it just to showcase how successful their originals are?. I remember some creators complaining they wouldn't let them know how their shows were doing.
Ginny & Georgia,Is Ginny & Georgina that good of a show?
Ginny & Georgia,proving people will watch anything if marketed right
Ginny & Georgia,That show is giving me strong “Girl Meets World” vibes.
Ginny & Georgia,I liked it for what it was. But… can we just talk about Ozzie wearing the (2004 version) Phantom of the Opera shirt?
Ginny & Georgia,That 90s is horrible. Show sucks.
Ginny & Georgia,It's almost as if both shows were taped in front of a live audience...
Ginny & Georgia,"I think a lotta people fail to realize that sitcoms are corny by nature. The first season of any sitcom can be rough. When compared to the other recent Netflix sitcoms, that 90s show has been great. I couldn’t make 5 min in to that god awful blockbuster one"
Ginny & Georgia,It's a multi-camera sitcom. How do people expect anything else?
Ginny & Georgia,"I loved That 70s Show and the 90s version is almost a pitch-perfect continuation. 

I'm really enjoying it, but I think that comes from my love of the original. My wife who never watched it doesn't get it."
Ginny & Georgia,"I feel like people look back on That 70s Show with rose-tinted glasses. That 70s Show didn't start out amazing either. 

So far I feel like the writing/jokes of that 90s show is on par with it's predecessor. It feels really similar to me. I think the style of humor just feels dated these days, but I enjoyed it for what it is. Not as good as That 70s Show, but good enough to be the successor (and to give the benefit of the doubt that it could improve) imo."
Ginny & Georgia,"Yeah, I get the sense from some of the critical comments, that a lot of people just haven’t watched a multi-camera sitcom in like a decade."
Ginny & Georgia,"Not a track, both shows were filmed in front of a live audience"
Ginny & Georgia,I think the issue is the cast in the 70s show actually seemed to be laughing at stuff. In this the cast is over the top to try and make jokes but it keeps falling flat.
Ginny & Georgia,"No one forgot, but That 70's Show came out 25 years ago. Laugh tracks were everywhere back then, so you just accepted it as a fact of life. However, in 2023, there's really no excuse to use a laugh track."
Ginny & Georgia,I watched a whole 30 seconds of That '90s Show before I remembered I hated everything with a laugh track.
Ginny & Georgia,"While I agree, I just feel like it was less forced in that 70s show. I couldn’t get through one episode of 90s. You sorta cringed and every showing of the original cast was like coming up for air"
Ginny & Georgia,"Hijacking the top comment to ask: How did they handle Hyde? Was he even mentioned? It'll be forever before I get around to this, someone please just spoil it for me."
Ginny & Georgia,I was surprised to hear a Pantera song during a gym scene.
Ginny & Georgia,"I think it’s a decent first season. They’ve got a LOT of room for improvement, but it’s not the total dumpster fire that some comments want it to be"
Ginny & Georgia,"Yeah, just finished it. It was a show. I giggled from time to time. Which as it turns out was everything i needed from it."
Ginny & Georgia,">Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

Perfect synopsis. Watched all 10 episodes on a binge and it didn't change my life or anything, but it was a nice, lil show to watch while I had nothing to do. Nothing wrong with that in my book."
Ginny & Georgia,"I mean there’s a lot of popular songs in the show, like no rain, groove is in the heart, I wish"
Ginny & Georgia,">Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

Agreed. And in this era of so much ""prestige"" television... I'm pretty happy that it's just a fun nice show. Sometimes that's all I really want."
Ginny & Georgia,I’m watching it in picture to picture on my phone and it’s pretty enjoyable in the background. Love seeing all the old characters pop up too.
Tribes of Europa,Wierd BDSM cult tries to steal the cube of destiny from a bunch of kids ...Ulrich helps a bit
Tribes of Europa,"Looks like if ""Divergent"" had a kid with ""Children of Men"" and the baby was raised by a kinky German couple."
Tribes of Europa,Kinda gives me The 100 vibes.
Tribes of Europa,"Yo, Urlich!"
Tribes of Europa,I'm a sucker for anything that is post-apocalyptical
Tribes of Europa,Oh Yeah
Tribes of Europa,If youre interested in the show come on over to r/TribesofEuropa
Tribes of Europa,Looks fun but also generic as all hell.
Tribes of Europa,Looks p cool
Tribes of Europa,I’ll watch because of Ulrich
Tribes of Europa,So it looks a lot like See just with Germans instead of blind people...
Tribes of Europa,"I can never get over how all these post apocalyptic people get cars, fuel, weapons, ammunition, computers (in one of the scenes) and even fucking ELECTRICITY in a world without production and economy?

A little bit of heat and half of California is in blackouts and this is today."
Tribes of Europa,_Dark 100_
Tribes of Europa,"looks like it had a pretty sizable budget which is good. A lot of solid European dramas tend to have poor production values which can hurt the enjoyment of the shows,"
Tribes of Europa,The story seems generic but the cinematography looks good. Reminds me of Lubezki's work.
Tribes of Europa,Looks like a CW show
Tribes of Europa,For a split second i thought this was show based off of the game destiny or in that lure
Tribes of Europa,"Well... It was kinda awesome, exited for a second season, and the bdsm cult was kinda hot, got a small crush on ""sophia""...
But i am quite curious of how the world ended and whats beyond europe, allso.... Where the fuck do They get fuel for that old ass wv bus, They use a shitload of it and seems there is a shortage of it, since the most powerful bdsm cult are mostly riding horses, or maybe thats Just part of the cults bdsm vibe 🤔"
Tribes of Europa,"Watched it last night, incredibly shit. The fight scene at their base was so cringe."
Tribes of Europa,"Seeing a German show as a german is always cringeworthy.

Especially when it tries to copy the US style. And when it copies shamelessly some iconic scenes."
Tribes of Europa,That looks fun! Though The 100 should get some royalties off that.
Tribes of Europa,"Hope they don't go too off the rails on the fall.  The continents shouldn't be isolated.  There are plenty of old sailing/steam ships and steam locomotives left to keep the world in communication.  

It will be interesting to see if there are immigrant tribes among the larger native European tribes as well.  Oh and will the U.S. forces in Europe be allowed to be tribes as well.  Maybe the prince of Baden has a royal guard made up of the U.S. 10th Special Forces Group."
Tribes of Europa,"Why Europa if it's Europe, not Europa?"
Tribes of Europa,They had me at BDSM cult tbh.
Tribes of Europa,this is kinda what I wish would have happened in the 100 that like the Tribes of Europe crossed the ocean for war.
Tribes of Europa,this basically sums up about 95% of modern day sci-fi/fantasy tv shows
Tribes of Europa,I have a little bit of hope from this as it's from the same producers as Dark and that was anything but generic. But from the trailer I'm not 100% certain.
Tribes of Europa,"So, what do yall think? I just finished watching it, and sure it was a bit generic as most shows are nowadays. But I still enjoyed it quite a bit, will probably tune in for future seasons."
Tribes of Europa,Yall just love comparing post apocalypse stories that barely have anything in common. Have you actually even seen See?
Tribes of Europa,"Its only set 50 years in the future, some of that stuff would still be functional if stored out of the weather. Much further out and yea, not realistic. The standing wooden houses 200 years later in the Fallout universe always make me laugh.

Fuels can be made, older cars last if stored inside, generators can be made out of any electric motor and last basically forever, batteries would be a huge problem.

I reckon it depends on how quickly the population dropped off, if it was a quick crash then a lot scavenged goods could believably be stashed away. As long as it is realistically scarce and not everywhere.

I'd definately agree on ammunition in Europe, that'd probably be gone in a couple of years, I cant begin to guess how much ammo is stashed away in America or how long that would last."
Tribes of Europa,Yeah the all certain age good looking cast
Tribes of Europa,"Babylon Berlin is great, at least. 

And Derrick is... Derrick."
Tribes of Europa,"Dark is one of the best shows I've ever seen, so you guys got that going for you."
Tribes of Europa,"You literally stole this comment, word for word, from a YouTube comment."
Tribes of Europa,where do you think 'Europe' comes from? They're both the same.
Tribes of Europa,Seriously??
Tribes of Europa,"""Europa"" is the German name for Europe."
Tribes of Europa,Uh because it takes place on the moon europa.
Tribes of Europa,The writers are the key and it's not those from Dark
Tribes of Europa,"Happy cake day!.  

&#x200B;

Yes I saw See.  I don't get how you think these two are that different?  Sure this one seems to have more tech and closer to the apocalypse, but they are pretty damn close in terms of following one family, going against a monarchy of tribes controlling specific territory, and nature taking back civilization. I guess filming in Germany or Sweden is a bit different than filming in BC."
Tribes of Europa,"Some of my German friends say that the speaking in Dark was a bit stiff. As an English speaker, I couldn't tell... ignorance is bliss!"
Tribes of Europa,"Ever thought that I may be the author of both comments?

Same profile pic?!"
Tribes of Europa,Yeah....?
Tribes of Europa,What do they call the moon Europa?
Tribes of Europa,Europa has trees? I thought it had Ice and sub surface oceans
Tribes of Europa,The wiki says Europe. It also looks 100% more like Europe than Europa.
Tribes of Europa,"Did you get permission from yourself, you may have to go to court against yourself.

Get yourself a good lawyer."
Tribes of Europa,"Europa = Europe, it's just Europe in german, which this show is"
Tribes of Europa,The moon is also called Europa.
Tribes of Europa,Both are named Europa after [her](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(consort_of_Zeus).
Tribes of Europa,Europa is german for Europe. Pronounced Oi-raw-pa.
Tribes of Europa,"Oh, uh. This sounds like a prime vs alt reality version scenerio... 🤔"
Tribes of Europa,I heard someone copied my comment without asking?
Tribes of Europa,I thought the english title would have used the english word for Europe.
Tribes of Europa,"Assuming you have liability insurance for such matters, you should sue yourself for a nice payday."
Tribes of Europa,I liked the show but i think Kiano's story with Varvara was far superior than the others two storylines.
Tribes of Europa,"It was awesome seeing Oliver Masucci, who played Ulrich in *Dark*, in this. His character was so different and so much fun, it was a surprise for sure. He really is an amazing actor. I really enjoyed this new series and agree it does definitely throw off some *See* (Apple) and *The 100* vibes. Looking forward to see where they go with it in the next season, I’ve read somewhere the writers have plans for up to 8. I’ve been watching a lot more foreign content in the last year, like many others due to less content being produced right now, and I’ve been quite impressed with what Netflix has done in Europe. A silver lining to the pandemic has been getting more acquainted with their foreign shows. Definitely watch this in it’s original language with subs if you don’t want to suffer through the dubbing and it will give you a much better emotional context for the dialogue. It’s filmed in a mixture of English and German anyways, so if you watch the dubbing you won’t even hear the original actors’s English parts. They switch languages a lot and part of the story is seeing them struggle to communicate at times as they travel and switch languages. You miss that in the dubbing."
Tribes of Europa,Come to r/tribesofeuropa
Tribes of Europa,I’m on the third episode. Really interesting so far.
Tribes of Europa,"In a time where we have a ton of YA fantasy/Sci-Fi shows, it was decent. But it suffers a bit that Germans are still on the lower end of funding regarding TV shows. I felt that this series should have a longer run in the season, not just six episodes."
Tribes of Europa,"I loved it. This show created such an interesting world. This has potential for more seasons, lotta development and even spinoffs. Sorry. Getting kinda addicted with everything turning to be a franchise with series, movies spinoffs and everything. And i feel this has the potential"
Tribes of Europa,"I enjoyed it, though I think it had a lot in common with early seasons of *The 100*."
Tribes of Europa,There's little hype around it because it's a barely average show🤷🏽‍♂️
Tribes of Europa,I think it needed a few more episodes
Tribes of Europa,I love scifi but I’ve sworn off a lot of Netflix shows in general if they seem like they might be on the bubble. Maybe one day if Netflix keeps it around long enough to have a proper ending.
Tribes of Europa,I’ve added it to the list...so many European Netflix shows I have to get through
Tribes of Europa,I have watched it over the last few weeks - give it 7/10 and look forward to season 2.
Tribes of Europa,It's half a show and kind of a not as good The 100. I still liked it but I didn't think it was groundbreaking.
Tribes of Europa,"That is the dubbed The 100 show, right?"
Tribes of Europa,"Yeah agree, his was the most interesting, but I was surprised to find myself actually invested in all three siblings."
Tribes of Europa,"Yeah agreed, definitely it needed another half of season to finish the story but I’m very happy they paced it right and did half a season rather than trying to cram it all into one season."
Tribes of Europa,Have u watched the show See from Apple with Jason Momoa? Is very good and also reminded of The Grounders from The 100.
Tribes of Europa,That awful? Jeez.
Tribes of Europa,"I don’t get that attitude, I watch a ton of netflixes original programming and for me this was way above average compared to what they usuly put out."
Tribes of Europa,Yeah this ones bad about it too. Season 1 ends at the single most interesting point in the show. I’ll be extremely annoyed if there’s no second season.
Tribes of Europa,"This , holla when you get more seasons under the belt or cancelled. Not before."
Tribes of Europa,"I’d recommend bumping it up, it’s one of the better shows I’ve seen on Netflix overall."
Tribes of Europa,"No, I don't have the Apple service, so I haven't seen that."
Tribes of Europa,Above-average Netflix fare still leaves a lot to be desired
Tribes of Europa,Will do
Tribes of Europa,"You can get a free trial and check it out, that's how I watched it"
Tribes of Europa,"this comment chain makes me having a weird feeling...like ""oh sweet summer child"""
Tribes of Europa,?
Tribes of Europa,"Too many things from The 100 in this trailer, although better looking."
Tribes of Europa,"'We dont know what it is BUT ITS A THREAT TO ALL MANKIND!'

Looks and sounds exactly like some generic 5/10 sci fi netflix show."
Tribes of Europa,"German sci fi. It's like sci fi, but in German."
Tribes of Europa,"After seeing Dark I would give every German Netflix show the benefit of the doubt, loved that show!"
Tribes of Europa,Looks like The 100.
Tribes of Europa,"Visually, it looks neat.  Conceptually it looks like someone took The 100, mixed in The Expanse, added a scifi MacGuffin cube, katanas, and a lot of mascara.  It's a little try hard?  I don't know.  I might give it a peak, but I'm not expecting much depth."
Tribes of Europa,The visuals here look amazing but the writing seems piss poor.
Tribes of Europa,"Saw bootleg Lament Configuration in image...got excited (spin-off?  reboot?).  

Watched trailer. 

Disappointed :("
Tribes of Europa,There's a sub for this r/tribesofeuropa
Tribes of Europa,So The 100 with sub titles.
Tribes of Europa,Why use the word *cube* and *tribe* when they speak german? Feels incredibly unnatural.
Tribes of Europa,This actually looks really good. I like the mix of futuristic and a kinda  medieval style.
Tribes of Europa,People sure do look pretty and not so grimey for it be some kind of post-apocalyptic world.
Tribes of Europa,Agreed. For a sec I actually thought it was already something related to the prequel series they're making
Tribes of Europa,Yes. It felt like European The 100 and then it turned into Euro Hunger Games towards the end.
Tribes of Europa,"I dunno, the CW is known for all theirs being the best looking."
Tribes of Europa,"To be fair, any evidence of advanced alien life should definitely be considered an existential threat until we have more information."
Moms Café,"I think she's supposed to be 30, damn, is that middle aged now?"
Moms Café,"It would never occur to me to compare Ginny & Georgia to Little Fires Everywhere. The tone is so different.

Ginny & Georgia has been most often compared to Gilmore Girls, which was on purpose. It's not like Gilmore Girls at all though, just a premise of a teen mom who has a close relationship with her teen daughter. 

I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone, but I thought it was quite good for a teen show. The storylines seemed pretty well thought out, at least the arcs in season 1. It sometimes goes in an unexpected direction. 

Even if the writing isn't noteworthy, it is noteworthy that it spent the most time on Netflix's top ten list number one watched spot. Audiences liked it.

Little Fires Everywhere I recall got a lot of mixed reviews, but I thought it was brilliant start to finish."
Moms Café,this is a really good review! the netflix trailer from it seemed mildly interesting but the screen caps i saw elsewhere from it made it seemed like the dialogue was super recycled. i think i made a good choice deciding to skip it lol
Moms Café,"I enjoyed it, mostly.  Some parts it started to get dry but it picked right back up.  I'd be down for season two.  It also reminded me of Magnolia show on Netflix too."

"Hello, Me!",Can you please stop dying? I'm traumatized every single time
"Hello, Me!","Hi Ben!

First, you're amazing in concert, I saw your first show in LA and loved it!

Second, I wanted to ask - we've seen Freddy fully embrace the Kazzle Dazzle name. I've seen The Darkling referred to as ""Darkle Sparkle."" I was hoping that you'd see this and the next time you and Freddy post things together, maybe you can refer to yourselves as Kazzle Dazzle and Darkle Sparkle just once?"

1. How would you describe The Darkling’s feelings regarding the women he’s impacted in the series ie Alina, Zoya, Genya, Baghra
2. Have you, at any point in your life, read fanfiction about a certain long haired, convicted murderer that turns into a dog at will and his friend group whilst they were at school?"

"Hello, Me!","Hey! Great to have you here! I have following questions:

The darkling looks much older in the show than in the books (even though he is hundreds of years old in the books too). Dont get me wrong, you are a great cast for him! In the books he is as old as Alina, how do you think changes that ""up-ageing"" their relationship? 

And: are the costumes comfortable? Sometimes the keftas look kinda stiff and I am wondering about the scar make up too!

Cant wait seeing you all on screen soon again!"
"Hello, Me!",Not a question but you're great in Cabinet of Curiosities on Netflix.
"Hello, Me!","Hi Ben!! Thank you for taking the time to answer fan questions on here. 

We know that you and Jessie watched Jane Eyre to prepare for the first season :) Did you do anything in particular with Jessie to prepare for Darklina scenes in the second season?"

Can you tell us a bit about your experience with narrating audiobooks? Do you have any vocal warm ups you follow and how do you prepare for a day of recording?

Did your parents ever recommended you to therapy looking at your immense sense of intrigue towards recently portraying a villain."
"Hello, Me!","bin bons???? 

but in all seriousness, your performance as the darkling is truly insane- you bring so much nuance to this character while still making it clear that his actions are just.. awful. i remember growing up watching you play prince caspain too, so i guess my question is, who are your favourite literary heroes and villains? (p.s. i LOVE that you're an anna karenina fan too!)"

"Hello, Me!","What was your favorite part about shooting for Season 2? Were there moments from the books that you were craving to do or new characters you were excited to meet? 

Also: you’ve played characters that come from books before; what makes Shadow and Bone stand out as another literary adaptation for you?"
"Hello, Me!","In season 1 there were hints of the Grisha being an oppressed minority and you spoke about it in some interviews, but I have not seen this mentioned so far in any season 2 interview…did season 2 ignore how the Grisha were persecuted for hundreds of years before the Darkling lived???"
"Hello, Me!","As a long-time Shadow and Bone fan its exciting to see the characters come to life on screen, especially the Darkling!

Is there any aspect of the book version of the Darkling that you've primarily kept in mind while acting as him? Thanks!"
"Hello, Me!","If the show is renewed for season 3, do you think that you would feel comfortable returning as the Darkling (if/when he's killed off, if/when they go the resurrection route) considering that they massacred the S1 development and backstory of the character in favour of making Aleksander the scapegoat for the systemic oppression of the Grisha in S2?

You added a lot of humanity to the character and elevated him from a one-dimensional villain to a fallible human just desperate to save his people from persecution. From the S2 trailer, it seems that they just want to erase all of that work. Whether you step down or not, thank you for all you've done to give the Darkling depth and growth.

PS If they cast for a young Darkling to do any Demon in the Wood flashbacks, might you recommend Louis Partridge? He's perfect for younger you, even if you are ageless and immortal.  


Much love,

a fellow English degree nerd"
"Hello, Me!","Hi Ben, I'm rewatching Season 1 just now and I have to say it's still one of the greatest show on Netflix and your performance is brilliant.

"Hello, Me!","Hello Ben! I have been a longtime fan of the series, and I love the nuance you bring to the Darkling! Book Darkling could feel like a cartoon villain sometimes, but you play him with so much care that the viewer sympathizes enough to hate themselves for rooting for him. 

Do you think the Darkling really cares for Alina as a person? If so, does he care about her because of her powers, or because she is the only one as endless as he is? Or is she just a pawn to him? 

Much thanks for reading, can't wait for season 2!"
"Hello, Me!","After shadow and bone, would you like to work with Jessie again? She's so talented, and you two work perfectly together."
"Hello, Me!","Hi, you are amazing villain in Shadow and Bone. 
The Darkling is my most favorite character on the show.I'm so excited to watch season2.

You've played roles of villains/bad guys many times.
Your acting is just amazing. And you seem like a very nice person. How do you separate your work and your private life? Has playing villains affected your private life?

I also wanna know funny behind the scenes stories about Shadow and Bone.


Lastly, watching Shadow and Bone helped me get through when I was in my lowest point of life. Thank you for your amazing work and your costar's amazing work. The show is so special for me."
"Hello, Me!","I had no idea who you were before I watched Shadow & Bone but I became a big fan of the show almost entirely because of your scenes. Also I'm jealous I'll never be able to pull off an all black outfit like you can.

My question for you is: if you could put any of the other movie or tv characters you played in the past in the Grishaverse (to be a hero or a villain, your choice) who would you choose and why?"

"Hello, Me!",What do you think about Jessie? 🙂
"Hello, Me!","Hey Ben! You always seem like such a fun, loving nice guy in social media and interviews but seem to have a preference for playing bad guys (and wonderfully, I must say, I've loved your roles in Westworld and Shadow & Bone, but have been a fan since Narnia). Can you share with us why? I'm guessing it's because it's fun to pretend to be someone else, but I wondered if there are other reasons.

Also, revealing the Darkling's real name was a significant thing in the Siege & Storm book and a very memorable line from Alina in Ruin & Rising, but in the show it's mentioned very early in the story. Why the change?"
"Hello, Me!","hello ben!!! i’ve been a fan since your narnia days, but your role as aleksander in s&b and the show in general has meant a lot to me—i was juggling an intense degree program and taking care of a family member pretty much alone when s1 came out, and it was an escape that brought me lots of joy and led me to some amazing friends. thank you for the passion and commitment you bring to your craft and all the roles you play! 

actual question time: who’s your favorite poet? are there any particular poems or lines of poetry that are (figuratively) forever engraved in your brain?"
"Hello, Me!","Hello!!! 🥰🥰🥰 I have seen you first in  ”Dorian Gray”at the cinema, though I was young, in my early twenties, and though I even deeply hated the book, you have done an amazing job, even then! But I loved you in “Easy Virtue”! And I adore your album!  In this series, though you are more good-looking than what I have pictured reading the books, you are still rocking it because I totally despise your character 😆 like in the books! And that means A LOT!👏👏👏 since I consider you a super sweet and handsome man!   


MY QUESTION:

Did you tried other characters in the show before be assigned to the General Kirigan? Or did you choose to do that role? Or were you being contacted only for that character?   


thank you 🙏 

I wish you well and have a lovely evening!

Nadiya Bakes,"The reason why I love and appreciate Bake Off, is because it's the opposite of American Reality TV. Don't get me wrong, I watch Survivor each week and I love shows like Beat Bobby Flay. 

But Bake Off is a nice change of pace because of its different style. It's lighthearted, calmly paced, and positive. The contestants don't fight each other, they help each other and cheer each other on. There is no screaming at people. There are no rivalries. It's just a lighthearted fun show that nothing else I watch is like."
Nadiya Bakes,"Haha is this spam? Are you a bot? Your exception proves the rule. Most people like Bake Off exactly *because* of the reasons you described - it's nothing like the shows you listed.

[This funny New Yorker satire article](https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/the-average-contestant-on-british-baking-shows-vs-the-average-contestant-on-american-cooking-shows) comparing GBBO and American baking competitions pretty much sums up the general vibe difference and why a lot of people (including a huge American audience) prefer Bake Off, although it pokes fun at both Bake Off and American cooking competitions. The article will not, however, lessen your impression of Bake Off being pretentious (despite the general classism in the UK, I actually think Bake Off is less pretentious than American cooking shows)"
Nadiya Bakes,"Have you been smokin something??? 

 I'm a pro baker, so I enjoy series like Bake Off-though the other versions more than British. Not a fan of American version, but that might be for you because you have the baking & the drama.....I also watch AR, because it's continuous, not a bunch of people sitting around, starving, & scheming. In other words, the key is to have variety in your tv life. Oh, & btw Challenge starts up again next week....."
Nadiya Bakes,"""I have to watch another baking show, I'll start baking myself goddamnit!!"""

Nadiya Bakes,"You should check out the kids Bake Off version on Netflix: Junior Baking Show. So many ""5 second rule!"" Shouts and they help each other, it's so cute. And they actually do pretty good job! 

Have you tried Baking Impossible? That was pretty good. A little more active and fun. 

Also, Bake Squad was pretty entertaining too.

And then, for something similar,  but not baking, try Making Fun. A group of professional builders get designs from kids and compete to build their creations and the kids choose the winner.

Edit to add:

Oh, also, random recommendations,  if you like travel, try out Worlds Most Amazing Vacation Rentals on Netflix. Three friends travel around and rent 3 diff places in a diff place each episode. Each place they rent is a diff style, fancy, budget, unique, and they vote on their fav at the end. 

And another is Instant Hotel on Netflix. Where people have created an airbnb and they enter a competition and take turns staying at each other's and then at the end vote to try and win the best airbnb."
Nadiya Bakes,Canadian and Australia both have versions of the Amazing Race.  Australian Survivor had Sandra and her daughter and Russel on a different season.

>It's just a lighthearted fun show that nothing else I watch is like.

It's not that it's a bad show or anything like that. I just find it... pretentious the more I watch it.

Worse, trying to mostly hide negativities isn't gonna prevent negativities anyways, like cyberbullying on poorly-skilled onscreen bakers. You can blame social media all you want, but I blame the show... and poorly-skilled bakers more than social media. Those bakers can give you nicer personalities and eat up camera time, but they don't know how hostile viewers can be, including casuals."
Nadiya Bakes,"What? A pro baker? Have you applied for Food Network's *Baking Championship*, *Sugar Rush*, or any other baking competition that allows or requires those with (official?) baking profession? I really hope one of the shows helps promote you and/or your bakery."
Nadiya Bakes,"*Baking Championship* shows from Food Network would do? Or *Nailed It* or *Sugar Rush*? If a show has numerous seasons, that mean the show is more likely good to watch... right?"
Nadiya Bakes,"I don't know. *Baking Impossible* and *Bake Squad* haven't had newer seasons AFAIK. I did watch some scenes of *Squad*.

I might consider *Junior Bake Off* or *Making Fun*, but I'm unsure whether *Making Fun* will have another season."
Nadiya Bakes,"No word on newer seasons of *World's Most Amazing Vacation Rentals* and *Instant Hotel*, unfortunately."
Nadiya Bakes,How do I legally watch those versions?
Nadiya Bakes,">It's not that it's a bad show or anything like that. I just find it... pretentious the more I watch it.

Pretentious is...not a word I would have ever used for this show. I'm honestly not sure how that would apply to this show. 

>Worse, trying to mostly hide negativities isn't gonna prevent negativities anyways, like cyberbullying on poorly-skilled onscreen bakers. You can blame social media all you want, but I blame the show... and poorly-skilled bakers more than social media. Those bakers can give you nicer personalities and eat up camera time, but they don't know how hostile viewers can be, including casuals.

I'm not sure how that is *hiding* negativities by not including what people on social media say? Why should any show care about what a toxic audience would think? Plus, all of them are amateur bakers, not professional bakers. And I don't watch Bake Off sitting on my couch eating cheetos saying ""fucking idiot, that's not how you make a Hot Water Crust Pastry!""."
Nadiya Bakes,"I did see that Instant Hotel season 3 was confirmed, but no release date. But haven't seen anything about Vacation Rentals yet. Its too bad, I liked both of them. They were good for easy watching after a long, frustrating work day, lol."
Nadiya Bakes,I set my VPN to Canada and watch at https://www.ctv.ca/ or I set it to Australia and https://10play.com.au/  I have seen them a few times on youtube or dailymotion.
Nadiya Bakes,">I'm not sure how that is *hiding* negativities by not including what people on social media say?

Sorry, I'll rephrase. Or rather ""hiding"" isn't the right word. Any moment onscreen can *provoke* sometimes negative reactions... and cyberbullying.

Or rather... the show is too ""sheltered"" for me?"
Nadiya Bakes,"Any moment on any show can provoke negative reactions and cyberbullying. Why is the show sheltered for staying away from negativity. You *want* this show to be more negative?

I think we've determined that this show just is not for you."

Buried by the Bernards,"**Asked if he’s watched the prequel series, the actor replied** -

Buried by the Bernards,"Hail Theoden, King!!"
Buried by the Bernards,"Listen man, I know New Line *claimed* the movies never made a profit to screw over anyone who negotiated for a percentage of the profits, but in reality the movies you starred in were **also** a money making venture."
Buried by the Bernards,What can men do against such reckless money grabbing?
Buried by the Bernards,"I know the same could be said about the trilogy but that argument forgets that adapting the trilogy was a monumental gamble and was coupled with an effort not seen in most movies. PJ even said it himself before the hobbit came out that the effort he put into the trilogy was a project of a lifetime and he will never put that much effort again because it was so intensive, hence the ammount of CGI we got in the hobbit. 

That being said Hill also said the hobbit was a cash grab in the article 

>Asked if he believes the franchise would have been better off ending after the original trilogy, he said:""Completely, yes. I think they were pushing it when they made The Hobbit. The Hobbit’s a tiny book. 

>“They did it well – they did it really, really well. They expanded it [but] I think you can only stretch a piece of elastic so far. I think they managed it in The Hobbit because there were some really good things in The Hobbit without a doubt.” 

ROP rides off the success of the trilogy without doing much to create its own impact, just like the hobbit did. It was all character reveals (who is sauron?, who is the stranger?, the low effort mordor reveal) and cheesy lines/recycled lines from the trilogy and books (I am good!, follow your nose.). 

The risks taken in the trilogy were not taken in ROP, despite how much money went into it. The show played it safe for the sake of ensuring a profit and a mediocre show is what we got, not a masterpiece like the trilogy was hailed to be, despite formerly being considered an impossible task. 

By that standard the trilogy is most certianly not a cash grab, it was a gamble that exceeded all expectations."

Buried by the Bernards,"Reddit really loves debating a single quote taken out of context to defend popular media. I get it, you think you're smart for pointing out to him that all films are money-making ventures."
Buried by the Bernards,"I think context is a problem here. Bernard Hill isn't denying that LOTR was also a money making venture. He's saying that the LOTR films attempted to do justice to the source material while making a bunch of money.

Rings of Power on the other hand is intended to make a lot of money while disregarding the source material.

He's mad about the source material not being respected."
Buried by the Bernards,"I'm so annoyed they decided to add Gandalf to a 2nd age story.  

It's like the writers were afraid to do a LOTR story without Gandalf going on an adventure with Hobbits."
Buried by the Bernards,"For everyone saying all movies and series are supposed to make money. Yeah, obviously. *But* imo there is a difference if that's the primary reason for something being made. 

If a director/producer is passionate about telling a story, whether it's original or an adaption of something they love, but also aware they have to make it profitable for it to get made at all that often results in something great. But if a movie/series is funded because there is a calculation that some element of it will make a lot of money and **then** someone figures out what it's about it's often soulless and mediocre."

Buried by the Bernards,Buncha people in here can’t accept King Theoden himself thinks ROP looked like a shitty show
Buried by the Bernards,"I think the point is that it is being written and made in a very corporate way. Meaning it is more like an old summer block buster. 

It has a formula for cgi and battles. But ultimately it's like fire works. It pops, you watch, and you move on. 

No real staying power with this series unlike the LOTR movies. It just doesn't have any heart or anything that evokes emotion. 

I remember watching the fellowship as a kid and being in awe. I could rewatch it over and over. This is because everything came together. Story, characters, plot, special effects, the acting. There was always something more to catch.

Rings of power reminds me more of the star wars prequels. Which I liked as a kid, don't get me wrong. But other than a few scenes I don't really rewatch them at all. I loved the Yoda and dooku fight the first time it came out. But it just doesn't hold up. It has some great ingredients, but just seems like it wasn't cooked right. 


To me that is rings of power in a nut shell. I can admit that if I turn my brain off I could watch the rings of power and enjoy it. But I have no inclination to watch it again."
Buried by the Bernards,I’m with the King of Rohan on this one
Buried by the Bernards,Source material is an issue.  The movies were based on one of the classic works of English literature.  Rings of Power was based on an appendix.  And it shows.
Buried by the Bernards,"Amazons PR team going hard at this thread, dear god.  RoP is by far one of the most lore-eggregious shows ever made, and absolutely craps over Tolkiens work."
Buried by the Bernards,"I agree with the symptom but I don't agree with the overall statement. Is Rings of Power a money-making venture, yes. It is the reason why it is bad? no. 

Also there are plenty of lore to tell a good story, regardless if we have any more books or not. 

Someone call the white wizard because this man needs some inner demons purge."
Buried by the Bernards,"Salty boys mad bc one statement is crapping on a pop culture big wig series. 

That btw didn’t take a gamble but was indeed a money grab. “aLl mOvIes aRe mONeY gRAbS”

Buried by the Bernards,Less than half as entertaining as he was hoping for!
Buried by the Bernards," He’s not wrong. It’s pretty well publicised at this point that bezos green lit rings of power because he wanted Amazon to have its own ‘game of thrones’

Honestly I defy anyone to watch an episode of rings of power and say with a straight face it was made with the kind of love and respect for the source material that Peter Jackson had with his films. 

Films and tv are there to make money, but it’s pretty obvious when some shows and films are made as a corporate cash grab, and when others are legitimately made with passion. It’s equally obvious which category the rings of power falls into."
Buried by the Bernards,Theoden King stands not alone
Buried by the Bernards,I wonder if starring in those movies were a money making venture for him? Or did he do it pro bono because of his “love of the arts” or something?

Buried by the Bernards,"He used a lot of words to mean ""cash grab"", which would have been well understood by reddit.

Younger people, <40, tend to avoid words and phrases with lots of baggage and older folks seem mostly unaware of the baggage. I think this is a huge source of cultural confusion, misunderstanding and resentment."

Buried by the Bernards,These are clearly the words of Grima Wormtongue
Buried by the Bernards,"Lmao, who isn’t going to try to make money? Like LOTR is some indie venture or something. I’m guessing Jackson and all the actors from his trilogy donated their money to charity."
Buried by the Bernards,"They put a link to their 4/5 star review in the article. Like pretty much every media outlet, they only got the first two episodes for review purposes and didn't go back for any updates to the total season review. I don't understand why this isn't more of a scandal, as many reviewers who took a look back on the entire season after the finale rated it much more poorly than they did on their initial review. But since almost all season reviews are based on those first two, the show looks a lot more highly rated than it would otherwise be.

Most shows usually give out far more pre-release episodes to critics to review the whole season."
Buried by the Bernards,"I watched the new show and had to turn it off after about 20 minutes. 

Everything looked like it had a 2013 Instagram filter on it, and the characters were so uninteresting.

Perhaps I didn’t give it enough of a chance, but these are my thoughts"
Buried by the Bernards,King Theoden is right. And thats him being polite.
Buried by the Bernards,The show was pretty lame. That's all.
Buried by the Bernards,"Actually, since it's Amazon, it's a money sink venture. Invest a ton of money expanding the prestige of their brand, that they won't make back, but can write off to help them pay $0 in taxes on the profitable AWS side of the company. It's basically a free marketing hack.

&#x200B;

That said, I loved Rings of Power."
Buried by the Bernards,"He thinks they made The Hobbit ""really well"". That statement makes all his opinions suspect."
Buried by the Bernards,Yes like all popular IP film mediums. The studio didn’t spend 300 million on your trilogy for artistic achievement. It’s always about money
Buried by the Bernards,"low iqs in here like “but all movies are money ventures”

Trilogy was a passion project that tried to stay as true to source material as possible"
Buried by the Bernards,Hits out?
Buried by the Bernards,Every single piece of media about this show is confirmation bias clickbait. The actual show itself is entertaining enough for being something I get to watch because I need the crap I buy sent to me the next day. It's better than the Hobbit movies.
Buried by the Bernards,He’s right
Buried by the Bernards,He's not  wrong.
Buried by the Bernards,Ya damn right Theoden King.
Buried by the Bernards,"People with the brilliant take of 'aLl ShOwS eXiSt To MaKe MoNeY!' are missing the sentiment.

Yes, the movie trilogy exists because people thought it would make money, however that doesn't diminish the fact that the people working on it, from top down, had a true passion for the series. The Rings of Power just feels like a generic low grade fantasy show concocted by a bunch of suits at Amazon.

How many people came when the Numenoreans rode in to save shit-town in the Southlands? Cause I nut everytime the Rohirrim ride in with Gandalf to save the defenders at Helm's Deep"
Buried by the Bernards,So were the movies…
Buried by the Bernards,"Just because it's money making venture, doesn't mean it's bad!"
Buried by the Bernards,"Why exactly are people starting disingenuous arguments over what he said here when it's extremely clear what he means? ""Uhhhhh, clearly the movies made money, *duh!* Got'em."" Like no shit the films made money, his point is that RoP feels like a cash grab banking on the IP name, which it ultimately is.

What is it with this constant back-and-forth culture war where people are inclined to die on the most pointless hills because things keep getting twisted into an ""us vs. them"" mentality? Media is still allowed to be mediocre, not everything has to be either a flop or an award-winning masterpiece."
Buried by the Bernards,"Of all the things in the world that are true, this is one of those things."
Buried by the Bernards,Bravo that man
Buried by the Bernards,If anything it's a money-spending venture by someone who is a huge LOTR fan and has more money than God to make more LOTR.

Buried by the Bernards,"Hail Theoden King! His insights into RoP are glorious! Yes, It’s all nostalgia-bait for money."
Buried by the Bernards,"As opposed to the jackson films lmao?

The show is bad but you don’t need to say cringe shit like this to justify not liking it.  Fucking all entertainment exists to make money"
Buried by the Bernards,The LOTR films made by the non-profit WingNut Films.
Buried by the Bernards,"Ah yes, in contrast to the movies, which had no interest in making many and were purely a work of creativity.

Like, yes, they want to make money. And choosing LOTR as the universe to tell a story in is more lucrative than building your own. But A that is what the movies did, and B that doesn't mean you cannot tell inventive, interesting stories in that world. And the show so far has been great."
Buried by the Bernards,Sounds about right. All movies are a money making venture even LOTR trilogy.
Buried by the Bernards,"So was Lord of the Rings, bro"
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,When I heard a large majority of the show involved interviewing YouTubers for their opinion I knew I would never watch this.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"I'm not, it was obvious the whole time what happened. There is no such thing as ghosts and they purposely held on to the info about her not taking her medication which if they would of just opened with it, we wouldn't have to sit through all those bullshit amateur detectives telling us things just don't add up. Yes, they do. It should have been and hour and half doc and not 4 episodes of filler."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"I was turned off of this show after about 10 minutes when you had people saying “the hotel has a history of prositutes, drug addicts, suicides, clearly there is something evil going on”

Maybe the fact that it’s in downtown LA, a stone’s throw from Skid Row. Maybe that’s why."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,I found the history of the cecil hotel very boring. I don't think I made it past episode 302.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"It quickly went from a mystery to a PSA about mental health.  

I suspected that there wasn't any shocking outcome, but I thought that surely I had to be wrong- or else why would they make a 4 part documentary?  Turned out to be a giant waste of my time."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"Exactly this. It was a hugely disappointing documentary. The twist was that there’s no twist, and what happened was exactly what it seemed like. She went crazy and for some reason crawled into the tank and couldn’t get out. Case closed. Could have covered everything pertinent with a 30 minute special instead of making it a parade of conspiracy theorists and internet sleuths who didn’t know what the fuck they were talking about. 

Bloody waste of my time. We already knew most internet sleuths were idiots, they didn’t need to present all their “investigating” in a documentary as though they had any credibility."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"I think Netflix’s problem is that they determine the number of episodes first and then try to figure out how to fill that time. The Cecil Hotel and Elisa Lam story is tragic but there really isn’t that much new information available to the public or the filmmakers. As a result they had to pad the run time with fluff.

I respect where the author and the filmmaker are coming from but I also understand why people are a little tired of having conspiracy theorists and similar types of dirtbags dominate the conversation in every single situation."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"It wasn't just the medication angle that they withheld.  They have the audience questioning who put the lid of the tank back on if she killed herself, only for them to reveal in the final episode that the custodian found that the lid was OFF when he discovered her body."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"""Clearly there is something evil going on.""

""Yes...the evil of the cuts in spending for education, public health, and the social safety net in general.  As well as public policies that dehumanize the poor, indigent, and marginalized.""

""No I meant demons."""
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,302?
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,Those internet sleuths drove me crazy. They don't want to see the facts because other morons watch their videos and it is how they get clicks and make a living. This right there disqualifies them from being talking heads in a doc.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,I would have rather it been about the Cecil Hotel and all the history. Would be much more interesting.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"
>I think Netflix’s problem is that they determine the number of episodes first and then try to figure out how to fill that time.

This is correct.

They usually commission a show by a certain number of episodes for a set budget, regardless how much the story and content.

Hence so many Netflix shows have so much fillers."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"Exactly, they let those ""sleuths"" continue to push that narrative when they knew the entire time the lid was off. The doc at anytime could have showed them the proof. The cops did a half-hearted search. What a waste of time."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,Maybe it was 2. Felt like I had watched 300 episodes though.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,I was thinking the same thing!  Tie it in to a larger doc on the history and origins of Skid Row.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"> According to colleagues, Ruzicka had been feeling unwell for around a week with cold and flu symptoms. After testing negative for Covid, Ruzicka’s symptoms got worse and he was having trouble breathing so he left his home to visit urgent care but fell while on the way to his car. Paramedics arrived shortly after, but they were unable to resuscitate him."

Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,I just started reading the comics and so far the animated series has done a lot better with most of the stuff they covered. None of the fight scenes in the comic so far even come close to what they've done.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,Favorite is a stretch for me. Memorable certainly.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,Yeah I was going to say this. Recently had a healthy guy slightly younger than this man die after contracting strep throat for 2 weeks. He died in his sleep.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"Okay but the problem is that 1) medical care is expensive, and 2) the way health works is that everything is a symptom for everything. Do you know how many things depression is a symptom of? LOTS. Having cold and flu symptoms in February isn't necessarily indicative of dying of heart failure, and we can't all afford to go to the doctor every time we have a cold. And then there's the issue that when people do go to the doctor, doctors just dismiss it. If you go to the doctor because you've had cold or flu symptoms and you test negative for covid, the doctor isn't going to say ""okay it's possible that you're going to die in a week of sepsis or heart failure"". They're going to say ""well it's February, so it makes sense that you're having cold symptoms. Take some cold medicine and have chicken soup. Also you should lose weight."""
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,Common symptom for what?
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,You don't know anyone who died in their 40's before 2021?

Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"That series was so fun to read. The fights get better as it goes on, imo."
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"There are definitely some awesome fights later in the series. The book starts with, and occasionally goes back to, Cory Walker as the artist, but Ryan Ottley handles the bulk of the series. Ottley is who I would consider the better artist, and is definitely better at conveying action. He's just generally better at dynamic movement and interesting poses, so his action looks way better.

His is, in my opinion, the greatest performance in all of Game of Thrones so far. And certainly a performance that in my opinion exceeds some of the other nominees."

I KNOW"
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,It's the fucking Golden Globes lmao
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"Golden Globes are trash, but it does show how contentious Emmys and Oscars are going to be this year.

Emmys - Better Call Saul, House of the Dragon, Severance, Andor, Hacks, The Bear, Abbot Elementary, some real peak TV with no way to give everyone the awards they deserve, but at least for once Succession isn't going to come in and take up all the air in the room.

Oscars - some really fantastic all-time greats this year including Everything Everywhere All At Once, along with popular box office draws like Top Gun: Maverick and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Avatar, and then award bait like Elvis, Babylon, She Said, and The Fablemans.

Lot of folks and fandoms will be going home disappointed, but ultimately just enjoy this great content we all have!"

He is good but Considine's performance was kind of career-defining. It also was like the center of gravity of the whole show, from a dramatic point of view. Like the cleft in a partiture. Every other character's behaviour took its cue from Viserys."

Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,Award shows are a joke.
Crime Scene: The Vanishing at the Cecil Hotel,"I’ve never cared for awards. The fact that Leo been snubbed for so many Oscar’s proves that none of this shit matters. We all know who the best performances were, and let’s be real here, so do the people who made those performances."

Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Break glass in case of subscriber drop.
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Plot twist: This season will just feature episodes based on news headlines from 2019 - 2020
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Let's see if they can finally get out of the ""consciousness trapped in a machine"" trap and actually get creative again. They leaned _way_ too heavily on that premise the last couple seasons to the point where if someone hadn't seen the first couple, they'd think that premise _was_ the core of the show."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"I’m happy about this, Severance was one of the best shows I’ve seen in awhile and it was essentially a 9-episode Black Mirror story"
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"I’m of the opinion that the first three seasons are overall great, but the quality starts to drastically decline after that. It’s obvious that Charlie Brooker is starting to recycle a few of his concepts one too many times, and that is making the later seasons look like pale imitations of past episodes."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"If you want a show to hold you over until then, I recommend “Severance” on AppleTV+."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"White Bear is probably still one of my most WTF episodes of all time.

That being said, hopefully the writing will be more like the first four season. The last one kinda sucked."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"OI

WOT IF YER MUM WOZ A COMPUTAH"
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK," When I tell people to watch this show I'm like maybe skip the baconator episode and watch it a few in or more down the line, trial by fire with that episode as a pilot.

edit: spoilers below in the replies"
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Details:

>While details about specific stories are being kept under lock and key, Variety understands that Season 6 will have more episodes than Season 5, which comprised of just three instalments and starred Andrew Scott, Anthony Mackie, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Topher Grace and Miley Cyrus.  

  
>A source close to the production tells Variety that the latest season is even more cinematic in scope, with each instalment being treated as an individual film. This is, of course, in line with recent seasons of “Black Mirror,” for which episodes usually exceeded 60 minutes and had incredibly high production values."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"After the last few years, I think I'm going to pass on watching a ""fictional"" dystopian future society where tech companies have too much power and humans have lost their empathy."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,There’s that guy that looks like Matt Damon but isn’t
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Rumor has it Charlie Brooker originally had an idea to start the season with an episode where  456 people who are in deep financial debt risk their lives to play a series of deadly children's games for the chance to win a millions of dollars. 

&#x200B;

Apparently someone beat him to it then he got severe writers block and couldn't write any more :("
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Not a big fan of them going cinematic, with these long form episodes. I like Black Mirror because it's an anthology series. I want lots of decent little stories with a few amazing gems. You get a few stinkers in there too, but it's better than putting everything into three okay mini movies"

Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Meh. I'm sorry but the last season was basically trash. This won't save Netflix.
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Yessssss I’ve been waiting !!!!!
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,I consider Severance the new black mirror season.
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Good for them. Personally I think it went to shit and every season got less impressive after White Christmas which was the absolute peak. No I never felt ""existential dread"" from it because it is extremely over the top in that regard, it does not feel realistic at all. What it did feel me with was misery because pretty much every ending is sad, not because it is something realistic or relatable but because it just is. 

Furthermore I feel like starting with season 3 they started going fantasy rather than sci-fi. How the hell could you get a copy of someone's thought and memories from their spit?"
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Oh look at that, a reason to keep Netflix."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Hope it's better than the current season of Black Mirror we're currently living in.
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Just don't feel the same dread and hopelessness feeling like the UK seasons.
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"I’ll echo that it dipped when it went to Netflix. Bar a couple of episodes they’re pretty average. 

Inside Number 9 is a far better horrorish anthology series"
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Finally. I know not many people liked the latest season but the concepts are always entertaining to me in some way so I very excited for a new season.
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Season 5 was a pretty big let down for me. More like quirky ideas being played out than some of the earlier material which I hope they return to

Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Cool so when these good series actually return then let me know and I’ll *consider* subscribing again. Dangling a shit-covered carrot (that it’s “in the works”) isn’t going to get me to buy back in and wait another year or more for it.

Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,Expectations are low but I look forward to the good episode or 2 to come out with the rest.

Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,[deleted]
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"People complain the Netflix episodes aren't bleak enough, but also complain the themes are repetitive...

The reality is, it would not be possible to keep making episodes of the show in the same tone as National Anthem et al without them completely losing any effect. It's like drowning your chips in vinegar with no salt.

The shift also coincided with Brooker's growing family life and success, and the increasingly depressing political outlook that he's stated made him reluctant to continue the show. So the tone shift would pretty definitely have happened on C4 over the time scale regardless.

The difference though is that not having Netflix money/exposure would have meant Brooker was trying to make more tonally diverse stories without being able to do some of the experimental stuff he managed to do with Netflix' flexible formatting, runtimes and budgeting.

(Btw no amount of sulking about happy endings changes the fact that San Junipero is the most sophisticated writing of Brooker's career and the best episode of the show - and would not have been remotely possible on C4)

So the shift to Netflix didn’t cause the change in the show's direction. Rather, it mitigated the effects of lots of other inevitable stuff and extended the show's lifespan past what was likely its end otherwise."
Cells at Work! CODE BLACK,"Take it back to its roots, drop Netflix's American influence. There are a handful of good episodes in the Netflix era but the reason the first seasons are so good is because it was authentically British."

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"However different our tastes may be, I think it's great how you always seem to put such a lot of effort into your writings.

I've got a question, though.

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation

It's not easy reconciling the above with some of your actual ratings: *Firefly Lane* (just as an example, I haven't seen it) you give a 6.8 - a rating you subsequently explain by calling the show ""forgettable"", and by saying it ""does nothing to stand out"".

So... How can a show seemingly so wholly lacking in originality, creativity, and innovation *measured by those very same categories* still get a 6.8? Shouldn't it be more like, I dunno, a 2? Or do you count up to 100? How exactly did you arrive at the (very precise!) number 6.8?"

Dom is a very hard series to label '*good*' or '*bad*'. It certainly holds your attention throughout, with it's emotional stories about addiction, exciting burglary scenes, intriguing drug busts operations and gorgeous locations, but it's all so disjointed and incoherently written.

&#x200B;

Porni doesn't do too bad at accomplishing what it sets out to accomplish. It's a very genuine and relatable series about motherhood, there just isn't anything here that makes it stick out. Not the plot, not the characters, not anything really.

&#x200B;

Mare of Easttown is by all means a well put together series, my issue is there's not an ounce of originality to be found here. It's too typical a '*whodunnit*' detective mystery-drama, in the same style and execution we've seen a million times already. The performances and character work act as saving grace, but at the same time its not like we haven't seen character work or emotional weight of this magnitude before.

&#x200B;

Genera+ion does have potential, but so far, besides it being more LGBTQ+ centric, hasn't branched out beyond being the average teen show. They do have opportunity to make some audacious and daring decisions here with a very strong group of characters, whether or not they will capitalize, we'll see, but Genera+ion definitely needs something to stand out. Crazy enough the best episode here so far is the one directed by Lena Dumhum. From her 'Girls' days she's always been a master of making great episodes that are literally about nothing.

This one falls into '*so bad it's good*' territories. A series that's bat shit crazy, overly dramatic and unpredictable in the sense that the writers don't give fuck all about consistency, cohesion... or logic. Mexican telenovela at its finest.

&#x200B;

The most creatively ambitious work the MCU has put out so far, but not fully committing to its more ambitious ideas lead it to falling into familiar 'formulaic superhero' territories by the end of it.

A psychological-thriller that's fascinating... baffling... and bat-shit crazy! I'm not sure what to even say the premise of this is. What starts out as a 'unconventional love-triangle', develops into something so... left-field. The writing is more in line with a soap-opera, but it's one of the most unpredictable stories I've ever seen if you ask me.

Following a group of friends from the year they met while *walking the camino*, to different period in their life throughout the years where they would walk it again and again, 3 Caminos is centered around the Camino de Santiago and feels very much like an advertisement for the ""spiritual"", ""life-changing"" walk. Apparently it's funded by the European Tourism Board, and that will put things into perspective when you watch it, but besides having to hear the word ""Camino"" over and over again the series does have its upsides. Its stunning visuals and scenery for one, also its very calm and tranquil atmosphere, plus the feeling you get at the end, like you've just finished watching something very profound, meaningful and life-changing... even though you haven't."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Invincible is my current favorite.

I am watching For All Mankind and Mare of Easttown very soon though."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,">Inspired by the true life story of Christiane F., unlike the 1981 film Wir Kinder vom Bahnof Zoo takes a more stylistic approach, modernizing the 1970s with contemporary music, glossy visuals and unexpected surrealism as it tells the tragic story of kids on drugs.

Not with you on that. But, I read the book for at least 5 times, and maybe find it hard to separate. Still, I feel its a bit a case of many overwritten drama shows. In the book - which I found a much tougher read today as back then when parents and teachers used it as anti-drug-pamphlet - there is foucs on the social background, but still I got more the sense that a lot of this teenagers where hapless kids that were overwhelmed by what happened. Got shocked how easy it was in the 1970ies to go to the center of Berlin as a John and buy teenage junkies for sex.

With you on ""Yasuke"". Generally I am not fond of the trend started by Castlevania to make this super short anime series. I wished ""Yasuke"" had some filler episodes. Too crammed with everything they could pull out of their minds."

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Oh that's because the 'rating' I give when I *review* a series, isn't just '*how I feel about the series from 1-10*'. Well... it is and it isn't. Originality, creativity and innovation are still the basis of my ratings and the determining factors as to whether or not I like something... but I still rate all the essential elements, then use the average as the final score.

Hopefully this makes more sense.

    Originality/Creativity : 6 
    writing (plot & cha): 7 
    writing (dia): 6 
    acting: 8 
    visuals/cine: 7 
    prod.: 7 
    rating: 6.8

I don't post it like this because it makes more sense in my head then when shared lol. Rating the visuals, acting, writing etc. individually then using the average as the final score allows me to work out how good i thought something was overall without thinking about it directly you know.... I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something. It might sound weird... but Im just glad someone cared enough to ask. lol."

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"WandaVision was more than okay, but IRYO."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"> Not with you on that

On what exactly, that I called it stylistic, that I listed it under ""outstanding"" or both? 

Probably a case of separating book from adaptation as you said. I haven't read the book myself but according to several reactions I've seen from people who like both (and the disclaimer at the start of each episode emphasizing that it's merely ""inspired by"" these events), you're suppose to take the series as its own thing. There are new characters, their relations are different and none of their backstories (besides Christiane's) are the same as in the book/film apparently. 

Taking the series for what it is I thought it was pretty great. The concept of modernizing the 1970s with a surrealistic approach is fantastic and something we haven't seen before. And out course it's still one of the most daring things on the TV platform to the point where it isn't even available for U.S. viewers on Prime (or at least it wasn't). Plus it still packs an emotional punch showing the consequences of drug use.... I fucks with it. lol."

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Indeed, (6 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 7) / 6 ≈ 6.8, but why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories? After all:

>Shows categorized based on originality, creativity and innovation (as those are the 3 main factors I look for in TV shows)

And what exactly is ""prod.""? Direction? Editing?

Also: no category for scoring/music... Have you no decency? Or actual hearing loss?

>I also remove 1.0 point whenever I don't finish something

Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is *really* awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense..."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"What a shitty way to say, “You might also like *Wonder Egg Priority*”"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Agreed.  She was great.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,so many words... so many fuckin' words lol.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Yeah, it is 20 1-hour long episodes. But I actually looked forward each week to the new episodes, and it’s rare for a show to have that effect on me."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"    > Mare of Easttown:
    originality/creativity: 3/10 
    writing (plot & cha): 8/10 
    writing (dialogue): 7/10 
    acting: 10/10 
    visuals/cinema: 7/10 
    production: 7/10 
    rating: 7.0 out of 10

So, for all the reasons I've already said there's no way I would give Mare of Easttown a 9.5. I do agree that it is probably the best detective-mystery of the year so far though, but that might say more about how creatively starved that sub-genre has been since the days of True Detective and The Missing. Or I don't know maybe my favorite detective shows were the ones in a long line-up of typical offerings that pushed the envelop a bit.

But as I mentioned Mare of Easttown is a well put together show, but its goals steer towards precision without much thought of offering something new, and if you read my 'NB' in the opening statement or you're familiar with my posts, you'll know I have an issue with that. hehe."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Personally, I was surprised how good it was - and fell also in the trap to almost dismiss after the first episode. Really creative take."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,">The concept of modernizing the 1970s with a surrealistic approach is fantastic and something we haven't seen before.

Legion...?"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Its bad?
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Have you watched Magicka Madoka btw?

Wonder Eggs setting and premise is basically taken from there"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,What about The White Lotus? Also from HBO
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"> why don't you weigh ""Originality/Creativity"" more than the other categories?

mmm.... nah. It just works better (in my head) if it's equally it own essential. A show can have an original idea, but bad writing, or vice-versa... but i still would want to give points for the idea itself, on equal grounds with everything else such as writing, acting and visuals. 

> And what exactly is ""prod.""?

Production is all the other stuff that can be taken into consideration like sets, costumes (mostly for period dramas), designs (especially for animated stuff), music/ost, editing, make-up sometimes etc. Occasionally one of the things I listed will stick out, like the soundtrack on Yasuke, or the editing on Sexify... I just use ""production"" to give nod points to those. Shows with bigger budget will get higer points for production of course but low buget shows that still manages to be effective and convincing with limited budget also gets high points for production. 

> Why not just subtract 1 point per unwatched episode - this way you can get into negative numbers when something is really awful, especially when rating 20+ episode network nonsense...

Ok this.... this makes a lot of sense. lol. I doubt i'll ever get a negative score on anything though lol. I mostly watch shows with 8-10 episodes... shit sometimes 6. Plus I watch 4 episodes of every single show before I decide whether or not I want to quit."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"> “You might also like *Wonder Egg Priority*”

I wasn't trying to say this at all. Wonder Egg Priority has nothing in common with Mare of Easttown, it's just *better* (even with that underproduced OVA for an ending). 🤷"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Agreed. The 1st two episodes were kinda boring, but it got so much better."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Legion's setting is a modernization of the 1970s?? I always took it like it just didn't want viewers to know what year it was set in lol.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Terrible. They had major production issues. Not sure why they even released it.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Great! I made this post before I watched that.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,">mmm.... nah.

You misunderstand - I wasn't making a suggestion, I was asking a question: why do you emphasise ""originality, creativity"" as ""main factors"" you look for in TV shows when, in the end, you weigh those on an equal level to writing, acting, etc.?"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Thanks for the spoiler
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,The first two episodes aren't the problem with it.  It's really the last 2.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Oh because it's the basis of my write-ups really. Let me put it like this... It gets its own category, but really what aspects of a show are original, creative or innovative? It could be any of the other essentials I rate. It could be the writing, dialogue, visuals, production etc. I didn't have to rate originality/creativity by itself... most people don't even think about that when watching shows."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,What!? 😐
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"I meant it more that it went to a total different way than I expected, and I liked that."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,People only hated the last episode because their fan theories didn't come true.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"True enough, I'd regard something like ""originality"" solely as a modifier to more traditional categories - something doesn't necessarily need to be original, to be ""good"" (whatever that word may mean).

Thank you for sharing your thought process."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,And because it completely wiped out any consequences for Scarlet Witch and acted like she was the victim of the whole thing *she orchestrated*. Scarlet Witch was *the only actual villain* in the entire series
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"> I'd regard something like ""originality"" solely as a modifier to more traditional categories - something doesn't necessarily need to be original, to be ""good""

Exactly! But for me, a person who watches A LOT of television, there has to be original ideas or creative execution or done in a way I haven't seen before for me to really like something or find it praise-worthy. 

That's why I put that in the opening statement, because originality, creativity and innovation is what I look for when I personally watch anything... but the writing, acting, visuals etc. still has to be up to standard. hehe."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Grest show!   FYI - Directed by Peter Berg.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Here's the trailer from Showtime:

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Man, I'm watching now. It's very well made."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"I watched this on Channel 4 and this is honestly my favourite show of the year. 

Definitely reminded me of the equally hilarious Derry Girls when that first came on TV and quickly became a favourite of mine too.

Can’t wait for Season 2 of Lady Parts."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Really loved this show, I think it's very likely to be my favourite of the year! Glad to see people talking about it"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"I'm meaning to watch this as I check out as much foreign stuff and channel 4 type of content as I can.  But worried though, as the previews I've seen look starkly unfunny."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"It's airing on Showcase in Canada, so it'll be on Stack TV for streaming."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"As an American, I’m so jealous of your channel 4. So many good comedy shows. This one sounds awesome."
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"The short for Comedy Blaps a few years back is pretty amazing [(here's a link if anyone's interested)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOEXtrPFEzc)

Can't wait to watch it on Peacock next week!"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"But...but...it has a song called Nobody's Gonna Honour Kill My Sister But Me, which cannot possibly be bad. I'll watch it to see if there are any more jokes like that, but I hate sitcoms and I'm not expecting much."

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"I do enjoy your reviews btw, sorry youre getting downvoted"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,It's partially autobiographical so not sure how the creators real life experience of being a Muslim woman in a punk band is shoehorning.

2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,Cool thanks!!
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,why not?
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"Pretty sure it's a pun playing on the two meanings of stoned - the type that punk rockers do, and the type that happens to Muslim women"
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,He just means he doesn’t like Muslims and women on his tv.
2.43: Seiin High School Boys Volleyball Team,"The burden of proof isn’t on me, you’re the one who said it sounds fucking amazing. I’m asking why, and you respond by wanting me to prove a negative? It doesn’t sound amazing because just that, the concept sounds tired and boring."

Pretend It’s a City,"There's a funny moment in season 2 that refers to this that I can't unsee when I watch the episode. In ""The Marshal"", when Cobb Vanth first appears in the armor, he orders a bottle and two shot glasses from the bartender. He goes over to the bar and when he reaches for the bottle and glasses, you can see his fingers fumble around with the shot glasses a bit to figure out where he's gonna situate his grip, like he can't exactly see them."
Pretend It’s a City,"This is the way.

Pretend It’s a City,Can confirm. I 3d printed a copy of his helmet. Even without the black lens your field of view is severely restricted. Looks badass though so whatever
Pretend It’s a City,"As a casual watcher I didn't even know if he was in the suit, he could've just done the voice"
Pretend It’s a City,Any hole?
Pretend It’s a City,"Why do I get the feeling that the helmet should have an internal AR/VR setup, to deal with low/star/nolight conditions. combined with targeting link to their weapons. If you’re going to spend $$$ on clones, you might as well bite the bullet and decent kit too."
Pretend It’s a City,"Well if last of us taught us anything, falling into a hole is step 1 to finding love."

Pretend It’s a City,"So, he can't see...the way?"
Pretend It’s a City,Wish he’d fall into my hole 😔
Pretend It’s a City,"I very much enjoy that there is a Venn diagram where the overlap is people who cosplay as Mando, HEMA armorers, and people with actual body armor experience and the thing they all have in common is knowing that Mandalorian armor is wildly impractical. 

It looks cool as hell, but yeah, you can’t see shit, you can’t move well, and if you’re not Pedro Pascal you’re worried about breaking something you’ve poured a ton of time and money into."
Pretend It’s a City,"Hi! I guess unofficial member of the 501st Legion here!

Can absolutely confirm. I spent most of my childhood either in a Jawa costume or wearing a 501st Legion t-shirt at the parades working as a 'spotter'. The visibility in basically \*all\* of the Imperial and Mandalorian armors is so bad that it really is like trying to look through a mailbox slot. In fact, our troopers very lovingly call them their 'buckets'.

Not to mention, hot as hell. I can't even begin to describe how many times I had to help our Darth Vader change the batteries in his helmet so the CPU fans that kept him cool wouldn't die during a 4th of July parade."
Pretend It’s a City,"So he's probably asking ""is this the way?"""
Pretend It’s a City,"""We ain't found SHIT"""
Pretend It’s a City,"I know he's on the path to fix his honor or whatever because he had removed his helm, but if they're going to be moving away from the lone wanderer western feel into I guess some medieval esque power struggle, I'd be fine if they wrote in somehow that he takes his helm off more. They got the emotional payoff in S2 with keeping his helm on mostly forever up till Grogu at the end."

Pretend It’s a City,We ain't found shit!
Pretend It’s a City,"Yeah, I agree. With a Mandalorian helmet on I can't see shit either."
Pretend It’s a City,"Not going to lie: that armor looks awesome on him (and whoever his stand-in/stunt double is).

It gives him such an idealized masculine profile with a very broad set of shoulders and chest, narrowing to the waist, and then thicker thighs all in a way more pronounced than you see in Stormtrooper armor, or Boba Fett's armor."
Pretend It’s a City,"Of course he can't see out of it, he's in a recording booth five hundred miles away."
Pretend It’s a City,"I mean, I kinda understand what he's saying, but with either my Jango or Boba Fett helmet you use the vertical part of the visor to see what's immediately in front of you. Once you learn how to walk with it on you can do stairs even. More importantly you feel cool when wearing it, who need to see what's in front of them really"
Pretend It’s a City,I hate that it’s not even him in that suit most of the time.
Pretend It’s a City,"I think we all think the Mandalorian helmet was a nice idea. But, not pointing any fingers, but it could of been done better. So how about no Mandalorian helmets this time, but next time we do this we go full regalia."

Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,This was a great read.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."

Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Delta state was the shit!
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,It was on both actually
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I expect Norman is off setting fire somewhere. He’s a right little pyro that boy.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,In Germany we can’t watch the classics 😭
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I believe that's *Firefighter* Sam...
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"He's clearly Sam's illegitimate son and trying desperately to get his father's attention. Sam still denies him, though. :'("
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I'm so glad shows are resuming production!

  
SPN wraps for good next week, though, which makes me a little sad."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I did see filming happening downtown Vancouver the first week of August, on the steps of the Art Gallery. I wondered what that was..."

Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Hooch is crazy
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,that's a lot of content
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,[deleted]
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Any specific dates to go with this?
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Thanks man you're awesome
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,[deleted]
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,*holds up lighter*
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,It’s pretty genius
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,That’s pathetic
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,[deleted]
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Mighty Little Bheem: Kite Festival,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I've watched the premiere.  One thing that stuck out to me is when Lori's mom and others remark, ""she changed when she met Chad.""

No, she didn't.  She was always nuts!  Anyone who claims to speak to Jesus or Angels or anyone else who is not present clearly has a screw loose."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Like it says in the article it doesn't change anything and to be honest I don't think the documentaries about sympathy for him as it is just telling the story of this insane family which is obviously still insane. Him getting arrested reinforces this documentary in a way that this family needs to be locked away.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"For those who didn’t read the article:

The story is told from the son’s point of view, he is portrayed as sympathetic and a loving husband and father. Son just got arrested for domestic abuse. Makes it awkward how he is portrayed in the documentary."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Excerpt:

>Latter-day Saint ties


>Very little of what happens is directly tied to Utah, but a lot of it is tied to the fact that both Lori and Chad Daybell were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Chad served a mission to New Jersey, where he “set all sorts of baptismal records,” another returned missionary says in the documentary.


>Chad is a graduate of Brigham Young University; he, Tammy and their children lived in Springville before moving to Rexburgh, Idaho; Tammy is buried in Springville, which is where her body was exhumed during the investigation into her death.


>“I raised all our kids in the LDS Church,” Lori’s mother says in the documentary. “All of our kids loved the Book of Mormon, and Lori’s always loved the scriptures.”


>And Ryan says, “As time went on, the LDS Church was becoming a bigger topic in our house. I think it started to become a little bit more of idolatry. There was just pictures everywhere. Everything was getting replaced slowly with pictures of temples and stuff like that. All over the house — all over everything.”


>“Sins of Our Mother” outlines how both Lori and Chad Daybell moved far from their Latter-day Saint upbringings. Chad thinks he’s a prophet. He and his followers think reincarnation is a thing, and he was awaiting an apocalypse, when only 144,000 righteous people would survive. And he would lead them.


>“He’s trying to create a new religion on the back of Mormonism,” says forensic psychologist John Mathias.


>There are references that only those familiar with the church will understand, like when Charles texts about “Gadiantons” — seemingly drawn from the Gadianton robbers in the Book of Mormon.


>And there are audio recordings of Lori recounting religious experiences that are … odd. Dead people, angels — including the angel Moroni — and God talking to her. She and Chad believed they had been married to each other multiple times in previous lives.


>Lori is convinced that Chad is indeed a prophet. She believed that her ex-husband, Charles Daybell, and both Tylee and JJ had become “zombies” — evil spirits took over their bodies, and they had to be killed to free their spirits.


>“I mean, look, it’s completely off the wall,” Borgman said. “But, we’ve all seen stories or known people who sort of just go too far in their beliefs. I mean, usually it doesn’t end up with the murder of your children.”"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,just rename it Sins of our Mother and One of her Sons and voilà
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Is it still a good documentary? Despite being “awkward”? The case is fascinating
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,The Mormons brought us Jody Arias too.  Hat's off to Joseph Smith
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Grandma is reprehensible too.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I grew up in Utah. Fuck that cult and all the damage I’ve seen first hand it’s responsible for.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I read that the charges have been dropped already btw
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Colby seemEd to be as fake and fame hungry as his crazy mom. I wondered why always let Lori off easy when he was one of the few in contact with her.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,His charges were dropped 2 days ago
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I literally just finished the show and was looking for somewhere on Reddit to comment how strangely cold and disconnected the son seemed from these traumatizing events. I was trying to tell myself everyone grieves differently but it just seemed off to me. Lo and behold
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Why are there so many Mormons involved in murder? This case, the Susan Cox Powell case, etc"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"The charges against Colby Ryan were dropped and court appearances cancelled on Sept 6. Apparently, it was his estranged wife. [https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2022/9/12/23349124/sins-of-our-mother-colby-ryan-charges-dropped](https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2022/9/12/23349124/sins-of-our-mother-colby-ryan-charges-dropped)"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,LDS is illegitimate!
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I do not think that she was a ""faithful"" good member of that cult ever...she was always nasty, hypocritical and shallow"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Agree. She accused her 3rd husband Joe Ryan of sexually assaulting Ryan & Tylee because she wanted full custody even had her now deceased brother Al taser Joe in a parking lot after a custody hearing. Lori told a social worker she wld kill Joe if he got shared custody. Even falsely told 4th husband Charles lies about Joe hoping to get full custody of Tylee. Charles spent thousands on court case fighting custody. Later found out was all a lie. Social workers police did a thorough investigation into allegations and concluded it was obvious Lori coached both kids as to what to say about Joe. Btw Joe is Tylee's bio Dad. Ryan still claims Joe sexually assaulted him since Lori was arrested. Seems to add to it  each time in paid interviews.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Agreed with this guy. It doesn’t taint his image within the documentary, it just goes to show that these people are messed tf up and need help"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"So a guy who lived with some reprehensible woman as a mother grew up to be a domestic abuser?

*Shocking.*"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,He also has a rape charge. There is verbal evidence to his admission of doing so on a recorded phone conversation… i thought he was a loving married man?!
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Are you serious. I felt something was off with him and his wife, but I couldn’t put my finger on it."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Damn….
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I haven't read the article, but this excerpt doesn't really explain why the documentary is now awkward with the arrest of her adult son. Why is it awkward?"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Her ex-husband Charles “daybell”. Gross!!! 
🤢🤮🤢🤮I’m sure it’s honest mistake."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"May I reccomend Neil LaBute (a former LDS member) excellent play ""BASH"" 
It is a three part play about the intolerance of some members of the LDS 
It is available in paperback and I got a VHS copy of it, I do not know if it made it to DVD or YouTube.
Neil LaBute was expelled from the church because of it."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Lol.  Just got this update from r/exmormon :

>Colby was arrested BUT now all charges were dropped without prejudice."

SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Keith Morrison better narrate or I’m out.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I watched it just now and thought it was very informative. Then came here and wondered why they left so much out
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I see what you did there
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"And the Laffertys r/UnderTheBanner

And Mark Hoffman r/MurderAmongTheMormons

And the Brobergs r/AbductedInPlainSight

And Warren Jeffs r/keepsweet

And Ted Bundy r/TedBundy

And ..."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Jody Arias only joined the church because Travis was Morman
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,And Josh Powell.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,So Joseph Smith brought us Jody Arias’ asshole?
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I don’t think we can blame them for Arias since she only “converted” to get Travis Alexander to marry her. She wasn’t raised Mormon and wasn’t even close to living or subscribing to the lifestyle.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"The LDS has the rare distinction to share 1st Prize ex-aqueo with Jehovas Witness as the MOST INTOLERANT Christian cults.
Evangelists and Lutherans are among the tolerant top. Catholics too, but boy, their church has a nasty past...."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,If you aren’t a part of the Mormon church is it an ok place to live? UT looks so beautiful.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I had no idea about the Mountain Meadows massacre until Under the Banner of Heaven. What a PR job by the church
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"But not cancelled, the victim can bring them back if she wants, at anytime..."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"How did he seem cold and disconnected?

In my opinion he seemed to be making everything about himself. He did break down a few times about the deaths of the children and his step father. What did I miss?"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Do you remember that it was a whites only cult, and then President Carter told them if they kept that ""rule"" they would have to pay TAXES ??
All of a sudden, they changed and became a ""non racist"" cult...."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,LSD is pretty legit tho
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Which are very acceptable traits in cults as long as you profess belief.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"What would Colby gain from saying that Joe sexually assaulted them? I’m not saying I don’t believe you, but I don’t see the point in lying about that. 

I also had no clue she was married 4 times. Edit- just looked it up, and apparently she’s been married 5 times."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I recall Ryan's mil starting a gfm the minute Lori was arrested in Hawaii. Ryan quit his job at a lube centre car wash type job had his car repossessed was living with mil wife new baby. Don't think he's worked since but has had another baby with his now separated wife. He needs to man up do the responsible work needed to support his young family. Instead seems to want to live off drama and paid tv interviews.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"No, he is not a loving married man. He is, after all, Lori's son."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Because he is one of the people interviewed for the documentary, he is depicted as someone you’d feel badly for. Then, he was arrested for sexual assault - the same week the series is airing."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Maybe the church lulled some strings
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,But they are still open if the victim wants to go ahead...
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,The only right answer 👆🏼👏🏻
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,With many more yet to come!
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"To be fair, Bundy was killing girls long before he became a Mormon and he wasn’t really that serious about the church either."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I will *never* forget Abducted in Plain Sight.

That documentary was a constant mindfuck."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I cant remember the title but I watched one with the guy faking some LDS manuscripts, selling it and killing people to keep the fraud alive."

SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Travis Alexander, Jason Alexander is George Constanza"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"She had the dude bang her in the butt before she killed him because vaginal intercourse is forbidden before marriage by the Mormon church 

Not sure where we lost you

Must have been after the second hole"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Yes and it’s beautiful. But the culture is not friendly to non Mormons. Its a “good ol boy” state, aka which powerful Mormon family you know."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Yes as long as it’s not Provo
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Yeah, I have no idea about the legal system. What exactly is he supposed to have done? And to whom? (Not doubting or judging, just curious about the context)"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Idunno to me he seemed like he just really didn't care enough. When calling his mother in prison after finding out they murdered his brother and sister his first thought was to record it and not even shed a single tear and he was barely angry. He only broke down once and even when he broke down he just covered his face and when he finally moved his hands there wasn't even tears and his eyes weren't red. The reporter who was reporting that the children's bodies were found seemed more upset then he did. This guy's whole entire family was murdered by his mother and he didn't shed a single tear. I just felt his behaviour was very off and idunno I guess narcissistic? Maybe he has the same mental issue his mother has just hasn't gone completely insane like her. Of course he's gone through stuff too but it was just was weird to me how completely unphased he was by everything. Imagine if something like this happened to you I mean I know personally I would not be able to fathom it or keep it together. And I definitely wouldn't be calling my murdering mother telling her ""I still love you but I can't believe you went this far! My siblings!? 🤪"". Even him calling them his siblings was just odd too. It's such a cold phrasing given the circumstances, that's what you call your brother and sister in a professional setting, but calling them your siblings while you're calling your mother in prison after finding their bodies buried in her back yard?!  Just my 2 cents, everyone grieves differently at the end of the day but dam he realllllyyyyyy didn't seem to care much that his whole entire family blew up. Even this story here, you'd think he would hold on to the family he created for dear life with everything that happened but he has SA charges and he's cheating on his wife? Sussy baka"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,🤭🫡
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Joe Ryan took a polygraph which he passed. Yes her marriage to Chad Daybell is her 5th husband.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Colby did it because Lori asked him to. Colby was paid hush money by Lori for years.  When she stopped paying he got mad and turned on her. Colby is not a good guy. How much do you think he was paid for the documentary? I sympathize with him in that he was raised by Lori and of course his values would be all over the place due to that.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Calling the murders of someone’s stepfather and siblings “drama” is heartlessly reductive
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Interesting point: I wonder how many members of Lori's family have EVER had a JOB ??
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Obvs this person is not okay
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"WOW !! A play within the play !!
I think there are more shocking events in the near future !!"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"once the r/LoriVallow trial starts in Jan 2023, it’s gonna be 24/7 nonstop piping that insanity to everybody’s screens.  Lori & Chad took Mormon true crime to a horrific next level."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Plus there's horrible killers who are Christian, Buddhist, Shinto, Muslim, atheist.

Probably Jewish? I can't think of any."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Yeah, that’s Mark Hofmann.  The series was called Murder Among the Mormons.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hofmann


Here’s some archival footage with the woman who wrote the definitive book about Hofmann: https://v.redd.it/770a14d80yx81"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Whoops, thank you! Fixed it!"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Yeah, that was *his* hang up, not hers. He was a classic hypocrite- being very socially active and faithful in the church and then doing whatever he felt like in his personal life."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"A friend of mine was made to sit alone on a bench outside the SLC Temple as her son was married.  He converted to please his fiancé but neglected to tell his Mom that after she travelled 1000 miles to attend the wedding she wouldn’t be allowed to actually see it.  Happy ending, two years later he announced he was gay. She was relieved the church no longer wanted him cuz she still did."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,I can only imagine the country club gossip that goes down behind closed doors
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Thanks. We’re going to visit SLC because my cousin just moved there for work. I’m really excited because it’s one of the few states I’ve passed through but never explored.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Very well said & I agree with many of your thoughts & opinions. Thank you for sharing!!
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Idk if that man did what he was accused of, but I never miss an opportunity to deride polygraph tests.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph

> Assessments of polygraphy by scientific and government bodies generally suggest that polygraphs are **highly inaccurate, may easily be defeated by countermeasures, and are an imperfect or invalid means of assessing truthfulness.**[10][11][12] A comprehensive 2003 review by the National Academy of Sciences of existing research concluded that there was **""little basis for the expectation that a polygraph test could have extremely high accuracy.""**[13] The American Psychological Association states that **""most psychologists agree that there is little evidence that polygraph tests can accurately detect lies.""**[5]"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Lori and Charles asked him to say that
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,He definitely did seem weird in the documentary. He didn’t really ever cry and when he did it looked fake/forced. Seeing that he raped his wife confirms my suspicions.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Very few if any
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I wonder if the LDS will hire the best attorney to put all the blame on Lori and Chad will NEVER be sentenced, to ""clean"" the LDS reputation...."

SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Yea he became a born again Christian while in prison, but was raised Jewish, adopted I believe. 

Also Joel rifkin…. Who weirdly enough was also adopted and raised by a Jewish family"
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Well gee, thanks for that."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"Personal editorial aside, judging by the trailer, a certain church will soon be looking back with nostalgia and fondness for that wonderful brief period when Andrew Garfield was the face of Mormonism."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Small but active sub with some serious true crime aficionados closely following this case:  r/LoriVallow
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Looking forward to this. Girl in the Picture was excellent
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"I read about this murder, and I don't subscribe to Netflix, because this type of ""murder-tragedy porn"" makes me shake my head in disgust. And the the trailer basically tells the whole story anyhow."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,"She’s an insane person whose beliefs don’t align with the religion. It really isn’t fair to claim she in any way represents the church, much less being the face of the religion."
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,IS everyone stupid?? and doesnt have any idea what a tragedy this is?..Let's face it ..LDS is the most archaic ridiculous religion on the earth with absolutely no basis to their beliefs..Who in their right mind would follow that absolute crap..this documentary is proof..it has been documented so many times how crazy these people are.. only someone weak would be a follower..smell the roses people and it stinks..proof positive by this series
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,Story isn’t over either.  Neither she nor her husband have been tried yet.
SanPa: Sins of the Savior,">Probably an unpopular opinion, but religion played a major role in her not getting help. Her hearing voices, talking to ""angels"", getting personal commands from ""God"" were all major red flags, but most people around her were not alarmed because they had been conditioned to believe ridiculous things.

Wut?"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,What an unbelievably shit article 😂
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,How much is HBO paying Reddit to post this garbage over and over?
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"That's hardly ""making history"" to be the most watched show on a service that's only been around for a very short time, and only in one market.

Making history would be the most watched premiere on say, all streaming services ever, globally."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I copy pasted the article into ChatGPT and told it to make it coherent and [it did an infinitely better job](https://i.imgur.com/wuhHPUe.jpg):

>HBO continues to uphold its reputation for producing high-quality, award-winning series with its latest major production, ""The Last of Us."" Based on the popular video game of the same name, the apocalyptic drama premiered its first episode on Sunday, maintaining the weekly launch dynamic that has worked well for the channel and studio in the past.
>
>The series, which was created by Craig Mazin, the creator of ""Chernobyl,"" and Neil Druckmann, the creator of the acclaimed video game, has already made a significant impact. The premiere episode, titled ""When You're Lost in the Dark,"" became the most viewed premiere in HBO Max history in Latin America within its first 24 hours of availability. This achievement beat out two other strong performers: the first day of the debut episode of ""Game of Thrones"" and the second season premiere of ""Euphoria.""
>
>""The Last of Us"" takes place twenty years after modern civilization is destroyed by the spread of a virus. The story follows Joel (Peter Pascal), a seasoned survivor, who is hired to smuggle 14-year-old Ellie (Bella Ramsey) out of an oppressive quarantine zone. However, what starts out as a small job quickly becomes a brutal and harrowing journey as the two must rely on each other to survive as they travel across the United States. The series is not just appealing to fans of the video game, but also to a wider audience.
>
>The series has also been a hit on social media, trending as #1 worldwide on Twitter on the night of its premiere. Brazil was the market with the most conversations about the series on social networks worldwide, accounting for over 50% of those mentions and dominating fifteen of the thirty top hashtags in the country during Sunday night.
>
>With a production budget of about one hundred million dollars, ""The Last of Us"" is expected to continue to dominate conversations every week with each new episode. In addition, the series also boasts an Argentinean presence with Gustavo Santaolalla, the Oscar winner for ""Babel"" and ""The Secret in the Mountains,"" as the creator of the music for the series. Santaolalla had already created the songs for the video game and knew well the world his music was to have.
>
>In addition to Pascal and Bella Ramsey, the cast of ""The Last of Us"" also includes Gabriel Luna, Anna Torv, Nico Parker, Murray Bartlett, Nick Offerman, Melanie Lynskey, Storm Reid, and Merle Dandridge, among others. The series premiered its second episode on Sunday, January 22nd at 11pm on HBO Max and HBO.

BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"**'The Last of Us' Casting Process**

> Gabriel Luna: **Well, casting for The Last of Us ended up being a pretty rapid process. They had some interest, and my team called over and asked if I was interested. And, of course, I was.** It’s a wonderful project with great people involved. **Shortly after they mentioned they were interested, I started playing the first game just to have a sense of the story and to get a handle on the character.** My approach is to always prepare as if you have the job, in the event that you might get it.


> Gabriel Luna: **And then they asked if I’d be willing to throw something down for them, so I made a tape with one scene from the game and one scene from the first episode.** And shortly after that, Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann and Carolyn Strauss wanted to talk. So, all in all, it was a six-day process from the time they were interested to the time they offered me the role. 


**Playing Tommy**

> Gabriel Luna: **I felt it was important to play through it and get a true sense of what Jeffrey Pierce had done with Tommy’s voice and performance capture in the games. So as I played through it and familiarized myself with Tommy, it became more and more evident that we were in the same channel, energy wise, historically and culturally.** There were a lot of similarities there. After Craig and Neil watched my tape, they told me that they saw the soul of Tommy, and I started to understand what they were saying as I was being introduced to Tommy. That said, knowing the place where he was born and raised, it felt pretty natural to play him.



> Gabriel Luna: **What’s interesting is we talk about him like he’s a real person. Having been created 10 years ago, he has a history with the fans and a place in the gaming space, character wise. So you approach it somewhat like a biopic about a person that exists in life.** I tried to absorb what I believed to be important and what the gamers are going to hope for in a true translation of the game."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Personally I would love if the show filled in some of the bad stuff that Joel and Tommy had to do to survive the intervening twenty years.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America," “Having been created 10 years ago, \[Tommy\] has a history with the fans and a place in the gaming space, character wise.""

I haven't even seen this yet but if this is the attitude he takes, it is no wonder people are saying it is a hit."

BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Haven't seen him in anything else before, but man he killed it as Tommy."

BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"""So you approach it somewhat like a biopic about a person that exists in life.""


Great way to look at it.  You then end up with a character that has been proven to work within the intended universe.  Not a reinterpretation that seems to be struggling within it's own reality."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,I'm glad he played the game before even being cast. He showed initiative and was willing to go straight to the source material to better inform himself
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,I didn't realize that was him. Nice!
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Is he related to Diego luna?
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Come on Kevin. Give this man his own Ghost Rider show.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Without spoiling anything. I’m excited to see how he approaches Tommy becoming more ruthless later in the story.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"""Y'all got any towels or anything?"""
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Seems like everyone really did their hw for this show. That is really nice for the fans of the game.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I really thought this should have been two separate episodes.  It seemed like everyone disagreed with it me, but then I listened to the official podcast and Craig Maizin literally talks about how this should have been two episodes."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,[removed]
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Oh yeah. He was the Ghost Rider.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Forever sad his Ghost Rider show got cancelled :c
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,He was a pretty good Terminator in Dark Fate also.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,He was great as an undercover DEA agent in the 2014 action series 'Matador'.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"His voice is spot on for Tommy, though it seems like he's going to have a more youthful take on the character. A little early to tell after just one episode, but I'm really pleased with all the casting."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Man, >!Tommy was fucking terrifying in the game. That section when he starts sniping dudes to try to get to Abby was fucking insane. He's so nice usually, so seeing that was messed up!<"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"TLOU2 has to be the most consistently spoiler-tagged piece of media I’ve seen on Reddit. Even when some people are ragging on it hard, they tag the spoilers or refer to events vaguely.

I haven’t played it yet, so it’s very much appreciated."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,When they get there my big hope is that >!they'll tell the sniper section from his point of view.!<
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,[removed]
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"He sounds exactly like Jeffery Pierce (the guy who played Tommy in the games) in the show. I swear, I thought he was dubbing him due to how similar they sound."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Seeing where Tommy >!ends up in TLOU2 !< will give Gabriel so much to bite on in terms of character growth and range as the seasons progress.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"That’s what’s so exciting for me as a fan of the game; it genuinely seems to be the attitude of the whole cast and crew, and it absolutely leaked through in that first episode. The attention to detail and character work, along with the extra depth added, were all absolutely on point."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I'm a *big* fan of both of the games for their ability to move me and make me think and feel things. Even if I didn't want to think or feel them. Even if I disagreed with them. I still appreciated the games for what they were. A powerful and moving story full of flawed, hurt, and scared people.

I was certain that the show wasn't going to do TLoU justice, and that it wouldn't hit the same notes as the game did.

I was wrong. It's *the* *best* adaptation I've yet to experience. Shit, the first episode is pretty much a frame for frame, and both Pascal's reserved gruff demeanour, and Luna's laconic delivery are almost perfect depictions of Joel and Tommy. And Ramsey as Ellie is amazing. Ashley Johnson did a fantastic job bringing Ellie to life and giving her depth in the games, but Bella Ramsey has captured Ellie so well I now have a hard time visualising the original depiction in my head.

Now, I know it's early days yet and we only have the first episode, but I can't help get the feeling that every single person working on this show respects the source material for what it is, and not what packaging it came in originally. And it shows.

I'm no longer hesitantly excited for this. I'm just plain excited. For those of you that don't know The Last of Us story, please, for your own sake, go in blind.

And mind that 35 minute mark. It a doozy."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"He was already a fan of the game by the time he started working on the project, as was the showrunner Craig Mazin. So I guess just like Henry Cavill he basically imitated the voice of the character as closely as he could.

By contrast, Bella Ramsay was apparently told not to play the game so it didn't inform her performance too much, but from the little that I've seen from the game she embodies Ellie perfectly in voice and attitude alone so I'm thinking she didn't listen to them and at least watched extensive cutscenes lol"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"They announced at one point he was getting his own Ghost Rider show, but I haven't heard about that in a while and I assume it's dead. 

But it would be dope to have him show up in the next Doctor Strange, or maybe Blade, even if just in the after-credits to tease a Midnight Suns something-or-other.  Get Ghost Rider, Blade, Dr. Strange, maybe Elsa Bloodstone, Jack Russel, and Ted to round out the lineup."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Yes, amazingly so, in the games Tommy behaves in a way that screams ex-military without it ever being confirmed I believe. Luna’s performance has that same way of carrying himself and they put in the sticker on his truck to confirm that detail and flesh him out. Combined with the voice being almost pitch perfect Gabriel Luna is absolutely representing and embodying the role"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,His voice is so spot on. It’s almost uncanny how accurate it is.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"He absolutely is an accurate representation of the games. As are all of the cast so far, I don’t wanna spoil anything but I’m looking forward to the way they develop him in future episodes."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"We see a bit less of Tommy in the start of the game compared to the show, but definitely an excellent representation of the character. I loved getting a few more scenes with him, which provided a lot more context about his character, his relationship with Joel, and the events that lead to them meeting up the night of the outbreak to try to escape the city together. Really fantastic performance by Gabriel Luna too, IMO."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"He is *by far* the closest to the games of the show cast. Voice, mannerisms, and body language is just spot on."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"He's pretty perfect as Tommy. 

Looks absolutely nothing like Tommy, but once they cast Pedro Pascal they had to cast someone who could be seen as Pedro's brother. 

He does sound exactly like Tommy, though.  Both Pedro and Gabriel grew up in Texas, so I guess it's not surprising that they know how to sound Texan."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Other than changing the characters from White to Latino, Tommy and his brother Joel from the show are pretty much identical to their video game counterparts. 

How Show Tommy has acted and behaved is very similar to how Video Game Tommy acted and behaved up to that point in the story."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Physically, no, but I didn’t care about that bc Pedro and Bella don’t really resemble Joel and Ellie anyway. However he’s definitely nailed his voice, cadence and general demeanor."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I don't want to be mean but Tommy in the first game is kind of a nothing character, the show is already handling him inherently better lol. No sane person would  have intense sentimental value over his OG role"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"So far, yes. But we don't really see a lot of Tommy in the beginning of the game so we have to see how he looks in later parts of the season"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Surprisingly, they aren't. They do look alike, besides the skin color. Their head shape and their eyes sort of look similar."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Most badass character in the MCU besides Punisher imo
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,It’s messed up that we’ve had two ghost riders in the last twelve years or so and neither of them are confirmed to be a part of the MCU
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Definitely, *Dark Fate* unfortunately wasn't as good as I had hoped it would have been, but it wasn't due to him, he was great."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Is that show any good? The ratings are pretty terrible
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,On god I didn't >!catch on that it was Tommy until they either showed him or outright said it and I flipped my shit.!< God that game is so good moment to moment.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I hope in the show they show the transition more, it seemed pretty sudden in the game."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,I'd try to play it before watching the show. The reason it's so controversial is almost entirely due to how viscerally you experience the game.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"It's a great game in my opinion. Very realistic, gritty combat and a fairly risky style of storytelling. 100% worth your time to play it when you get around to it"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,">!I think that section works much better not knowing it’s him until after it’s basically over. Having to go through what is a pretty grueling and terrifying section only for it to be revealed that a character the player likes is entirely responsible takes that section to the next level!<

>!That along with the Ellie fight are my favorite parts of the game due to how effective they are at role reversal. Being on the other side of what you’ve been directly doing to people for the entire game makes you realize how fucking terrifying the “good” guys actually are!<"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I feel like when adapting the second game they could do a lot more with Tommy. I liked his arc in the second game, but there’s still a lot that I want to see during that timeframe, especially if Gabriel Luna is playing him. 

It seems that the first season is having Tommy play a somewhat more important role, but time will tell if they continue with that."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"IMO you've nailed it when you say its about the attitude of the people working on the project. When they see the IP and their main thought is to give it justice instead of trying to make it better or even worse, rewriting it."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,It definitely helps the creator/writer of the game is the co-showrunner and even writes and directs a few episodes.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I keep hearing about this show, but I've never heard of the game until now. Is this still worth watching as someone unfamiliar with the game?"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"So I finished it last night. It was ok. From the perspective of someone who knows nothing about the game, it was a little boring but the acting kept me in. Whether or not it will continue to, is tbd."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,They cancelled his ghost rider show. And thankfully- it wasn’t Kevin feige produced so it woulda been in the same limbo as lots of those other pre Disney plus marvel shows
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,That show was a casualty of the transition from Marvel Television to Marvel Studios. I think they will be bringing him back eventually though.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Was Joel ex-military too? That would explain his ridiculous skills.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Yeah, I actually had to look up if they just cast the voice actor.

Which they actually did do for Marlene, interestingly."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Yeah, it really had me questioning whether he was the game's voice actor. I *knew* that he wasn't, but it had me doubting myself how close the voice was."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Gabriel was even born and raised in Austin where the 2003 scenes are set.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Yeah. And Pascal doesn’t really look anything like Joel. But if they nail the essence of the characters, I don’t really care"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"The movie ended up being kinda ass, but he was a pretty badass Terminator too, I thought."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,He was awesome.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"You must be a fan of Cosmic Ghostrider, then."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,I thought everyone was good in Dark Fate with the exception of the lead actress that was essentially the new John Connor.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"It was a fun action series, a good mix of spy action & soccer team drama that didn’t take itself too seriously. Both Gabriel Luna & Alfred Molina were great. 

Unfortunately, the show aired on El Rey network & it didn’t get the necessary public exposure. The weird thing that the show was originally renewed for a second season, but couple weeks later, El Rey network ""unrenewed"" it."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I'm curious if they'll split TLOU2 into 2 seasons, and flesh out each half of the game. >!I feel like the show would benefit tremendously from spending more time with each of the cast, so we see more of Jackson and WLF. I would move the golf incident to halfway through the season after audiences have a chance to bond with the new characters, and tell Days 1-3 chronologically instead of the convoluted narrative they settled on. The back half of TLOU2 deserves *so* much more depth than what we got in the game.!<"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"""Listen. I didn't take 3 years of college to write someone ELSEs story. I know I've been given this IP, but I'm going to rewrite it to my own. I also don't understand the original story in the first place, in fact I hate it, so I'm going to write it in a completely different direction than what made it popular in the first place. Oh, and remember that cool character you liked? He's a bumbling idiot now. I thought it would be funny"" - way too many live action adaptions"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Yeah definitely; the show basically adapts the events of the game and adds extra scenes for detail, so you don’t have to be a fan of the game or anything to get what’s going on, the show sets up everything on its own and can very much be watched as it’s own thing"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I said this to another commenter the other day; people who have played the game can see the first episode is sticking to the source material and so are mega hyped from it, but from an objective viewpoint, I think the second half of the episode is a little boring for a first time viewer. A lot of worldbuilding and set up. 

For me the events in the game that correspond to the second half of this episode are by far the most boring part of the whole game; it’s basically the tutorial. The main focus of the whole thing is the dynamic between Joel and Ellie and the situations they’re forced into, and they’ve only just met, the real story’s barely begun.

Although I must say, I think they nailed the tension in the pre-infection scenes, I loved the way they done that. If the show continues to adapt the way they have so far, basically everything from here on out will keep topping itself."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Oh yeah it was also for Hulu, it might have been as lame as the Hellstrom series they did over there."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"I don’t believe he was. He had Sarah when he was around 16 or so, and the mom was never really in the picture since they have virtually no pictures of her in the house."
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Marlene's actress was an actress before getting cast in the game, so easy transition. Plus, as she put it, aged into her role"
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,When Tommy was on the phone from jail he sounded so much like the game's VA.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Tommy's actor is in the show. Obviously not as Tommy though
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,I'm talking about the Agents of Shield Ghost Rider.
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,Hell yeah
BREAK IT ALL: The History of Rock in Latin America,"Same. Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna were fantastic but (and I can't even remember the actor or character's name any more) the new John Connor character wasn't great, and the actress couldn't do anything to elevate the material."

The Mess You Leave Behind,He was good as the police chief in season 1 of 'Fargo' as well.
The Mess You Leave Behind,Taking an actor mostly known for absurd sketch comedy and making him the comic relief in a serious drama was ballsy but then taking that character and making him the *main character* in another serious drama was insane. The fact that it all worked out *and* was some of the best television there ever was... That has to be unheard of.
The Mess You Leave Behind,Triples of the barracuda was his role of a lifetime.
The Mess You Leave Behind,One of the greatest TV performances of all time.
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Odenkirk:

>“I know that was probably the role of my lifetime, and that’s a wonderful thing to have had. Some people don’t get that. I will be wallowing the rest of my life.”  

  
>“I would not have predicted it,” admits Odenkirk of where the show ended up. “I would have predicted an ending with more explosions. I’m so glad there weren’t. And yet the weird thing about it to me is that it really came from relaxing your grip on the characters. One of the struggles I had, and Rhea had this too, is that the characters were very emotionally intelligent about almost everybody they interacted with, and yet had these blind spots regarding their own behavior. And in the end the writers granted these characters the self-knowledge that I felt they always had. I thought it was beautiful. When I read it, I was like, ‘Yes, exactly, that’s what should happen.’”

Seehorn:

>“To have Kim leave Jimmy behind in a place that feels so punishing, so isolating, scary and sad was really, really hard. I hadn’t realized the way Bob-as-Jimmy was going to look at me, and it was so arresting. To me, it was so much about him letting her know, ‘I’m okay, the best of me that you always saw is alive and well,’ and I think she’s trying to let him know, ‘I see that.’ She still loves him. I always felt that was key. The entire series, these two people had all sorts of different masks they wear out in the world, and they only truly felt seen by each other. That’s what that last moment felt like to me.”"
The Mess You Leave Behind,"My wife and I are rewatching Breaking Bad. We watched the season 2 episode where Saul makes his debut (Better Call Saul, appropriately). 

I don’t think there’s a better written character in the TV universe. From the very start he’s flawed, yet sticks to his convictions. The writers did such an amazing job combing two stories into one arc nearly a decade apart that we were absolutely floored by it. Ignacio (Nacho) and Lalo are both mentioned out in the desert, yet never appear and I remember feeling at the time that Saul wouldn’t be in more than an episode or two as a side to Badger getting arrested. Yet here we are. 

If you haven’t rewatched Breaking Bad after watching BCS, you should. You won’t have the shock value of the first time, and you won’t have rose colored glasses about Walt but damn, what a well told story."
The Mess You Leave Behind,"It's gonna be realy fucking hard to find 2 shows in the same universe at the level of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, they're really special."
The Mess You Leave Behind,Seconded only by his work on the [Drugachusetts episode](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FHqcNj0Pv6c) of Mr. Show!
The Mess You Leave Behind,"He’s not likely to be wrong. 

I mean, he’s had great parts before, and he’s still getting them - he was great in Fargo. 

But Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul is very likely what he’ll be remembered for. It’s some of the best television drama that has ever been made, and as others have noted, it is filled with great performances that enhanced each other - the portrait of Jimmy’s relationship with his brother was next level, and *so* was the portrait of his relationship with Kim. What are the odds of three great performances in the same show? And they aren’t the only ones. 

While of course this isn’t the end of his career, and I sincerely hope he stars in other shows even better, the odds are against him getting another show that can top these. I’d be very happy if this proves dead wrong!"
The Mess You Leave Behind,And he has triples of the cuda
The Mess You Leave Behind,He’s got triples of the nova…triples of the barracuda….
The Mess You Leave Behind,I mean he literally almost died while doing it
The Mess You Leave Behind,[deleted]
The Mess You Leave Behind,I can’t believe the other guy from Mr Show ended up with the career he ended up with. I fuckin’ love Bob Odenkirk.
The Mess You Leave Behind,He was Saul Goodman for over a decade. I'd imagine it would have a huge impact on him.
The Mess You Leave Behind,"But, but…Mr Show?"
The Mess You Leave Behind,"From what I've seen? 

99% of actors, this would've been the role of their lifetime."
The Mess You Leave Behind,"I disagree.  Odenkirk's role of a lifetime was Gil in Curb Your Enthusiasm.  He was a porn star living in the ""House That Cum Built""."
The Mess You Leave Behind,No probably about it.
The Mess You Leave Behind,Senator Tankerbell has something to say about this
The Mess You Leave Behind,"I don’t know who bob is, I know who Gene and Saul were."
The Mess You Leave Behind,"You did it Bob, and that Nova deal went through."
The Mess You Leave Behind,He’ll always be Nobody
The Mess You Leave Behind,only because he hasn’t played Kevin Costner yet
The Mess You Leave Behind,"What I love about Better Call Saul is that it takes what was my favourite show ever, Breaking Bad, matches it beyond all expectations or hopes, and consequently makes Breaking Bad even better by being both a prequel, a companion piece, and a bookend. By the end they benefit from each other in a way I've never seen television do before, and may not again. 

I can't separate them as 'this one is better than that one' because they're just so exceptionally good together that the entire Breaking Bad Universe, including El Camino, is probably gonna be the best thing I got to experience from the very first airing through right to the very end."
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Y’all got fake poop?
-Mr. Show with Bob and David
The real role of a lifetime"
The Mess You Leave Behind,That or the weird car guy from that one Tim Robinson sketch.
The Mess You Leave Behind,[not. even. close.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NjDelKobC-s)
The Mess You Leave Behind,Go landcrabs!
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Idk man, I personally like his role as “Concert Nerd” in Wayne’s World just a lil bit more🤷‍♂️ /s"
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Followed closely by the “triples is safe, triples is best” guy"
The Mess You Leave Behind,He once played a salesman who sold topical cream that gives you diarrhea so you can get out of business meetings. That was a pretty solid role too.
The Mess You Leave Behind,Final season on Netflix when? Sad it’s still not on there.
The Mess You Leave Behind,What about his role as Porno Gil? His work afforded him the “house that jizz built”.
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Maybe but I still wanna see more from him. ""Nobody"" was pretty decent."
The Mess You Leave Behind,"literally the role of his lifetime. gave his career best and lived to tell the tale. 

so glad this man is here"
The Mess You Leave Behind,"I was an avid watcher of both series, and I feel BCS was better than BB, and that's saying a lot. Saul Goodman (a.k.a. Jimmy McGill) has to be my all-time favorite character in any series. I can imagine Jimmy getting paroled in about 10 years, moving to Florida and opening a Bakery with Kim at his side. Sorta like ""Bob's Burgers"" without the kids."
The Mess You Leave Behind,[deleted]
The Mess You Leave Behind,Don’t put his picture in black and white ever again my heart stopped there
The Mess You Leave Behind,Its not too late to call the studio and ask to keep doing it
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Loved him in the office still, it was more if a Saul Goodman vibe (breaking bad era)"
The Mess You Leave Behind,Anyone have advice on streaming the final two seasons of BCS?
The Mess You Leave Behind,Probably??
The Mess You Leave Behind,I understand the main players here (I would say Odenkirk and Peter Gould) feel obliged to move on and that the end of the series ties a nice ribbon....BUT I think there is reasonable potential for Jimmy's story to continue as a jailhouse lawyer.
The Mess You Leave Behind,That was DEFINITELY the role of his lifetime
The Mess You Leave Behind,3 of the 4 main actors from Breaking Bad got early exposure on Seinfeld…that show launched so many careers and thank god for that! Cranston’s character was hilarious…gimmie a Stickel of fluoride lol
The Mess You Leave Behind,Ya think?
The Mess You Leave Behind,"I think so, it was just so goddamned perfect"
The Mess You Leave Behind,"He's right, but part of me will always think of him as Charles Manson from the Ben Stiller Show. 

He was the ghost of a phantom in the hearts of our children."
The Mess You Leave Behind,It was the show of a lifetime.
The Mess You Leave Behind,Was an okay show.
The Mess You Leave Behind,*When I became an actor I always knew I would dump the last role I was in and find something better. That’s the dream of having the role of my lifetime.*
The Mess You Leave Behind,I just listened to his book. It’s good.
The Mess You Leave Behind,We were hooked on the show!
The Mess You Leave Behind,How's Okie Dokie Bob?
The Mess You Leave Behind,“Probably”?
The Mess You Leave Behind,"After seeing Nobody, I’d have to agree."
The Mess You Leave Behind,Okay but I wouldn’t mind a movie about Saul or Mike
The Mess You Leave Behind,"No, Bob, “[Manson](https://youtu.be/Z5IrRe2F7qY)” was the role of your lifetime and this pales by comparison 😂"
The Mess You Leave Behind,He put a killer streak of comedy into a bleak masterpiece.
The Mess You Leave Behind,I think it’s cool that he understands and admits this is his career role and that he’s appreciated it every tough step of the way
The Mess You Leave Behind,"To be fair, he kills it in every role he plays"
The Mess You Leave Behind,"I never gave this show a real chance. 

The ending to breaking bad was perfect and I just felt a sense of completeness, like I was done with the characters. I was mad that they announced the spin-off and thought they were just going to milk the franchise. So I just could not really get into this and didn't give it the chance it deserves."
The Mess You Leave Behind,Fellow Saluki right there!
The Mess You Leave Behind,I still think about this show and I finished it several weeks ago.  I'm really interested in whatever Vince Gilligan is doing with Rhea Seahorn next.
The Mess You Leave Behind,"He's had two roles I've really loved.

Triples would be best.

Doubles are good though"
The Mess You Leave Behind,That’s what showed me his genius for sure.
The Mess You Leave Behind,He has triples of the Barracuda
The Mess You Leave Behind,thats sad
The Mess You Leave Behind,Mr. Show has entered the chat
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Perfectly cast and a show to rival Breaking Bad. Well done, Bob."
The Mess You Leave Behind,His best role was Wizzard. Totally Wizzed out hitting the low G.
The Mess You Leave Behind,But was it a better role than Terry Twillstein??
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Magnificently fantastic. I hate that I watched it and I want to see it again, but with fresh eyes 👀♥️♥️♥️"
The Mess You Leave Behind,Mr. Show has entered the chat
The Mess You Leave Behind, rubbish article. its a quote or two from the lead actors. months after the show ended. jesus christ what a waste of time
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Don’t worry Bob, it was probably the role of our lifetimes as well"
The Mess You Leave Behind,BCS is in my opinion the closest a spinoff has ever come to surpassing the source material and I frequently say BrBa changed the face of dramatic TV as we know it. The bar was unbelievably high but BCS cleared it and then some. It wouldn't have been the same without all the wonderful people who worked on it both on and off camera. Cheers to a job well done
The Mess You Leave Behind,"What a high quality production that was, in all ways."
The Mess You Leave Behind,Probably….
The Mess You Leave Behind,He got doubles of Saul though.
The Mess You Leave Behind,"He says that as his insane ass workout for Nobody helped out against his heart attack.

Man needs to give himself more credit than Saul, he's great!"
The Mess You Leave Behind,I’d love to see him do sketch comedy again.
The Mess You Leave Behind,He had a million different great roles on Mr. Show
The Mess You Leave Behind,Probably? Absolutely was.
The Mess You Leave Behind,"Just like virtually every actor from Breaking bad, he was phenomenal in his role."
The Mess You Leave Behind,"For sure, but Henchmen #5 in the McGruber Tv show must be a close contender! ^/jk"
The Mess You Leave Behind,”Probably”?! What’s he on about??
The Mess You Leave Behind,Better Call Saul was okay.  Some of it was very boring.  I was happy when it ended.
The Mess You Leave Behind,What an actor and what a tv series ! Better call saul is probably the best tv show I've seen in years
The Mess You Leave Behind,My shoes hurt too
The Mess You Leave Behind,That is so sad… I loved Saul !
The Mess You Leave Behind,Lifetime of residuals I imagine.
The Mess You Leave Behind,[“Does anyone remember the Foghat rule? You’re fourth album should be DOUBLE LIVE!”](https://youtu.be/h7SdOtXI5R8)
The Mess You Leave Behind, /UC why is everyone being so serious without putting /UC tags?
The Mess You Leave Behind,"
I only know him from HIMYM"
The Mess You Leave Behind,“Probably”? That’s confidence.
The Mess You Leave Behind,Wait no more better call Saul?

Alice in Borderland,"Might be cause Squid game feels more real in a way. In Alice in Borderland the games are really over the top while in Squid game it's ""If you lose at this children's game I will shoot you in the head"". Idk though. That's just something I thought of a bit ago"
Alice in Borderland,"I think because most of the characters in Squid Game were adults. My 60 year old mother loved Squid Game. AIB, she would most likely think was a teen series."
Alice in Borderland,"It was hard to relate to the characters in Alice in Borderland. It was still enjoyable, but as a 30 year old with debt and having made some very stupid financial decisions myself, it was much easier to see myself in the squid game characters. I really liked the escapism of AiB, and it felt similar to a good sci-fi book, but Squid game felt so much more real to me, as if it were actually happening in our world of elite wealth and extreme debt."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid game is ""closer"" to reality & plays on social themes"
Alice in Borderland,I personally enjoy Alice in borderline more than squid game.
Alice in Borderland,"It's how far the slider is moved between fantasy and reality.

Alice in Borderland is a great action fantasy with larger than life characters dropped in the middle of a game against their will and they have to use their wits to survive against some unknown, perhaps otherworldly foe.

Squid Game starts off the first episode with everyone choosing to participate, because the realities of life  have crippled them financially in a variety of real world scenarios, starring characters old enough to have those financial troubles be believable, and performing for rich people's entertainment.

Alice in Borderland is a well executed fantasy adventure. Spotting literary in names and character concepts to Alice in Wonderland is fun. 

Squid Game part a commentary on today's world dressed in story, using real world childhood games that many of us have played as the inspiration for the games of death.

I like both, but Alice in Borderland is something I've seen numerous times. Giving everyone an opportunity to leave and most choose to comeback meant I had to throw out my expectations and was seeing something different.

Edit: Costume and set design and color scheme is also quite memorable while also being simple enough to easily replicate."
Alice in Borderland,Squid Game is social commentary and people see themselves in the allegorical death games of debt and capitalism.
Alice in Borderland,"Alice is way more anime like, with cringy dialog and characters and dragged out deathscenes, especially in season 2. However I still enjoyed it more, but I think squid game fits the general public better, better characters and dialog. That’s what I think."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid game is more relatable since it is a an allegory to the detriments of late capitalism. 


Alice in borderland has a powerful message but you don't get to know what it is till the literal last chapter of the manga, nothing makes sense till then. Highly recommend it tho."
Alice in Borderland,"I enjoy Alice in Borderland a lot, but I find it to be too anime at times. Like the guy who always has his hands in his pockets and posing in a circle and all that stuff. I can see why it wouldn't be as popular as squid games, along with what the others have said about the characters."
Alice in Borderland,"The games were far better and scarier in Alice in Borderland, but the characters were much better in Squid Game. Squid game also has a catchier name and A+ visual branding that made you want to watch it just from seeing the banner in Netflix. But I liked them both"
Alice in Borderland,"I think Alice in borderland is the best manga in the survival game genre, but the tv show suffer the same thing all Japanese drama had, very dramatic and over the top acting, plus the major thing is they don’t have as much money to put in marketing and  visual."
Alice in Borderland,"I started Alice in Borderland and Squid Game around the same time and dropped Alice because I really didn’t feel like watching the complicated games where  the main character had to monologue the puzzles and solutions to the audience. Where SG was about children’s games I was either already familiar with or were easy to understand the rules of. 

I also didn’t like the characters in Alice as much especially the main character. 

Squid Game is also just fun to look at. It has an eye catching color palette, unique set design that incorporates childhood whimsy, satisfying cinematography. AiB just didn’t catch me in those regards."
Alice in Borderland,"Feel like the difference between squid game and Alice is the difference between hunger games and divergent.


Alice just has a discounted feel to it in characters, dialogue, and pace. It's choppy and the characters don't seem to draw you into it. There's an unnecessary over the top feel which could be reigned in and made better by focus on individual aspects rather than broad stroke action sequences."
Alice in Borderland,"The magic of Squid Game is encapsulated in episode 2. Every character is given a chance to walk away and they all choose to return. Watching why gives the characters actual weight and raises the stakes all that much more.

AiB is just a show about people escaping puzzles. At least for 3 episodes, i turned it off after that"
Alice in Borderland,"I have watched the first 10 minutes and the tone is completely different. So far it’s a bit happy and out of touch with reality. 

Anime in most cases does not transfer well to live action."
Alice in Borderland,The dialogue in Alice is pretty terrible.
Alice in Borderland,Alice in borderlands is a lot more edgy/cringey. Still good but yeah.
Alice in Borderland,Mainstream appeal. Squid Game is a regular survival thriller with a mostly adult cast. Alice in Borderland is a sci-fi show with a mostly YA cast and a higher focus on horny sex appeal. All that makes Alice in Borderland more niche and Squid Game more mainstream by comparison.
Alice in Borderland," these 2 are not even close in execution, borderland is fun but so shallow it hurts."
Alice in Borderland,I can't agree on anything you've said. Obviously it's all subjective but beyond what you've mentioned I also thought Alice looked cheap and dull where Squid Game is colorful and shot well.
Alice in Borderland,"I mean is it not fucking obvious? Squid Game has 10x better marketing and key visuals. Those key visuals have better costume design and better set design, which makes them more memorable from a trailer viewing. Then the people who watched found better characters, writing, and performances. So they tell their friends, screencap on social media, cosplay, etc. On top of that Alice has a corny name and is far too anime for your average viewer."
Alice in Borderland,Never even heard of Alice squid game was impossible not to hear about
Alice in Borderland,Because it's Genuinely not as good as squid game. The characters are better in squid game and so is the writing. Alice is too anime and the characters don't feel fully fleshed out like in squid game. I love the games in Alice though.
Alice in Borderland,"I was recommended Alice in Borderlands because of Squid Game. The two aren't at all related. AiB seems to have the premise of some guy who isn't good at anything but video games being put into a situation where, coincidentally, his skill at video games is really important. Not a premise I really give a shit about."
Alice in Borderland,"I think it is because Netflix hasn't  pushed it as much as Squid Game. I have not seen nearly a tenth of the push for Alice on their page that Squid Game got. 

When I recommend the show to my friends they have never heard of it and compare it to Squid Game. It's frustrating because in some ways Alice is a better show."
Alice in Borderland,"Because the anime tropes are so apparent, it’s unbelievable."
Alice in Borderland,"The game is too complex. It distracts from the more important element, the human emotion. 

Squid Game’s game is practically children’s game with very simple rule. The “strategy” in squid game is just a made-up plot device that you don’t have to think too much if it will actually work. 

AiBL made the game too complicate, it overloads the audience."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid Game has fantastic performances.. all of the actors were just fucking captivating.

Alice In Borderland.. oh the main guy's so brilliant he just blurts out the solutions to each trap they find themselves in. I'm supposed to be ""OH HE'S SO SMART"" but it's like Sherlock where the main character solves puzzles the audience doesn't have the information for making it feel like a writer is just stroking themselves"
Alice in Borderland,"I loved Squid Game, but saw one episode of AIB...

* Part of the fun of Squid Game was thinking about how you would play the games if you were in them. They were simple and you can imagine how you could beat them. Meanwhile, the challenges in AIB are convoluted and require genius intellect to beat (deducing the measurements of the rooms by previously seeing the outside of the building...come on, that's impossible)
* Might get some heat for this, but Alice in Borderland felt a bit like a live action anime. The trope of genius gamer who can solve impossible puzzles made my eyes roll. The mysterious girl standing heroically with the backdrop of the city skyline and the epic music...that's an anime. Squid Game felt like a drama and more real."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid game was better shot, directed, acted and produced compared to Alice in borderland. 

I loved the [manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/33031/Imawa_no_Kuni_no_Alice), and many people do. Which may explain why you might like this one more than the squid game. Also Aso Haro's story/plot is probably better."
Alice in Borderland,"Honestly Squid Game is a much deeper show with genuine society critique. Not to mention that acting is far better. And this comes from me as westerner that neither speaks Korean or has any connection with their culture.

Alice in Borderlands , is really fun gonzo Manga adaptation. Nothing bad about it. But its simply not in same league.

By the way, talking about Manga adaptations , you should see Rourin Kenshin. Now that is a genuinely good one."
Alice in Borderland,Alice in Borderland is a great show
Alice in Borderland,"Considering this is the first time I've heard of this show, that might be your answer.... marketing."
Alice in Borderland,"Probably shitty marketing cause I literally thought you were shitposting and didn't know there was a show called ""Alice in Borderland."""
Alice in Borderland,"I like Alice in Borderlands just fine but it just isn't as good as Squid Game, not even close. The characters aren't as compelling, the direction is heavy-handed (there are a lot of slow-developing scenes of the characters realizing they have to keep going that are just plain unnecessary), the stakes don't seem as big as there are many games where you really don't fear the main characters dying, and there isn't as clear of an allegory to real-world issues."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid Games is more realistic, has relatable social subtext, is shot in a way that feels more cinematic, and the writing doesn’t have any overdone anime tropes. I like both but it’s not surprising that Squid Games is more popular."
Alice in Borderland,One is written for Younf Adults while the other is a commentary on modern day capitalism.
Alice in Borderland,"As someone who enjoyed AIB much much more, I gotta say Squid Game feels more relatable because of its themes regarding family, classism, etc. hence having a broader appeal. AIB is pretty much a live-action anime with its anime tropes, which turns off people who are not into the genre. Anyone can easily understand Squid Game.

Characters in AIB are teens/20s and a lot of older adults prefer watching protagonists in their age range (Squid Game). Squid Game had visual and auditory elements that were **made** for marketing (the pink outfits, the giant robot, the tracksuits, the theme instrumentals)."
Alice in Borderland,"They are both good but as others have mentioned, check out Kaiji. It is an anime with thinky death games (or fates as bad as death)."
Alice in Borderland,"I didn't enjoy it as much. I found the cinematography worse, the acting to be cheesier, the games a bit convoluted, and the premise less realistic.

Squid Game is not an original idea, but it does execute it very well."
Alice in Borderland,"As a lot of people have mentioned on here, Alice is very anime-like whereas Squid Game is more grounded in reality. I also reckon that the aesthetic and production design of Squid had a lot to do with its popularity. The costumes were bold and colourful, the masks were memorable and relatable to the real world. Outside of the violence, Squid Game is a very attractive show. 

Alice is a great show though. The fight choreography this season was amazing and the finale was very satisfying (it actually reminded me of Lost). It has a lot of anime tropes that are bound to piss off western audiences but I think it delivers in the end."
Alice in Borderland,I love them both but Alice in borderland has an awesome story
Alice in Borderland,I think it’s because Alice in Borderland is way more sci-fi than Squid Game.
Alice in Borderland,"I don't think the characterisation was there as much in AIB. Squid Game had a bunch of 'grey' characters, good people who do bad, bad people who do good, and everything in between. These were far more appealing to me than the characters in AIB - the most appealing part for me was the friendship between Arisu, Chota and Karube. Outside of those 3, I don't recall the names of anyone.

Also, the style is different, as you mentioned. The anime style isn't for everyone and I found the later episodes far less watchable than the beginning, because it started getting further into the realms of the fantastic. Squid Game stayed consistently dark and realistic.

Edit: Also, actors. SG had some phenomenal actors working on it, most notably Lee Jung-jae. I don't remember being blown away by anyone's performance in AIB, apart from maybe Arisu in the wolf/sheep game."
Alice in Borderland,"I liked Alice, but for me personally, Squid Game was just more relatable. I'm not in serious debt myself but playing a game for financial reasons is truly relatable"
Alice in Borderland,"AiB was written as a graphic novel first, as it feels very manga to me. Ill never understand the constant yelling and running. Can someone explain that to me please?

Squid Games is written as an insight and exploration of our current economic systems with compelling characters. It also had better overall production and originality.

It is interesting how now and then we get the same basic movie released at the same time like this. I loved both shows but find SQ more relatable and realistic."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid game is a character drama with some death game skin, it's got pretty universal themes like wealth inequality everybody can understand

Alice in borderland is an irl anime"
Alice in Borderland,"It has no where near the same mainstream appeal as Squid.

As you said, at its core is basically a live action shounen show. Its *too* anime for most people"
Alice in Borderland,Tried to get a friend into alice after he liked squid. He complained about it feeling cartoonish an it being a teen show. I quite enjoy it though to each there own
Alice in Borderland,Idk man.. alice is definitely more fun IMHO
Alice in Borderland,"Alice in Borderland = characters act like anime characters

Squid Games = characters act like normal people (for the most part)"
Alice in Borderland,"It's simple, Squid Game excelled in every area AiB didn't, they had stronger characters, they had a solid team for marketing, and a lot of people who don't even watch asian shows tuned in for it bc they felt drawn to the premise; all of these people drowned in debt show us how far they'll go for money, even if it means killing another person. In AiB, although the games are definitely superior, there's no reason why they're playing, the games are even deadlier and they don't even know how they got there, yes it's not crucial to know, but all of this effort for what? They don't know if they'll get a reward, if they'll just get to live until they finish, there's nothing they know for sure they could gain from risking their lives while playing, not only that, they have to keep playing every three days bc if they don't they also die, which is (in their position) pretty frustrating, squid game did an amazing job by introducing their characters in a way in which while we saw their flaws, we also saw their strength's (Gihun, the main character, is a gambling addict and he's not a present father, but while in the games we saw him in another light, he stood beside the people who were marked as 'useless' or 'not worth the trouble', he also stood for what he believed was right, all of this made him an interesting character) not to mention, squid game's side characters where so good bc we saw how shitty their lives were before the games, but they all had a thing in common: they wanted to comeback to someone/something (Ali to his family, Sangwoo to his mother, Saebyeok to his brother, and so on), AiB side characters although likeable, lacked a proper storyline, we saw glimpses of their past lives but nothing else, the actors of certain characters (Chishiya, Karube, Kuina and others) did an amazing job making their characters likable and gave them life, but I didn't care that much for the main characters, Arisu was a great character but he wasn't all of that as they made him to be, and Usagi although she had a great story the actress didn't do a great job with her character, and to finish off the marketing: once Netflix saw that squid game was getting popular, they made sure to promote it EVERYWHERE, I couldn't escape a Squid game promo even if I tried, whilst I found out about AiB bc people were recommending it ""if you enjoyed squid game"", I agree that AiB first season was strong and really binge worthy, but Squid Game in terms of storyline, characters and overall production was worth the hype they got in Hollywood"
Alice in Borderland,"Squid Game became popular because of the hype. It was chance that it got a little hype and that little hype prompted huge marketing investment.

Squid Game became huge because people thought it already was huge so they had to watch it."
Alice in Borderland,I honestly don’t think it has anything to do with the quality of the shows. Some of it is just luck but I think the main reason is that Netflix started promoting Squid Game on their front page big time once it started to get popular. Then it became a snowball effect.
Alice in Borderland,"This might just be a personal take, but the opening of Alice in borderland was very cringey to me. When a manga/anime is adapted, the interactions, emotions, reactions, etc translate into live action just terribly. 

I almost dropped the show at the beginning but I'm so glad I didn't because I think the show is really, really goos"
Alice in Borderland,AiB is 100% superior.
Alice in Borderland,Mainstream US audiences like Korean stuff more than Japanese. AiB is based off of a manga and has a bunch of manga tropes that don't translate well to live action.
Alice in Borderland,"It's simply not as good in my opinion, and it doesn't have that unique and high budget look that Squid Game has. But it's mostly in the characters and just overall writing that Squid Game is much better. I'm actually a bit baffled there's so many people wondering why AiB isn't as popular."
Alice in Borderland,"They aren't the same. Korean media in general is just way more dark. Old boy, i saw the devil,  man from nowhere, squid game, shoot even the monster one. Character development from kdramas is some of the best. As a lot of stuff just ends up being bitter sweet and the struggle characters face feels more real.  So you marriage the two and you have something great, something people can easily relate too despite it being commentary on korean society, and you are drawn into the world. Alice in borderlands just feels like an anime in live action,  and they never compare well enough to the actual anime. Japanese actors just have that over the top acting that just takes you out of it... because anime expressions can't be translated to life. What we like in anime ends up looking really fucking dumb in real life. Its still a great cheesy live action and imho is one of the better representations. But like they are very,  very different when you actually compare them."
Alice in Borderland,"Squid game is realistic and Alice in Borderlands is fantasy simple as that.

Also Japanese media that's not anime is no where near the quality and production of kdrama. I find their acting quite bad tbh. Almost comes off amateurish to me."
Alice in Borderland,"Cause it's just not as good. I like the show but cinemetography, direction, and acting is just not on the same level as Squid Games. It got me to cry once at the end, but there is just sooooo much melodramatic cheese in alice. I also feel like they shouldve strayed from the manga and kept the characters at least paired up in the second season.  The catch up montages didnt work for me. Also Needed more Aguni. He was unquestionably the best actor on the show.

I did like the ending though. The idea that they were in limbo worked for me.

&#x200B;

P.S.: The fight between Aguni and King of Spades in the woods was brief but soo damn good. The action the rest of the way was pretty disappoting after this scene because it showed they were capable of doing a great fight scene, but then you have the trans chracter fights which were all really badly choregraphed."
Alice in Borderland,Because it's kind of bad and doesn't have a good directing and aesthetic as Squid Game.
Alice in Borderland,Squid game has better characters. You become a lot more invested in them and their stories.
Alice in Borderland,Never heard of Alice. Guessing marketing sucked.
Alice in Borderland,"Everyone basically has said the main points but just gotta say AiB has so many more plotholes in it. Lots of things just don't make much sense. Lots of games can be beaten in various ways that you'd think the supposedly smart protagonists could figure out but don't. It's a bit more formulaic in just making the outcome that makes the most drama. It's definitely fine. But I think that contributes to the YA feel people have mentioned.   


The squid game, games are just simple kids games for the most part so not as much to work through."
Alice in Borderland,"I just finished AiB and here are my problems with it:

1) ending was too head fucky. I won’t go into it so I don’t spoil it for anyone but the last 2 episodes were just “really? Way to M Night Shamylan it.” 

2) romantic subplots felt very forced and not genuine 

3) main characters had **pristine** plot armor. Literally impenetrable until it’s their turn to die in the plot

4) huge “they’ll live cuz they’re the main characters” energy 

5) all the semi-main characters existed solely to support Arisu, which supports the ending they were going for but makes it less relatable.

6) some of the side characters are just not that interesting, like the bow and arrow chick who seems like she’s only there to fit the “precocious Japanese school girl who kicks ass” stereotype. 

7) this is more of a personal observation but the female characters feels like they mainly served as foils to the male characters. Kuina’s “slim but good at martial arts” thing just doesn’t work when she’s so slim and has no muscles but this seems to be a Japanese fantasy trope anyway. Ann’s “stealthy and deadly” thing isn’t very relatable. Usagi’s “survive and fight until your last breath” thing gets annoying. These might be more personal annoyances tho.

8) it feels like Arisu only tried his best because of his drive to protect Usagi. I know the survivors’ guilt thing is there but it just kinda feels not very genuine. 

I mainly enjoyed the games they played and learning how they worked and how the characters would resolve them, but outside of the games honestly imo the plot is weak."
Alice in Borderland,"Its because AIB is written more as an anime than a standard TV series (which is the cause of the choppy writing), I think this throws people off. I do have to say the games are much much better in AIB (its not even close). The characters in the squid game  are a lot less interesting but more grounded and more ""relatable.""

In the end I think its the anime feel. It also wasn't promoted very well in comparison to Squid game. Squid game was front page day 1 while AIB I only found because it was in my suggested from watching anime."
Alice in Borderland,"I liked both a lot, but AoB just delivers way heavier psychological punches to me, and that’s the entire reason I love the death game genre."
Alice in Borderland,I started watching season 2 and man… it’s slow going.  I don’t remember if season 1 was this slow
Alice in Borderland,"As is sadly the case with many shows from my country, Alice in Borderland is terribly acted and almost as poorly written. I don’t know how it comes across to subtitle readers/dub watchers but as a Japanese person it’s hard not to watch it and think I’ve already seen it done but better. Squid game isn’t ground breaking but the reason for the name being obvious right away and what the metaphor is, succinct storytelling and technically proficient acting/cinematography just made it consumer gold."
Alice in Borderland,I tried watching this show right after squid game. Wasn’t remotely as captivating. WS really hard to stay tuned in.
Alice in Borderland,"Squid Game has incredible visuals and great characters. AiB is pretty good all around but it lacks those sets, costumes, creativity, and characters that make Squid Game stand out. Having seen both I also think Squid Game is a lot better in pretty much every area as well. AiB is still good though but it’s not hard to imagine why it doesn’t rival SG imo.    

SG is also has adult characters with relatable situations and character arcs, whereas AiB feels very YA at times, and has a main character that doesn’t know how to act around women 80% of the time, which I think has very limited appeal. AiB anime allusions don’t do it any favors either.    

Not shitting on AiB, I like that show too but I don’t think it’s even close to SQ. It’s coming at a similar time to SQ also makes it look like it’s trying to cash in on the kid game survival show appeal"
Alice in Borderland,"Korean live-action shows inherently these days are more popular around the world compared to Japanese live action shows, and Vice versa. If both of these shows were anime, i can almost guarantee that Alice would be the more popular show since Japanese animation is much more popular worldwide compared to Korean webtoons/anime."
Alice in Borderland,"I think this easily comes down to Squid Game being realistic - you could imagine this happening.
Alice is very much on the supernatural side, which makes it automatically unappealing for some viewers."
Alice in Borderland,"I think the show has an incredible amount of plot holes. I found myself getting furious at the characters for their actions or inactions. Tons of cliches, complete lack of rational thinking in many situations... I still enjoy the show but more for shock value than well written scenes."
Alice in Borderland,To me it just comes down to style more than anything else. Squid Game has this surreal quality that reminds me of A Clockwork Orange; I found the plot nonsensical but kept watching because the characters were compelling and the visual style pretty amazing.
Alice in Borderland,"While Alice in Borderland has caught my attention I haven’t watched it yet mostly because I’ve already watched Squid Games and the similar premise makes it less appealing. 

So I would blame Netflix advertising or algorithms as Squid Games was being pushed every time I opened Netflix and made it impossible to miss, while I just saw a promo for Alice in Borderland for the first time recently. Had I seen it before watching Squid Games I definitely would have watched it first and been uninterested in watching SG after."
Alice in Borderland,"The dialog, acting, and voice acting in Alice is sooooo bad. I tried to finish the first episode twice."
Alice in Borderland,"It's not as good and it's not as effectively told. It is fun, for sure, but I'm in no way surprised that it's not as popular."
Alice in Borderland,"For those who liked squid games, give Alice a chance, it's pretty good.

My only issue with it is that, because it's based on manga, some of the scenes are ridiculous. Like you can imagine the panels drawn in the manga, but it doesn't work when you do it in live action it just looks ridiculous. Also the manga physics. But all in all great show"
Alice in Borderland,"Every time I see it recommended on Netflix, I think ""maybe"" and then don't. Couldn't really provide a more detailed explanation. Just nothing about it piques my curiosity enough to give it a try. Maybe I've seen enough dystopian themed content to feel like there's nothing new to be explored with the genre."
Alice in Borderland,Just started watching it yesterday and was wondering the same thing! It's really good
Alice in Borderland,I tuned out once they got to the beach. Really enjoyed it up until then.
Alice in Borderland,My colleague told me that the 2nd season is out? Thanks for the reminder. I liked it a lot more than squid game
Alice in Borderland,"I'm not sure how they're all that comparable. Korean-made dystopian, I guess? Their conceits are kinda similar, but the execution and direction are really dissimilar. The emotional levels of Squid Game are on another echelon, and Squid Game has a lot more to say about politics and modern capital ethics. Seeing evil face to face, learning its motivations, and feeling its apathy and contempt are other big differences.  

Alice in Borderlands seemed more like entertainment to me, whereas Squid Game had a message, a moral. If anything AiB seems like a CW adaptation, and I know I got bored of it."
Alice in Borderland,I love both
Alice in Borderland,"Squid Games was like Attack on Titan in the sense that both did extremely well in grabbing a western audiences attention. 

The story telling & how it’s shot, the characters, the themes—it’s something someone who doesn’t even like or normally watch kdramas or anime can watch. 

Something like Alice in Borderland requires ^(not “require”, but makes it easier for) you to be familiar with the exaggerations of a Korean show of that style. 

It’s like someone who’s able to watch a telanovella, Chinese drama, or Bollywood film somewhat seriously without always making fun of all the classic exaggerations. The flying-leap fight scenes & terrible wigs in Chinese dramas makes me snort & cringe while my mom is super into the plot & isn’t even dazed."
Alice in Borderland,Squid game is budget Alice in Borderland
Alice in Borderland,"Because the current trend is to thirst after korean people and culture, alice in borderland is Japanese so despite being better in every sense, it doesn't hit the same numbers"
Alice in Borderland,Popularity depends on a lot more. The when it came out and how coordinated the social media campaign was will affect it greatly
Alice in Borderland,"I think its just initial first impression people get. They also might not like the idea of teens in that type of situation.  
I liked alice in borderlands more but I loved the manga and was curious on this adaptation."
Alice in Borderland,Even though squid game is also based on an anime/manga. Kaiji.
Alice in Borderland,It's so much better than it too!
Alice in Borderland,"It doesn’t feel as real, but goddamn I love Alice In borderland"
Alice in Borderland,"Squid Game had a marketing campaign that got ball rolling very fast and people had something to discuss. In this case social-commentary message and how ridiculous it is despite having realistic feeling.

Alice in Borderland comes off as isekai in this case, which is not very popular outside of anime. 

Thus, despite having cool games, etc it didnt make a splash to bring in people to watch who usually are not looking for that kind of series, which Squid Game did with social media buzz."
Alice in Borderland,"Besides what other people said: it’s also the framing, camera angles, set design, set quality, use of color, lighting, hair, make-up, acting. All distinctly cliche live-action-anime instead of high budget or tv-style or creative."
Alice in Borderland,"Imo its the social commentary of squid game. 

A lot of ppl can connect with someone down and out on their luck forced into a shit situation… whereas less can relate to finding themselves in an alternate dimension fighting for their life. 

I love both"
Alice in Borderland,"I found the first season interesting at first, but it quickly degenerated into something I had to force myself to complete watching.

That guy with the sword, omg he was so laughably uncool and rediculously ugly in the way he tried to be cool and scary. Omg. I have zero hopes for the just arrived second season.

The girl protagonist is pretty, though."

You can say “but the law is the law” all you want. Shit, I’d even **agree** with you if it were a different person on trial…

But when it comes to scientologists, you know, the same people whose leaders will gangstalk you, poison your dog, and work to actively ruin your life for even *thinking* of dirtying the Church’s reputation and/or a member’s reputation?

This scientologist, who literally has a song written about what a massive piece of shit he is?

Yeah, have fun dying on that hill, boys!"
Room 2806: The Accusation,"Following this case, there’s no doubt in my mind he did it, but I can see how some jurors had reasonable doubt, though I found the defenses arguments unconvincing.  I think it will be interesting in the retrial how the prosecution adjusts.  The defense can’t do much different unless they put Masterson on the stand, which is not advisable.

The jurors were there and saw everything, but people will always assume some kind of ulterior motive.   I'm sure people will say Scientology threatened them, or something else.  But it may just be just like they said.

Sometimes prosecutors don't make a good case (Casey Anthony).  Sometimes accusers are not believable, like Amber Heard (even though yes, I know in that situation she was the defendant).   Hell, R. Kelly's first trial didn't convict him either and there was video evidence.

But this is why the challenge isn't to prove someone's innocence, its to prove their guilt."

Room 2806: The Accusation,"Eh. To this day I don’t think this case had anything to do with rape or masterson. It was Scientology and how the cult like behavior and how they treat people who leave. (This is mentioned about halfway through the article) which masterson may not have been a part of.

After my rape and being kidnapped for 16hours I went to the police. I had my attackers full government name and address. I had pictures of him. I had a rape kit done. I had marks on my neck and my face. I had texts etc. 

The police took my statement but asked me questions like “Why were you with him in the 1st place?”

“Are you addicted to any drugs”

“Why didn’t you run away”


I left feeling gutted and helpless. A week later I tried calling them for follow up. The officer I spoke to told me that if I wanted to pursue charges, “it would be more trouble than it was worth”.  I attempted suicide that week. 

It has been 8 years since then. If you asked me what happened I couldn’t tell you much, I blacked it out (and he had drugged me). I have no physical evidence either.  I wonder how many victims he had after me, or I try not to think about it. Maybe he killed someone. Idk. 

But the court system failed me. It failed every girl I know. It’s failed us for years and years. There needs to be reform surrounding rape prosecutions. This cannot continue."

Room 2806: The Accusation,"Conviction rates for rape are really low, exactly because it is so difficult to prove.  It's simple to prove that sex occurred, if someone immediately seeks care at a hospital, but there often *isn't* physical evidence of consent.  If a rapist injures their victim in the process, then those injuries could be used to show a lack of consent, but you can incapacitate someone without leaving marks.  In many cases, there aren't going to be any physical injuries.  Rape cases usually are he said/she said and they're tough to prove for exactly that reason.  Often the evidence is simply the victim testifying that they said ""no"" and ""stop.""

Because these cases are hard to prove, a lot of prosecutors will decline to pursue all but the most egregious and clear cases (i.e. stranger assaults or assaults with extensive physical injuries).  I'm guessing prosecutors pursued this case because there were mutliple alleged victims, which they felt would be enough."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"Yeah, and try to remember every single detail that many years later… Even if it was true, the fact that people may not be 100% sure after all that time just makes it impossible."
Room 2806: The Accusation,">He said/ She said cannot be the law of the land.

I mean, for something like this, barring actual evidence, it kind of has to be.  Its on them to prove his guilt, not the defense to prove his innocence."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"In California, the jury instruction reads:

“The testimony of a single witness, if believed, is enough to prove a fact.”

“If believed” is the operative phrase."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"“He said/she said” is pretty typical of any case. TV shows and movies make jurors more likely to expect crazy scientific evidence when in reality, most cases are just testimony. Two people tell a story, and usually one makes more sense than the other or one witness is more credible."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"It's very complicated. Sometimes victims are satisfied by getting it out there. I have worked on rape case that are years old but... this were cases in which it was done by a family member and it was repeated. The damage done by that is more easily proven. I have also worked on false rape cases. For the same reason that rape is sometimes hard to prove, it's also hard to disprove in the mind of the general public. You might not get convicted but if people hear about it, you are smeared in the mind of many. It's a very diffuclt situation and it is used as a weapon, since rape alledgers do not face legal consequences, unless you can prove how the fake rape victim lied to accuse someone. It's incredibly hard to do since it's rarely confessed or is there anyway to prove that they willingly lied (it has happened but it's extremely rare to prove). 

Even if it sounds crass, everyone should be educated on what to do in the case of rape. We all know never to disturb evidence in any legal case, but it seems people forget when it concerns rape. People shower, wash off the evidence, take weeks to report and many of the physical evidence is washed away.  Even if the last thing you wanna do is not shower when you were raped, it's absolutely necessary to keep the evidence and go to an ER immediately to get a rape kit done"
Room 2806: The Accusation,"I…I don’t disagree with what you’re saying here per se, but in this case especially; saying “seem to cross the line more then regular folk” feels kinda callous, especially when there were a fair amount of people who came forward about Masterson.  It really wasn’t just one or two."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"I think a lot of it has to do with confusion and denial in many circumstances. Like the victim at first tries to justify the scenario in their heads. Or replay it over and over and over to make sense of it. Or, represses it out of shame. Or blames themself. Or is afraid of revenge if they told someone. But many people don’t really realize what happened could even be considered rape. Sometimes things don’t make sense in the moment and your brain does what it can to try and protect you. Then later through therapy, or talking with someone, or having a memory come back might trigger some realization that something really was not right."
Room 2806: The Accusation,I think you mean famous people get accused more often than regular folk.
Room 2806: The Accusation,This fucking Me Too movement needs to die already. News needs to stop airing stories that try the accused BEFORE the fucking trial even starts.

Room 2806: The Accusation,"It’s Kavenaugh all over again and almost as triggering this time around.

Men like “Eric” live such lives of privilege that they cannot begin to relate to the shame, the disassociation, and the psychological tricks your brain automatically goes through to justify and forget about your rape. It took me 30 years to understand I wasn’t asking for it and to understand that remembering every little detail that led to the precipice of being assaulted but immediately blocking faces and forgetting names was not unusual and was a common protective measure.

The guy honestly doesn’t sound intelligent enough to serve on a jury and entirely unable to think with any empathy. Just another POS rape apologist on a jury."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"Crazy that they removed the statute of limitations on cases like this in some states.

Prove the smfraatructure and supports around reporting things that are currently happening.

Don't give people false hope that decades old cases can be heard fairly."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"That's why it's so important to actually do something about it asap. There's better chance of there being evidence if you can bring the person to court within a few years rather than literal decades later. 

But of course even if you can take the person to court the next day there's still a chance there's not enough hard evidence proving a crime occurred, and there's pretty much no way to address that until they can properly project our memories onto a screen for everyone to see."
Room 2806: The Accusation,So what? should no one ever go to jail for rape then?
Room 2806: The Accusation,"I guess one way to go at it is to interview people they told at the time of the alleged assault or a bit later, as in friends, family members, police who decided not to prosecute, officials of the 'church', etc, and see if the core stories match.  
People lying in 2003 to their mums and coppers so they can wait 20 years to bring a bloke down is an illogical scenario.

Another element is this is an example of he said/ ~~she~~ they said, which gives the possibility to confront the accusations and look for similarities or a modus operandi, like Weinstein and Cosby had specific ones.

Now, the number of victims in those 2 cases are dozens, not 3 like in this one, and one could argue (as they did) that the accusers got together to make their stories look similar, but if you have the witnesses from the early 2000s, when the accusers didn't know each other, corroborating the same stories, the hoax theory kind of falls apart and I can see why a D.A. would decide to prosecute such a cold case, especially because of the scientology connections (there must be a Unabomber sized task force somewhere investigating that cult)."
Room 2806: The Accusation,My question is what do the victims hope to get out of this 20 years later
Room 2806: The Accusation,"There is still evidence collecting and interviews. The accuser/victim makes a claim, the police interview both parties and any other people that may have been involved around the time of the incident, like parents, friends, teachers and co-workers etc. Then the def and prosecution bring people that were interviewed to testify in court. The prosecution will claim that it definitely happened and the defence will say that it didn’t and that the accuser/victim is a liar and outline why they would lie."
Room 2806: The Accusation,"Basically, when it comes to official law and convictions it should be that way. You can’t convict someone without evidence because then anyone can make up a story after 20 years and it can be just as hard to prove it untrue as it is to prove it true. So it should be on the accuser to prove it true. 

Public opinion doesn’t follow those rules and often an accusation is enough to be considered guilty in the public eye. Masterson is cooked in the public eye."
Room 2806: The Accusation,He did. And they did. They also harassed the victims and killed one of their dogs.
Room 2806: The Accusation,Unfortunately he will do it again or kill someone. Seems to be par for our justice system lately.

All the top comments are understanding the law here and why it favored him in this case, but they're not siding with him as a person.  As always: not guilty =/= innocent.

HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria’s upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...

Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"Warning: Rape, Sexual Assault

“At various points, Levinson’s scripts contained disturbing sexual and physically violent scenes between Depp and Tesfaye’s characters, three sources familiar with the matter claim. In one draft episode, there allegedly was a scene where Tesfaye bashes in Depp’s face, and her character smiles and asks to be beaten more, giving Tesfaye an erection. (This scene was never shot, the source says.) Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.) “

Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"Reading the whole article, it appear that as problematic as Sam's writing is, the issues were apparent long before he took over.

Looking at some of these quotes in bold:

**As promising as those initial scripts were, the scripts for the final episodes were still only half-finished and the finale completely unwritten. Seimetz was encouraged by HBO and producers to put her own spin on the show and write the last episode, a source explains. As a result, Seimetz was polishing up scripts and writing while directing. She also had her assistant, who had no previous credited writing experience, writing scenes, with HBO making the assistant a staff writer last January. (The assistant did not respond to a request for comment.)**

**Organization quickly evaporated, mainly due to changes in the script, sources say. One production member says the first version of the show went through more than 20 rewrites, saying scripts were being updated constantly: “We did it every fucking day. It was insane.** 

**Eventually, the crew say they stopped getting one-liners, an industry term for daily schedules of what was being shot. And the few one-liners that were given out quickly became useless due to changes, sources say. Decisions were being made on the fly, frustrating several crew members who say they felt they could never properly prepare for the next day of work. “I’d be driving home [at the end of the day] and they’d be like, ‘Oh, we’re adding a scene, but it hasn’t been written yet,’” one says.** 

**A report from April blamed the show’s overhaul on Tesfaye, who was reportedly unhappy that the story was focusing too much on Depp’s character, according to Deadline. A source with knowledge seconds that Tesfaye was the reason behind the shakeup, wanting to tone down the cult aspect of the storyline and pivot into something else entirely, dropping the “feminist lens” through which the show was being told as a result. “It was like the Weeknd wanted one show that was all about him — Sam was on board with that,” another source explains to Rolling Stone.**


In a six episode season, if you still have unfinished scripts for the remaining episodes and an unwritten final episode while you are filming an hectic production, it is obvious that the problem are deeper than just one person.


From reading the quotes above, It look like nobody had any actual finished outline of what direction the show was going toward or how it would end since they admitted that they already have gone through 20 rewrites while Seimetz was still in charge of the show. 

When you are rewriting scripts that many times and you still haven't even finished the scripts for the remaining episodes in a six episode season, it will be difficult to have a coherent story and character development. 

The crazy thing is that if this was a 22 episode season, it would make sense to have rewrite or revision to the scripts due to the length of the season but when you are struggling to write up only six episodes with a small timeframe for shooting and production, this is basically an issue from HBO management to the writing team. 

As problematic and disturbing as the reports have been about Sam especially backstage on Euphoria, it appear that just blaming him is the easy way out regarding the issues plaguing this show. 

The article make it clear that the issues were there from the first day of production before he was even involved and that the issues just kept getting worse as shooting continued. 

Also, It look like Tesfaye wanted the show to be more about him and his character compared to Depp's character. When you have one of the two Main Character of the show apparently having an issue with a woman character being the focus, you are going to have a difficult time appeasing him unless you recast him with a new actor who would be fine with allowing a woman to shine.

Honestly, you can just lay the blame on HBO management which appear to have an unrealistic deadline and a refusal to oversee what actually is going on regarding the scripts and production."

Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"Sam do be into depraved, toxic sexuality."
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"on the fence about whether this is *intentional* marketing -- but given that this exact article has been posted on Reddit 11 separate times, has almost 1500 comments on this thread alone, Tesfaye had a targeted and ready-made clip to respond to Rolling Stone with, and it subsumed discourse all day yesterday on other social media platforms incl. Twitter, I'm pretty sure it generated exactly the kind of outrage/buzz that will propel the premiere to sky-high viewership. Happy to revisit this comment when the show premieres and eat my words if I'm wrong but I doubt I will be. It's worth noting that the loudest critics of Euphoria have usually watched 16 episodes, maybe even all 18.

I'm pretty disturbed at how comfortable everyone is casually slinging around rumors about Levinson being some kind of predator, though. Not only is there zero evidence of that, but there's not even any *allegations* of him being remotely creepy. There's not even anything to disprove, just people clearly hoping that bad things will come out about him presumably because they dislike his work so much. Levinson certainly doesn't seem to find his own work as titillating as everyone here clearly does -- [seriously, I'd recommend reading this THR interview with him, he comes off as very thoughtful and just...not creepy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/euphoria-creator-boundary-pushing-hbo-drama-didnt-pull-punches-1218588/) -- and nearly all the social media comments are bursting with inter-generational hysteria about Kids These Days and dismissing Euphoria as porn while clearly ignoring the fact that Euphoria is making a commentary on how the ubiquity of internet porn has affected culture and particularly teenagers. I respect it for at least trying to start a cultural conversation on how porn is affecting youth and sexual expectations/gender dynamics especially when a lot of the takes around porn are just like, ""why don't you just jerk off in the privacy of your own room, you sick freak, and we can all pretend this huge cultural force doesn't exist.""

All this is not to discount the worrying accusations in the article, such as that of a disorganized set -- poor work conditions are no joke -- but all of the other stuff like the description of the egg scene, which wasn't even filmed, is to some extent clearly being enjoyed as salacious and transgressive by those who read it. Rape kinks are real and [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19085605/), another thing that could stand to be critically engaged with instead of acting like it's some collective dirty secret. Maybe the show failed at that but we can't really say until watching, which I'm sure most people will -- but I'm fascinated by how many people will eat up Levinson's work and then will completely miss the commentary or continue to insist he's some pervert. This conflict between what people do/want and what they openly admit to doing and wanting is a running theme throughout his prior work....and if you don't believe me on that then read the THR interview. anyway, ready to get downvoted into oblivion lol"

It’s definitely not a super realistic depiction of high school and it’s way over dramatized, but people do drugs and have sex in high school. I went to a tiny school and even there we had heroin addicts, meth addicts, etc. People had sex at parties. It was certainly way more awkward and not as glamorous as it is on Euphoria, but Euphoria is purposefully melodramatic.

The nudity can be too much, but all of the actors are in their mid-twenties. I don’t really agree that it’s pedophilic of the creator to depict high school sex.  All of Harmony Korine’s early movies had  more fucked up stuff involving kids and teens than Euphoria does."

Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"I'm sure the production of the show has been bad. But this article, to me, seems like it's slanted in a weird way.

The article seems written to imply that something changed from the ""original"" show to ""the current show"" due to the involvement of Levison and The Weeknd. But Levinson and The Weeknd created the show.

I'm failing to understand how the show transforms from A to B when the creators are also the same people leading now. I would understand it if you said it went from A to B to A, but that's not what it says, nor does it say Seimetz rewrote the whole thing. The current version of the show sounds exactly like Levinson and The Weeknd, so how could it have been different in the beginning and why would they have wanted it to be different?"
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,Who exactly is surprised with those two involved?
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,This is such a load gossipy bullshite. How is rolling Stone even in publication still?
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"""Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.)""

How hard is it to shoot that? You shoot an angle of hand with egg going between her thighs, you cut to a reaction shot of her face. I mean, we've been simulating actresses being penetrated for decades without actually penetrating them, this cannot be difficult."
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"What's missing from the story, because it's sourced by anonymous people who clearly wanted to publicize Amy Seimetz's perspective, is The Weeknd's vision of the show. They say it's about a guy's sexually abusive relationship with a woman but missing is his point. 

It could be wish fulfillment smut but there could be  something interesting he's wanting to land on that just wasn't what Amy was interested in doing. 

Messy production and sexual minefields aside, artists can connect with different aspects of a vision and end up running in opposite directions. I loved The Girlfriend Experience and find Amy Seimetz a great director but this may not have been the project for her. Also the Weeknd has never produced a TV series before and relied on Sam Levinson to execute his vision but Levinson was failing everyone

Either way I'll be watching, always down to see a beautiful mess of a series."
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,Nice marketing. When does it air? Sounds interesting.
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"Unpopular opinion; i can see theWeeknd and Levinsons point of view.  If you want to make a dark and disturbing noir tale about how easy people can be used and abused, you have to show that. Film it. You cant just have have characters say things are bad then turnit in to the triumphs of the independent woman.  Which it sounds like what was happening.  The original director was turning it in to something hopeful and uplifting how the female character perseveres over all obstacles- which is the opposite of the story youre trying to tell"
Check The Store Next Door: The Next Chapter,"This comment section is weird. You can tell when people already have their mind made up about something based on what other people have said. It’s just a circle jerk here of people saying basically the same thing.

This is a tv show we are talking about right? They can do whatever they want as long as everyone involved is on board.

We’re getting to this point where sex and nudity in mainstream media has to be tasteful and meaningful and it’s bad if it’s it’s gratuitous. Gratuitous violence is ok though. But at the same time so many people are making a killing on onlyfans servicing that side of what people want. It’s like we’re trying to hide that part of what people are. But at the same time empower people to do whatever the fuck they want. So what if it’s torture porn? Don’t watch it if it sucks.

Boy For Rent,"I miss his old hair, *sigh… it was an iconic silhouette which is character design 101, now he’s so modernly generic."
Boy For Rent,"Call me an old head but, I really don't like this CG animated stuff. -_-"
Boy For Rent,The animation takes some getting used to if you’re not accustomed to it. Some shots do look cool though. Glad to see the Typhoon return.
Boy For Rent,"Just watched it—I actually don’t mind the visual style, but they’re taking a very different approach to the story. Not sure how it comes across for a new viewer but if you’re familiar with the story they’re revealing stuff in ep1 that was final act plot development originally. Interesting choice, kinda weird."
Boy For Rent,yeah the art style is not my jam.
Boy For Rent,Boomers mad their 90's trend anime pretty boy is now a 20's trend anime pretty boy
Boy For Rent,So has it started airing? The original design for Vash the Stampede might be the coolest looking anime character of all time so of course a slightly altered version would still be good.
Boy For Rent,Look how they've massacred my boy...
Boy For Rent,New Vash looks like a fuck boy and I will never get over that.
Boy For Rent,"What, have we travelled back to the 90s again? I didn't know there was a new Trigun."
Boy For Rent,Did a fucking teenage fujoshi write this? Whoever wrote this fucking article keeps saying cutie. That to me screams they’re more concerned about him being a bishounen fuck boy than the story.
Boy For Rent,Idk that new art style is something else.
Boy For Rent,There’s no way Vash is a top.
Boy For Rent,"Its the second damn week of the year, let em cook"
Boy For Rent,What the fuck is with the tone of this article? Rarely are multiple uses of the word “cutie” included in media reviews.
Boy For Rent,The art style is too much like… Disney vibes. Looks like a lost treasure children’s movie.  Doubt I’ll be able to watch it much more
Boy For Rent,"I watched the first episode today. I'll give it some time but I was not digging the animation at all. The original was so cool and the opening scene made sure you knew Vash was a badass. Everything felt so rushed, I notice that about a lot of anime, slow down, and build some atmosphere. The mood of the original was not there. Maybe I need to stop comparing the two, but I'm a huge fan of the original. 

They made some changes to Vash I wish they didn't, his hair didn't bother me that much but one thing they changed that annoyed me that I'm sure most of you don't care about is Vashes gun. Vash used a unique and iconic 45 Long Colt break open revolver. The design is not a real one, but it made sense. Now they have him using this stupid .22 that looks like some spacey shit. I know that probably doesn't bother most of you, but it annoyed me. 

But I will continue to watch and see if the new version grows on me. I'm open to some changes, and if I like the direction, they take it, then cool."
Boy For Rent,"I guess this is what passes for journalism now lol. His zoomer redesign is terrible, there's no grit anymore"
Boy For Rent,It’s like watching Jared Leto play joker
Boy For Rent,I haven’t started watching the new one yet - but he doesn’t look so extremely different than old Vash.
Boy For Rent,"uhh at least originally he looked like an adult.  eh whatever.  some good shows are getting ruined by these new renderings.  GitS, Seven Deadly Sins come to mind."
Boy For Rent,Saw the 1st episode. Very hard to watch. The animation is not really good. DBZ Playstation games have better graphics.
Boy For Rent,I just hope it leads to reprints of the manga coming back.
Boy For Rent,Animation is a little wonky to me… like the character movements are “sluggish” if that makes sense?
Boy For Rent,Feel like that’s kinda the point. It’s more modern to reflect the time it’s released. Vash was always a pretty boy Bishōnen.
Boy For Rent,"One day in the future it'll hit that sweet spot but for now, we suffer in agony lol"
Boy For Rent,My only problem is I hate the Computer generated Anime. It looks wonky. I’d have loved a “trigun movie” quality animation.
Boy For Rent,First episode was today.
Boy For Rent,I like his new design. Some people “don’t like that he’s suddenly a pretty boy” but as I’ve said in other comments he’s literally just a backstreet boy who accidentally wandered into being an anime protag it’s always been that way.  A huge chunk of the Vash depictions in the manga are happy-go-lucky Labrador-vibes boyband himbo and not the sudden change in demeanor you see sometimes when things get serious.
Boy For Rent,"And, I'm sorry maybe I'm being nitpicky but I reeeaally wish he had his old sunglasses. The new ones are a bit much"
Boy For Rent,"Wait when did old Vash not look like a backstreet boy who accidentally wandered into a manga?

It’s honestly fitting for his character - he’s got a [crouching moron, hidden badass / obfuscating stupidity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass) thing going on. The pretty boy aspect I feel like just plays that up like he’s just good for his looks, just a young gunslinger who claims to be lucky."
Boy For Rent,Old Vash looked like a fuck boy I will and have gotten over it.
Boy For Rent,Vash has always looked like a fuckboi but what a fuckboi looks like has slightly changed
Boy For Rent,"Keeps saying? I did ctrl+f for 'cutie' and 'cuties' and there was 1 hit for each word.

Where are you finding all these other 'cutie's?"
Boy For Rent,I don’t know man. I genuinely think it’s gotten the sweet spot right now.
Boy For Rent,"Seriously though, the spiky hair, round spectacles and flowing trench coat are all 90’s as fuck. Vash’s design was 100% of his era so it’s only normal for the reimagined design to be 100% of this era. This coming from someone who discovered anime and Trigun in the 90’s and dropped out of anime soon after (aka never really kept up). Just saw the trailer and looking forward to it. One thing I can’t image them topping though was is the soundtrack. That shit was amazing."
Boy For Rent,"Search for cute. You also read the fucking article, it’s nothing but her gushing over his new looks."
Boy For Rent,I actually got that soundtrack on CD to listen to in my car lol. It was one of the things that made the show for me.
Boy For Rent,"The trench coat was more steampunk/western-y though, along with the glasses. It wasn’t a Neo trench coat.

His new look is just lame, generic zoomer. Looks like he’s gonna tell you to listen to his sound cloud rap or something."
Boy For Rent,Literal backstreet boy made into anime protag.
Boy For Rent,"I did, here's the hits:
Searching for 'cute' -
>Now, he’s back and cuter than ever in studio Orange’s reinvention of the classic sci-fi Western, Trigun Stampede.

>In the end, it leads him to be a lot more approachable, and also crushable beyond his cute looks. 

>he new Vash brings fresh life to a decades-old character, as he returns to us vivacious as ever and ready to capture our hearts as one of 2023’s most memorable anime cuties. 

>Given its history of work, it doesn’t seem so surprising that Orange can deliver our next star anime cutie.

Seems there were two more instances than what I found initially.

In 1,141 words, there are 4 instances of cute or some variation."
Boy For Rent,"She wrote the word cute 2 times in the first paragraph. Once is enough, let alone 4 times."
Boy For Rent,Is A-Train going to cross any sort of threshold in his character arc or is he going to keep seeing the consequences of his actions and then change absolutely nothing?
Boy For Rent,"It would be more surprising at this point if there wasn't any extremely violent/ disgusting scenes in the series.

 Like imagine if The Boys becomes a slow contemplative drama where the plot barely moves. Now that would be more surprising."
Boy For Rent,I would be very surprised if Carnage was in this.
Boy For Rent,"What is more surprising than someone being ripped in half from the inside, starting with their dick?"
Boy For Rent,"I like the show, but jeez, the constant ""this season is going to SHOCK YOU, we couldn't BELIEVE what we were DOING, everyone on set was VOMITTING!!"" between each season has gotten so old. I get it, it's a violent superhero show. Now are we going to get more movement on the plot, or are we going to awkwardly resolve most of the season's conflicts in the last episode of the season?"
Boy For Rent,Will it build to something though or will we leave characters (in the last episode) exactly where we found them at the start of the season?
Boy For Rent,"Are you trying to tell me that the show known for his excessive violence and gore… is gonna be violent and gory??!

I could have never guessed that. Genius marketing strategy I might say."
Boy For Rent,Hey Homelander is no longer holding back with his psycho/megalomaniac behavior of course it’s going to be carnage.
Boy For Rent,And again reserved for the secondary characters and those introduced just to die?
Boy For Rent,Just kill Homelander already or change his status quo.
Boy For Rent,"Has there ever been marketing where they say, ""naw, next season isn't as good as last one. naw next season will play out as expected.  naw, next season wont be as exciting""

Do ppl actually 'fall' for this marketing-crap?  Its always, ""next season will 1 up anything we have ever worked on"""
Boy For Rent,The show has turned into monster-of-the-season type of show.  I hope the storyline progresses in a more steep incline.
Boy For Rent,Anyone else getting tired of people exploding into Jamba Juice every scene? Losing the shock factor quickly
Boy For Rent,"I hope they’re not just drifting further into gratuitous violence for the sake of it. The show is plenty violent already. If it needs more of anything, it’s not that."
Boy For Rent,Season 3 was good and then the last episode just felt like a slap in the dick. Like nothing changed from the first to last episode.
Boy For Rent,S3 finale was such a letdown mess. I really hope the writers step up their game S4.
Boy For Rent,"I think the show runners are in a bind with what to do with Soldier Boy. I think the best thing to do is keep him in cryo and not talk about him. His popularity is overwhelming and has to be a concern for the show runners who are adamantly against people of his character.

Remember, these heroes are all parodies of other superheroes and ideologies we have in today’s society. A Venn diagram of Soldier Boy fans and Andrew Tate fans is too close to similar for their liking.

I’m really interested to see how this plays out. Wouldn’t be surprised if they killed him off in a hilarious fashion as some sort of ‘fuck you’ to his fans."
Boy For Rent,They had a micro character crawl in to another guys dick for a sex scene. There is nothing they can do more shocking. They are just trying to be shocking to be edgy now.
Boy For Rent,Its all building up to this season being a bloodbath / constant battle and I'm here for it
Boy For Rent,"An article about A-train published in Collider. How's that for irony..   Hahaha! See because the show starts with him colliding....

Please don't hate me I'm so lonely...."
Boy For Rent,"Like ""Herogasm"" was supposed to be wild, shocking, insane? It was none of those things."
Boy For Rent,I love this show!
Boy For Rent,"So is Usher saying, “Watch this, watch this?”"
Boy For Rent,Okay but is anyone important going to die? Like dude we gonna have another season of Homelander must die plot?
Boy For Rent,Am I the only one who finds this show to be overrated cringe?
Boy For Rent,"I don't believe these kind of statements anymore, these guys hyped herogasm to death and the episode turned out just ""okay"""
Boy For Rent,"lol pass, just cheap shock gore"
Boy For Rent,ITT people who have never read Garth Ennis.
Boy For Rent,"I know the comic and the show have a lot thing that are different but knowing how the comic goes... People can't be really be surprised. 

But maybe is just me that knows the source material."
Boy For Rent,"We gave up about episode 4. I get it. Everyone can blow up someone's head. Everyone gets blood on them from head stuff. 

I really didn't like Mother's Milk relapse. Ruined the whole redemption arc."
Boy For Rent,“I am suprised how heartless this heartless show can be.”
Boy For Rent,Last season was shit. This show has nothing more to give
Boy For Rent,World’s most bitter comment section
Boy For Rent,They better not try and redeem his character.
Boy For Rent,How about they start going the route of under-promise and over-deliver?
Boy For Rent,This feels very much like the horror movie trope of “lead actor says this movie is scarier than the exorcist”.
Boy For Rent,"They also said the ""Hero-gasm"" was going to be balls to the wall, and the season 1 supe-bar was more extreme"
Boy For Rent,"Which means that it now is significantly less surprising. Gee, thanks.

But after that stinker of a third season, I for sure will be surprised if something happens that actually moves the plot forward."
Boy For Rent,I'm trying my hardest to get into this show but my hatred for Homelander burns so bright I get angry just thinking about watching it.
Boy For Rent,RIP “The Boys “
Boy For Rent,I’d be more surprised if there isn’t any carnage in season 4 lol. That’s their brand.
Boy For Rent,"Watched the first season, it's okay but nothing i WAS WILLING TO KEEP UP WITH.

Season 3 ended as it started - and Butcher being ill means nothing in a story where superpowers are easier to obtain than an appointment with your GP!

Boy For Rent,I really hope A-Train and The Deep die in season 4
Boy For Rent,"This show could have been a movie maybe a mini series. It's out lived its entertainment now its just like old coffee grounds, no use"
Boy For Rent,He's a really bad actor. I thought maybe it was just how he was made to act in The Boys but now that I've seen him in The Walking Dead it's solidified it for me. Awful.

Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Holy shit, what?! I never expected this show to get a second season. Big Mark Little stan over here."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Season 2 is great, 10 episodes. A couple new characters, Vale is an awesome addition. You should check out the subreddit for more."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,">  Constantin Film, the German powerhouse behind the Resident Evil franchise, is partnering with U.K.-based Big Light Productions, founded by Frank Spotnitz (The Man in the High Castle, The X-Files, Medici, Leonardo), to develop a high-end drama series about the world-changing Nuremberg Trials.


> The project will dive into the events surrounding the prosecution of Nazi officials following WWII, the first time in history that people were held accountable for war crimes, exploring characters from all sides of the trials, showing how not only justice was at stake but the global balance of power...

> Constantin Film is no stranger to the subject matter, having been nominated for an Oscar with its 2004 film 'Downfall' which covered the final hours and collapse of the German regime. Most recently, Constantin Film’s The Conference, a historically accurate drama about a meeting that was part of planning the Holocaust, garnered international recognition and several International awards."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"There was a 2006 British docu-drama miniseries called *Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial* with Robert Pugh (no relation to Florence) as Goering, but that was only three episodes.

A longer series hasn't been done before and is probably worth doing - especially looking at the ten trials after the main one and how Cold War politics led to the Americans losing interest and a lot of people frankly getting away with their crimes."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Get Steve Harvey
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"a series seem a bit much for a topic that ultimately ain't that meaty but 6 episodes should be enough

time to rewatch Conspiracy. What a chilling, superb movie"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I thought there's a movie with a young Alex Baldwin as the main prosecutor too
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I LOVE the character designs. It’s like a perfect blend of The Simpsons and Futurama, with a unique twist (the design of the demon). Really looking forward to this."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Mythical Futurama? Heck yea im there.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,The Elf looks almsot exactly like Bart Simpson to me.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"So many people have parodied his style over the years that my brain's like ""Oh, someone did Simpsons versions of their fantasy characters"" before ""Oh, new Matt Groening characters!"""
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I saw Noel Fielding was in it, but Matt Berry and Rich Fulcher too!? This show could be something else"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,/r/disenchantment 
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Netflix?! Yes! This time my subscription is paying off! Futurama, I still miss you..."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I love that Netflix already has a two year committment in place. Hopefully this means they can plan out long storylines in addition to the comedy which are well-suited to streaming. 
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I get a Futurama vibe with the trio and that's a great thing. Obviously we don't know for sure until we see a trailer, but I can totally seeing the demon being like Bender. "
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"So it will be like adventure time simpsons, where absurdity is promoted (not like simposons have a problem with it as is). "
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Okay but why does Luci look exactly like Prismo from Adventure Time 
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Looks more like a Treehouse of Horrors skit, than an entire series."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Shouldn't Mr. Groening be focused on The Simpsons? 
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Looks like Cubert.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Which is weird because he has completely different nose, ears and hair.  And is also wearing a hat.  The shirt and shorts is the main thing that's similar."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,personally i think the princess and the elf look like bart and cubert switched noses
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"It's definitely giving off an Adventure Time vibe, we'll see I guess."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Last time he focused on something else then The Simpsons we got Futurama!

So in my opinion he should do so more often!"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I think it's the orangish shirt and blue shorts combo that makes me think Bart
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"And yet the face is very cubert-esque. Hm.

I dub him.... Cubart."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Hello from Pittsburgh.

Oh, you're an executive who wants to go into a bar? Well, the only bars in Pittsburgh are all filled with overweight men still wearing hardhats covered head to toe in steel dust and paying the bartender in girders. Oh, and it's still 1974.

If it's supposed to be a bar right outside the Pittsburgh area, same thing, only Copperhead Road is playing in the background."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"IDK, movies and TV are so shallow in their portrayals.

Only like 5 cities in the world have an identity in film, and really only Los Angeles and New York are portrayed in depth."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I've only been to Chicago once, but I was immediately assaulted by a large man with a kielbasa. 

It is unclear if he intended for me to eat it, or if he had some other, hidden, nefarious purpose."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,All the Netflix writers are Cardinals fans
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Is the show ""Easy"" on Netflix a better representation?"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Then there's Bojack Horseman. 

""Officer, I just saw a man putting ketchup on a hot dog!""

""Not in my city!"""
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,[deleted]
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"That just sounds like Wrigleyville?
Which sounds accurate for most upper middle class white protagonists in Chicago."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I like the Shameless portrayal
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I've never seen a motherfucker wear a hat that says ""Chicago"" on it in Chicago."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I don’t think Hollywood has a good understanding of places not located on either coast.  There is an overreliance on stereotypes when potraying people from the Mid west and  South.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Seems like Chicago really lucked out by getting rid of Emily. She is the worst.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I mean, theyre all white and upper middle class and they all go out in river north/river walk/wrigleyville. Not exactly a diverse portrayal of the city"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Wasn’t Chicago the first place to start charging a streaming tax?
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,And fuck Mark Walberg
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I guess Chicago is not their kind of town.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"This is the case for most cities in TV and film. In the opposite of overly negative, Hawaii is rarely portrayed accurately since all of the urban and suburban elements magically don’t exist."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I grew up in Logan Square. From 1988-to 2015. I take DEEP offense to Holidate's portrayal of my home. Smh.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Dude so much shit gets filmed in Toronto but we don’t ever even get to keep our name. Always some American city.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I just want a reality show based on eating a Portillo’s Italian beef dipped with cheese. No dialogue just scenes of food and the skyline.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"'Easy' on netflix portrays it as a nice modern and culturally-rich hip city. It's a similar show to High Maintenance, but with 5 or 6 story lines with recurring characters."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"It's so weird because Chicago is awesome! I've been to big cities all over the world and it's still one of my favorite places to visit. Both my kids loved visiting NYC but they would probably rate Chicago almost as high for having fun and interesting things to do as a tourist. And then when they were considering colleges, they both applied to colleges in Chicago. They could see themselves living there and really enjoying it."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Laughs in Baltimore.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"My kind of town.



Seriously, I love Chicago."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,And BoJack Horseman!
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Because most TV writers exist in a world where NYC/LA are the only liveable places on earth.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"It's a small thing but I ha a similar but inverse reaction to the Haunting of Bly Manor and how they portrayed 1980's England. 

In the sense it portrays 1980's England as some sort of fantasy version of 1930's England that in no way relates or connects to the actual 80's in the UK.

And....the thing is, nothing about the show needs it to be set in the 1980s. Not one single thing. They set the show in this time and place that is KNOWN for being a time of HUGE political upheaval and conflict, widespread strikes and riots, mass unemployment. London didn't look like some leafy part of New York City in the 80's.

And....just, the idea that in the 80's, Miles would be expelled over a few violent assaults and a dead dove. That little bastard would be on the fast track to PM. We'd all be suffering his wrath today."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"As someone from the south I laugh at your offense. Anytime there is a show set in the south it's all sister fucking rednecks, trailer parks, the klan and someone eating squirrels."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Blackhawks have had too much success, payback!"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,TV and movies often make San Francisco look affordable.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Yea it looked a lot cleaner in the movies/tv shows
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"The real question is 'why does Netflix hates the audience?'

Holidate, Emily in Paris, Princess Switch... what the actual fuck"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,You think Chicago is portrayed badly? Think abt Atlanta
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I was in Chicago for only 7 hours. Within the 7 hours we saw China town, Sears tower, the Bean, and this was during the Chicago marathon. Its a lot bigger than KCMO and probably has a lot of cool hole in the wall places."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Emily in Paris is just awful regardless of the depiction of Chicago
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,The real question is why does Netflix make trash quality rom coms?
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"To be fair, when it comes to rom-coms being greatly removed from reality, Chicago isn’t at the top of the list."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Cleveland and Detroit get made fun of way more than Chicago, imo."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"The characters in Emily in Paris are so one dimensional. The French are either horny or rude. The Americans are career-driven or uptight. That show is just beautiful people doing vain things. I confess, I watch it because the people are attractive and I like French, my S.O. watches it for the comedy-drama."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I went to Chicago for the first tine last year for the xmas holidays to avoid my family and I loved it. People were nice, it was hardly even cold (must have been an anomaly tho lol) and I had a good time. Then again I'm a city mouse."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I lived in Lincoln Park in Chicago and absolutely loved it, but I worked at banana republic on the magnificent mile and absolutely hated it"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Bojack Horseman makes it seem nice though
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Well isn’t that a true representation.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Is that not what Chicago is?
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I’m from downstate Illinois and we also hate Chicago so idk
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Is this not accurate? Asking from WI
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Chicago is easily my favorite city in the US. Absolutely stunning city.

Wouldn't live there (some bad areas, turns into a giant iceberg for 6 months a year), but I love visiting a few times every year.

Oh and deep dish pizza is fucking amazing and if you disagree you can crawl back to New York"
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"They need to redeem themselves and just give us all the proper Dresden Files adaptation that the human race deserves.

Give it to me Netflix.  Don't force me to bargain with the fae to make this shit happen."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"Because it's part of ""fly over country"", only the coasts matter."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I’m from Florida so I have a very hard time feeling bad for people form Chicago.
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,Pretty sure Holidate was filmed in GA
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,It's almost like the setting for a movie is intended as a prop...
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,I thought The Dark Knight was an accurate representation of Chicago
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"I mean, you guys have that big bean thing too, I guess."
Sleepy Princess in the Demon Castle,"You're talking about chicago, look at how India, Mexico and other developing countries are portrayed in every western movie/TV series.  They make it look like we're still living in 1920"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,[removed]
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"This is interesting. Mr. Rogers had her on in 1975 for the sole purpose of showing kids there’s nothing to be afraid of and that movies are all make believe. 

[link](https://www.metv.com/stories/in-1975-the-wicked-witch-went-on-mister-rogers-so-kids-would-not-be-afraid-of-her)

[YouTube link to the actual segment](https://youtu.be/vEY5EkUR6_M)"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"It aired only once before the complaints that it was too frightening for kids forced the Sesame Street Workshop to take it out of circulation.

After that it was believed lost, considered one of the Holy Grails of lost media. But now a copy has not only been found, but made available for viewing online (after being preserved and restored) by the Library of Congress."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Mr Rogers had Margaret Hamilton on once to show the kids she was just playing dress up. She was wearing normal clothing and no makeup. She put on the wicked witch costume on over her clothing. Mr Rogers didn’t want kids to be afraid of her and I’m wondering if he did that in response to this.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,This is a massive find.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"I like when Big Bird says ""Mr. Looper"", and one of the kids corrects him. lol."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Watch it here https://www.reddit.com/r/lostmedia/comments/vf7yu2/found_sesame_street_847_margaret_hamilton_wicked/
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"I just watched it, i have to say the episode where Bert and Ernie explore the mummy tomb, That episode was so scary as a child"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Was Big Bird gonna straight up beat the piss out of The Wicked Witch with a hockey stick and baseball bat????
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Wow this is incredible: Margaret Hamilton is my great grandmother and it’s super cool seeing her doing work for one of my most beloved childhood shows… that being said i was also terrified of her in Oz so it’s hard to imagine her talking to Big Bird of all people
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"I remember seeing a list of Hollywood’s greatest villains and Darth Vader was listed first - and in many ways rightly so, what an icon of villainy he is, and still is. But I’ve been to 501st Legion cosplay events where little kids will hug a Lord Vader cosplayer. They sort of love him like he’s part toy or maybe they feel for the orphan gone wrong. On the list the Wicked Witch was third, after Hannibal Lecter. I think she should be first. No kids would hug a good cosplaying actress of that in my opinion. The eagerness of those goddamn flying monkeys to serve her didn’t help. She’s terrifying and I’m a middle aged man. Can’t wait to watch this what a character Margaret Hamilton created"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,[Does anyone remember the Crack Monster short?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y0ffj__R4g)
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"The episode itself was never “lost” per se. The whole show (this episode included) was preserved by the Library of Congress years ago, and not “supposedly” like the article said. You had to go down there to view it, but it was available.

The thing that pisses me off is that HBO has the rights to stream every episode, this one included, but only has a smattering of the old ones."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"As a toddler of the late 70s/early 80s, this was the right call at the time lolol"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,r/filmpreservationists
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,BlameItOnJorge’s found media vid about to be lit.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,And Mr Rogers had her on to show kids the costume and she put it on showing that it was not something to be scared of.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I read Margaret Tatcher at first and it would have checked out as well
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,What the hell was the big issue? Because she was dressed up like a witch?
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I'm too scared to watch it
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I like that the kids hang out in a bar that serves water from beer taps.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,When I had my daughter I thought “let’s start Sesame Street at the beginning”. The first episode is like a fever dream/nightmare. Can’t imagine how scary this episode had to be to get complaints about it.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"The piece of lost media I'm hoping gets found sometime is an official Scooby-Doo animation set to Love Potion No. 9. I know it's a thing, but as far as I've been able to find, there's literally nothing even referencing its existence on the Internet at all except for [this single listing on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Potion-No-Scooby-Doo/dp/B07Z1K8K23/) for a cover version of Love Potion No. 9 that claims to be from Scooby-Doo."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"There was one called the ""Crack Monster"" and that was extremely creepy."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"All these years I have been trying to verify if there was a spooky New Zoo Review episode where the owl, hippo, and frog are abducted by an evil force and their heads placed on mantles like game hunting trophies. I swore I saw that back in the 70s as a child but nobody else I know remembers this."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"It was never lost, it just wasn’t available to the public."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I absolutely love her. She was such an awesome person.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I think I remember that episode.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I'm still occasionally of haunted by the episode in the Natural History Museum when Snuffalufagus goes to the Egyptian afterlife and has his heart weighed against a big bird feather.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,She was very multi-talented to do this after programming stacks of code for the Apollo missions!
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,People have no idea how huge this is. I honestly thought I'd never see the day. One of the holy grails of lost media has been found.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Holy moly, I didn’t know they found it!"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Would it be inappropriate to post that we listened to [Free To Be You And Me](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nCUGMMEF2Zk)which I had a copy on 8-track I listened to all the time Rosey Grier, Mel Brooks, Dick Cavett. Marlo Thomas."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Holy shit, I would have loved that as a kid. Glad they’ve preserved it."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I remember being 4 or 5 and going to NC mountains. They had a Wizard of Oz themed place. The witch traumatized me so badddd. I cried and was so scared. Memories
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,*was always preserved by the library of congress. Slightly misleading but now it’s online so good stuff. What a piece of gold.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,The episode from 1974 where Oscar is cursed by a with and he gets a nose scarred me for life.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I remember a Mr Rodgers episode where he had her on.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Funny when he asks her if she wants a cup of coffee and she says she doesn’t drink coffee. A little joke for the adults because she did the Maxwell House coffee ads for years.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,is it too scary for my adult sons to watch?
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,The episode should’ve been brought to you by the leathers O and Z.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"#WHAT?!

This is one of the biggest Lost Media cases of all time!!"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,FUCK YEAH!!
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Those kids are a bunch of babies. I just watched it and it wasn’t scary at all.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"> Although never re-run or made available for home viewing, the episode has reportedly been archived, safe and sound, for years in the Library Of Congress.

I guess possibly mis-filed?"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Cant wait for the Blame it on Jorge video on it
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I just listened to the History Chicks podcasts about this. Beckett(one of the hosts) actually talked about this and she remembers seeing it the one time it aired on TV
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Parents have to be weaker than their kids. If kids could handle Courage the Cowardly Dog then they can handle this.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,This one traumatized me in 1990.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,NO WAY I can’t believe this episode was found! I thought it was just a myth
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,and one day some old producer will die and his family will find a vault of complete dr who episodes he maintained but hid out of spite for the bbc who cut his penison
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Could you imagine what movies like Saw would’ve done in 1976? 😂

Complaints aside. Cool to see the rare footage and the wholesome nature of Sesame Street.

Love Big Bird"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Omg too scary how could a child ever recover from such terror?

And they say people nowadays are snowflakes, WTF is THAT old school snowflake nonsense??"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Couldn’t they teach the kids what is on TV is fake back then? Or was that concept too hard for decent parents to understand?
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I’m currently watching the muppets so how weird to have this pop up on my feed lol.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Sweet, where can I watch it?

Edit: thanks u/nick134"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Let us know when you find the Christine Chubbuck clip? You know the one.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,hell yeah
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,A nice win for lost media archivists everywhere
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Are they gonna save like all the streaming only shows and movies from this era or are we just gonna lose it all?
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Apparently this was found in 2019.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,It was a fun watch. I loved The Wizard of Oz as a kid so this was a treat.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,How can I watch the episode
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,New Childhood Trauma just dropped
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,That's great this has been found
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Excellent
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,TDIL that Sesame Street is congressionally archived.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I want this
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Wait, I’m too young to understand any of this, what’s so scary about it??"
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Wow.  It’s crazy when you have something in a single moment in time and you don’t realize it’s potential importance in the future.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Seeing this makes me want to see more of the 70s sesame street.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Why do I have a memory of seeing this if it never aired? Or did it?
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Oh, I remember that episode. ABC television in Australia showed it."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"As a 70s child, I was absolutely terrified of her. My father tried pointing out that it was the same woman in a Maxwell House or Folgers commercial while the Wizard of Oz aired on TV, but it didn’t help."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,"Cool, but not the Margaret Hamilton I was hoping for."
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,As an adult I find Big Bird lowkey terrifying.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Margaret Hamilton was a wonderful woman.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,“Big Birb goes gangbanging”
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Old Sesame Street is so based
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Wow that’s a neat lol piece of tv history I never knew about . Thank you for sharing .
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,That witch scared the crap out of me as a child. Truly wicked portrayal.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I get it’s rare and all. But too scary? Really?

Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,I saw this episode when I was a kid. This was the most awesome episode ever. People today are too sensitive.
Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina,Seriously this is so awesome! I never thought this would be found again. Or if it was that it would be extremely wonky and horrible quality
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Oscars are not even on the list of things i would consider watching.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Both for me since I live on the west coast. Will watch the Oscars broadcast (supposed to end at 8pm but of course it will go longer) and then stream TLOU finale right after.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Oscars is something you watch highlights from, so I have no issue waiting"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Definitely TLOU, but I’m an apocalypse junkie and do not particularly like movies (prefer serial and books). Enjoy your binge, that’s going to be a ride all at once!"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,TLOU and as soon as I finish and publish my very educated opinion somewhere I'll switch to the Oscar's so I can publish my even more educated opinion somewhere as well.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"used to work for an entertainment magazine and I didn't watch them even back them. If I wasn't on the block and getting paid, I didn't really care. 

It's overly privileged people giving other overly privileged people awards. That's it but the worst is when they give us socially conscious or political messages out of guilt because deep inside they know the show and the thousands of dollars worth of free gifts they get from the gifting suites ( a real thing) and the lavish after parties is kind of grotesque in a country where so many people live hand to mouth."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Oscars air at 5pm PST so I can watch both.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Oscars.  I'll catch up with The Last of Us tomorrow.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I have this new fangled contraption called a DVR.

I'm gonna record both"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I have DizqueTV installed on Plex so I watch my own live channel that I created...I think Magnum, P.I. is on tonight"

Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I have a TV and 2 monitors here in my bedroom so I just saw both, in addition to a football game and having a firefox window open

That said I will admit the oscars became background noise during TLOU. It was like I wasn't even paying attention to what was going on and I could hear it"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I’m watching old episodes of Community tonight
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Neither
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I am not watching either one.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,This sub Reddit has become posts about people who can’t make their own decisions lol.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I don’t think many people watch the Oscars anymore. Honestly I couldn’t care less about watching it *or* who wins. I’ll be watching The Last of Us for sure
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Oscars for me. I'm looking forward to it. Are there dedicated threads to the broadcast on Reddit?
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Neither, I'm going to rewatch this Thai romance I'm stuck on for the 9th time."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I haven't watched the Oscars in years.  Have no interest in that anymore.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"The Last of Us

I stopped watching the Oscar's when the first Avatar movie was nominated for Best Picture. It's been undistinguishable from the people's choice awards ever since."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Oscars: 3+ hrs, TLoU: <1 hr.

Doesn't have to be either/or"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"neither, I'll stream TLOU later and the Oscars are an embarassing display of idiocy. Deep Space Nine for me"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Why would I watch the Oscar’s for 3 hours? When I can watch a few tik toks with the highlights?

At least with TLOU, I get 60 minutes of  compelling story."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I don't think I've seen an Oscars ceremony my whole life.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I have no intrest in the Oscars.    But if I did, I would HAVE TO Tivo it so I could skip the commercials.    So, I would watch tlou while the Oscars was recording."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I would rather watch golf than an award show and I don’t play or understand golf.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Probably going to watch Billions 🤷🏼‍♀️
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Both, LOU first, then record oscars and fast forward the commercials to catch up to live broadcast"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Both because I really want/hope to see Brendan Fraser win.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,The slap wasn't even broadcast last year. I used to love watching big awards shows but I get the same joy reading about someone I like winning as if I was watching live so I'll watch other stuff and last of us and keep an eye on the winners via what we er has a bit obnoxious live page.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I’m a giant movie nerd and watched every single nominee so I’ll watch the Oscars and watch last of us tomorrow. I never watch shows when they air. Don’t tell me when to watch!!! Haha
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,TLOU
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Both? On the West Coast the Oscars are on from 5-8. There's still a lot of night left after that.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I didn't realize that was tonight. I will probably just check out Variety or NYT, somewhere that has live updates. And then sometime next week I might watch a couple highlights on YouTube."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"i realized earlier in the week that tonight is the last episode and it made me sad. a tv show hasn't done that in a long time, lol this season went by *way* too quick.

even tho it's the original creators and HBO, i'm pleasantly surprised they didn't milk out the source material as much as they could have. i was totally expecting the first game to be two seasons of tv."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"World Baseball Classic

Go USA!"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I might tune for a quick second if there's another slap. Otherwise, I can wait to read up on who won tomorrow."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Anyone have a stream for the Oscars?
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I DVR everything and don't watch anything live.

I'm looking forward to watching the Orcars later today. Usually I'm not interested but with EEAAO getting so many nominations I'll make an exception."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Didn't even know they were on till I saw this post
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Thanks :)
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Good for you, neither of them are really worth the waste of time."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"OP made their decision, was just a conversation starter :/"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,About 16 million watched last year. So people definitely still watch. Just not anywhere close to where it used to be. I think it’ll probably be more this year.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Didn’t realize 15-17million people wasn’t that many people
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Usually on /r/movies
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Lol what? The Oscars to this day are constantly dogged on for awarding stuff the general audience doesn't watch or care about.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I heard it was only like 43 or something! Could be wrong. Heard it was a quick episode tonight.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Thanks :)
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Thanks!
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,They extended best picture nominees from 5 to 10 years ago in response to that criticism. Just look at the nominees from the last 15 years.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"It's the finale, there's no way it's 43 minutes"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,But it is tho?
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World, Source?
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"If you check HBO's schedule, it's listing it at 47 minutes.

https://www.hbo.com/schedule"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"If u can’t be bothered to look it up, literally takes 1 minute. Than you’ll have the answer in about 2hours"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"So, you don't have a source. Should have led with that."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Yeah and I was right. Have a good day weirdo.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Linda deserves this!
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Happy that Linda is being rediscovered, though too bad it wasn't a song she has the rights to. ""Running up that Hill"" was written and composed by Kate Bush, so she made an awful lot of money from that, Linda won't see much in terms of financial benefit from this song."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I'm standing in line at CVS currently and it's playing on the store radio
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Prior to this my only reference for Linda Ronstadt was the Mr. Plow episode of the Simpsons.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I don't think it did really, it's not in the billboard hot 100 or anything. For context Running Up That Hill peaked at number 3 on billboard due to Stranger Things and was on the charts for months after."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Long Long Time has been my favorite song since I first heard it in the early 70s. I've been a Linda Ronstadt fan since I heard her sing Different Drum with the Stone Poneys.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Linda Ronstadt was a huge part of my childhood with Kevin Kline in Pirates of Penzance, we used to watch it all the time. Such an amazing voice."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Did Depeche Mode get a bump too? I lost my shit when Never Let Me Down Again played at the end of the pilot. It made me anticipate the next episode even more knowing that song came out in the 80s.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I was hoping it was a megadeth tape that they found in the truck.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"“Mr. Plow is a loser and I think he is a boozer, so you better make that call to the Plow King!”"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Good for her. I'll take Alone and Forsaken by Hank personally but some solid music thus far in the show.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Anyone looking to find out more about Linda's unbelievable career should check out her documentary, The Sound of My Voice.  If you're a solo female rock artist, you owe Linda a debt for all the trails she blazed for you."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I like this song, but am much more into the Depeche Mode song they play at the end of Episode 1!"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Glad it introduced me to it, it's a gorgeous song"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Surprised, scrolled through comments in this thread and didn't see any links to the song"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Today I lost my shit in a museum all thanks to a video installation of Linda Ronstadt.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Love seeing Seth Rudetsky, that was unexpected"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I, personally, cannot stop listening to it"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I love how much old music is coming back into the spotlight. Streaming and social media have their flaws but it's really cool that when a good song is from is becoming a non issue
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I love this :) I dig this phenomenon, good music is good music regardless of age or era. There's superb jazz being made today and excellent pop made decades ago, just as an example. Linda's an excellent singer and I'm sure many people will be as blown away by her now as I was first listening to her years ago (and even then she already had a very established career), and that's a great feeling that everyone should get to experience."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I have listened to this song probably 30 times since that episode. 

2 things I’ve learned…

1. She has an amazing voice 
2. She was fine AF"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I like Jesse Welles’ version from The Rockford files, but then again I really like Jesse Welles!!"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,My grandma had an old 70’s gran marquis wagon and the only 8 track in it was Linda Ronstadt’s greatest hits. She has been like a forgotten treasure or something lately.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I’m happy I was a kid in the best decade of music EVER.  i watched the Grammys the other night and thought Meh.  Occasionally a song comes out I like but the 70’s was packed with bands making music that has stood the test of time.  Now, will someone please call me a Boomer."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,The band Townland has a great cover of Long Long Time on their new album.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I support this trend of older songs becoming popular with new listeners through TV and movies. Or even through TikTok like Fleetwood Mac's Dreams did that one time.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I have that record on vinyl, got it from my mom, as my first vinyl record"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"HBO's marketing machine is very functional.  They have an incredible ""relationship"" with the press, making things look bigger than they are.  There's no real sign of a hit from this song, which is off any music streaming daily charts."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,She’s great on The Muppet Show
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Its a shame it is being review bombed by homophobes. This was the best episode of television I've seen in years!
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"""WELL ACTUALLY RUNNING UP THAT HILL  HAD MORE STREAMS"" lets us know who to avoid"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Never had any interest in Linda Ronstadt (beyond loving the song named after her by AJJ) until after I watched this episode. I’ve since listened to Long Long Time multiple times and it’s nearly made me cry every time because it makes me think of this episode
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"I forgot how dope Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” was until ST reminded me. 

I appreciate shows bringing back classics to reminds how dope they are. Also Linda Ronstadt has some bangers. “Different Drum” is one of my all time favs."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Linda Ronstadt?! How'd you get her?
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"""Love Is a Rose"" is another one by her that needs to be rediscovered"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Seems to be a common trend. 
Popular tv show plays old classic that appeals to another generation. 

Popular music is popular again."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"She’s always been at the top of my list. Do yourself a favor and listen to her album “Canciones de mi Padre,” one of my all-time favorites."
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,"Ronstadt feels like family to me. My mom learned how to sing from listening to her records, and taught me and my sister to sing. Linda just sounds like my mom, to me. I was all caps in our group chat after the episode and by the end of the week my sister sent me a rough demo of her singing and playing Long Long Time and I was like dammit you beat me to it XD"
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Watching Veronica Mars at the moment and that song showed up in a series 3 episode there the day after I heard it in TLOU. Weird coincidence.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,I've heard Linda Ronstadt's name and music more times this year than  in my entire life.  Wild.
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World,Is every big budget creature fighting/suspense show gonna try to resurrect an 80’s banger since it got Stranger Things so much free press? Cause if so that’ll become a fascinating trope.
Domestic Girlfriend,Wow. I’m surprised anyone even remembers 24:Legacy. Everyone knew it was a joke and it bombed hard. Jack Bauer was 24 and without Kiefer there was no show.
Domestic Girlfriend,I haven’t seen the show but I enjoyed reading this essay about it. Thanks.
Domestic Girlfriend,"I think it’s interesting that you’re focusing almost exclusively on the *politics* of the show rather than treat as just a piece of storytelling or a piece of entertainment. You seem to be unwilling to digest the show as just a show, and are instead observing it through a prism of your own making.

I’ve never watched this season specifically because it did not involve Kiefer Sutherland, thus making it feel like a waste of everyone’s time. I saw all of the other seasons as they aired back in the day, and it definitely had a mix of really good and really boring seasons. By it’s very nature, the only way to think back on this show is by treating each season as totally unique and separate from the rest. BUT, taken as a whole, 24 was schlocky entertainment that helped usher a new era of television, so overall it was pretty damn cool.

I don’t even agree with a lot of the politics of the show, specifically the constant glorification of torture as being a justifiable method of interrogation. But I’m intelligent enough to understand the difference between reality and fiction. So to me it was just entertaining, campy, fun, those are the words I would use to describe it.

So it’s interesting reading your comment, and feeling like you did not perceive even one minute of it as a piece of entertainment. You only perceive it as a sort of political statement, and thus your entire criticism is centered on those politics. It’s just an interesting form of criticism, but I don’t think it is all that fair."
Domestic Girlfriend,If you say so.  24 had run its course long before Legacy was released.
Domestic Girlfriend,I think if they had managed to find some way to make legacy feel like it's own thing while in the same universe it would've worked. Also I only remember it cause I was basically forced to by roommate/fuck buddy three months ago lol
Domestic Girlfriend,If there was anything of actual entertainment value I could have looked past it. Hell a lot of action shows and movies are problematic as hell. But if they're doing what they do well I can mostly ignore while check noting it in the back of my head. This show doesn't even have the benefit of having a good story so yeah I ended up focusing on the shit that bothered me quite a bit. Also you must have had to have jumped straight to the end of this post to think I only focused on the politics of the show
Domestic Girlfriend,I never got past season four outside of this so I really couldn't tell you
Domestic Girlfriend,You missed out. Season 5 is the best season of the show.
Domestic Girlfriend,"We all do dumb shit but most of us are lucky enough to have a support system that makes it a life lesson and not a tragedy. But I agree it was frustrating to see her making slow and steady progress, then do something really dumb."
Domestic Girlfriend,"I only watched an episode or 2 of the series. I read the book and I thought the same thing about her ‘memoir’. I couldn’t finish the book because, when she was with the 2nd boyfriend, things weren’t perfect, but she had been thinking about having a baby with him. Damn girl, your first child took her first steps in a homeless shelter. The last think you need is another child."
Domestic Girlfriend,"I searched the title of this show in this sub to find references. I'm SO relieved to find I'm not the only one who absolutely hated the moronic ""choices"" this character kept indulging in. Always professing one thing and acting another. Keeps constantly throwing herself overboard with moronic decisions. She *earned* her fate with her absolute resolve to never see the results of her own decisions. Got to face consequences. I don't think I can finish this series, the main character is so profoundly blind to her own stupidity.

EDIT: I absolutely agree, Alex is the victim of her own repeated, idiotic decisions. First rule of thumb, when you find yourself in a hole, STOP DIGGING."
Domestic Girlfriend,there's a lot of caps locking about her abusive ex-boyfriend and you didn't for a moment consider that this is part of the cycle of domestic abuse?
Domestic Girlfriend,I too felt the same!!!!! Every single time....
Domestic Girlfriend,The main protagonist deserved everything that happened to her. I was amazed how every time she started to get ahead she would throw it in the trash by making the worst decisions she could.
Domestic Girlfriend,"I honestly don’t understand how can she be so ignorant, careless…although the story is very sad and she is a victim of domestic abuse, you can’t just the child in the middle of the night, with no plan and no resources. And when you do receive valuable help, you just take the dumbest decisions ever. Dumb, dumb, dumb and everything that keeps happening to her are the consequences of her own decisions."
Domestic Girlfriend,"I am watching now. Every episode I am amazed at how she manages to completely fuck everything up. Beyond normal comprehension. It's like she says, what is the worst possible decision to make, and then does that. I think the birthday party really has been the worst (SO FAR). Just like... DV is rough, she did have bad things happen, all of this is very traumatic. This does NOT stop a person knowing right from wrong. There is not enough of a face palm emoji for this lady."
Domestic Girlfriend,"TBH I didn't read any of your wall of text.

But, I agree with your title. 

Additionally, the series was boring and predictable at best. I loved Queens Gambit, it went against traditional tropes and had great characters.

Maid seemed to have a similar following and media attention. But it was so forgettable. I kept wondering when it would be good or entertaining. It didn't happen."
Domestic Girlfriend,You're absolutely right on all of this. You'll also get downvoted to 0 since Reddit loves victim porn.
Domestic Girlfriend,"Thank you.  THANK YOU😂people really try to explain this stuff away but just stop…no. I didn’t get why people were hating on this saying she trashed to many opportunities just to continue the desperate Alex plot, but man I get if.  Personally shit I would have given Sean a second chance when he really had his shit together, i at least woulda gave Nate a shot considering he was such a good hearted man that generally liked and cared for her NO CAUSE HE WanTeD To fUCk Her😂🤬but she threw both those away. Don’t get me started on how her dad really changed and really wanted to help…more less Regina in the end.  Come to my mansion I came in the middle of the night to pick you up I have a guest room for you, nah just take me and daughter to a DV shelter…man idk."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Alpha fucks Beta bucks the series, lol. Good for Nate though!"
Domestic Girlfriend,I didn't know this was based on a true story.
Domestic Girlfriend,"I did. It's just not the angle I chose to take when I posted my rant. I also know that the character's actions reflect a deeply flawed, or total lack, of a healthy sense of self-worth. Alex seems to lack any foundation of self-respect and doesn't seem to feel as if she deserves anything but the worst. Her childhood was obviously garbage. But there's a point where we have to stop wallowing and blaming and climb out of these fucked up patterns of behavior. I'm speaking from personal experience.  But everything aside it all makes for scream-at-the screen television."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Thank you for ""listening""...golly..."
Domestic Girlfriend,Yeah people actually do dumb stuff in real life.  Shocking I know.
Domestic Girlfriend,A Netflix adaptation of a 'true' story is a spurious thing at best.  For the now cancelled adaptation of 'Lucky' they fired a producer who objected to race-swapping a character.  The now ex-producer hired a private investigator because he thought the whole thing stank to high heaven.  PI finds out the woman who wrote the book fingered the wrong guy as her attacker with enough evidence to get the conviction overturned.
Domestic Girlfriend,"I can understand not liking the execution of how the story was told, and maybe that’s your point here, but escaping depression, negative self worth,PTSD and the cycle of abuse aren’t things you get over by telling yourself “stop being sad”, that’s some /r/thanksImCured stuff.

I’m not saying we absolve people of responsibility but at least allow grace and understanding for those who can’t overnight stop being sad and not let past incidents impact their ability to make the right decision."
Domestic Girlfriend,Flash in the pan nonsense that would’ve gotten no press if Zendaya wasn’t in it
Domestic Girlfriend,i watch euphoria for the chili subplots
Domestic Girlfriend,That's a lot of words to say that it's completely degenerate and subversive propaganda. When my teenage daughter gets out of jail I'm not letting her watch anything like this
Domestic Girlfriend,😐 did you watch pass episode 1 or...
Domestic Girlfriend,😂😂😂 What!?
Domestic Girlfriend,Be careful. As a Latino I can tell you millions of women (and some men) have fallen victim to those Brazilian soaps. Beating Mexico soaps too.
Domestic Girlfriend,Is this available in Canada? Need to check out.
Domestic Girlfriend,"A bit late, but what do you mean?"
Domestic Girlfriend,Yea. Of course.
Domestic Girlfriend,"For fuck's sake, isn't the host Asian? Would love to see her confront them on this once their asses are kicked off."
Domestic Girlfriend,"While I'm not an Aaryn fan at all, I'd like to point out that this:

> ""You want crystal ball on your nail? I make you shine like a star in the sky, look so pretty. You say want long nail I try and help you. Why you no have boyfriend? Because you no have long nail. I try and help you... It's only four dolla more.""

wasn't technically mocking Helen. She'ss actually quoting(horribly I might add) a bit from comedian [Anjelah Johnson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=baDJ-ZIvYy0#t=385s).
"
Domestic Girlfriend,"It's almost like they casted real people. The entire premise of the show is that they take ordinary people and lock them in a house together for weeks. When you film average people 24/7 you are not going to get a perfect politically correct commentary. This crap ranged from stereotypical jokes to straight horrible racist homophobic remarks, which is exactly what you should have expected, I don't know how it is a surprise. "
Domestic Girlfriend,"honestly for some of them, like Nick and Judd's for example, I feel like people are being a little too sensitive. You know who the racist ones are and you know when people are't calling them on it or (like Nick and David) and simply listening to the house guests go on a tangent, they're playing the game. Unfortunately two of the biggest biggots have the most power in the game right now"
Domestic Girlfriend,[deleted]
Domestic Girlfriend,"You should cross-post to /r/bigbrother, there's way more than just what's on that video. Also I think joker's update is keeping a log."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Please tell me I am not the only one who hears Eddie Vedder talking when Judd speaks. Everytime i hear him, i laugh to myself, do the voice and introduce the song ' daughter ' LOL. BTW [Jay Mohr does the best impression](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtZEAzX3w-k)"
Domestic Girlfriend,"This list is amazing, thanks for compiling it! I'm the one who made the video, by the way. You got almost everything right, but there are just a few small corrections.

-It was actually GinaMarie that said n****r insurance.

-It was Amanda, not Kaitlin that talked about Helen, Howard, and Andy being outcasts.

-Spencer said ""Fuck it?, she's gonna lay over here and stink up my space."" about Candice.

-Amanda also called McCrae McQueer after Jeremy called him queerboy.

-After Amanda said that thing about chinamen, Jeremy said ""Helen is Korean"", and Amanda said ""Same thing!""

-When Jeremy said Elissa had Michael Jackson's surgeon, Spencer chimed in by saying he hoped she had his doctor, Conrad Murray because he killed him with propofol or something similar, not sure.

-I don't think Kaitlin said ""black n*****"", I think she said ""my n*****"", but it was really hard to tell.

-Nick said all the girls were on his shit list.

Again, this is great! Well, not what they said, but that you've put it all together."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Ugh, and I liked Amanda. Now I find her worse than Aaryn.  Who jokes about raping and killing someone? What horrible people. CBS should be ashamed.

I'm seriously sick to my stomach after reading all of that."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Shut the fuck up, already.  It's not that serious. "
Domestic Girlfriend,"Yeah, I get that, but I don't go around quoting Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock like I'm [Michael Scott](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeQIQuDL8aA) or something."
Domestic Girlfriend,"I don't think people who joke and calmly discuss murdering someone and raping their dead body are ordinary. I'd actually say they are extra ordinarily sick if you ask me, but hey, we might run with different crowds and have different levels of expectation ;)"
Domestic Girlfriend,"Thanks, and I agree, I removed Judd's because that is the only time I saw anything with him (which admittedly wasn't really of consequence), and his laugh was probably a, ""these people are fucked up"" uncomfortable laugh.

But Nick seems to be one of those tag along types from what I've seen, so I'm leaving them up for now... He definitely isn't any where near as bad as the others, but giving them a willing audience only eggs the real bigots on."
Domestic Girlfriend,The biggest problem is that young people will watch this garbage horse shit of a show and there is absolutely no narrative or clarification to them that this is all plain wrong.
Domestic Girlfriend,"Thanks! Made just about all of those edits I think... Wasn't sure on the exact Nick quote, I'll look it up later and add it in."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Also, I'm not sure who Amanda Zuckerman was referring to when she fantasized about killing and raping another house guest with her fellow scumbags, but if it was Candice Stewart or Helen Kim, she is the worst kind of bigot.

I doubt she would ever hurt someone, (though I wouldn't vouch for her), but she could incite a sick person to hurt someone with remarks like that if she says them around a really deranged person who is infatuated by her."
Domestic Girlfriend,Thanks for your comment!
Domestic Girlfriend,Someone's never played an online game.
Domestic Girlfriend,">I don't think people who joke and calmly discuss murdering someone and raping their dead body are ordinary.

Yea, they were totally being 100% serious.

Do you have Asperger's or something?"
Domestic Girlfriend,They're talking about raping and killing Jessie.
Domestic Girlfriend,"Lol, dude fuck you.

You can judge some people by the way they joke. It's not like I thought they were conspiring, I think the fact that you joke about using people's blood as lube and how it's easier to do anal when they are dead because their muscles relax is fucked up, and a real scum bag thing to do.

Look, you keep accusing people of being overly sensitive or having Asperger's (I'm guessing this is a common tactic you use? Classy!) when they point this out, and I'm glad to be on the other side of the argument."
Domestic Girlfriend,"I think the fact here is you're an oversensitive little bitch who cries at anything that isn't 100% politically correct. You've even called out people up there for using the word ""retarded"". How do you survive in the real world? Do you just break down crying every few minutes you happen to hear such terrible things? 

"
Domestic Girlfriend,"Why would it bother you that someone would post these things that were actually said by these people? They are their actual words, should they not be judged by them?  If people don't take offense, that's their prerogative, but the fact that you're getting so upset about people being called out for this leads me to believe that this is the way you behave and speak."
Domestic Girlfriend,">Why would it bother you that someone would post these things that were actually said by these people?

Where did I say it bothered me that these things were posted? And who's the one getting upset here? 

>Lol, dude fuck you.

lol.

Oh, and just like the OP, your account was registered today and you only have posts about this Big Brother incident. Sockpuppet much?"
Domestic Girlfriend,"If you're trying to imply that the OP and I are the same person, we aren't. I was the person who made the video they're referencing in this post which is why I'm posting here. I don't really go on reddit, but saw that my video was being discussed, so I made an account so I could comment. And you're clearly bothered or you wouldn't keep posting about it. "
Domestic Girlfriend,">And you're clearly bothered or you wouldn't keep posting about it. 

Yes, people only have discussions when they're bothered by things. That's literally the only reason there are discussions, it's impossible to just be disagreeing. The hypocrisy in not pointing out the guy literally saying ""fuck you"" to people is actually upset goes unmentioned. 

It's definitely not because you're both Big Brother fanboys with some hard-on for political correctness. Nope."
Domestic Girlfriend,"BTW, good job on the video edit, how ling did it take I wonder?

I transcribed it in hopes it would be search indexed down the road so they might be held accountable for their words. But this can only be relevant (however unlikely) because you took the time to make an excellent video."
Domestic Girlfriend,">Lol, dude fuck you.

I think it's funny he is so indignant about my line when you consider he mused whether or not I had a serious mental illness in his previous post. It's like he's surprised someone would say, ""fuck you"" when he suggests they have Asperger's or something.

It's hardly surprising though, out of curiosity I clicked his post history, just a few posts in he accused someone of being bipolar. This is his mode of operation. Get progressively more belligerent during an innocuous argument, and then accuse them of being mentally ill. 

When you reconsider he thinks having a discussion about murdering and raping someone is completely normal, I think his quick trigger to accuse others of having mental disorders is self indicative."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Well, you clearly came in here looking for some sort of fight since almost immediately you asked OP if tey as aspergers.

Also, I'm not male and sorry that I make a point to not offend people with what I say and get upset when other people don't."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Thanks! I'm not totally sure how long it took, but I worked on it for three nights for about 1-3 hours per night, but I'd probably estimate 6-7 hours total. It really helped that the site I post about BB at kept a post that people would chronicle the horrible things the hgs said and have posts with running commentary so I got flashback to a minute or so before someone posted about a racist/sexist, etc thing someone said.

And I was definitely thinking along the same lines as you because I made the video to make sure that the people wouldn't get away with what they're saying."
Domestic Girlfriend,">It's hardly surprising though, out of curiosity I clicked his post history, just a few posts in he accused someone of being bipolar. This is his mode of operation. Get progressively more belligerent during an innocuous argument, and then accuse them of being mentally ill. 

You know what's funny? How completely **retarded** you have to be to think this. I asked someone if they had a mental disorder *and they told me they were bipolar*. I didn't ""accuse"" anyone of anything. 

Reading comprehension goes a long way."
Domestic Girlfriend,"Maybe I asked OP if they had Asperger's because they showed symptoms of someone with Asperger's?

Just a thought. 

>Also, I'm not male 

What does that have to do with anything? ""hard-on for political correctness"" is a figure of speech, not an actual erection.

Domestic Girlfriend,"I'm so sorry.

Honestly, please accept my apology, because I am so wrong. I passed judgement on you and I was wrong. Aside from the fact you threw it in their face without knowing, you were in fact right and I'm sure they were glad in the end that you attacked them like that. I initially just glanced at your posts for a second because to be honest, at the time, I just didn't really give a fuck about you and that comment caught my eye.

I have since rechecked your posts and honestly, I don't know how anyone could think that maybe you're a mentally unstable asshole. That was totally wrong of me and I am deeply sorry.

Please accept my apology from the bottom of my heart, I really didn't mean to suggest you were a rude, inconsiderate prick, or that most people you encounter on a day to day basis probably walk away from your interaction wishing they never had the misfortune of suffering your company. I was wrong, you really seem like a nice guy.

Good bye!"
Domestic Girlfriend,I'll definitely add it later when I get a chance. Thanks again for putting it all together!
Domestic Girlfriend,"So you got even more mad and wrote an essay. Nice.

Sorry your submission got buried for being shitty!"
Domestic Girlfriend,I'M NOT MAD!!!
Over Christmas,"In the US we tend to stop airing new episodes of shows during Christmas Break.  It's expected and normal. Mostly I think you can assume because people watch less TV during holiday times, but I don't know for certain. 

Our television schedule is much more strictly structured, too.  Seasons (or series) tend to start uniformly a few times a year with Fall premieres and Winter premieres. "
Over Christmas,"Thankyou. This is exactly what I was looking for. Is there generally a time when they boot back up? 
Unfortunately in the UK, much of our TV doesn't live up to my high expectations. "
Over Christmas,"I use this website: returndates.com, for most part it helps."
Over Christmas,I liked seeing Kurt calling Dexter out on his justification for killing people.
Over Christmas,The clown low-key looked like Phoenix’s Joker.
Over Christmas,"My guess is that it is going to end with Harrison having to kill Angela because the code that Dexter just put in him was, ""Don't get caught"". So Harrison kills Angela and now Dexter has to decide what to do with Harrison. Does he kill him like he killed his brother and end up forever alone, or does he say fuck it, let's go amurderin.


If they want to end the show, they kill Harrison."
Over Christmas,"I was split at first, but they've won me over now. I think they have things planned out, and all of the choices I was iffy on were 100% made for the right reasons. I just hope the good ratings don't make Showtime try to force more seasons than Clyde Phillips had planned for."
Over Christmas,"I will admit, I didn't see the twist with Molly coming. You'd think after being saved once, she'd be in the clear.

Also, while Harrison was definitely believing Dexter's justifications originally, likely more to make himself feel less like a monster, you could definitely see the wheels turning during the confrontation with Kurt on the table, and seeing Dexter savor the experience."
Over Christmas,"I am so sad that after the next week episode...we have no more dexter show to look forward to.

i hope they find away to keep the show going, we don't know what the ending is, but the actor can still deliver that original dexter show, and i loved the flash back episode explaining everything again.

&#x200B;

The ratings are amazing for this, and i think the last episode got a massive boost as well. 

As long as they dont pull a GOT final season ending..they have a real winner here and hopefully the network is willing to pick up for new seasons while the actor is also willing to keep going."
Over Christmas,"> episode title

Killing people, ~~hunting things~~ barely covering it up. The family business."
Over Christmas,"So does Dexter have a mutant healing factor or something? Dude flew through a car window, and got shot in the leg. Didn't see evidence of either in this episode."
Over Christmas,"This episode was good in showing Dexter, from Harrison's eyes, that Dexter is just a serial murderer. He sounded really delusional in this episode. 

Next episode, they're probably going to find Dexter's trophy of Matt. That's going to leave Angela with no doubt about who Dexter is and for Harrison, confirm that Dexter is no different.

Now that Dexter gave her that arrest book, I'm wondering if they're going to end it roughly the same way it started with Dexter being pulled over by Angela on the side of the road."
Over Christmas,"So good. 

Last episode got 8.2 million viewers, that’s massive

Big numbers yet I don’t see it talked about anywhere except here of course"
Over Christmas,"Some are hypothesizing that Harrison will Dexter, but I find it more likely that Harrison will kill Angela (her being the only one who knows dexter is the BHB) and then boom Kurt Caldwell is still guilty & all that good stuff"
Over Christmas,The killings by Dexter this entire season were slow but it was worth seeing how crazy Kurt is. I wasn't expecting to see that he collected all of his victims and seeing the YouTube vlog girl in there was hella sad. I think father and son will run away to another rural city and this will be the ongoing theme for every season assuming there are future seasons.
Over Christmas,"Dexter is going to be a valid target for Harrison, if he follows the code of Harry.  I feel that that is where the finale is heading."
Over Christmas,i’m still annoyed by angela “figuring everything out” by this huge ketamine plot hole 😒
Over Christmas,Waiting for dead deb to knock him out and take over
Over Christmas,"No, Harrison will not be killing Angela to keep her quiet. Angela doesn't fit the code nor will she ever. Angela is already on Team Vigilante with Dexter and Harrison, just, Dexter's audience doesn't realize this. How? Easy ... Angela has already proven to keep a huge secret, Jim's true identity which is of course, Dexter Morgan. Also, she will soon learn that Kurt did in fact kill her friend Iris ( she already suspects after Kurt's arrest but she will finally have confirmation ) as well as all those other women that Kurt killed and moth-balled. She might struggle with not following the law and enforcing it but she will give in to allowing Dexter to keep his secret and do his necessary work. I doubt they will ever be a couple again tho. How this happens exactly is unclear but I do not see her or Dexter doing this together in a new season. It just goes against who she is as a Police Officer. This was a very good episode. I pray to sweet Jesus that Dexter will return for a new season and reprising his role as Jim aka Dexter Morgan .. But ... BUT ... I don't see this happening, not is that small sleepy town. There isn't enough action to support Dexter's need to bring bad people to justice in that small town. So as it stands now, logic points to this being a one and done season. I really believe that Dexter dies at the end of this season. I hope I am proven wrong and that both Dexter and Harrison go off into the sunset only to set foot somewhere else. I really don't know. I do not like my logic and hope I am wrong but common sense is screaming at me. Also, there is no way Dexter's sister ( Jennifer Carpenter ) keeps coming back over and over again as the voice of reason for her Brother. That actress would never ever reprise a role like this season after season. In an interview, Michael C. Hall has said he hopes that this ""limited"" Dexter season answers a lot of questions that fans of the series have been looking for. I am not sure I would be a fan of a new Dexter series staring his Son Harrison but, I don't think that would happen. We can't stick Harrison into a new series as there is no history or depth to the character. What could happen is that Dexter and Harrison escape away and that the audience will be left guessing. I expect some twist of the knife so to speak at the end. I really do not think Dexter will be killed ( yes I am contradicting myself from my statement several lines up ) I saw this because there is no way in hell that the show would allow Harrison to lose both parents. So, maybe, Dexter is arrested. I dunno. My gut literally hurts that I have to wait another week. Dexter will always and forever be on my top 10 list of favorite things in life and trust me, that list is short and very special. This list has my very first love, how much I love Led Zeppelin, my favorite movie of all time, The Big Lebowski, etc so, it's a pretty special list. And I am proud that Dexter is on that list."
Over Christmas,I think Dexter's girlfriend finds out and is okay with it once she realizes how many people Kurt killed. They will end up together
Over Christmas,"I think ""New Blood"" as a title is about Harrison being the new Dexter. Showtimes seeing way too much money from this to let it go. 

Dexter gets caught and the set up is pretty good. Remember what doesn't burn? Well its in the ashes of his cabin and Angela is going to find it and realize the screws match between the one Kurt left for her and the one in the ashes of the cabin. Dexter will be arrested for sure. Shes going to try to make him take the blame for the killings in the area and also killing Molly. He could reveal Kurts trophy room, but that really doesn't explain away Matt. I don't think at that moment she will have enough to hold him though. Angela will hold most of what she suspects to herself and will make calls to Miami which either will take time to get return calls from OR someone from the old cast will make a special visit from Miami.

The heat will be on Dexter now even though he had to be released. The clocks ticking. I think its very possible Harrison kills Angela thinking hes doing the right thing in saving Dexter ( I mean he is a teenager after all) and I think Dexter will take the fall for it to save Harrison and everything will start to come apart. However I don't see Dexter as a person who will go to jail, I do see him as someone who will allow Harrison to escape while he leads the police on a crazy goose chase in which he is killed in gun fire. Dexter at the end will make the ultimate sacrifice for his son in which he shows Harrison exactly how much he loved him. 

The end. Harrison spinoff ""New Blood"" begins a 8 season run.

I think Dexter Morgan is going to be gone. Anyone not realizing how much Hall was ready to end Dexter for so many years is fooling themselves. Hall has always wanted to character to meet an ending that is final. I am not sure he really loves Dexter as a character. I think this was absolutely part of his agreement to come back. I would bet he was insitant that this was going to be the end of Dexter. He's made a lot of comments over the years and one of them was he was a little creeped out that fans would ask him to do things for photo ops he wasn't ok with. He also began to become bitter over his biggest role being Dexter from what I have gathered over the years.  So I think Halls agreement had to be on his terms to return and that term is that Dexter is dead when this is over.

Will he still work as Harrisons ""Deb""? Maybe he can probably get paid nice for an apparance a few times a year, and the show is set up for that to happen. But I do think Dexter will die."
Over Christmas,"Honestly I watched this episode with major anxiety, the thought of dexter getting caught or killed would really ruin this for me 😢 watching Dexter be so frantic and not being able to sense Angela’s distant behaviour has me stressed hahahaha, they’ve done so well with this series I hope dexters still around for a season 2
Edit: spelling"
Over Christmas,"So molly who literally studies serial killers for a living, had a creepy encounter with kurt, has to get saved by dexter, still somehow ends up dead? Like what? If i was her i would have reported the incident and then left town"
Over Christmas,"So in this episode Dexter tells Harrison he killed trinity for what he did to Rita, but he had already killed Trinity before he found out Rita was dead. So is Dexter deliberately lying to Harrison to save face about what led to his moms death? Or is this another plot slip up?"
Over Christmas,Could it be that the big surprise in the finale is that Harrison is not Harrison?
Over Christmas,So it seems like Harrison is on board with dexter style justice but he might have to find his own way of doing it and his own kill room. Dexter saw his mom dismembered with a chainsaw so that’s how he chops up bodies. Seemed like that was a bit much for Harrison. But I think the show will probably end with Dexter dying or getting caught and Harrison continuing on the tradition
Over Christmas,Dexter as the dark passenger voice is such a neat idea I can't see anything other than it happening.
Over Christmas,Mery fucking kill how did that happen. She didn't even fit the bill. Also the first time he was desperate and idk why she would follow him into an unknown cabin and go in the basement when she should know she's a serial killer podcaster who thought she would be smarter. Wonder how he got her this time prob kidnapped her. She still didn't fit his code though. Also why target such high profile victims she has an army of detectives remember she said this to Angele and was able to find out about some of the missing girls. Her fans would find her this wouldn't go quietly.
Over Christmas,"It’s been a while since I saw the original run, but did we ever see Dexter chop up the bodies so … vividly like we did in this episode? That was an excellent was of having the audience see Harrison’s view of things."
Over Christmas,"Still a few loose end plot holes that if aren’t resolved completely undermine the credibility of this series as a whole and ruins it really. 

The whole ketamine/m99 and syringe thing first of all. Now it’s likely that only Dexter knew about M99 bring his drug of choice since when Masuka saw the syringe and had that dead lady tested in season 1 and found M99, that victim was never attributed to the Bay Harbor butcher (and Dexter subsequently eliminated any trace of how he obtained the M99). In season 2 when the victims of BHB were found, Dexter messed up the refrigerator so they couldn’t do any toxicology reports I believe, but how did they did they not notice any of the syringe marks?? In the photos of the bodies in this New Blood episode, the syringe marks are clearly focused on but I don’t remember this ever being focus of Miami Metro and the FBI in original shows investigation… and now thinking about it, it seems incredulous no one would have noticed those marks lol….So how did the syringe and ketamine get attributed to Doakes? To my knowledge, this was never established in the original series, so I surely hope they explain this. Otherwise it’s just terrible on the writers part. And then how did Dexter end up coincidentally using the same drug that has somehow now mysteriously been attributed to Doakes as the BHB?

Lastly, Dexter tells Harrison he killed trinity for what he did to Rita, but he had already killed Trinity before he found out Rita was dead. So is Dexter deliberately lying to Harrison to save face about what led to his moms death? Or is this another slip up?"
Over Christmas,I think watching Dex try to be ‘normal’ and celebrate Christmas was the scariest we’ve ever seen him. His overt blending in was straight up anxiety inducing. Bonus points for gifting Harrison with the signature long sleeve ‘kill’ tee.
Over Christmas,Unpopular opinion probably but I thought Deb showing up every episode was just too much. It was satisfying this episode to see her warn Dexter against talking to Harrison and him just ignoring her completely. I know she's a figment of his psyche and all but... she was getting annoying to me.
Over Christmas,I’m probably going to get downvoted here.. but.. the clown was so cringe. They couldn’t have created any other scenario to describe his “Dark Passenger”. I was rolling my eyes until they were breaking the fourth wall.
Over Christmas,"My biggest issue with this season is They’ve been rushing this season along just because they know they’ve got a limited run but I wish they would just take their time with it! This convenient writing is really just lazy which is a shame because they’re actually otherwise doing a relatively good job at redeeming their last crappy ending. But Angela’s first google search with ketamine and Miami metro should not be BHB, especially since he used M99. This was the most obvious one but she’s been too conveniently finding breadcrumbs all season. But they could still go any way with the ending. Maybe they’ll leave it open for a revival"
Over Christmas,"The one long-shot theory that I had was killed off in this episode.  I thought it was possible that Harrison was working with the Murder podcast girl, and that he tracked her down due to Trinity, then got pulled into the BHB case, thinking it could be his dad because of the letter.

I was picturing a finale where Harrison turned out to be a good guy, and brought Dexter down, after Dexter revealed the Code.  

Now, I'm not sure what they're going to do.  With the M99/Ketamine plot hole, they butchered part of Dexter's original story arc.  The way Angela has coincidentally stumbled into everything from meeting Batista at the conference, to uncovering the real identity of Dexter Morgan, has been one giant leap in ""suspend your disbelief"" storytelling.

They could have done more with the podcast girl.  Angela's white whale could have led to the podcast girl revealing her own white whale, The Bay Harbor Butcher.  She could have been the one that talked about the needle marks from Miami, and even said she used to have a suspect...Dexter Morgan...but he's dead now, which would have opened up the whole Angela storyline a lot easier.  Angela sees the picture of Dexter, freaks, and goes to Jim, who tell her everything.  She's suspicious, but she buys it, until she comes across a complaint from the guy they recently arrested, saying that he got stabbed in the neck by something.

That ties Dexter/Jim to the BHB, and Angela is exactly where she is leading into the final episode with a more coherent storyline."
Over Christmas,"Who left the note? Had to be the city forensics person, right?
... No, because there was no postage so it had to be a townie meaning it was definitely old guy. Oh, I suppose he was going to confess to the arson and use his son as an excuse."
Over Christmas,"are we even sure Harrison is actually his son? He could also be  another Dexter victims son looking for revenge or if indeed he is Dexter""s son, coul dhe actually be wanting revenge on his father for indirectly causing the death of his mother?"
Over Christmas,"So as I’m rewatching the episode there’s a moment where Angela is in the hotel room Molly
checked out of and asking why the safe is locked. When the guy who is letting her into the hotel room responds, he clears his throat in a suspicious way as if something already strange may have happened that he isn’t reporting. Could this be he knows that Kurt had something to do with her disappearing? It’s just an odd moment for me. I think Kurt had many minions."
Over Christmas,"Small point, but if Dexter had only initially planned to give Harrison part of the story, telling him the correct performing name of the clown he killed was incredibly sloppy."
Over Christmas,I’m just glad I no longer feel the anxiousness when Dexter and Harrison are doing the business. My mind is constantly thinking “what if they get caught?” even though they were at a remote location.
Over Christmas,"Maybe already posted and just haven't seen yet, but did anyone see a familiar face in Kurt's boxes?  One we had not heard was missing."
Over Christmas,"Harrison is not Dexter. He's clearly afraid of blood and he just realised he's not a killer while watching his father's ritual. 
The only thing left for him to do is to bury his daddy by telling the truth about him. It's the only way he'll be able to move forward."
Over Christmas,"Terrible ending guys just terrible I guess micheal hall was sick of the show, but that was the dumbest ending wow!  U ruined a good show sucks"
Over Christmas,"Is dexter's kid a fucking idiot? His dad tells him all that shit he does and Harrison is just like ""oh yeah, totally dad, I totally believe you have an urge to kill people and then go through all this trouble to kidnap and restrain them and then you totally just let them go omg! You're like batman!"" 

Fucking seriously? This whole season has had such incredibly shitty writing. It feels crazy seeing such great reviews for what is such objectively bad writing. It's every bit as bad as the last season was."
Over Christmas,"Everything changed when Kurt told Harrison about Dexter killing his son. Remember that scene in the school where Harrison sees all of Matt's trophies and Kurt's pride? That scene was included for a reason. It humanized Matt as a worthy person and loved

Harrison's whole demeanor suddenly changed and he was repulsed by Kurt's death 

My prediction: Harrison kills Dexter with his new rifle (Chekov's gun)

Last way I want this series to end but seems to be shaping up"
Over Christmas,"I disagree with most comments. I'm not sure how the series will end, honestly we should have gotten 3 more seasons just to wrap up the story.


At the end of the day. Dexter will not get a happy ever after ending. Dexter will die and Harrison will break the pattern.

How, i have no idea. It feels a bit like the GOT ending, way to short and forced to wrap up the ending quickly. Unfortunately i think the ending will be rushed and forced"
Over Christmas,Why? Its perfectly fine justification. Kurts justification was the joke.
Over Christmas,Leave Batman alone!!!!
Over Christmas,The way the makeup was done
Over Christmas,"They have been throwing the term ""Batman"" around a lot."
Over Christmas,"Yep, I thought this as soon as I saw him"
Over Christmas,"I thought its an reference or  an easter egg, even the guy kinda looked like Phoenix."
Over Christmas,I want to see a fan edit mashup of this now.
Over Christmas,"I  think Dexter and Harrison will ride off into the sunset together, Father and Son and are never seen again. Dexter won't / can't die. Why? There is no way they kill both of Harrison's parents. That would be too cruel. But this is mostly likely and one and done season. It's the closure that all of the fan's of Dexter have been asking for for years and that Michael C. Hall have been wanting to do. There is also the possibility that Harrison dies just as Deb has always feared. This would be the most shocking outcome and dare I say, fitting ending to the series. I wonder if the rifle Harrison got for Christmas was a nod to this fact. It's gonna be a long long week folks. I'm so scared to watch episode 10."
Over Christmas,[removed]
Over Christmas,"That's interesting, kind of an unintended consequences of the lesson.  If rule 1 is don't get caught then that would trump all other rules right?  Or at least someone learning from scratch could see it that way easily.  Otherwise rule 1 should be only kill bad people or something lol."
Over Christmas,"I hated the first episode of this season, stopped watching, and binged the rest of the season, today. There are lots of plot holes, but it definitely got a campy fun quality that original series had. Whatever this season's ending is, it must be better than the eighth season's ending."
Over Christmas,"Harrison reaffirmed multiple times the number of lives that were saved by Dexter eliminating killers. It could go either way: Harrison embraces the comic book vigilante code like most Zoomers likely would, he sees the “end result” of what that life brings and goes in a new direction (therapy, institutionalization, etc), or he becomes an unrestrained serial killer.

Either way, he suffers from the identical trauma his father suffered. No one has given him a practical outlet for that trauma until now. It also happens to be his real father. The anger and abandonment issues he felt are satisfactorily nullified. If anything, I see him going all-in Team Dexter. Even if Dexter gets caught, Harrison is being set up to continue the legacy."
Over Christmas,I disagree I like the show and all but how can you say that when the chief of police all of a sudden becomes Sherlock Holmes. She couldn't get krut who has been doing it for years. Stopped pursuing him after he got away with that story just beloved it lmfao like come on. Dexter didn't use ketamine in Miami so her googling that and it coming up as bay harbor butcher first result really. Worst writing in history of tv better way they could have done it. It's a good show but can never be great. But still a pretty darn good entertaining show.
Over Christmas,"I'm sad as well. The show is getting rave reviews and is extremely popular. Money is the king of all. I am sure that after Dexter New Blood ends and the numbers are in, Michael C. Hall goes and sits down with Showtime and Showtime says ... we want to order another two seasons and they throw a lot of money and I do mean, a lot of money at him. I bet we get Dexter New Blood Season 2. Let's hope and pray to god this happens. There are not a lot of successes going on right now in Hollywood with Covid-19 and the delays and missed ticket sales, new shows being ordered and or in production .. from what I was reading, Dexter is perhaps within the top 10 most profitable and successful shows in the United States market for 2021. That's a huge huge accomplishment."
Over Christmas,"I think its a bit premature to think that Dexter ends next week. I think we're gonna get kind of an ambigious ending that could be taken as a true ""ending"" but its gonna be open enough that if reviews and fan interest is high enough (which it probably is) they can smoothly transition into season 2."
Over Christmas,Lmfao I forgot about that 😂
Over Christmas,"It's  a medical condition called ""Hollywood"""
Over Christmas,"Lmao I completely forgot about that. Now that I think about it, Dexter has always had mutant healing"
Over Christmas,Haha. Oh yeah. I completely forgot that happened. Haha
Over Christmas,"He doesn’t have a trophy of Matt, he said he can’t do that anymore because it’s a risk."
Over Christmas,"""Can I help you officer"" - he said flirty

""Dexter Morgan.............you're under arrest"""
Over Christmas,"Especially everything he said to Kurt was true of himself - He does what he does because he likes the control - He attested as much to a number of his kills and Deb. The fact the world is a better place because of it is completely ancillary though it does pose an interesting philosophical question, albeit one that's been diluted over the show as Dexter became more human. I always thought the show was more challenging when he was an emotionless homicidal sociopath that as a byproduct made the world better and you felt uneasy rooting for him - it was an interesting dilemma.

That synopsis is kinda lol though, Kurt is probably the most humane and tender serial killer antagonist we've had, an instant shot through the heart so they don't suffer after holing them up in a 5 star hotel room :p Compared to Miguel, the skinner, Ice truck killer, Trinity, the doomsday guy, the rape gang, a Ukranian hitman, the brain surgeon and even Dexter himself it's really tame and non-violent."
Over Christmas,"You think that will be the ""break the internet"" finale - Angela arresting him and then what?"
Over Christmas,If angel doesn’t come back in and be like “oh shit it’s Dexter” I’m gonna be thoroughly disappointed
Over Christmas,"I called it from the start that the series would end with Harrison killing Dexter, I think it would be fitting."
Over Christmas,"Source for that? I don't see numbers like that anywhere?

Edit: found it. That article is referring to total viewship thus far for the very first episode with the 8 million number. The episode had 2.34 million viewers."
Over Christmas,"I mean...if Harrison kills Dexter because he fits Harry's code, then Harrison also fits Harry's code."
Over Christmas,"You're a fool if you think they are killing dexter off. They didnt do it a decade ago, they wont do it next week."
Over Christmas,">  by this huge ketamine plot hole 😒

just because he used m99 doesn't mean a search engine wouldn't find exactly what you wanted by searching ketamine. All it takes is people in miami trying to remember the killer they heard about and thinking ketamine and searching for it"
Over Christmas,"I mean, is it really a plot hole? The season opens with Dexter saying he hasn't done this sort of thing in years - it's completely fitting that he's gotten relatively sloppy with it."
Over Christmas,">No, Harrison will not be killing Angela to keep her quiet. Angela doesn't fit the code nor will she ever.

Anyone fits the code due to rule #1. eg: killing laguerta, or about to anyway"
Over Christmas,"Agree with everything. This is exactly what I'm thinking, and also what I'm hoping for. I'd love to check back in after the last episode to see if we were right, and to discuss what happened if we're not."
Over Christmas,Like a dentist missing a cavity
Over Christmas,"It's a stretch to say she studies them for a living. Most true crime podcasts are just made by people really interested in the topic. She was so obsessed with getting the story, it got her killed."
Over Christmas,"I know it's a year later but replying anyway because this stood out to me, too. I don't know if he had enough reason at this point in his confession to lie about the order of those events, unless he plans on spinning the entire Trinity story to omit his involvement with Arthur which in my opinion ultimately led to Rita being a chosen victim.

But at the same time it's hard to imagine the writers would forget about something as epic as Arthur's ""it's already over"" line on the table and the revelation at the end of season 4 when Dexter gets home. I mean that whole twist was a huge deal."
Over Christmas,"I haven't considered this at all and it feels kind of unlikely, but damn that would be fucked up."
Over Christmas,"Ok first things first:

No, she didn't fit the bill. But his last kill was a fail and so he needed another kill to make his urge stop. So he picked one, where he knew, he could do it to her, aka Mery fucking kill.

She lives for her stories and probably didn't think of him as too much threat, even though she was wary of a risk in the air. 

He probably kidnapped her as u said from the hotel room, cause he couldn't let it go."
Over Christmas,"We've seen it a couple times in bits but never with such emphasis on the gruesome and insane nature of what he does, and having someone other than Dexter in the room watching him at that moment also emphasizes just how fucked up all of this is. I think they wanted to emphasize the terrifying gravity of what Harrison is witnessing"
Over Christmas,"Probably saving his face on the last part. Lest we forget, Dexter is very good at lying and also rationalizing lying. He also conveniently forgot to mention that Trinity only went after Rita because Dexter went after him. If he had said that, Harrison would maybe now have a less romanticized view of Dexter's line of work and the kind of danger it puts those close to you in."
Over Christmas,I just can't believe Dexter would not make a cut where the syringe marks in the first place destroying any evidence of how the bhb operated because of rule 1
Over Christmas,"And his ugly Xmas sweater fetish!!!  Him thinking giving Angela a book about her job was a good gift (*though thoughtful, not the best gift idea, lol, I hate the cliche gifts of candles, but I'd take a Yankee candle over that book specifically if I was a cop) I lol so hard at Harrison's gifts (warm socks, this ain't Miami, black long John's, gun)  ...  it's like he's doing his best to fit in, help and support others, but is fucking oblivious that what he thinks is normal or good natured is actually kinda fucking weird"
Over Christmas,"You're right in that we've never seen such a cheesy kill before on the show. The way I see it, though,  it was Dexter telling Harrison a story of one his kills from his own point of view. He's never told such details of what he does to someone before, and he's embellishing hard just how cartoony crazy the clown was because he wants Harrison to take his side. He wants Harrison's approval and to say that the clown deserved it. When Harrison calls Dexter ""Batman"", you can see the satisfaction that goes across Dexter's face. 

If you remember season 1 of the original show, Dexter used to fantasize about people holding up signs commending and showing support for him. Dexter, in turn, becoming famous among the public for all the good he's done for the world by eliminating the ""real"" monsters of the world. This is what he's always wanted. Then add in that Harrison has some of the same urges as him, Dexter has someone to share his kill ritual with now - something else he's also always wanted. He doesn't feel so alone anymore. It wasn't the first time Dexter has tried to connect with someone having previously tried sharing his ways with his brother in season 1, Miguel in season 3, and seeking out the Trinity Killer season 4. Now he thinks he has Harrison, but by the boy's reaction to the blood during the dismembering of Kurt's body, it doesn't look good...I agree with others here that I don't think it's going to end well for the father and son."
Over Christmas,Why don’t u go write some fan fiction then
Over Christmas,I agree they could have done much better with the storyline.S I was thinking one if the episodes they mentioned I think a commentated saying with dials when they ran special ops and he couldn't have done one of the murders. I was thinking as part of doing the BB story she interviews people including this guy and a couple other special ops guys he knew. And she with their help starts putting it together that it might be Dexter or something like that.
Over Christmas,Hold up a sec. When/where the Mary said her suspect was Dexter for BHB?
Over Christmas,I think it was Kurt who left it.
Over Christmas,Probably Doakes.
Over Christmas,"Kurt, when he stopped by Angela's house earlier in the episode."
Over Christmas,"I think Kurt was planning to use the same strategy Dexter used on him after Kurt ransacked his place to pack.  He reveals Jim killed Matt, but the cabin has burnt down, and Dexter/Harrison are nowhere to be found.  Angela assumes they left town and torched the cabin to destroy the evidence.  He just didn't know that Angela already suspects Dexter/Jim of something much worse than killing Matt."
Over Christmas,"No, Angela gave that thing to a person she knew to find out who's finger print are on that thing and that was Jim Lindsay's"
Over Christmas,Harrison would need to be the greatest actor in the world. It doesn’t make sense to me.
Over Christmas,The character has flashbacks of the trinity murder scene. That would be too far fetched
Over Christmas,"I think he was just playing along until he could have time to unwrap that psychological Christmas present. Later in the episode, he directly inquired the truth of it. The first episode was shitty writing, in my opinion, but it became classic Dexter afterwards, with a twist.

You are definitely analyzing a character through the fourth wall."
Over Christmas,"This is my theory as well! I think Harrison is going to kill Dexter. To me, it seems like Harrison has been taking mental ""notes"" per se, and asking a lot of questions. I think it is the answer to these questions that will provide meeting code to kill."
The Minions of Midas,Really excited for this new entry in the Despicable Me Cinematic Universe
The Minions of Midas,"The premise is silly


Stupidly rich guy is being extorted


If he doesn't give them money one random person he doesn't know will die

There's no reason for him not to keep the money

Its not even a philosophers problem because he is being extorted"
The Minions of Midas,Vamos Tosar!!
The Minions of Midas,"Here from the future to tell you ""It's Cancelled!!""."
The Minions of Midas,"I haven't seen the trailer, but I wanted to read that name as The Minions of Moranis

We need more Rick Moranis"
The Minions of Midas,This looks like it takes place in the same universe as 'La Casa de Papel'
The Minions of Midas,"3,2,1 Canceled. The premise is bad, it looks cheap and it probably is."
The Minions of Midas,netflix just keep on producing garbage.
The Minions of Midas,If that was a twist in this show I would lose my mind.
The Minions of Midas,"It looks like all the murders take place in the Spanish capital Madrid. Spain is quite safe with a low amount of murders in the whole country. There was less than 20 murders in 2020 (in Madrid, not Spain) . If there is one, it usually reaches the national TV.

So, If the murders take place in Madrid only, without a suspect each time, all the alarms would pop up and the main character will notice. That it's what I think it will happen."
The Minions of Midas,"This premise is on par with the ""threat to blackmail Bruce Wayne with knowledge he is Batman"""
The Minions of Midas,Also known as Spain
The Minions of Midas,"And we kinda see one murder potentially done in its presence which is not great for your mind. He also seems to fear for its family. And he is right to say to the journalist ""If you publish that story, all people will see is I'm allowing people to die instead of giving money"".

Not every CEO is a soulless person. The first two death, you'll chalk it up as ""it's not my fault"", but after that you start to wonder where the murderers will stop and how it will affect you, your family and your portfolio."
The Minions of Midas,"""Let me get this straight: You think your boss; one of the richest, most powerful people on the earth is dressing up as a bat and going out and beating up criminals at night. And your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck."""
The Minions of Midas,"Well, in the end, he was going to say it on TV though. Bruce Wayne would have been able to prove that he is not Batman probably, but it would have lingered in the mind of people."
The Minions of Midas,"I don't know, I prefer marvel universe to Spain. There's more work ethic and less unemployment."
The Minions of Midas,SCU then!
The Minions of Midas,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Minions of Midas,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Minions of Midas,[removed]
The Minions of Midas,[removed]
The Minions of Midas," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Minions of Midas,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Minions of Midas,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Minions of Midas,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Minions of Midas,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Minions of Midas,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Minions of Midas,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Minions of Midas,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Minions of Midas,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Minions of Midas,Rat King is coming
The Minions of Midas,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Minions of Midas,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Minions of Midas,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Minions of Midas,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Minions of Midas,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Minions of Midas,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Minions of Midas,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Minions of Midas,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Minions of Midas,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Minions of Midas,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Minions of Midas,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Minions of Midas,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Minions of Midas,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Minions of Midas,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Minions of Midas,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Minions of Midas,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Minions of Midas,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Minions of Midas,[removed]
The Minions of Midas,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Minions of Midas,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Minions of Midas,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Minions of Midas,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Minions of Midas,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Minions of Midas,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Minions of Midas,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Minions of Midas,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Minions of Midas,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Minions of Midas,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Minions of Midas,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Minions of Midas,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Minions of Midas,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Minions of Midas,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Minions of Midas,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Minions of Midas,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Minions of Midas,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Minions of Midas,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Minions of Midas,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Minions of Midas,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Minions of Midas,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Minions of Midas,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Minions of Midas,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Minions of Midas,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Minions of Midas,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Minions of Midas,[deleted]
The Minions of Midas,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Minions of Midas,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Minions of Midas,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Minions of Midas,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Minions of Midas,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Minions of Midas,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Minions of Midas,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Minions of Midas,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Minions of Midas,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Minions of Midas,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Minions of Midas,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Minions of Midas,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Minions of Midas,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Minions of Midas,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Minions of Midas,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Minions of Midas,We gonna get the rat king.
The Minions of Midas,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Minions of Midas,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Minions of Midas,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Minions of Midas,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Minions of Midas,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Minions of Midas,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Minions of Midas,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Minions of Midas,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Minions of Midas,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
Country Ever After,"Love this show, glad she is doing ok."
Country Ever After,I want a Hacks/ Veep crossover with the meanest dialogue ever concocted.
Country Ever After,She’s one of my favorite actors. Glad to see she’s recovered well. Can’t wait for season 3.
Country Ever After,I had no idea they were doing a season 3. Season 2 finale was written like they did not know if they were getting another round. They wrote off into the sunset from my perspective but excited for it to come back.
Country Ever After,Jean Smart is amazing! Glad to read this
Country Ever After,I’m kind of surprised that they are doing a season three because season two’s ending was absolutely perfect. I’m in though. I love the show.
Country Ever After,"Just looking at this picture, I gotta say, Jean Smart has aged well."
Country Ever After,"I first remember seeing and falling in love with Jean in Designing Women. Then I started seeing her in other shows like Frazier, 24 & Fargo. Then one of the first movies I remember was Audrey’s Rain that her real life husband Richard Gilliland co-starred with her. She was in Sweet Home Alabama and other TV Shows & Movies too! ♥️"
Country Ever After,Love Jean! Glad she’s doing better
Country Ever After,Oh fuck!!!! I assumed we wouldn’t get a season 3. I love this show so much
Country Ever After,"Shows got heart 

fr tho , pun aside"
Country Ever After,"loved season 1, season 2 was a lot less funny imo."
Country Ever After,She was great in that show. I didn’t like the writer girl though. She was so not funny that I’m surprised she didnt get a Netflix show. Seems like every not funny woman comic has one.
Country Ever After,Jean Smart has to be one of the greatest character actors of her time.  Her range is impressive and what she brings to life is something palpable.  Love to see how she can hold her own in a scene and make her mark.
Country Ever After,"I would watch a show about Jean Smart brushing her teeth for an hour every week, but I really don't like Hacks much.  It feels like they just took a bunch of fun actors and were like ""We've got a bland story here, please don't add anything to it."""
Country Ever After,Who?
Country Ever After,"Jean Smart in everything please

I wanna see a Jean Smart/Jennifer Coolidge show"
Country Ever After,"I like Hacks quite a lot but it is totally different to Veep. Sure, Hacks has some vicious insults, but Veep’s heartlessness was on a whole different level. Hacks is ultimately a far kinder show than Veep. It’s not exactly Ted Lasso level schmaltz or anything but it definitely ain’t Veep."
Country Ever After,"Yeah, she's amazing. She also lost her husband while shooting the first season so she's had a rough few years."
Country Ever After,"Man, ""wrote off into the sunset"" almost works here..."
Country Ever After,"I would have been content if it ended with S2, but I’m glad we will (hopefully) see the two women come back to each other. The breakup between the two was tough love that they both needed at those different points in their career which will make the reuniting that much better."
Country Ever After,IIRC they did not know if they were getting a season 3. It was not renewed until months after S2 was released.
Country Ever After,Have you watched the show?  She's a goddamn babe.
Country Ever After,"season 2 felt much more sinister with the like abusive relationships taking a much more center stage

Maybe it's just that season1 was a funnier take on abusive relationships. It makes me wonder what season 3 will feel like cause I think it will be a difficult balance

One of the best shows currently running though so exicted to see what's next"
Country Ever After,One thing Hacks and Mrs Maisel taught me is that it’s incredibly hard to write standup comedy. The jokes are just so freaking terrible and it really ruins the illusion.
Country Ever After,"I watched a few episodes and it was funny enough, but I refuse to get into any more shows about being a stand up comedian, it's a played out plot at this point."
Country Ever After,How dare you
Country Ever After,Featuring Christopher McDonald
Country Ever After,"Cool. Didn’t really investigate the idea too deeply, but I’m glad someone did their due diligence."
Country Ever After,That’s too bad to hear. She’s such a champion.
Country Ever After,I realized it was wrong but i left it because it kinda works.
Country Ever After,"I feel the same. 

The finale was so satisfying that I would be ok without a third but I still *want* a third season."
Country Ever After,"I seem to remember the three producers said in one of the extras featurettes during S2 mention they have a four season arch. Alas, I canceled HBO for the time being and can’t check to confirm."
Country Ever After,Her sex scene with Devon Sawa is super hot lol
Country Ever After,i hope they get back to Vegas.
Country Ever After,"it wasn't that, i kinda expected a dropoff, it was the story lines in season 2, i couldn't get into it, it was all about gay relationships, and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

season 1 was just funny, season 2 i feel they were trying drama, and it didn't work for me.

i still like the premise though."
Country Ever After,I have a similar rule about novels about academics.  E-fucking-nough.
Country Ever After,With the theme by Michael McDonald.
Country Ever After,"She actually filmed the scene where she shows up at the funeral of Ava's dad about a week after Richard Gilliand passed. She absolutely deserved that Emmy, you could feel Jean's whole heart in that monologue in front of the mourners."
Country Ever After,holy fuck that was Devon Sawa?!
Country Ever After,">and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

You're not okay with that."
Country Ever After,Why aren’t you going to watch something with a gay relationship?
Country Ever After,"> it was all about gay relationships, and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

grow up dude"
Country Ever After,Right??!?!??
Country Ever After,sure.
Country Ever After,"Yea, homophobic much??!?!?!"
Country Ever After,why do you care?
Country Ever After,Because hes obviously a hateful homophobic trumper! Duh what else could it be?
Country Ever After,no
Country Ever After,"Yea fr fr, no cap. Only the most grown up, mature people find every show relatable and watchable, regardless of the characters and their stories. They like anything and everything, and everyone. Its lame and immature if you dont."
Country Ever After,Just wondering since you decided to share on a public forum. Curious.
Country Ever After,I dunno. That’s why I asked.
Country Ever After,"a forum about tv shows, and i critizied a story line."
Country Ever After,"We assume the worst in everyone here, where have you been?"
Country Ever After,You’re doing a lot. It’s starting to feel like projection.
Country Ever After,"Whoaa, is it?? Are you a mind Doctor or something?"
Country Ever After,iTs ReDdIt. Im AsSuMiNg ThE wOrSt 🤪🤪
Country Ever After,"What you are doing is fighting the good fight fellow redditor, keep homophones out of our subs"
Country Ever After,Thank you netflix
Country Ever After,Makes sense.  Americans are getting more exposed to other content plus about 17% of Americans speak Spanish at home.
Country Ever After,"I'd like to know more in detail on this. 

Like what's the percentage difference there is between those who watch international shows dubbed over in English to those who watch with subtitles."
Country Ever After,"You can likely thank Netflix for the boom in popularity of foreign language content. Their dubbing of international originals has really helped shows like Squid Game, All of Us Are Dead, Lupin, and Money Heist find a good audience in a number of international markets. 

I’d also say the have helped boost the popularity of more niche Japanese anime and K-Dramas in international markets."
Country Ever After,"If the dialogue sound mixing on English language television is so bad that English-only speakers need to turn the subtitles on anyway, this is a logical consequence."
Country Ever After,"This comes right on the heels of the release of 1899. Awesome hugely international show, the native language facet is so cool.

Watch it and make sure you turn dubbing off (still don’t get why Netflix turns it on by default)"
Country Ever After,I think about 70% of the shows I’ve watched in the last couple years are international with subtitles.
Country Ever After,Are those numbers good? I feel like the amount of non English content available is has exploded since 2018. It seems like almost half of the new content on Netflix is international but only up 8%? Seems like a dramatically small increase compared to content available.
Country Ever After,"With a billion talentless talent shows, reality TV shows that have ALL been done before, and the same police/firefighter/doctor drama (but in a different city): who would blame them?"
Country Ever After,"> When the Academy held the inaugural International Emmys **in 1973, the interest in, and market for, non-U.S. television was close to zero. This was the pre-cable, three-network world**, and foreign programming, or diversity of any sort, was hard to find on the primetime schedules.


Three networks, and PBS!  


> **A half-century later, international shows are all over the proverbial dial. Thanks to the number of streaming services now offering foreign programming, American audiences can watch just about every one of this year’s nominees**. Figures from Whip Media, a U.S. company that runs a platform for worldwide content licensing, show that the share of non-U.S. titles viewed in the country has more than doubled, from slightly less than 8 percent in 2018 to more than 16 percent in 2021... 


> That demand has helped fuel a boom in production worldwide as global streamers double down on non-U.S. content. Whip Media says that **some 38 percent of new Netflix shows in development are in a language other than English. Nearly one-quarter of Disney+ content is non-English**, and competitors **Amazon and Apple also have increased their spending on local-language shows worldwide**. (HBO, a global content champion, only recently drew back from international programming as part of companywide cost-cutting in the wake of the Warner Bros.-Discovery merger.)"
Country Ever After,"This just in: Americans enjoy well written, well acted television shows."
Country Ever After,Now if Disney read the numbers and did the rollout of content that isn't Marvel or Star Wars better.
Country Ever After,I know I am. Tired of the same ol same ol. More overseas TV!
Country Ever After,Does Bridgerton count?
Country Ever After,"I enjoy *Doctor Who*, that’s about it. 🤷‍♂️ 

*Peaky Blinders* too, but that ended."
Country Ever After,"International tv to me at least, doesn’t force minute and weeks. If a show needs to be 6 episodes cool, 8 fine. That works too. In a media we need 40 minutes for 19 weeks and that produces garbage."
Country Ever After,"Before streaming, international tv just wasn’t a thing you had access to for the most part.  Foreign films haven’t even been that easy for many people outside major cities to access until fairly recently.  But with television, there wasn’t even a cable channel that showed foreign language television outside maybe telemundo."
Country Ever After,I suspect that the pandemic has had a big affect. We burned through all of the English language content already.
Country Ever After,Yeah our shows are soo over the top and needlessly dramatic. There is a better finesse.
Country Ever After,Pretty much all I watch French tv shows and movies! I wish we had more access to them. Netflix is annoying with their blocks and limits based on country. Give me all of it!
Country Ever After,Well yeah I’ve finished all the good English stuff on Netflix tf else am I gonna do?
Country Ever After,British panel shows are crack. I just can't stop. And don't get me started on Taskmaster
Country Ever After,Americans have discovered...culture!
Country Ever After,"Well, one the greatest shows of all time, The IT Crowd, is from England so this tracks."
Country Ever After,"This isn't surprising. When every major American studio is going full tunnel vision on message > writing, people will start looking elsewhere. It's tiring to be constantly bombarded with ""agree with this position!"" or ""we're focused on checking boxes!"". Doubly so when you're labeled a bigot if you don't jump in with emphatic approval."
Country Ever After,"TV and even movie production in America has become so uncinematic over the past 5-8 years. Foreign tv and movies feel so much more cinematic for some reason, particularly Korean ones."
Country Ever After,"I'm sure it's not a lack of talent. Writers, directors, showrunners, I'm sure there's many talented people in the US, but it needs to be said this bluntly: US shows, with a few exceptions, over the past 5-10 years have become absolute, utter ass. There's just so, so many shows where you can tell they went through a focus-group reliant board meeting clean-up process. Everything is samey, everything is streamlined, everything is boring as hell.

And it doesn't stop there. You're media critics, for example, are also terrible, and most of them certainly bought. Go to rottentomatoes, look for ""the best TV shows 2022"" (or '21, or '20, or...). Those lists are straight-up awful, dominated by shows I can only describe as ""for white, middle-aged, alcoholic moms"".  One middling show about nothing after the other, with less than a handful exceptions. 

Everything is white-washed, there are no stakes, nobody's taking actual risks, everything is built to appeal to specific demographic groups.... It's like everything else is more important than the actual quality of the show. People watch these international shows because they're better, because they're actually trying to deliver, it really is that simple."
Country Ever After,Non-American content is the only stuff that’s worth watching right now
Country Ever After,Probably because American TV sucks ass now.
Country Ever After, I for one cannot watch another CSI courthouse coroner 911 Bismarck. The first 23 we’re slightly derivative.
Country Ever After,"How are Americans defined? Anyone in America?

While international content has opened up a lot I'd wager it's more people consuming native language content instead of English speakers suddenly taking an interest in Bollywood or Korean dramas. 

Doctor who, downtown abbey and squid game certainly helped as did shows like dark and others that grew in popularity but I don't think they can explain such a quick increase."
Country Ever After,Because most American shows are too busy preaching at us. Social commentary should never trump good story-telling.
Country Ever After,[deleted]
Country Ever After,Less woke material?
Country Ever After,Streamers got desperate for content during COVID and other movie industries outside of Hollywood are growing rapidly as technology becomes more accessible. The diversity is great to have.
Country Ever After,American TV and Movies suck. Maybe that’s why I gravitate towards British crime dramas and Japanese Tokusatsu & Anime.
Country Ever After,Its only because Netflix is being so cheap they are forcing us to watch international titles because thats all that exists now. Then write titles like this to convince us its popular.
Country Ever After,I’m not surprised. We hear about international movies more and Netflix is constantly recommending it and throwing previews on my screen.
Country Ever After,It’s probably not all English speakers. I know native Spanish speaking women like watching Turkish telenovelas dubbed in Spanish for example.
Country Ever After,"Can only speak for myself, but I started watching kdramas for the first time thanks to Netflix last year and haven’t looked back. Got into so many other korean shows since then and even started watching a few c dramas"
Country Ever After,They ain’t watching Canadian shows cause it’s on live support and the only thing that’s keeping it alive is probably letterkenny
Country Ever After,"these ""international"" shows are being made with America in mind, it's pretty noticeable from either casting, setting, writing, therefore they're more easily digested. They're as authentic as a three pound note"
The Devil Punisher,"Filming begins this month:

>Jon Bernthal is returning to his most punishing role. The actor will reprise Frank Castle, aka anti-hero The Punisher, in Marvel Studios’ Daredevil: Born Again.

>Bernthal joins Charlie Cox and Vincent D’Onofrio in the series, which begins shooting in New York this month. As opposed to other Marvel series, which come in at six or nine episodes per season, Born Again is planned as a whopping 18-episode epic. Writers and executive producers Matt Corman and Chris Ord are behind the show which is expected to bow in the spring of 2024.

The bad news:

>However, actors from the Netflix Daredevil series are not expected to return. Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson, who played classic supporting characters Karen Page and Foggy Nelson, respectively, are not on the roll call for the Marvel series. It is also unclear whether those characters will be recast or excised from the story."
The Devil Punisher,"For the love of god, please don’t fuck this up."
The Devil Punisher,"As long as there is some long scene with some punishing going on (the bar fight in s2 still gives me goosebumps), i can be happy."
The Devil Punisher,"He was excellent in that role.

He should win awards to we own this city. Amazing actor"
The Devil Punisher,This dude is perfect for the role. Anybody else just wouldn’t do.
The Devil Punisher,Next up is Kristen Ritter...
The Devil Punisher,Cool news. Not sure if Disney can pull off the tone of Born Again.
The Devil Punisher,"This is good news, buuuuut it's hard to imagine the blood and guts version of Punisher we got from Netflix making the transition to the MCU."
The Devil Punisher,Make it Rated R or I don’t fucking want it
The Devil Punisher,I can't wait for his one night stand with She-Hulk
The Devil Punisher,I really want Krysten Ritter back as Jessica Jones
The Devil Punisher,"They're either gonna nerf him, or Disney+ is about to get TVMA"
The Devil Punisher,"I'm really worried about this. Disney Marvel hasn't shown, in my opinion, that they can do great tv. I'm definitely not convinced that they can do right by the Punisher character."
The Devil Punisher,"Is a PG-13 Punisher in the ultra-safe MCU/Disney house style even going to be interesting though? Daredevil is one thing, but the Punisher?"
The Devil Punisher,I can't help but feel this show will not be good.
The Devil Punisher,"I'm fascinated to see where they go with him now, especially under Disney because that logo sure as fuck doesn't mean what it used to."
The Devil Punisher,fuck yes!!!!
The Devil Punisher,We won
The Devil Punisher,"If he's gotta be PG Punisher, what's the point? PG Daredevil, sure. Not PG Punisher."
The Devil Punisher,"I just hope they don't recast Foggy and Karen, leaves the door open for them to play a part later if they come back (unless they kill them off). Better to just do some new story around new characters and events. 

Recasting would just make me dislike the decisions even more..."
The Devil Punisher,"Cool, JJ and Luke Cage next. I'm indifferent about Iron Fist."
The Devil Punisher,Thank the universe this is happening
The Devil Punisher,"Many years ago I was excited about the possibility of either or both of these two shows coming back, but now I realise the problem is that the shows were never going to go back to exactly how they were, regardless of the fact that disney/marvel is going to drag their reputation through the mud. Pls no more marvel man."
The Devil Punisher,Is it me or are there a lot of actors with big heads and small bodies?
The Devil Punisher,Can’t wait for the pg13 “jokefest” Disney will force on us
The Devil Punisher,"Bernthal gave a great performance but his character never really felt like the Punisher to me. The writers gave him Wolverine’s personality, where he keeps trying to leave the violence behind, instead of fully committing to it like Frank Castle"
The Devil Punisher,"Holy shit, this is huge.

&#x200B;

Waiting for Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson to come back as well."
The Devil Punisher,"Can't wait to see how they mess him up like they did with the characters in phase 4.   
He'll probably only have access to nerf weapons."
The Devil Punisher,"Goddamn, I didn’t know I was working with super lawyer!! Kingpin you’re going away for a looooong time!! And a motherfuckin brick!"
The Devil Punisher,"That's fantastic, the two had incredible on screen chemistry and brought new depths to the charcters and their opposing morality/way of getting justice.  Just holding out for the Foggy & Karen reveal... holding.... holding... hold me."
The Devil Punisher,Disney gonna make it rated pg
The Devil Punisher,RUGHH RAGHH ARGHH AHHHB RUHHHH RUHHHHH RUHHHHHHHH
The Devil Punisher,Fucking pissed it's going to be PG-13. Punisher needs to go nuts at least one without stupid camera cuts or lack of blood
The Devil Punisher,"I don't really care about this since they are leaving out the two that actually matter; Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson, Karen and Foggy. Adding the punisher doesn't make up for leaving those two out."
The Devil Punisher,"The Punisher on Disney.

BWAHAHAHAHAH"
The Devil Punisher,"This is great and all, but I'm not really excited about the characters returning...

If they do it like they did on the she-hulk series, this will be nothing like the Netflix series....

Punisher without blood, and gci fights all over the place...


Hard pass"
The Devil Punisher,Please please take this show seriously and not another quippy cookie cutter MCU vehicle.
The Devil Punisher,"Everyone saying ""You couldn't put Punisher on Disney+""' should log into their account and look it up."
The Devil Punisher,Nice. Excited to see how Disney ruins this.
The Devil Punisher,Ah shit.
The Devil Punisher,*laughs in Garth Ennis*
The Devil Punisher,Hype
The Devil Punisher,Good
The Devil Punisher,"Cheers into Frasier. Breaking Bad into Better Call Saul. Daredevil into The Punisher.

Not every original/spin-off pair is worth remembering, but the ones that truly shine make all the other attempts worth it."
The Devil Punisher,Definitely some awesome news but it’s still a Disney+ show so it’ll prolly be missed opportunity after missed opportunity. How much y’all wanna bet 18 episodes means the individual episodes are gonna be 20-30 minutes long thus making every episode feel unsatisfying and aimless?
The Devil Punisher,I will watch simply for Vincent D'Onofrio
The Devil Punisher,Russoooo
The Devil Punisher,WE GONNA GET THAT PUNISHER / KINGPIN REMATCH???
The Devil Punisher,YESSSSSS!!!!!
The Devil Punisher,I'm so excited I loved him as the fucking punisher
The Devil Punisher,"When he shoots people, fairy dust will pop out"
The Devil Punisher,YES
The Devil Punisher,"I'm excited - but also, these Disney+ shows have been so underwhelming.  

Please do better."
The Devil Punisher,"I am so excited. I just binged all of the Netflix marvel shows. The only characters I didn't like were foggy and Karen. I feel like this is being made just for me.

...sorry to everyone else"
The Devil Punisher,"I hope they bring back Dex, I loved his fights with Daredevil and his transition to Bullseye at the end of season 3 really needs to be explored further.  He himself was reborn"
The Devil Punisher,"Good. I was scared that if Castle was going to return, someone else would be in the role. Bernthal’s Punisher was fantastic, guy really brought his A-game. Netflix’s take on those Marvel  properties was so poorly handled. But the cast was great. Hope Foggy and Karen original actors return as well."
The Devil Punisher,Happy Wayne Jenkins day!
The Devil Punisher,"As long as they dont doom it by ""made for a modern audience"", then im totally onboard."
The Devil Punisher,Disney better allow it to be dark.
The Devil Punisher,If daredevil is coming back. I want ghost rider too
The Devil Punisher,"That's great news! Jon Bernthal's portrayal of The Punisher was outstanding, and I'm excited to see him return for 'Daredevil: Born Again'. It's sure to be an action-packed and thrilling season."
The Devil Punisher,"Are thet still gonna keep the show as a ""Family Friendly"" one ?"
The Devil Punisher,I'm not sure how I feel about 18 episodes. One of the problems with the second season of DD was that it dragged on too long / had pacing issues. I'd rather have a more concise season with a tighter storyline.
The Devil Punisher,Jon returning without Deborah is upsetting.
The Devil Punisher,Man I can’t wait for how disappointing this is going to be.
The Devil Punisher,Couldn't care less. I liked the Netflix Marvel Collab shows. But Marvels MCU nonsense has run itself into the ground with how stale the content has become. Most people haven't kept up fully since End Game since they started pumping out TV shows and movies at an accelerated rate. Let it all die at this point.
The Devil Punisher,"As much as I enjoy Bernthal's more raw portrayal of Frank, I still vastly prefer Thomas Jane.

I was lucky enough to see the workprint of his Punisher movie."
The Devil Punisher,Karen had a really great dynamic with both these guys. What an odd choice to leave her and Foggy out of the show.
The Devil Punisher,Disney already screwed up Daredevil. Now they're on to Punisher.
The Devil Punisher,Hell yeah
The Devil Punisher,"I am PRAYING Disney doesn't ruin these characters/this show. 

I think I speak for most fans of the Netflix shows when I say we want a heavily character focused drama with stakes. We do not want another okay comedy/action series."
The Devil Punisher,As long as he’s the Punisher from the Daredevil series. Not the actual Punisher series
The Devil Punisher,Can’t wait to see how Disney absolutely obliterates this series.
The Devil Punisher,"Making fun of how kingpin is bald 

“He’s right behind me, isn’t he?..”

Can’t wait to see all the hiiilllaarriious one liners he’ll have"
The Devil Punisher,"Finally so good news for a change...

but is it going to be watered down and ham fisted Marvel schlock.


Wait...no Karen nor Foggy? what the hell??? What's even the point. you gotta bring everyone back"
The Devil Punisher,"https://youtu.be/xWh6A6ZIpfo

More of this, less phase 4 please"
The Devil Punisher,Am I the only one who thought this had already been confirmed?
The Devil Punisher,Geeze. I'm just now realizing I never watched the final episode of Season 2.
The Devil Punisher,It's amazing they spent all of Phase 4 introducing tons of characters that had the impact of wet cardboard. None of those got me hyped like this announcement.
The Devil Punisher,"I'm not expecting much.   I'm actually kind of sad they dragged the characters from the Netflix shows into the MCU.  I loved the dark, gritty, violent, grounded feel of the Netflix shows.  Now that Disney is doing them, they're for sure going to be the same as every other MCU show with their light-hearted, excessively quippy, PG-rated violence and no depth."
The Devil Punisher,Will this be violent? Or watered down like most of the Disney shows?
The Devil Punisher,"Bernthal is the best Punisher of all time. Some people make up/portray their characters so well that there’s not another person out there in existence that can do it better. For example: Stifler, Elvira, Devito’s Penguin, Campbell’s Ash, Michael Coleone. I’m sure there’s many that can contribute to this list."
The Devil Punisher,"So is everyone in Hollywood dying of cancer? Or is the need to look like you need rocks in your pockets on windy days just being pressed even harder than before?

Remember Anya in Split? See her now? Shit's fuckin wild."
The Devil Punisher,He wasn't and will never be Thomas Jane.
The Devil Punisher,"A Disney DareDevil production... let that sentence sink in. 

Are we really still in our hearts expecting this to be anything more than another passable show that doesn't really deliver on the things we want and only promises something better the next time?"
The Devil Punisher,"Jon Bernthal's return is fucking fantastic news. But if anyone at Marvel is looking through comment threads, please for the love of God bring back Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson. We love them. They're essential to Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock."
The Devil Punisher,"After what they did to Daredevil on Disney plus, I’m not going to hold my breath."
The Devil Punisher,I have a bad feeling about this
The Devil Punisher,"If they neuter this show then seriously, fuck Disney"
The Devil Punisher,"Punisher>>>>>foggy and Karen

I’d love them to return but if we only get one then punisher is my vote"
The Devil Punisher,idk why but I just really don't like this guy in anything that he's in.
The Devil Punisher,Need the punisher TV show back. Dont know why Netflix even cancelled it
The Devil Punisher,"Bernthal is a dude with very strong opinions. If he's returning it must be because the project isn't half bad. I hope what's on paper ends up being what we see on screen.

Just read we're losing Karen and Foggy... that sucks big time. They'll be deeply missed."
The Devil Punisher,"I'm bummed bout Woll and Henson not being casted, but I am glad that the best Punisher is coming back."
The Devil Punisher,Super bummed to hear Deborah Ann Woll won’t be coming back; she’s just a fun actor to watch and she elevated the character way beyond what was written on the page.
The Devil Punisher,"Too bad itll be PG13 or w.e to target mass audiences with the hope that nostalgia from the netflix series will carry over and blind viewers from the subpar writing and nonsensical fights that only ever result in someone being ambiguously hurt/sore or a large explosion/cut away that is supposed to appear deadly but ends up only resulting in the character being in a hospital or dragged to a special place of healing....

Remember when kingpin had a gun pointed at his face, cut away and a gun shot was heard? Well that only caused a survivable injury, maybe a damaged eye or scar.


Gone are the days of consequence."
The Devil Punisher,The Disney Version of Daredevil is gonna be so watered down compared to the Netflix version.
The Devil Punisher,Praying for the show to have the same amount of violence as the OG shows.
The Devil Punisher,Man if it's toned down from what the Netflix ones were it's going to be disappointing
The Devil Punisher,"There was an interview with him while he was rehearsing for the role and he talked about putting on heavy back packs and walking around New York at night. The reporter asked him why that was relevant and he couldn't really explain it. 

Somehow, that sums him up so perfectly for me."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Enjoyed the show but not surprised at all
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"first season was fun.  second season's villain was too big(?) >!infiltrated every single intelligence agency, eliminated every hacker worldwide who wasn't working for them, coordinated global attacks, etc...for a heist!<"
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,this is the show that only put out two seasons since 2019
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"When the show finished production in December 2020 and it took 19 months to actually get released, I figured it was pretty much a goner.

I enjoyed season 1 but season 2 was meh."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,I tried watching this show but found the main characters acting to be pretty bad and gave up
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Nooo we all loved this show
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood, Never heard of it
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Did it end on a cliffhanger?
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Never seen it never heard of it but if I was reading up recommended shows I would skip this. Not sure what it is but I really really dislike this trend? Of shows being called ""Blood &...""
Hate it."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,i would love more shows like this but for some reason this one didn't really interest me.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"This is a show where the idea is great but the execution not so great, perhaps because neither of the leads has real charisma or chemistry. But it moves, is colorful, is way different than other fare, and doesn't really disappoint."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Not surprised but at least they got a second season. Enjoyed the show and would have liked more seasons. Putting the show as a paramount+ exclusive certainly didn't help it but apparently they had no options.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Not surprised - it can't have been cheap to do all that travelling.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,It was a fun show and I would have liked to see more season.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Agreed, I also thought season 2 was a bit weaker and I didn't always agree with the decisions the main characters were making. But overall the two seasons are worth watching if you don't take it very seriously. It is a very light hearted show with some fun set pieces that look higher budget then you would expect. (Even though it does have some weird low budget moments where the CGI is just plain bad)"
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Same! I can’t even get far in a show when it’s obvious bad acting or writing
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Who is we? Are they the same people who wanted more from the DaVinci Code and the National Treasure shows?
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"No, they finished the season arc completely, so it is safe to watch."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Yeah, I assumed season 2 was a covid cancelation for a while, was surprised to see it eventually come out"
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Yeah, I really wanted to like it. I definitely have appetite for an Uncharted/Indiana Jones/National Treasure kind of tv show. I was even prepared for the acting to be a little CBS. The writing was just too weak. It wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Tom's character tries to sell Larry a reverse mortgage.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Blooblub!
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Have they ever had Tom Selleck on the rebooted Magnum PI?
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Thankfully we never got version of Indiana Jones with this hairy mofo.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Never heard of this - any good?
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Cool. While it had its flaws I enjoyed it while it aired. I thought it was cancelled.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Disappointed they're locking this behind Paramount+. 

I hope it does well for them so we get more of it, but I worry that, with all the time lost since Season One, it will get lost in the streaming shuffle."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Never heard of this show before now but it looks interesting, the treasure hunt/adventure thriller ala Uncharted/Dan Brown have always seemed to be a good fit for TV IMO but it isn't really common.

I guess it needs a big budget to be done well (that type of genre kind of rely on spectacle, action, beautiful vistas/ruins/historical places) and I'm not sure this one has a big budget considering they didn't really market it a lot"
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,[deleted]
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,I'd say [fun rather than good](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/blood_treasure/s01).  :)
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Evil was on CBS for season one and then moved to Paramount+ and it's still going strong. Just got renewed for season 4.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Frankly I'd be more worried if it didn't go on Paramount+ nowadays, the downward trend of cable/broadcast has not stopped. Paramount+ is surprisingly popular among the general population."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,They did quite a bit of overseas filming (which is why Covid was a big problem) and that costs.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"I called it ""The Adventures of Sexy Vasiri"" myself. Pretty enjoyable, turn-your-brain-off kind of fun.

I have Paramount+ myself - it's complimentary in the UK with a Sky Cinema subscription."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Good point!
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,I've just started rotating subs to save money
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,That's not how separation anxiety works Amazon
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Thanks Tubi, your ad made my father start yelling at me because he thought I changed the channel!"
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"The gimmick this year seems to be multiple celebrities in the same commercial. They open with one celeb, which doesn't surprise anyone, but the stinger is that they have another celeb in the same commercial!
  
Like all gimmicks, it gets old pretty quick. The ones that aren't relying on star power look good in comparison."
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Tubi: Home of all the weird movies your old off-beat video store used to carry.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul love being Walt and Jesse so much.
Oktoberfest: Beer & Blood,"Did they decide to save the funny commercials for the fourth quarter?  Sarah McLachlan in a Busch beer commercial, parodying her ASPCA ads was pretty amusing."

Flavours of Romania,"Just one more thing, Ceausescu was the only communist leader killed in 1989. I wonder if Season 8 got to Romania before or after he was given a machine gunning for Christmas."

Flavours of Romania,"You think angry Romanians are bad, just wait another 950 years for Lrrr and the rest of the Omicronians to find out."
Flavours of Romania,I'm guessing that was not the full reason for the uprising in Romania in 1974.
Flavours of Romania,streaming...?!? own the whole collection on dvd... i’ll never lose my columbo!
Flavours of Romania,"This reminds me of the clandestine phone calls between Jules Haimovitz, Aaron Spelling, and David Lynch about *Twin Peaks*: 

Jules (who was the president and COO of Spelling Entertainment while *Twin Peaks* was on) got a call one day during the run from financier Carl Lindner, who had bought half of Aaron Spelling Productions and who happened to be friendly with then current President Bush, ""wanting to know who killed Laura Palmer.""

Haimovitz said he didn't know the answer, but was told ""it's really important"" so he called up Lynch himself.

""I called David and he says, 'I can't tell you.' I don't want to press David, so I call Aaron back to say, 'David won't tell me, *who* wants to know?' and he says, '*President Bush*.' Apparently what happened was Gorbachev called Bush, who in turn called Carl, who called Aaron, who called me,"" Haimovitz says.

Haimovitz reportedly called Lynch again to *demand* to know the name of the killer, joking that National security might be at stake. Again, Lynch refused. ""That's when I realized David had *no idea* who killed Laura Palmer."""
Flavours of Romania,"You know, this is such a timeless gem of a show. I’ve been binging it this month and even my teens are obsessed now. Although the imdb ads are horrendous and seldom fit the cutscenes."

Flavours of Romania,"Fun fact, there's a Columbo statue in Budapest, Hungary. It's much cooler than the weird Regan statue a short distance away"
Flavours of Romania,also 'Dallas' was a big thing in Romania
Flavours of Romania,"Romania is legendary for not fucking around and actually getting people on the street to protest. The headline is definitely amusing, but when you look at it as an anti-government movement it makes more sense. Also, it's not like anyone hates Columbo anyway. You know you'd do the same."
Flavours of Romania,"Another fun Romanian fact about their appreciation for American TV: after the series finale of The Fugitive aired over there, the water levels dropped dangerously low. Folks wanted to see the identity of the one armed man. After the show ended, tons of people simultaneously used the bathroom."
Flavours of Romania,Is this the basis for the futurama episode? Doesn't matter I want it to be true so I'm going to ignore any evidence to the contrary
Flavours of Romania,"I loved how he described his character as ""someone who looks like a flood victim""."
Flavours of Romania,I guarantee Falk asked the representative from Romania how much did he pay for his shoes
Flavours of Romania,Everyone knows the uprising was due to The Great Lettuce Famine.
Flavours of Romania,Futurama anyone?
Flavours of Romania,Last time I recall this being posted Romanians claimed it wasn’t really true and Dallas was more popular anyway
Flavours of Romania,i remember in 1994 appeared a channel that aired 'The A Team' and 'Knight Rider'...goddamn...those were the times...
Flavours of Romania,"Meanwhile, he’s just not popular in Albania."

Flavours of Romania,"I don't know what the fascination with Columbo is in that part of the world, but when we were in Budapest in 2017 we saw the Mr. & Mrs. Columbo Restaurant and Pub. Weird"
Flavours of Romania,This seems crazy but the explanation makes sense the people are not happy because they thought the government wasn't letting them watch as much an American television as existed. They were not happy about possible censorship.
Flavours of Romania,I guess the Mrs Columbo series wasn't enough to quench their thirst
Flavours of Romania,I guess this is where Futurama got the inspiration for that one episode with the Omicron Persei 8 Aliens
Flavours of Romania,“As you wish”
Flavours of Romania,I think I watched that Futurama episode
Flavours of Romania,I still love the show!
Flavours of Romania,Galaxy Quest FTW.
Flavours of Romania,"I just imagine Peter Falk getting of the plane in Romania. He’s wearing the trench coat and everything. A throng of his fans are cheering wildly. Suddenly, a new reporter walks up to him and puts a microphone in his face. The crowd goes silent. Peter Falk clears his throat, moves closer to the mic and says “Eh, just one more thing...”. The crowd erupts and then carries him on their shoulders through the village square."
Flavours of Romania,"wow, i’m romanian born in ‘76 and i finally understand my parents’ obsession with Colombo"
Flavours of Romania,Am I the only person who’s never liked Letterman? I’ve never found him funny and just got an asshole vibe.
Flavours of Romania,Columbo is my ish!!
Flavours of Romania,"What is it with Eastern Europe and TV stars?  Serbians were obsessed with the Canadian TV show ""Sweating Bullets""... so much so that its main character became a political symbol for anti-Milosevic dissidents.

> According to (Rob) Stewart, who co-directs, co-produces and is the subject of *Slaughter Nick for President*, the Brampton, Ont.-based, largely unemployed actor was living in his parents' suburban basement when he heard the news: Tropical Heat (a.k.a. Sweating Bullets), the Canadian-made Magnum P.I. via Baywatch meets Miami Vice detective show he'd appeared in back in the early nineties, was an object of high cult enthusiasm in Serbia. 

> Not only that, but Serbia's top dissident punk band, Atheist Rap, had scored its biggest and most socially galvanizing hit with a catchy little high-velocity number called Slaughteru Nietzsche – commonly translated as Nick Slaughter, Serbia Hails You. The song was not only popular throughout the country, it had attained anthemic status as the soundtrack to the anti-Milosevic movement of the 1990s. - https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/slaughter-nick-for-president-from-star-of-cheesy-cop-show-to-serbian-cult-hero/article11793705/"

Flavours of Romania,"Further proof that tv is just used to keep everyone complicit, or not - depending on what the goal is,"
Flavours of Romania,Futurama. Single Female Lawyer.
Flavours of Romania,I love it when you find out that a show has a bizarrely huge following in another country.
Flavours of Romania,"Fun Fact: During WWI The Romania Army had a standing order that only Majors and above were/are allowed to wear makeup.

Another Fun Fact: Also during WWI a Romanian Army Group surrendered to the Russians. Russia was Romania's Ally. Needless to say the Romanians were not amused."
Flavours of Romania,"""The confusion, as Falk explains, came from the fact that the Romanian government had a quota on how much American television could be viewed in the country. With Columbo averaging less than 10 shows per season, the people of Romania were convinced that the government was keeping more episodes from them, stoking fears of a massive protest. ""

&#x200B;

Communism at it's finest.

Also a perfect test case when a state (Alabama) or country bans abortions. Romania banned abortions and contraception in 1966 to increase the population. People found ways thru back alley doctors where thousands died from it, or ended up with a bunch of homeless kids. Sex became a burden for them."
Flavours of Romania,Today I learn Romania is a country-sized “assisted living center”.
Flavours of Romania,I think this was the plot of that flashback episode of WandaVision.
Flavours of Romania,Romania cea mai tare 🇷🇴💪💪💪👏👏👏
Flavours of Romania,Columbo is head and shoulders above most 70s TV cop shows and still is fantastic today. The only thing that comes close is Kojak and both are partly due to solid writing and exceptional leads.
Flavours of Romania,Reminiscent of Tropic thunder really
Flavours of Romania,It was a dictatorship. I think they likely had a bit more control than this
Flavours of Romania,I watched The Chase this week and learned that Romanians built a statue of Colombo because Peter Falk had Romanian roots. I’m guessing that what caused OP to research.
Flavours of Romania,Were they somehow using a steady drip of Colombo episodes to stave off an uprising?!
Flavours of Romania,I really want to see a respect thread for Mrs. Columbo.

Flavours of Romania,"Back in the 70s there were four Sunday night detective shows. We got one per week. Colombo, Mannix, Cannon, or Barnaby Jones.  Colombo was my favorite. Mannix was more action packed and more racially unbiased.  Cannon and Barnaby Jones were ridiculous IMHO."
Flavours of Romania,"This Columbo, he pretends to be stupid... ...but he's really smart as a tack!"
Flavours of Romania,"There needs to be a reboot, but they MUDT pick the correct actor for the role"
Flavours of Romania,Sounds like a futurama episode
Flavours of Romania,Jojo reference because jotaro used to watch columbo
Flavours of Romania,Columbo is life
Flavours of Romania,This reminds me of the scene in Wings of Desire where some German kids wonder if Peter Falk's character is Columbo. I didn't get why kids would care about that show of all things. Guess that's more plausible than I thought.
Flavours of Romania,Hard too believe he had a glass eye that gave him his trademark squint…
Flavours of Romania,Colombo is a legend
Flavours of Romania,My mum can understand. She has columbo on all day
Flavours of Romania,It’s like the Futurama episode
Flavours of Romania,"This reminds me of an episode from Futurama where the Earth gets invaded by aliens in the years 3000 and something because they want to see the ending of a law serial from the 70's. I know, what a crazy story! Hahaha!"

Flavours of Romania,"As someone that was born too late for Columbo, I've now watched all 10 seasons.  

I urge everyone to watch it. It just oozes charm, has lots of actors that you will recognize (Jamie Lee Curtis, original Spock (can't remember the name), captain Kirk (can't remember his name either), Leslie Nielsen (more than one appearance), plus several more that you just recognize but don't know the name of.  

Highly recommended by someone that doesn't normally go for that kind of show."

Flavours of Romania,They go together like lamb and tuna fish.
Flavours of Romania,Benjamin Franklin... his teeth were made of wool...
Flavours of Romania,I always felt like Columbo had to be a primary inspiration for the team behind Monk.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"They've had *three hours* to capture your attention. 

Lots of good stuff to watch out there, I wouldn't invest another five hours in the hope that it gets more interesting to you."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"It might just not be for you. Not every piece of media is for every person. If you're finding that it's not what you're looking for, that's cool.   


Not as to say there aren't legitimate criticisms (they really needed to fill in some information gaps and the way they handle the timeline IS confusing)."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Geralt is a good character. His story is pretty easy to work out. I don’t know why he goes everywhere with the bard, but it’s not the worst thing about the show. 

The Mage stuff is weird and the lore isn’t really explained. I just don’t get it, anyway. 

The cinematography is hit and miss. The on location shots look good. The obvious sets are obvious. Which isn’t bad, per se, but they seem to switch between the two in establishing shots and shots with dialogue. 

The CGI is not good. I will say one word that hopefully will sum up the difference between GoT and the Witcher: Dragons."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"They spent $10,000,000 per episode?!"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Even without any knowlodge of the Witcher (Played the third one for 3 hours and stopped) this Series is pretty easy to understand.   
They just jump from different times to another but it ain't that difficult.   
There are series with way more different character so it's not so hard to follow.   
The athmosphere is fantastic, don't really get what you talk about."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Around the age of 35 or so... you begin to realize that every movie is just a mish-mash of movies and ideas that came before it.

The hit series 'The Expanse' -- it's just a soap opera set in space really, with cool graphics and alien goo thrown in."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,For 10 mil per episode those dragons could have looked far more spectacular. Really the only thing I was very disappointed with. The dragons were SHIT!
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"To help with the confusion a bit.

The three main characters are Yennefer, Geralt, and Ciri.

All the Geralt scenes happen in order compared to other Geralt scenes, Yennefer scenes happen in order as compared to other Yennefer scenes and Ciri scenes happen in order as compared to other Ciri scenes, but each character's storyline starts at a different point in time, so when they switch from one character to another the time period switches. Yennefer's story starts decades before Geralts, and Geralt's starts decades before Ciri's. Also all the mages don't age, and Geralt ages extremely slowly. Regular humans age normally though, but makeup did a bad job of portraying that for Calanthe and Jaskier imo. For example the scenes with Calanthe in episode 4 take place about 15ish years before the scenes in episode 1, but she looks the same age imo."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,It’s not for everybody so don’t worry. Same way Thrones wasn’t for everybody either.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Season 2 onwards won’t have any timeline switching so the people who couldn’t keep up should be fine
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"your first sentence makes me ignore your opinion. you went in with expectations it would be 'like game of thrones' - expectations will almost always kill your appreciation of any art.

and 'comparison is the death of art' has been a saying for a while now.

that said, the timeline confusion is a problem for this season, but they say it'll clean up the timeline stuff next season. which is admittedly a cop-out."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I dont know why the hell people even begin to compare this show with GOT. Story wise or budget wise. They are two completely different things. Never once did i think GOT when i first saw the show. Its a high HIGH fantasy show, more magic than political intrigue. It has its flaws but heck so did GOT even in its early days. 

If you think its bad, thats just your opinion. Emerald City and The Outpost are far far worse high fantasy series than this. 
Got S8 spent 10mil per episode but where did all the outstanding sets, costumes and CGI lead it? To a dumpster fire because the writing was utter garbage.

Edit: Grammar"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"As someone who played the games and was previously invested in the Witcher story prior to the Netflix show it's probably a lot more enjoyable and that's where I'd figure most of the praise is coming from, although I definitely agree that the way they handled the story and the timeline is frustrating and without the prior knowledge I had it would definitely be more confusing than not."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I have no prior association with The Witcher series, never played the games or read the books, but I enjoyed it. Henry Cavill does a great job, and I like the story overall. There were a few actors that didn't do as well as the others (Queen Calinthe) but apart from that, I'd say it's a solid 7/10 show for an average viewer."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Because it's three different stories, set in different times, and doesn't even unify into a single thread until episode five or six. This is just the first season, and you expect something that was originally a Polish tale to translate into English TV? They've made a few movies AND TV shows in Poland off the books, try checking those out with English subs if you want to see how well it actually fairs without the game hype?"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"If the story is confusing, some that's important to understand that. Not everybody does is that in the early episodes the events aren't happening at the same time. The Geralt storyline, and the Ciri story, and the Yennefer story are happening many years apart. After they develope them each individually, they start to bring them together chronologically. They tell you this in subtle ways from the beginning, but they don't smack you over the head with this fact until like episode 4 or 5, so it can be easy to miss."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"They really should have put location/year stamps on the screen for the past stuff, like every other TV show does. Breaking it up the way they did without telling the audience didn't really lead to any big twists or reveals, and would've saved a bunch of confusion."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I loved the first episode and hated the second. I hated it so much I haven’t been able to start the third episode. Not sure I ever will.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Timeline isnt linear. Things will make sense in the end.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"4th episode was the one for me. Its written like Dunkirk, but instead of 2 hours its 8, so getting through its tough. I didn't read books or played games, so if you don't know whats going on you need to stick with it, second half is much better paced.

There are 3 timelines for 3 main characters and i realised it clearly by the fourth episode, as soon as i realised it, it all became very clear, the structure, where season 1 will end, etc.

I think its gonna work really well on the repeat viewing."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Welcome to the future of television.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I thought the CGI was terrible and took me out of it. Nearly every effect is Scorpion King level distracting. It's so dated and it just came out.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,i waited till episode six for it to get better before i realized that i just didn't care lol.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I have one episode left to watch, but so far, I'd give the show 7/10 or something like that. It kinda reminds me the show Hercules from the 90s. I agree wit you on the CGI and sets, it doesn't look really good, especially [spoiler](#s ""the dragons in episode 5 or 6, gawd they look awfull!"")."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I honestly thought it could have been better. Some of the episodes were entertaining, some were just weird af when it came to acting/ dialogue. Hopefully, we see an improvement in s2... For those tryna compare this to GoT lol there's a long way to go to reach that level. The creature designs were impressive when they stuck with practical effects compared to the CGI they used which was meh."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I like it. Have rewatcheda few episodes and just find it comfy.

But I am with you on some of the criticism. The show really does look terrible. 

I can't take the Nilfgard dick armor seriously.

The swordplay is awful except for Geralt.

I watch it bc I like the characters and a fantasy setting."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I'm pretty fond of the witcher and to be fair it's really not at the level of the game. Most of the show is below average, set, acting, etc... Imo the best part of the show is Yen genesis. Cavill overplay everything even the ""hmpf"" part.

About the story ""fuzzyness"" it's because of the base material.Those épisode are based on thé essays, explaining some of the charachters back story. The Real story take place afterward according to my girlfriend who read the book.

On an other hand the show is not as Bad as I thought wich is nice.

Sry for typos and stuff on my phone and lazzy"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,THE SPRAY PAINT SNOW.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I am baffled that they spend 10 Mill an episode on that shit. The costumes were shit, the sets were horrible and the whole thing just felt like actors on a set."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Watch all of them or gtfo.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Honest question. How does it *look* like GoT? Because there's swords?
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I was onboard for most of the show but that ending was just awful. You could literally see them run out of budget during the episode.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,On diversity hires.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Who decided this is a Netflix flagship series? 

Why not The Great British Baking Show, which is popular enough to be aired by U.S. Netflix on a weekly basis in tandem with the U.K.? How about Grace & Frankie and Orange is the New Black, their longest-running originals? Or Unbelievable, which Netflix claims was the second most-watched TV series this year after Stranger Things? The Crown is the one that's swimming in awards nominations, if that counts for anything."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"it was honestly pretty bad

the main thing why it sucked was because the writer(s) sucked. Honestly makes you appreciate D&D to some degree for first X seasions of GoT than this disjointed mess

how it could be 100x better:

\- a linear timeline instead of jumping all over the place. Maybe some people could pull it off but they're out of their depth with handling this... Makes viewers very confused especially when you haven't read the books or played the games

\- taking their time instead of rushing every plot point like checking off a list. Seriously most TV show viewers aren't short on time, people enjoy slowly digesting a new world instead of the writers shoving down stuff down their throats. refer to GoT s1

\- quit casting for sake of diversity. Like dude it's not racist if you cast white people for a characters that are white in the books. How would you feel if black panther was asian and frodo was played by a black guy? Like it doesn't make sense and ruins the immersion"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I made it 3/4 of the way through one episode. I can’t get into the renaissance fair circle jerk with shows like this or GoT
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"My wife and I played a game while watching the show.  Everytime someone is about to have sex, just add....""And then....they boned!"" after the last sentence and while they are kissing.  I don't know why but it made it much more fun to watch.  

Also, the women in this show are written terribly.  I liked the show and all, but every time there is a woman on the screen there is a 90% chance that woman is going to have sex and it gets old REAL quick."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I haven't watched it yet, but I am already annoyed at how cool it's becoming to hate this show.  

  

Like shut up already."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"What decides whether to market on merit or money?

Nothing against the Witcher, but some shows like Mandolorian and and The Morning Show also had excessive talk about the price tag."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,If you think it looks bad you should get some glasses. Also paying attention prevents confusion.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Need spoon feeding much? The refreshing part of this series is its non-linear narrative and it’s design decision to not over-explain the story. Too often shows give the audience everything, leaving little to imagination and contemplation. That said not everyone liked Pulp Fiction or The Machinist either. The show is disjointed. Maybe better questions to ask are _”What is the director trying to say in the story at this moment?”_ and _”how does this scene tell me where the characters are on their journey?”_

I also suspect your focus on the financial cost of these shows is misplaced. Costs of production are massive. It’s not filmed on an iPhone but rather cutting edge equipment, and there are big crews which are needed to get the content you see, location fees, insurance, clean-up costs, over and above the standard costs like actors and stunts, post processing, and pre-production. Your preconceived notion of what money buys in this case isn’t giving you the full picture. 

Just sit back and enjoy something new and try not over analyse the _’what could have been’_."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,[deleted]
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,">I know nothing of the books

You missed nothing of importance. There's a reason why most of the books weren't even available in English before the games came. They range from outright bad to decent. The author isn't very good, and TW isn't a very good setting for literature or TV imo. 

Its a good gaming setting though."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,What makes me laugh is all the hype for this kind crap  . And then on top of that Netflix will totally discontinue a excellent show usually by the third season generally  ' despite good feedback and a loyal fan base  🙄  ...Netflix logic  lol
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"It really doesn’t get any better. I enjoyed the first three episodes then it slowly drops in quality imo. Just after watching episode 6 and thought it was dreadful. Don’t have the will power to finish the series anymore, unfortunately."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"This response is so balanced I had to check for a minute I was still on Reddit, lol."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"And the sets and costumes do look cheap. All of OPs criticisms are valid. This isn’t a case of the usual “I’m not the target audience so it sucks,” he’s making valid points about the craft of the storytelling. It’s getting a pretty massive pass on Reddit that other shows don’t because of the title."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,">It might just not be for you.

I'm kind of sick of seeing this response in defense of this show. This is like telling someone who literally just ate actual shit that it ""might not just be for him"" if he says it is disgusting and tastes like crap just because you somehow enjoyed the taste of the shit yourself, it isn't ""just not for him"" it just objectively tastes like shit, whether you enjoy that shitty taste or not is entirely up to you but acting like it tastes good and the person just doesn't like its taste is stupid.



From OP's post its obvious he likes game of thrones and i bet he likes harry potter and lord of the rings too so why would you think this show wouldn't be for him? He clearly enjoys fantasy and theres nothing in the witcher lore that makes it any crazier or weirder than the aformentioned franchises. He dislikes the show because it is poorly made, as simple as that. The cgi is bad, it is melodramatic, the dialogue is poor, the editing is confusing, the performances range from terrible to good and the tone is wildly inconsistent. 


You wouldn't say Transformers 2 is ""not for him"" if he said he disliked that because its widely agreed upon that the film is a mess so why are you saying it for this?

Stuff like Wes Anderson or Ari Aster movies are not for everyone despite them being well made on every level but acting like a high fantasy show like this isn't sonething that most people would like if done well is ridiculous. Witcher 3 isn't one of the best selling games of this decade because the property isn't ""for everyone""."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I thought the bard was a cool introspective choice. Geralt is used to solitude and not caring about the praise and adulation that you'd think would come with his line of work; not only does he rarely get a thanks with his payment, but a lot of people actively despise/fear him. But the bard is there, singing about him and seemingly grateful for his protection and companionship. The episode with the djinn shows Geralt genuinely cares for him; like if the bard wasn't there, Geralt wouldn't really be as humanized as he is, y'know?"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,The bard is great friends with him in the books. He annoys others but Geralt and Him are total bros.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I feel like half of it went to Henry.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I believe the whole season was $65 million
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Poor resource management surely. Cavill well paid but only a fraction of the budget and most of the rest of the actors are relative unknowns who should be cheap.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,It looks kinda cheap in so many ways though...
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Yeah, this one of their big budget shows...."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,I watched doctor sleep yesterday and thought it was basically spooky Inception.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Yeah, I don't know how they managed that. Especially after the creature with the assassin was frankly awesome and terrifying, but they couldn't get a damn dragon right?"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"GoT first few seasons were great, even though S8 was complete garbage

people mostly compare with how GoT handled their s1 than  Witcher

Witcher s1 is wayyyyyy too fast, and this has nothing to do with high fantasy low fantasy it just shows good world building vs. bad world building

imagine 8 episodes covering span of like 40 years with 3 different branches... It's confusing af and the dialogue and plot points are way too dumbed down for it to work"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Then please PM me about a certain scene in episode 7. Im very confused. The very last part with Ciri. Wtf was that about?
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"To me it sort of feels like how those who weren't happy with Fallout 76 latched onto Outer Worlds, and heaped on more praise than it deserved. In this case it felt like instead of Fallout 76 it was Game of Thrones.

I played the three games and read the books, but I thought the show was okay. Something about the production kind of gave off a cheap vibe, and I didn't think the music scoring was that good with it sometimes feeling too modern or kind of giving a Harry Potter type fantasy vibe. Had a hard time connecting with most of the characters too, but I did come to like Henry Cavill as Geralt. 

Kind of puzzled how each episode was $10 million. I expect it to be better for season 2. I ended up gaining more appreciation for the early seasons of Game of Thrones after watching Witcher sort of like how some gamers came to appreciate the sense of exploration of Fallout 4 after Outer Worlds."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"To be honest...by the 3rd episode, it was very clear that the narrative was non-linear.  
  
I passively watched the show and wouldn’t be able to tell you the name of most of the characters, but I feel like the story overall took very basic comprehension.  
  
This wasn’t even remotely as difficult as say, Season 2 of Westworld. I can’t help, but feel like this issue is exaggerated, but I could just be wrong honestly"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"exactly. people were talking about aha! moments where you pieced the timelines together, but you dont gain any new info from realizing there were 3 separate timelines. when movies and tv does the hidden multiple timeline thing, its supposed to build up to something big, but this was just not that"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"3rd episode is great especially the last 20 mins. Creapy monster, great fight and a great metamorphosis scene with a absolute bonkers transition and score."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I think of all of them only the 8th episode was a miss for me. I couldn't get into the brotherhood plot, and the ""big battle"" was frankly disappointing all around."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I thought the 3rd episode was a bit better as it was a Monster of the Week episode. And the hunchback girls story finally goes somewhere.

But I'm still struggling with the whole series, ngl."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,The Geralt/Filavandrel chat was just so disappointing.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,What is this supposed to mean?
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Budget does.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,What are you talking about I saw four episodes and there was one sex scene.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"You're really misplacing that argument a bit, since Netflix still has the overall strongest(if only by sheer quantity) quality content of all the services. 

No one would really rate Netflix originals higher simply because they're on Netflix. Otherwise they wouldn't have canceled some of their originals.

The show isn't that good, granted. But it tries to catch a general TV audience that has never heard of The Witcher, plus gamers who made a mediocre fantasy franchise, into a big worldwide hit. It clashes. 

The Witcher certainly isn't The Mandalorian, which succeeds mainly on applying brevity and restraint, and not making the mistakes it's franchise has been doing for the past decades. Making it the best its been on the screen since the last century. TW on the other hand, has to figure things out on its own."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,[deleted]
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Wait so you made it thru 6 hours of a 8 hour show and are going to skip the last 2 when it all comes together...I mean you do you but that's just seems like a complete waste.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,The only thing that kept me interested was Yen's story. But Ciri and Gerry are 😴
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"What can I say, I'm a freak."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Can't say I had any issue with the sets or costumes. The dragon CGI in Episode 6 was pretty bad, but otherwise it looked pretty good. Even the big battle effects (and I didn't even like that part)."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,The fact that you got downvoted to hell is funny. This show  really got 3 midgets at the 7-11 and told them to dress up.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Agreed, not to mention that besides Cavill doing a good Geralt, the acting and actors are mostly crap.

I kinda feel sorry for Cavill. He's doing roles he really wants to do with Superman and Geralt, but he's being bogged down by poor writing and productions."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"sometimes even decently made medium in genres you like don't quite hit the mark for you for whatever reason.  


I think the witcher is good, 6 or 7 out of 10. it's not perfect and I can see how it could be confusing with the timeline.   


But maybe this one thing just... isnt for them?  


For example I love science fiction from Futurama to interstellar to alien but I just can't get into Ex Machina. By all means I should love that movie but idk it just doesnt hit the mark for me."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Except...it's not in defense of the show. It's a response that's true across all media. If you don't like it, it's okay to not like it. But that you just wrote a 3 paragraph diatribe because you couldn't accept a simple truth says a lot more about you than anyone giving anyone this response."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,True.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"the whole season is just a bunch of short stories. if you cant comprehend it... you should go back to something even less ""complex"" like peppa the pig"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Trust me people who first watched Got with no knowledge of the books were left lost and confused from all the names of characters, locations and past events they had to keep in mind to keep up with the story. Dialogue was so complex and interwoven with foreshadowing that to this day you can still rewatch the series and pick out things you didn’t realize before. The dialogue got dumbed out more in later season because 2D are idiots and cant write for shit and have to literally spoon feed the audience on all the details."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,GoT first season was complete shit. I couldn’t even finish it.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"You're going to have to give me a bit on that unfortunately since I've only gotten to episode four, sorry."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"It was clear they were different timelines but it wasn't clear when they were taking place. It added absolutely nothing to the show. It was just annoying. It's terrible decisions like that that will ruin the show for plenty of people. It's no fun when the show gives you obvious spoilers from the beginning. It didn't improve anything knowing that Queen whatsherfuck was a complete moron every  because we knew that every choice she made was going to be the worst possible one. It's a very average, campy show. The people making it just didn't realize it. It's like watching Spartacus. Sure there's some story but the titties and fighting are more interesting."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Because it was just there to put Ciri and Yen front and centre before they appear in the story.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,The intro cut scene to the first Witcher game was basically episode 3 of the show.  I though that was really cool.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Thanks. Guess I will give it a go.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,The blockbusterization of TV
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"Me too. I agree it has issues, but I think I like it because of how it humanizes Geralt and Yen, and gives us an insight to the complication of their relationship. Also while others thought Geralt snapping at Jaskier was out of character, that was the point. He's under incredible emotional pressure from that moment, and lashing out because he can't cope with it.   


Shame about the CGI on the dragon though."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,">i was prepared to like it [spoiler](#because of dragons but then the dragons were so fucking hideous that you can tell netflix screwed their animators once again """")"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"What I was thinking. I don't plan on watching the show, but if I was that invested I'd force myself to sit through it just to see how the fuck it ends."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"As a teenager I watched all 4 seasons of heroes just to fall asleep on the second to last episode.. when I woke up I realised I didn’t actually care about the show anymore and never bothered finishing it. 

That’s almost 70 hours invested to say fuck it at the last hour and give up."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Finishing it for the sake of finishing it would be an even bigger waste of time. You gain precisely nothing by finishing a series you aren't enjoying anymore. Best cutting your losses and moving on to the next thing.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,If it hasn’t come together by episode 6 and there are 8 episodes then that sounds like a bad show
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,A rare specimen indeed.
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Episode 2 looks very cheap to me
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"i think people are just spoiled by big budget fantasy battles. by television standards, the witchers werent bad. they werent the best, but there are worse examples in other shows. the dragon cgi was atrocious tho"
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,"I mean, marvel got a midget and made him a giant with CGI, that was stupid and laughable looking."
The Witcher: A Look Inside the Episodes,Did he not want to do Man from UNCLE?
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I wish there were legitimate ways to watch older episodes without forking over $100 for a DVD collection. I dunno how they attract new viewers if there's no way to catch up on storylines. I understand all the way to the beginning would be crazy, but even being able to access the last couple decades on a streaming service would be cool."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,The show hasn't been the same since they killed of Dr Drake Ramoray
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I haven't watched the show in decades, but I'll always have a fondness for the 80s era - Bo & Hope and Steve ""Patch"" Johnson, Eugene and Calliope, Shane the spy, evil Victor Kiriakis.  Marlena and Roman.  Good stuff."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,I miss when it used to appear on nbc
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Everyone jokes but shows like this remind me of my grandma watching when she would stay over when she was getting to the end. Makes me miss her a lot
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,I can hear the opening narration forty years after my last sick day from school.
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I stopped watching at season 54, is it worth coming back to?"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Is Marlena still possessed by Satan?
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Fantastic news.

The show continues to be enjoyable and somehow is funnier than more shows on TV, comedies included."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Peacock has breathed new life into the soap genre.
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,...or *was* it!?!!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Okay, so I just watched a promo (the Bo and Hope one) for this show and all I can say is what the fuck did I just watch? Like I said in another comment I'm from the UK, I watch Coronation Street sometimes with my girlfriend, but just from going off the promo, this looks almost like a parody. Corrie and the UK soaps in general take themselves pretty seriously. Please tell me people don't actually take this show seriously."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,[deleted]
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Awww, I've got a soft spot for Days. My friends and I had lecture class and we'd take turns missing the first half of class to catch the show and then bring everyone else up to speed at the break."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I watched it for a good few years in my teens just for Nadia Bjorlin. There was a storyline that felt like Lost on crack with a mysterious island. Also, it was a bummer that they swapped the Brady Black of that era and recast the same actor in a different role later on. Soaps man, just bonkers!"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Must I have seen the first 59 seasons to understand the new season?
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Best show on TV!!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,I wasnt aware they still ran soaps. Where do you even find them?
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I don't know if you've ever seen a daytime soap opera like Days but, at least from what I remember, they're more or less designed so that you can jump in on them at any point and get caught up pretty easily. They repeat plot points a lot, the progression is slow, often it's the same day for like weeks, a scene between characters could last an entire episode or longer. If you miss more than a few episodes it's not really worth going back, especially since they air five days a week, pretty much every week.

That being said some crazy shit has happened on Days over the years, it might be smart of them to put up compilations or edit down earlier seasons for people to watch. Dunno if there's anything like that."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"There are over 14,000 episodes of Day of Our Lives.

While I definitely agree that they need to market their more popular story-lines (the possession, the couple of people who have been buried alive, Stefano trapping Marlena in a giant bird cage, Melas Island and the serial killer, etc...) into easy to watch playlists, they're never going to release everything in any kind of easy-to-watch format.

Even if they were all available, it would take several years to watch through all of them."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Catch up after 60 seasons? If anything what they need is a recap service.

Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Steve, Marlena, and Roman are still on the show. Victor is technically still there, but his actor recently died so I'm sure he'll be written off next season. Bo & Hope are supposed to be coming back soon, supposedly tomorrow or Friday from what I've heard."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"> Calliope

Huh. Never saw this name spelled out. Feels like I would have misspelled this horribly if forced to type it out."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"My mom practically raised me on Days, so I was there through all of the 80s and early 90s stuff, but I don't remember Eugene and Calliope."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I would sit and watch grandma's ""stories"" for a couple hours every day, when I would visit, because I couldn't play NES until she was done.

Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I'll always remember hearing The Young and the Restless theme at FULL VOLUME, with my grandmother folding laundry in the living room. 

I also remember the time she was watching a movie...

Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"> often it's the same day for like weeks

Seriously? I'm from the UK and even though I'm not really a big soap watcher, I still catch a few episodes of Coronation Street when my girlfriend watches it. They don't really do this. Usually one episode is one day in soap world. I can imagine it would get really confusing otherwise."

Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"That's great that there's still old timers on.  (Of course, I remember when the ""old-timers"" Alice Horton and MaDonald Carey.)  Is he still the one who announces the show?"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Eugene and Calliope were great.  They were kind of the comic relief of the show.  Almost everyone had the standard chiseled ""soap opera"" look, whereas their characters were very unique, with wonderfully quirky personality traits.  They were the funniest and most charming characters from that era, I would argue.  Trivia, for the genre inclined:  Eugene was played by John De Lancie, who would later become known to Star Trek fans as Q, from The Next Generation.  Calliope was played by Arleen Sorkin, who, in a dream sequence from this very show, was the inspiration for the character of Harley Quinn, and who voiced her on Batman: The Animated Series."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Days is different. Peacock actually promotes it, which is one huge thing nobody else is doing, and they’re doing Days live events in their app. Pretty radical compared to the “dump it on streaming and only advertise it *during* the tv broadcast” stuff others are doing."

Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"lol then maybe a soap opera isn't for you. There are nearly 15,000 episodes of Days."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I'm the same but trust me soaps are kind of designed to just jump in mid stream and just go with it.

As someone once told me, there's no beginning and no end just middle and middle is all there will be."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"If you had access to every single episode of Days and played it 14 hours a day with no breaks or holidays, it'd still take well over 18 months, if not much more than that."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Well then don't go into soap like this. It's impossible to be a completionist with a show like that lol. Even if that was your full time job, it'd be hard."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I'm not a big soap watcher either, but I remember a few years ago EastEnders did like 2 weeks in January where all the episodes were set on New Years Eve and viewers complained about them dragging it out too long. 

It was about mid-January and someone told me ""EastEnders is still celebrating New Years"" and I went and looked up what people were saying about it. Really made me think about how British audiences would react to the pacing in American soaps."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"> I can imagine it would get really confusing otherwise.

I suppose it's one of those ""soap logic"" things people just have to get used to, like characters suddenly aging up/down, actors being swapped out, people coming back to life, etc."

Ah, now I remember them, but I could have sworn they were on Another World."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"""Live events"" have to be the future of streaming. Whether actually live (like Chris Rock's special) or just live premieres it seems like a way to make your show hit harder on social media. So many shows get lost when an entire season gets dumped at 3am. 

I feel like we're going to get more and more aspects from linear TV back in our streaming services. Live premieres with post shows, linear channels like Pluto has, building a schedule of similar shows to make a block of programming."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"> law clerk/granddaughter

My only complaint is episodes end with Judy in her chamber giving her editorial-style opinion with her clerk / granddaughter.

It's not Judy's editorial that bothers me, I actually find it the most enjoyable part of the show (whether I agree with her or not). It's that Sarah kind of sits there and smiles, agreeing with nods, and not saying much of anything. 

If you read old Greek philosophers they'll have essays where they present their ideas and then some nobody sidekick whose only job is to say ""Plato you're so smart"". It's a style I get but it annoys me."

Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Fell down an elevator shaft, I suppose."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Asshole! Good riddance.
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,omg what i loved him on hollywood heights
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Drugs, Suicide, or Car?

Edit: Drugs it is!"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Oh nooo.  Anyways!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I grew up across the street from him, I was a few years older though. My only real memory of him was him getting a mophead and it being very loud as he drove it up and down the street."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"It's days of our lives.

Is he really? Or will his evil twin brother come back next season?"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,...or was he pushed?!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"That's incredibly sad, he's leaving behind 3 little kids.    And assholes here are making jokes ."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I follow him and his wife on IG and by all accounts it seemed they were separated. Lots of cryptic posts over the last few months by both too. Don't believe for a second that he was the ""best husband"" that she claims.  Dude should have been in jail and she was distancing herself from him. Sus."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,The comment section of filled with assholes.
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Is this the dude who was in that Hollywood Heights soap opera on Nickelodeon? Holy shit
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,[deleted]
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,But what if this guy had died at the hands of a 17yr old with an AR at a BLM protest 😎
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Wow. Fuck this dude.

NEXT!"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Don’t believe everything you read. It was disproved! Look that up!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Consider the fact that a lot of people like that were often victims of abuse themselves.

It's not like they just choose to be assholes."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Not to mention, she had totally distanced herself from him completely as far as anyone knew. Honestly pretty sus."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"I ended up personally contacting CNN, telling them they needed to include this information; Especially the rape charge, as this means a grand jury found the complaint credible on **legal grounds**."
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,[deleted]
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,He didn’t rape that girl! It was disproved!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,[deleted]
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,[deleted]
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,Huge loss for his wife and kids! The rape allegation was disproved! He didn’t do it! So you’re the horrible person for trying to condemn an R.I.P innocent man!
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,My question is why do you follow them on IG??
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,"Yes, they were going through marital problems but she is beyond broken over his death. You have no idea so don’t claim to know! And he wasn’t a pedo! It was disproved! He’s never touched a child!"
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,It was disproved! He didn’t rape that girl! Little do you know
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,He was a really bad dude apparently. You have free reign.
Diary of our Days at the  Breakwater,You’re the sick one! That rape allegation was disproved!

The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Details:

>Mullally and Offerman will be play a mild-mannered married couple named Jean and Gene, who are college professors."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Ron and Tammy 2 are back.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Nick Offerman is in EVERYTHING these days. Why has he been hiding for so long after Parks and Rec??
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,How the fuck does Megan manage to look half Nick’s age when she’s 12 years older than him?  What the fuck is her skincare routine?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"“I mean, the deal's not quite closed but let's just pretend it is,"" Mullally said, revealing they start filming ""in a couple of weeks.""

GOAT"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Why does Megan Mullally look so different in this picture?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"I feel sorry for the runners sent to get them out the trailer, lord knows there's going to be some gingerly knocking after the first time"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"I haven't seen season 3 yet, is it worthwhile?"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Why does he look so yellow
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Tammy 2 is the true world ender.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Love these two. Just saw Nick's performance in the Last of Us. Give that man an award. Well done.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,They obviously work so well together and I'm excited they will both be in the new Party Down revival.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,IDK if I can watch it. This last season was so convoluted and weird I almost shut it off.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"I’m hoping this final season gets some more flexibility and freedom after how season 3 clearly suffered from Covid restrictions. 

I’m still annoyed >!they spent so much time in the hotel after wasting the Sparrows. They should have trapped the Sparrows in the hotel as well and turned it into a multi-episode war with them controlling different parts of the building!<."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,This is what I want from a Hollywood power couple!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,That frigid bitch Tammy got her tendrils back in him
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Im assuming him working with Peter Hoar on that last of us episode helped make this happen. Very cool
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Might want to get that liver checked, Nick. Or fire your makeup artist."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Both of them are always value added. Very cool news.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,That will be fun.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Is Nick’s liver okay? Hard to tell if he is yellow or the contrast of the red hair is throwing me off.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Someone’s had some work done
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Do they offer a 2 for 1 deal
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Does he look jaundice to you?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Hell yes
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Shit is about to get weird
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Fuck my pooper I’m so happy
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,I feel like this is gonna be a great addition.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,How this show made it past season 1 episode 1 is beyond me. I truly despised this atrocity of a show.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,They are trying very hard to get people to watch it again
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Wow!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Absolute units of talent these two
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,I have such a crush on both of them but I think just a little bit more on Nick
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Ack, I thought this was a divorce announcement when I saw the photo!!! 😰"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Nick Offerman supremacy
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,I’m always stoked to see these 2 in a project together! Their chemistry is unmatched!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,I love that these two come as a package
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,He is not longer Ron Swanson to me.   He is Bill Swanson.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Suddenly interested again.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Oh yes please!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Nick Offerman is literally in everything these days. Pretty wild!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,The contemporary Offerman resurgence (or just continued upward trajectory perhaps?) has been awesome. Dude is surprisingly dynamic and I’ve yet to see him in anything where he didn’t improve the quality of the show/movie with his performance.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,“As themselves”
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,[deleted]
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Last of us
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Fuck well now I have to finish watching the last season. Ugh.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,That show is so original.. and awesome 👏
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Yessssss!!!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,This show had so much potential… season one was great and imo it went downhill after that. Hoping season 4 does a good job of tying up loose ends.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Looking at that table read photo, it never connected in my head that Tom Hopper wasn't that huge in real life. He's a svelte dude!"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Yes!!!
Can’t wait."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Nice! I'm excited to see more Nick Offerman after his great performance in The Last of Us episode.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Offerman staying booked and busy.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Glad for them, but I’m glad this is the final season. I like the show, but it’s so draining."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Great, great show"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Never forget that she’s 64!!!!! Wow
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Shit now I gotta watch just for Nick
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Is it just me, or has Nick Offerman been increasingly present in movies, tv, etc lately? He’s always had work, but I feel like he’s busier…?"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,I LOVE NICK OFFERMAN!!!!!!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Karen Walker approves of this message.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"All I know about the show is that I watched it and liked it. I have no idea what’s going on plotwise. Yes, I’ll watch the next season. No, I won’t understand it."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Looks like liver failure
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Woke Academy
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,This is the best news I’ve seen all week
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"these two actually dated at one point, just an FYI"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"She comes across as a bit of an airhead with her “like”, “you know”, “hello!”, “great, great, great…”.  

And I’d be saying the same thing about him if it applied."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Can we make sure the end of the world isn’t because of five’s powers? Boring the second time around.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,[removed]
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,YEEEEEEES AWESOME!!!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Shows dead
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Aww man they dragged those two into that mess?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,They won’t be enough to save it
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,There’s going to be another season? Why?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Cool!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"What the hell, that’s awesome"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,He and Frank are both dead.. how can he be in that?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Well.. I wasn’t expecting that but I’m in!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,No idea what that is. I’ll watch it now.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,These two would be awesome to hang out with.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"I love both of them, they’re hilarious !"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Yessssss!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Shit! How the hell was season 3 not the end? There was nothing left.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,I thought it ended?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Awesome. 

And what an awesome couple. 😁👍🏼"
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Damn, I cannot wait to see their chemistry on cam as a married couple."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Cool!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,But which ones gonna be which? Guess we gotta tune in to find out!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,i feel like its the crazy stuff of the show and their names being Jean and Gene but it makes me think of the Lutece twins from Bioshock Infinite.  Not really twins they are the same person in parallel universe
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,What's it like to stare in the eye of Satan's butt hole?
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Gene Parmesian!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"My grandparents were Gene and Jean (technically my granny is still Jean, she's still alive). Eugene and Jean, but they went by Gene and Jean.

My mother was first born, named Eugenia. Her brother? Eugene. 

I'm serious, it's an old, running joke. If they joke about ""having good genes/jeans"" in TUA, I'll spit."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"Huh, I was expecting he'd be Doctor Terminal. But considering how far this show has strayed from the source material, I guess anything goes."
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Of course they will be!
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,One of my sister's first husband's parents were named HeGene and SheJean.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,“I didn’t shave it off.  It rubbed off.  From friction.”
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,If they're not violently making out in every scene I'm not watching.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Ron as a woodworking professor and Tammy the college librarian.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Her evil cackling is something that hits so close to life. I know a Tammy in real life and she is 5150 for sure.
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,Glad it’s not Tammy 1
The Misfit of Demon King Academy,"He has been in lots of stuff but I don't think a ton of it made it into the zeitgeist. He hosted that crafting show, Making It, with his co-host Amy Poehler. My favorite thing he did was Devs, which was very good but its release got overshadowed a bit by the start of COVID and everybody watching Tiger King instead."
The Tale of Nokdu,Could have been 1 one hour episode.
The Tale of Nokdu,"He wasn't looking for a weaponised plane, he was expecting the fighter jet without the weapons though."
The Tale of Nokdu,"This is just a clickbait headline, the plane was never going to have weapons (except for being a high speed fighter jet itself) and the show IMO leaned towards the kind of over-the-top advertising at the time. 
It was fun and a bit of nostalgia for a person like me who lived through all of that."
The Tale of Nokdu,"I watched it. Lame ending, but it’s a true story so you can’t help how it ends. Seeing that Michael Avenatti was involved was an interesting twist, though."
The Tale of Nokdu,I actually didn’t mind it
The Tale of Nokdu,[Simpsons did it](https://youtu.be/YaYc5UP8PsI) better.
The Tale of Nokdu,"I really  enjoyed it. It was corny af, but had a wholesome 90s vibe I really enjoyed. A little long but I thought it was a lot of fun. And Mike Avenanti showing up under house arrest weeks before getting a decade in prison is hilarious"
The Tale of Nokdu,"Nobody mentions the problem with protagonist being interviewed as a grown man in front of the jet the entire time, although the story ends nowhere near that spectacular."
The Tale of Nokdu,"Was a nice fun watch. Definitely overlong but had a good positive vibe so didn't mind it too much. They could have maybe focussed more on the legal side from neutral point of view and asked experts about their views. That could have made the script tighter.

And the coke challenge with the main characters was fun too! Especially the first reaction when Todd said they both taste like shit lol."
The Tale of Nokdu,I watched it and Pepsi 100% owes that man a Jet.
The Tale of Nokdu,"Specifically said not weaponized. Otherwise, I thought was interesting in how it became a landmark for legal rhetoric going forward."
The Tale of Nokdu,Everyone that went to law school ever after this case collectively sighed already knowing how it ended.
The Tale of Nokdu,Deweaponised* plane. (Which was legal to own)
The Tale of Nokdu,"Honestly, the story lost some of its magic for me once he realized they can just write a check for the points. I was intrigued by his whole plan to buy all the Pepsi and rent warehouses to store them etc etc. 

But then once they saw you can just send in money, they did exactly that and I started to wonder if he did it as a publicity stunt."
The Tale of Nokdu,"Went to watch, saw it was 4 episodes and went ""nope."" The whole story can be told in 45 minutes... wtf?"
The Tale of Nokdu,"Misleading title, he wasnt expecting weapons"
The Tale of Nokdu,"The legal landmark moral of this story:  
Don't make an offer if you're not prepared to deliver."
The Tale of Nokdu,"They really could have done the whole thing in like...90 mins.  Clearly they were never gonna give him a jet, but offering him 2 cases of pepsi for his trouble was pretty sad."
The Tale of Nokdu,"I find ""oddly dull"" applies to 99% of streaming content"
The Tale of Nokdu,He didn’t get it and Stormy Daniels lawyer showed up.
The Tale of Nokdu,"I legit don’t understand why we let companies just blatantly lie and mislead people, but that seems to be an unpopular takeaway from this."
The Tale of Nokdu,Not true. He knew it wasn’t going to be weaponized. Just operational
The Tale of Nokdu,"Terrible title.

They never wanted a weaponized version.  Hell they called and asked if it was possible to own one without weapons and the answer was yes."
The Tale of Nokdu,I actually really enjoyed it. Watched it one sitting with my girlfriend and we didn’t wanna turn it off lol..some of the editing was really great and there wasn’t any droning narration to put us to sleep…it was a fun story to watch.
The Tale of Nokdu,"This is another one of those annoyingly edited nostalgia docs on Netflix. There are so many of them and they’re so annoying and pointless. 

Documentary: Remember when this happened and how this looked like this and how funny that was?

Viewer: Yeah, I remember that!

Documentary: That sure was cool, wasn’t it?

Viewer: Uh huh"
The Tale of Nokdu,Stop reading after review claimed only one guy noticed lack of fine print.
The Tale of Nokdu,Ya it wasn’t weaponized.
The Tale of Nokdu,If they watched the series they would know it wouldn't have been weaponized.
The Tale of Nokdu,"Yeah I watched the first episode and stopped. I couldn't believe they made a multi episodic show from this.

Most of the first episode was just fillers, fluff, and needless crap interwoven into the story just for the sake of expanding the runtime"
The Tale of Nokdu,"Just watched this w my girl last night, we like it"
The Tale of Nokdu,"Was good and he didn’t want a weaponized plane.  

Other than that, good title"
The Tale of Nokdu,The show was good. The guardian is worthless.
The Tale of Nokdu,So did he get the plane or what?!?
The Tale of Nokdu,*oddly* dull? it's not like the subject screams great excitement
The Tale of Nokdu,"The guy was just some douche who teamed up with his millionaire friend. Literally had enough money to throw it away on the chance they could pull it off. 

This is the story of rich assholes trying to make more money. I don't care about how they waste their money."
The Tale of Nokdu,The sub editor who wrote the headline didn’t watch the show. The checked about 10 minutes in to the first episode if it was possible to get harrier jump jets with weapons removed.
The Tale of Nokdu,He wanted the jet not the weapons. Calling it weaponized is inaccurate. Fighter jets can be owned and used by the public if they got the money. Of course they strip out a lot of weapons related components.
The Tale of Nokdu,"The jet wouldn’t have been “weaponized”. This title is misleading. It’s legal to own military equipment as a civilian, but certain things are disabled or taken off first. 

I actually enjoyed this show. I was upset at Pepsi over the Philippines. I will never buy another product again if theirs."
The Tale of Nokdu,"Shit headline. Pepsi promised a fighter jet, and he met the stipulations to earn it, then they reneged."
The Tale of Nokdu,"I really liked it! Did it need to be three or four episodes, no, but it had a cute framing device and I liked the surprise twist that it’s actually not about the jet, but about the friendship between the college kid and his business partner”, and ethics between friends. It was cute! I finished in the same evening while doing paperwork. He didn’t get the jet, but he did find his purpose (became a lawyer,) began a lifelong friendship, a great lift, and always has this really cool story."
The Tale of Nokdu,"Good reminiscences on '90s advertising and sitdowns with industry professionals from a specific campaign, very interesting recounting of a mentorship between the protagonist and his sponsor; a hypothetical multi-part episode from the kind of series you'd almost want CNBC or Bloomberg to screen during off-market hours."
The Tale of Nokdu,I can’t stand how every Netflix doco needs to do a 40 minute deep dive into the history / founders / childhood life of creator / company or whatever whenever they’re filming. 90% of the time it’s completely irrelevant and dead boring.
The Tale of Nokdu,"#1. It’s not weaponized. 
#2. It’s not a plane, it is a jet. 
#3. It’s not dull. It’s hilarious. 
#4. Fuck Pepsi Co. Evil bastards."
The Tale of Nokdu,"15 min in and turned off. I usually watch documentary stuff, but the main character just came off as dislikable. I don't know if it was the excitement they were trying to inject, but it wasn't appealing to me."
The Tale of Nokdu,Sounds like this show would make a good 10 min youtube video..
The Tale of Nokdu,Why did they not make a documentary about that time [a Pepsi campaign in the Philippines left five dead?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi_Number_Fever)
The Tale of Nokdu,"To this day I am shocked at the number of people who will try to argue that Pepsi should have had to come up with a plane. Like it's such an absurdly obvious joke. I was 12 when that commercial aired and I never thought it was anything other than a joke and thought these guys were tools at the time for trying to claim it.

What if, instead of a jet, it had been ""You get a moon base"" Would anyone still try to argue the point? That's an equally plausible idea for anyone who isn't a complete idiot."
The Tale of Nokdu,Still think he should have won this
The Tale of Nokdu,"I was familiar with this case before, and when I saw my wife watching this, I was wondering how they managed to make a full series out of this. You could sum this up in a 20 minutes video and not lose any interesting content.  
Netflix is just spamming content for us to watch now."
The Tale of Nokdu,"Tv execs need to understand when something is documentary series worthy, and when its 20 minute video essay worthy.

Why the fuck would i pay for a stream service to watch *class action park* when i can just watch the defunctland episode about it"
The Tale of Nokdu,"I feel they could have trimmed this entire series down to a good ten, fifteen minutes tops."
The Tale of Nokdu,"Show was wayyyy too long. That being said, Pepsi 1000% owes that kid a jet."
The Tale of Nokdu,A six part series about one time getting bad shrimp.
The Tale of Nokdu,"A guy with no legal case whatsoever sued Pepsi, they still offered a settlement which he declined, and then he lost in court as he absolutely should have. End of story."
The Tale of Nokdu,The guy who didn't get sarcasm...
The Tale of Nokdu,"He asked the DoD if a civilian could get a harrier they said yes, without the weapons and radars etc. then they the bacon guy said later on a press release “Hurr durr no a civilian can’t cause it’s a war plane hurr durr” which does not and did not address a demilitarized version. Which I believe is a valid question to have answered; which I suspect we would find to be yes a civilian can own a demilitarized piece of military hardware."
The Tale of Nokdu,"I watched it the pentagon said yes you may own a demilitarized jet , later in the film they walked back the statement. With that being said normal civilians own WW2 tanks and other forms of heavy equipment. There are heavy rules and regulations and taxes in place on said hardware. None the less Pepsi did drop the ball and thought no one would believe the add campaign. I was one of those kids when this campaign ran back in the day who said no way in hell is anyone getting a new a the time vertical take off jet fighter . Since this debacle we now have 10 minutes long disclaimers that might cause anal leakage or swollen nipples and subject to change."
The Tale of Nokdu,So god damn tired of everything from my childhood being a shitty netflix documentary.
The Tale of Nokdu,"first of all, it’s Weaponized, not weponised, and second of all, do people not know what a decommissioned jet is? You can buy mig-29s."
The Tale of Nokdu,J a mail p  b
The Tale of Nokdu,It could have been one episode. They repeat themselves so many times.
The Tale of Nokdu,I liked it. I did have the worst hangover in probably the last two years while watching it though. It is good for that.
The Tale of Nokdu,"This series is selling the 90s, shoulda been an hour and done. Still, I appreciate Netflix production on what could be a YouTube video."
The Tale of Nokdu,Huh I’ve had this in my queue - if it’s dull should I drop it?
The Tale of Nokdu,"wikipedia article:   exists. 

netflix :   let’s make more crap!"
The Tale of Nokdu,I loved the nostalgia of it.  They should of used the last episode for kool-aid points though.  I saved enough for a Mr Kool-Aid pitcher/jug.
The Tale of Nokdu,"Jesus. What a headline. 

I really enjoyed the light humour of almost all of the 4 45-minute Episodes and had some good lights along the way. 

I recommend it. It won’t change your life, though, like some of the shows that progressional reviewers privacy wish that you were watching /s"
The Tale of Nokdu,Bart gets an elephant
The Tale of Nokdu,"It felt like a made-for-tv filler piece with how slow the pacing was, really felt like they were trying to eat up as much time as possible"
The Tale of Nokdu,It's so exhaustingly boring. And should have only been one episode.
The Tale of Nokdu,"I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Maybe a tad long, but I remember this happening, so it was a fun watch."
The Tale of Nokdu,I haven't watched it...can't see it being better than the 20 minute youtube video I watched 5 years or so ago
The Tale of Nokdu,I work in marketing for a highly regulated industry (ie a long of fine print) and we often get blasted by executives because of all the fine print we have to put on our ads. This series really demonstrated why its so important
The Tale of Nokdu,Where’s my elephant?
The Tale of Nokdu,It’s not dull but this story is like a 10 minute YouTube video not a whole doc
The Tale of Nokdu,"Love how the end is basically, “so we didn’t get the money or the plane”"
The Tale of Nokdu,drag out way to long
The Tale of Nokdu,A lot of (if not all) the Netflix pop culture docuseries seem to be copies of stuff from YouTube. Only differences being (1)turning a 45~60 minute video into a series of 6 or more episodes and (2)making the content a lot less interesting.
The Tale of Nokdu,It wasn’t weaponized.  They verified with the Pentagon that it would be allowed if the missile weapons systems were removed. So kinda a de-weaponized jet.
The Tale of Nokdu,"Hey Raytheon, I’m suing pepsi if you don’t put some sidewinders on this harrier."
The Tale of Nokdu,Lol what makes this more than a 30 minute story at most?
The Tale of Nokdu,Wouldn’t this be covered by one line saying ‘while supplies last’?
The Tale of Nokdu,Never finished this - wasn’t really that interesting
The Tale of Nokdu,"Took me 15 mins to think ""fuckers are milking this"" and switched it off;  don't know, or care, how it ended."
The Tale of Nokdu,I thought about it and then I realized I would have more fun sodomizing myself with a Pepsi can than watching this drivel
The Tale of Nokdu,I made it about 5 minutes in before realizing what it was going to be. Sounds like I made the right call!
The Tale of Nokdu,wow another click bait tread/story.
The Tale of Nokdu,I don't understand why this needed to be a documentary series.
The Tale of Nokdu,One of the best classes in every first year of law school is this case
The Tale of Nokdu,"Should have been maybe a 90 minute thing. The four episodes was far too much.

Eta: there’s a documentary out there called The Perfect Bid. It’s about a guy who gamed The Price Is Right. I want to say it comes it at like 70 or 80 minutes. And it’s far more intricate of a story."
The Tale of Nokdu,It was more anti-climactic than dull….
The Tale of Nokdu,"Just struck me as a privileged guy, unphased by an easy life, not knowing when to give up on a greedy idea."
The Tale of Nokdu,I liked it. But mostly for nostalgia
The Tale of Nokdu,There are a lot of sour articles from The Guardian lately.
The Tale of Nokdu,Hard to do an underdog story when your underdog is an unlikable shitbird.
The Tale of Nokdu,"We read this case in law school, and I saw this commercial on Channel One, and I've never forgiven the judge for thinking it wasn't a reasonable expectation."
The Tale of Nokdu,"A very controversial story, Pepsi could have done better. You should listen to what this guy had to say; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EywUUgT-b1g&feature=youtu.be"
The Tale of Nokdu,It was boring. I don’t even remember that commercial. The dumbest part is…the dude didn’t take $ Pepsi offered him. The McDonald lottery documentary was much better.
The Tale of Nokdu,It was so boring
The Tale of Nokdu,Watched it and felt like I lost a chunk of my life.  It had your hopes up right till the end.  What was the point?
My Fellow Citizens,"There are tons of good improvisers, it sounds to me like you don’t have any familiarity with the comedy scene past network sitcoms from 10 years ago. Why even bring up The Big Bang Theory?"
My Fellow Citizens,"The latest episode was such an example of that. The references are still from 2 decades ago. And its obvious that the audience weren't getting them
 I still watch it for the Ryan colin banter which are the still the best parts of the show

Man I miss drew"
My Fellow Citizens,4x Greg Proops
My Fellow Citizens,Your issue is you're trying to find improvisors from a pool of sitcom actors from the past 15 years. Im sure without a doubt there are tons of great up and coming improvisors that you've never heard of that would be great on the show.
My Fellow Citizens,Just replace them with the four members of Big Grande and the show would be perfect
My Fellow Citizens,Middleditch and Schwartz and maybe blend in like Kenan Thompson
My Fellow Citizens,"Zac Woods, Ben Schwartz, Aubrey Plaza, Donald Glover, hosted by Joel McHale would be my dream lineup, but I feel like that's aiming too high.  


Zac Woods stays, he's a personal favorite.  Standout on every show he's been in for me.  Ken Marino maybe, he's always really funny in improv based shows like Party Down or Brooklyn 99 but never made it big like some of the others.  Tawny Newsome from Star Trek Lower Decks and Space Force.  Harvey Guillen would be my 4th choice since I don't know if any of the others can sing, I just know them for being funny in improv based shows or routines.  For a host I'd try to get Nic Offerman.  As long as they didn't try to do 20+ episodes a year I think that cast would be able to find time to work together.  


But of course it all would depend on seeing if they have chemistry."
My Fellow Citizens,"Oh, I think the Friends gang would make very good one-shot guests. But I sure wouldnt wanna see them week after week."
My Fellow Citizens,"OH SHIT!   
Wayne Knight!

And Jason Alexander!

AND NATHAN LANE!

But I bet they wont be regulars. they'd probably just do 3 or 4 episodes and thats all.

Christopher Titus might do one episode a season. Maybe."
My Fellow Citizens,[removed]
My Fellow Citizens,Drew was great but I hear he got tired of Ryans nonsense after a while. Aisha is very nice but not especially funny.
My Fellow Citizens,"How are you sure? 

Do you know any?

Why not list some here? which was my original question to begin with."
My Fellow Citizens,I dont think Middleditch is gonna be getting much work
My Fellow Citizens,OH YEAH! Kenan would be awesome. Also I just realized Keegan Micheal Key was on a couple episodes and he's fantastic. He could be a regular if he wanted.
My Fellow Citizens,"Yeah  I was just thinking the Community people minus Chevy Chase would be great. Good man, good lookin out."
My Fellow Citizens,"I like how you think Ryan and Colin are too old, but then suggest people who are in their 60s lol"
My Fellow Citizens,[removed]
My Fellow Citizens,">How are you sure? 

Because there are improv troupes all over the country, and that just seems like a very large pool of promising improvisors to pull from. 

>Do you know any?

No I don't know much about the improv scene"
My Fellow Citizens,I like how you cant read but post anyway.
My Fellow Citizens,"TV was cheaper, they had less time to prep, they pumped out 20+ episodes a year. It was more disposable and less lucrative for the actors. All that means it's going to be viewed as lesser."
My Fellow Citizens,[deleted]
My Fellow Citizens,"I’m not going to read all that, but the primary reason tv work once hindered an actor’s ability to work in movies is that tv requires the actor working specifically on that job for 8-9 months. That’s still the case for regulars in these high budget fantasy shows. It’s kind of hard to get into movies when you’ve got 2-3 months available to shoot and films take anywhere between 2-6 months to shoot on average."
My Fellow Citizens,"I’m not going to read your whole post, because you wrote an essay instead of asking a question, but here you go:

Tom Hanks was a television star, even though the show he had a lead role in only lasted two seasons.

Bruce Willis was a massive television star.

Michael J. Fox was a television star.

There were a bunch of television stars who made the jump to movies because when movies were star driven, the money in movies was much better.

The people who stayed in television had no movie star power, which back then was defined by the ability to get people in the theatre in the first extended weekend.

So the answer is simple, many television stars became movie stars, and did not go back to television because back then, movies paid better."
My Fellow Citizens,"As a rule, the US didn't just treat TV acting as lesser, but the whole medium of television. It's kind of what Newton T. Minow was getting at with *Television and the Public Interest*; he had the belief that television had the *potential* to be brilliant, but that it was rarely exercised in the US, particularly after the death of the television play.

Meanwhile, as mentioned in one of the replies in your original post, in places with less commercial pressure, television could and often was treated with more seriousness and respect. For example, in the UK, the television play format persisted well into the 1980s, with some pretty big names involved such as Ken Loach, Dennis Potter, Nigel Kneale and Noël Coward, but US audiences of the time might have found a formula where they were adapting scripts by Jean-Paul Sartre to be a bit stuffy.

Further afield, other European countries gave a certain amount of credence to highbrow directing on television; Germany had Rainer Werner Fassbinder with *Berlin Alexanderplatz*, Poland had Krzysztof Kieślowski with *Dekalog* and Sweden had Ingmar Bergman with, among others, *Scenes from a Marriage* and *Fanny and Alexander*. As a result, I get the impression that there would have been less of a stigma around transitioning from television acting to the big screen.

I kind of feel that the perspective that *The Sopranos* invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens, but it did have a big enough budget that it was hard to ignore. That said, one could assert that David Lynch was there first from a US perspective, transitioning from an already pretty notable cinematic directorial career into television."
My Fellow Citizens,Times change.
My Fellow Citizens,"The movies traditionally held higher prestige. But around the year 2000 CGI was just getting cheap and easy enough that it could be in any movie. That's why the era of superhero movies began around that time. Once CGI got cheap and easy, we were inevitably going to be given lazy movies about people with superpowers that took the form of CGI. We've always had lazy movies, but ubiquitous CGI shifted the balance. 

So cinema got shallower, lost its prestige, and lost its status as being above television. Television filled the vacuum of substantive storytelling."
My Fellow Citizens,"In the US. When you sign up for a show you sign up for 7 seasons of a show. Because the TV studios own you for this period of time, it can definitely effect the career of a rising star or a movie star would be reluctant to go back to being shackled to a such a long contract.

Michael J Fox is one such example, the producers wanted him but they couldn’t get him because he was contractually obligated to Family Ties. It wasn’t until later they could get him. 

Pierce Bronson was offered Dalton’s James Bond but also couldn’t take the role because he was on Remington Steele at the time.

Even with these limitations there are a plenty of people that went on the great success after being on TV back in the 80s. 

Will Smith is probably the biggest example of someone that got super star fame and awards. 

The difference you are seeing now is that an actor can go to television and back because the contracts of many cable or streaming series doesn’t require the massive 7 year contracts that are required of older network shows."

My Fellow Citizens,I love when I come across Robert Redford or Clint Eastwood in their early days.  Redford was the best Angel of Death Ever (Twilight Zone).
My Fellow Citizens,"> I kind of feel that the perspective that The Sopranos invented quality television comes with a certain amount of cultural myopia when other countries were straight-up putting art cinema in a television form onto their screens

100%. It irks me every time I hear it."
My Fellow Citizens,"I'd like to think that after the series finale James and Miles travelled from small town to small town hunting ghosts, conning cons, and buddy-copping their way to success.

Call it ""Bonjour LaFleur""."
My Fellow Citizens,"I'll see you in another life, brothah."
My Fellow Citizens,"Damn. I would have watched that in a heartbeat. Miles and Sawyer were some of my favorite characters in the show. 

And Leung is so underrated as an actor."
My Fellow Citizens,His character’s argument with Hurley about time travel was my favourite part of the whole series.
My Fellow Citizens,"I would have watched the shit out of that. 


Still would"
My Fellow Citizens,"I’m honestly a little shocked that they left that franchise alone. No spin-offs, no prequels, no sequels. Just one classic series standing on its own."
My Fellow Citizens,"It amazes me that even to this day, every LOST thread will have people claiming ""they were dead and in purgatory"" the whole time. Not only do people say this, but they say it with such confidence.

It's not even like it's a matter of whether or not you understand the ending. This idea was directly refuted with a line of dialogue in the finale...in the most important scene! I guess these people just weren't paying attention...to the most important scene of the finale?!?!?!

Seriously, WTF people?"
My Fellow Citizens,This reminds me of the comedy drama about two retired spies/assassins that we almost got starring Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson. Still wish that could've been a thing
My Fellow Citizens,Always remember him from Rush Hour
My Fellow Citizens,"Horseshit, but I would have watched the crap out of that show.

And he's right about the Asian stereotyping.

Unfortunately, he'll have to wait until the boomers start dying for the Calgon horseshit to truly end.

The boys had a pretty good joke about it. 

""Soldier Boy: Where's the Chop Socky Oriental sauce?   
  
Hughie: They don't have that anymore  
  
Soldier Boy: Why the fuck not?   
  
Hughie: Uh, many... many good reasons""

It was just casual and accepted, ""haha, hollywood is racist!""

The Hawaii 5-0 shit was jaw dropping. Treating them like half a person. As if stupid vampire show man and nepotism hire were actually worth more than the two people who carried the show.   


Poor Grace Park had to sell bing like her life depended on it."
My Fellow Citizens,Wonder how this show holds up on a rewatch. Blew me away when it aired.
My Fellow Citizens,Why are his characters always pissed off?
My Fellow Citizens,###Maybe include Sayid.
My Fellow Citizens,LOST SEQUEL WHEN!? Come on D+ give us what we want!
My Fellow Citizens,That would have been awesome.
My Fellow Citizens,Love a good lost moment brotha
My Fellow Citizens,I haven't watched this show in 10 years and have a really bad memory. Can someone remind me what connection their 2 characters had?
My Fellow Citizens,"It's probably not as impactful now, with so much foreign TV at our fingertips on streaming.  But back in 2004 it was pretty wild to have a main character on an major American TV show who didn't speak any English."
My Fellow Citizens,"I am re-watching the Mission Impossible franchise, and when I got to Ghost Protocol, I'd totally forgotten that the film opens up with Josh Holloway as an IMF agent that gets killed. It made me want to see more of that character and of Josh Holloway in good roles.

Also, I really enjoyed Ken Leung in Person of Interest."
My Fellow Citizens,"Nobody can replicate true detective 

Not even true detective"
My Fellow Citizens,"In the book Under The Dome Stephen King writes about the characters watching a l
LOST spin-off called The Hunted Ones. I wonder if he had an inside scoop on this project before it was canceled."
My Fellow Citizens,Would love. That guy was so entertaining in the sopranos
My Fellow Citizens,They should have made it even if it wasnt connected to lost
My Fellow Citizens,That would have been awesome. Dudes a great actor who deserves more chances.
My Fellow Citizens,Just make a true detective season 3 name them sawyer and miles and just never acknowledge it.
My Fellow Citizens,Been awhile since I've seen such a toxic comment section.  Do people really feel the need to hurl personal insults and belittle people they don't even know?  Are people really so insecure that someone not liking a TV show they like is an excuse to be so bitter?
My Fellow Citizens,"My wife and I are about to finish a rewatch of the series and when that episode of Sawyer and Miles came on I made a crack similar to this article. While a spin off wouldn’t work, I think a show with those two would of been interesting to watch. Ken and Josh have good chemistry and it fit very well in police drama setting.

Along with those two I would of loved to see Terry O’Quinn (Locke) and Michael Emerson (Ben) in another show together. They also had amazing chemistry and seemed to bring the best out of each other on screen."
My Fellow Citizens,I would've watched it. Miles had one of the best storylines for being a secondary character.
My Fellow Citizens,"His character is probably one of my favorite lowkey LOST characters.  He never really seems to break into the main LOST stars, but he's got such a full character history and it's interesting with his ties to Dharma and the island and the superpower he has.

He's also pretty unique as a character because you usually have characters that are smartasses (like Sawyer) or comic relief (like Hurley) or serious/tragic (like a lot of them), and his character is impossible to pin down as a particular thing.  He's likeable and good but also unlikeable and bad at the same time.  It makes him one of the more realistic characters on the show too (despite talking to the dead)."
My Fellow Citizens,I can't imagine Damon Lindelof involved with a series that actually *solves* mysteries
My Fellow Citizens,We dodged a bullet there.
My Fellow Citizens,"As much as I enjoyed their characters, S6 left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. I still refuse to watch anything by Lideloff/Cuse, even though I've had people recommend The Leftovers to me."
My Fellow Citizens,"yeah I remember when the idea was first floated, most of us hardcore fans absolutely loved the idea 

...of course by the end of the show, you couldn't pay me to watch a _Lost_ spinoff so... probably worked out for the best, really"
My Fellow Citizens,"Any ending would of been better than what they did. 

Edit: dislike all you like but the end of lost was hot garbage. First 4 seasons were good before time traveling nonsense."
My Fellow Citizens,Lost was the biggest waste of my life I can think of. Besides alcoholism. Yes I’ve binge watched shows since then. But I used to have to be in front of the TV when lost was on so I wasted many hours just being prepared for it to start. Then when the show went downhill I was too invested in it to stop watching.
My Fellow Citizens,Ken Leung has never given off “co-lead” vibes in anything he’s ever done.
My Fellow Citizens,*Straume Sawyer*.
My Fellow Citizens,"List was great would of loved to see a spin off!, have to admit ending was a tad confusing in my opinion."
My Fellow Citizens,...I don't remember the guy on the bottom left. :|
My Fellow Citizens,He is so fricken good as Eric in Industry
My Fellow Citizens,Didn’t he beat up Jr Soprano?
My Fellow Citizens,"I thought they were supposed to do an adaptation of Chew.

I wanna see Ken solve crimes with food based psychic powers."
My Fellow Citizens,I would have watched the hell out of that.
My Fellow Citizens,"I mean there’s no stopping that happening now, is there??"
My Fellow Citizens,I would totally watch that. The dude paid his dues a long time ago and needs that big break
My Fellow Citizens,NO PROBLEM JUST RUSH HOUR
My Fellow Citizens,Not too late!
My Fellow Citizens,I would have loved that!
My Fellow Citizens,"Ken is great on Industry in a role that normally wouldn't go to an Asian American. Can't believe it's the same guy from X-Men!

I always thought Josh Holloway would have been a bigger star. He was the good-looking breakout from that show and had a promising role in a Mission: Impossible movie but nothing big ever really came of it."
My Fellow Citizens,I like his little stint in Sopranos.
My Fellow Citizens,"Daniel Dae Kim was the best part of Hawaii 5-0. Although most of the scenes with McGarrett and Williams arguing were funny.

Industry is a hard show to like. It's not like Succession where the business aspect is accessible to laymen. So it's hard to care about these people's lives when you really don't know if they're doing good or not.

it is watchable though. it's bingable and not that deep.

I don't see it going more than a couple more seasons though."
My Fellow Citizens,That is almost interesting
My Fellow Citizens,Shit. I forgot Eric was on lost too. I only remembered him from sopranos and rush hour 2.
My Fellow Citizens,I’m still confused about what happened in Lost - but I’d kinda lost interest towards the end
My Fellow Citizens,"yeah man it would have been EXACTLY like true detective, you know that show?"
My Fellow Citizens,The therapist in squid and the whale?
My Fellow Citizens,"We could have had a Sawyer/Miles as a private detectives(?) spinoff of Lost.

Okay, now I'm a little pissed. ;)"
My Fellow Citizens,"Why? so we could follow them for 5 seasons chasing smoke? Please… lost just like everything JJ abrams touches goes nowhere. It’s like starting a journey thinking you are going somewhere wondrous only to end up at a smelly swamp with a broken leg, a missing eye, leeches on your back and neck deep into a rotting mire."
My Fellow Citizens,How did they almost make a spinoff of a show that didn't have a plot?
My Fellow Citizens,"Not sure how this would work, especially if it didn’t have the blessing of Damon Lindelof. They didn’t write what happened after the Ajira plane “made it to safety” for a reason. The only events we know after the finale is the Ben/Hurley DVD extra. Infact I don’t even know if they confirm in that if the plane made it back, maybe it crashed and they all died? Hurley and Ben made their way off the island a different way right? 

If Josh/Miles got a show, fans would just be clamouring for Lost easter eggs and disappointed there was no further lore or cameos happening."
My Fellow Citizens,"After the horrible ending, it’s best that all things related to the show just fizzled away."
My Fellow Citizens,This was a show that went on for way too long to milk as much money as possible.  By the end I was just watching just to see how it ends.  Only to be disappointed that all the fans guessed it back in the first season.  Before Game of Thrones this might of been the most hated ending to a strong start series ever.
My Fellow Citizens,Spin-off?  All the characters were dead at the finale reveal.  Do they call it Sixth Sense the Series?
My Fellow Citizens,The show was boring as f
My Fellow Citizens,"Man, because of how badly it ended I guess, I forget how stupid good the cast was on that show."
My Fellow Citizens,"> Call it ""Bonjour LaFleur"".

On a somewhat related note: The LOST episode called [""LaFleur""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8kAfmI4HVk&t=17s) was my favorite episode of the entire series."

My Fellow Citizens,I liked him in Industry
Lovely Horribly,"It's pretty funny, but it doesn't feel like a Mel Brooks show, mainly because it doesn't really involve Mel Brooks or his usual repertoire of supporting cast members (just about all of whom are dead nowadays)."
Lovely Horribly,"I'm half way through the series. It had some good parts that made me laugh, particularly Lincoln and Grant. To be honest, I feel like I'm watching the senior class film project made by the students in Mel Brooks' class...and this is from someone who is a devout follower of Brooks, (Hail President Skroob). It could be better, but it could also be a lot worse.

By the way, if there are any fans who haven't read it, I highly recommend his autobiography ""All About Me"". It has some cool insights into how Brooks developed his career and neat tidbits from behind the scenes."
Lovely Horribly,"Yeah it's not very good though.

The Krol-as-Larry-David bits were fun.  Always bet on JB Smoove"
Lovely Horribly,"It definitely could have been better.

But the thing that gets me the most is that in the recurring Civil War bit, they have West Virginia being Confederate as a major plot point.

But the only reason West Virginia even exists separately from Virginia is that *West Virginia did not leave the union*. WV broke off from VA specifically because WV didn't want to be part of the Confederacy.

There's bending history for the sake of a joke, and I expect a lot of that in the show. But there wasn't even a joke to it - they could have just as easily said ""North Carolina"" or ~~""Kentucky""~~ ""Tennessee"" instead of ""West Virginia"" and changed almost nothing else about the whole thing.

Edit: Kentucky was Union, too. D'oh."
Lovely Horribly,"Overall I've been really enjoying it. Some skits hit way better than others. The Civil War and Judas skits have been great. The whole Jesus saga going on over multiple episodes was great, especially how they wrapped it up.

It was stupid as fuck but I absolutely loved the Statue commercials.  Russian stuff was also pretty good as well.

They got some really good comedians for this show and it was nice seeing a good amount of Mad TV alum showing at different spots and one of the main dudes being from that show."
Lovely Horribly,"In regards to the whole thing as hit or miss, I pretty much agree, but I feel that way about part one as well. The thing is, where part one had hit/miss ratio of joke styles in longer segments, this has commitment to largely single tone jokes in short segments. That being said, the mixture of slapstick, gross-out, word play, lampoonery, delivery, and satire has the tone of the original, and I laughed more than I do at most new comedy attempts. 

It has the heavy hand of Nick Kroll, who himself is hit or miss, but he is successfully restrained enough in this to be successful. I would’ve like Mel Brooks in a cameo at some point more than voice, but he’s 96…that’s a big ask."
Lovely Horribly,"I think I fall into the specific intersection of people who enjoyed Mel Brooks movies, but mostly don’t enjoy SNL. And unfortunately, that makes the show not for me.

I wouldn’t say it’s badly made, just that it didn’t work for me. Maybe my sense of humour has changed over the years or it’s some kind of nostalgia filter, I’m not sure. I’d be curious if others feel the same."
Lovely Horribly,About halfway through and my favorite part by far so far is Jack Black and the Someday musical bits.
Lovely Horribly,I found the first few episodes to be the best.  After that it just got drawn out and the comedy went missing.  I haven't watched the last two episodes and not sure when I will.
Lovely Horribly,"It’s pretty hit and miss but I also found the original movie to be hit and miss so that sorta fits

The recurring Masshole yelling about sports was my favorite little bit"
Lovely Horribly,"The reaction to this episode only shows how little people actually know about West Virginia. Eastern and southern WV were dangerous places for Unionists, in 1865 WV Confederates crossed over into Cumberland, MD, and kidnapped 2 Union generals and took them to Richmond as prisoners. The state had half of its counties vote to secede from the US in 1861 along with the rest of Virginia. HOTW2 was not incorrect.

[Historical Marker Database](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=81416)"
Lovely Horribly,"I enjoyed it more than most current comedies. Not in a “back in my day” way, but the same way I liked Spaceballs more than most 1987-ish comedies. Brooks’ movies have been going downhill since the 80s but I think this was way better than Dracula Dead and Loving It and at least as good as Robin Hood Men in Tights. It’s clear from interviews that Sykes wanted to do Chisholm for a long time, Kroll wanted to the Russian Revolution story for a while, and Barinholtz was really into the Grant story, so those weren’t going to be cut out. But it still had plenty of funny stuff. JB Smoove was great as always and Jack Black was a fun twist on Stalin. It’s not a classic but I liked it for what it is: a miniseries on Hulu. They say they have plenty of ideas for a second season, and I think that now that Sykes, Kroll, and Barinholtz got the stories they loved most out of their system, a second season would be a lot stronger.

And yes, West Virginia not being a Union state drive me nuts too. But as a few have pointed out here there were plenty of Confederates in WV at the time so I’m downgrading myself from driven crazy to fine whatever."
Lovely Horribly,I don't think they had enough jokes about historical figures being on social media.
Lovely Horribly,"With the pedigree of the original, and the insane talent pool they put together for this, the first part was exceptionally disappointing.  Each sketch was worst than the last."
Lovely Horribly,I enjoyed it overall. Not the greatest thing in the world but  overall more hits than misses for me.
Lovely Horribly,I think it's just missing the original cast. They just don't have anyone that's very funny. Just imagine Gene Wilder and Madeline Kahn and Harvey Korman playing these characters and it would be well worth da money for Hulu.......(du Monaaaaaay!)
Lovely Horribly,I’ve been enjoying it!
Lovely Horribly,"I love it so much, so funny. My favorite is the civil war stuff (I LOVE Ike Barinholtz), all of the Judas and Jesus stuff, and the Russian stuff. The rest was slightly less good to me but still watchable, and Shirley I think just being way too long"
Lovely Horribly,"It just feels cheap like drunk history the movie and hey thats what they should have done and i would be fine. However you drag out brooks and use the name and whats on screen even though funny, it feels sad. This is where comedy is, unless its an action movie, comedies are made on shoe string budgets for streaming and its depressing."
Lovely Horribly,Some skits went on longer than it should've.  I found the shorter ones alot more funnier.
Lovely Horribly,"The Civil War and Shirley sections were either boring or one note, with few laughs. The Curb parody was great and the Russian Revolution stuff was hit-or-miss.

Overall, I thought it was pretty bad, and will not recommend it."
Lovely Horribly,"Btw, if they would have done any research at all into the council of Nicea, they would have included Santa Claus punching a bishop in the face. Missed opportunity in my opinion."
Lovely Horribly,"Love the movie, love Mel brooks, this show was painfully unfunny"
Lovely Horribly,"Not a single thing about this was funny... i doubt Mel had anything to do with other than agreeing to be in it.  

They even put Hitler on Ice and they couldnt even roll with the jokes.  All it was commentary shittinf on Hitler rather than Hitler acrually being stupid.... just bad writing.  Only good part of that 1st episode was the jackass bit and that was just cause it was Jackass."
Lovely Horribly,"Personally didn't enjoy it. I'm a big fan of Brooks, and I watched the whole series to give it a chance, but only episode 2 made me laugh. Most of the jokes felt tame and dated to me. Reminded me more of modern SNL than of Mel Brooks."
Lovely Horribly,"I don't get why people find this funny. Every sketch might have been based on Mel Brooks's outline, but it's pretty evident, they were then scripted by unfunny comedians like Seth Rogan.

Every joke seems to fall into one of two categories:

1) anachronism (e.g. Princess Anatasia being an influencer)
2) ""fuck white men""

I don't think either of these is funny. While anachronism has always been part of Mel Brook's school of comedy, at least in the movie was clever, here everything feels like a first draft.

""fuck white men""-series is a new addition to Mel Brook's category, though their addition after *Velma* and *Santa Inc.* is hardly surprising.

Ultimately I'm disappointed by this. Mel Brook's had a very unique sense of humor; it was grouchy and he wasn't afraid to make fun of everybody. Meanwhile, draws a clear line between those who can be made fun of and those who are off-limits."
Lovely Horribly,Drunk History did it better.
Lovely Horribly,"It’s ok. I’m a huge fan of Brooks’ work pre-MIT, and this is falling somewhere in between that and Dracula for me. Which means I won’t go out of my way to ever watch it again."
Lovely Horribly,Feels more like one of Nick Kroll's sophomoric humor than Mel Brooks to me. I don't feel like Mel Brooks would have ever had someone fuck a phone.
Lovely Horribly,"I enjoyed most of it. But my God these Shirley bits make it unlikely I'll re-watch it.

I wasn't expecting a classic Brooks film.  It was a lot better than I expected especially for a modern comedy."
Lovely Horribly,"Great for history nerds. Not for dumb folks (like me). Still pretty entertaining to watch though, the cast was amazing and the only reason I kept watching."
Lovely Horribly,"I didn't get far into the first episode. I liked Kroll show and the people involved in this, but it just wasn't funny."
Lovely Horribly,I can see that but I feel like the vibe is there. The town of “Shi etl” or whatever it was named had people selling Serf Boards and that felt very Mel Brooks to me.
Lovely Horribly,"There's a lot of Mel Brooks style jokes and definitely his refusal to pull punches.

The cast is the cast and I think they got great performances from everyone.

The piece I don't get is shirley it seemed like it lacked everything that he was known for.  It feels like they didn't even try."
Lovely Horribly,Those were my favorite. Should have been more spoofing.
Lovely Horribly,"I feel like there could have even been humor found in the idea that West Virginia broke away to remain with the Union but as a condition of it staying with the Union it wanted to be able to retain slavery in the immediate future. And/or in the idea that most of the West Virginians who enlisted in the Civil War did so for the Confederacy despite the state itself sticking with the Union.

But I guess they just decided to be lazy. I should say I haven’t actually watch it because well it looked like a big piece of crap just as most of these reboots/sequels made decades later than they should have been tend to be."
Lovely Horribly,Kentucky would've made a lot more sense. Because of Bourbon.
Lovely Horribly,"Kentucky was also part of the Union, though."
Lovely Horribly,"I had to Google ""history of the world part 2 west virginia"" to make sure I wasn't the only one bothered by this, and the second result was this thread. Thank you Reddit for making me feel less alone in yelling at my TV."
Lovely Horribly,Yeah that bothered me a lot too.
Lovely Horribly,It's actually really bothering me lol I'm watching it right now and I'm here specifically because I wanted to see if anyone was talking about this
Lovely Horribly,"As a west Virginian i was really excited about the set up. Cause the history of like, moonshine running and that sort of thing would have been rad to explore. The scrappy nature, the fighting cops and that sort of thing. But no. They painted us a ignorant rednecks. It's kinda a piss off tbh"
Lovely Horribly,Funny my girl said she didn’t want to watch this because “they’ll just make fun of history and get everything wrong and it’ll piss me off” and welp. That would def piss her off.
Lovely Horribly,Maybe THAT’S the joke.
Lovely Horribly,I was bothered by this as well!
Lovely Horribly,"I'm about halfway through, but it could have been better.

To be fair, I don't think this is Mel Brooks at all, it feels way more like its just Kroll Show with Ike Barinholtz co-starring. Thats fine, but 'fine' is about as high rating as it deserves."
Lovely Horribly,That’s fair. It’s not going to be for everyone especially if you don’t like the format.
Lovely Horribly,"In Part I, man evolves 20 million years ago and the first Homo sapien marriage takes place in 1 million B.C.

It’s not trying to be accurate. That’s part of the joke."
Lovely Horribly,Yeah those were easily my least favorite parts. The rest of the show was a little hit or miss but I mostly liked it. But Princess Anastasia on Instagram Live or Galileo on TikTok was just awful. It started to be a mini commercial break where I'd pay attention to literally anything else for a little bit.
Lovely Horribly,"Agreed. Episode 3 was okay, but the endless tropes during the russian revolution sketches were just, ugh."
Lovely Horribly,I didn’t feel that way but I’m also a big fan. It’s really fun to see Part 2 actually exist so I’m enjoying it all.
Lovely Horribly,tbf Part 1 also ran the French Revolution and Rome segments way too long so if you look at it that way it's a great sequel.
Lovely Horribly,Co-signed on all of this. It was also very 'look at us!' aware which killed the humor.
Lovely Horribly,"I was excited to see so many The State alum involved, but I agree I thought they could've done more with the premise."
Lovely Horribly,This. It’s like they wanted to be in on a joke they didn’t understand.
Lovely Horribly,"Dude where are you even getting that second point from? The ""anachronistic social media"" stuff blows I agree. But I'm really not seeing anything you could even really construe as saying ""fuck white men"" the only example is maybe if you don't know who George Wallace is, but I can assure you, if you look him up, they went easy on him, casting George Wallace the comedian as him was very funny, but I would've gone with a talking pile of turds á la Pizza the Hutt."
Lovely Horribly,"To be fair, at least half of the humor in Blazing Saddles is “fuck white men”. That isn’t really new. And HotW part 1 was full of anachronisms like the Roman unemployment office the slot machine torture device in the Inquisition. But agreed that the show had some weaknesses."
Lovely Horribly,"This show makes fun of everyone, including some historical figures who happened to be white men."
Lovely Horribly,"I'm not saying it's worth ""suffering through"" but I thought the 6th episode was really funny. The first 5 were hit or miss with some jokes ***really*** not landing, but the 6th one was mostly good and you could probably skip through to that without missing much."
Lovely Horribly,"Ah, dammit. Knew I should have checked that first."
Lovely Horribly,"It would be funny concept of Southern pride wave the Confederate flag even though they're forgetting their a union state

Lovely Horribly,"come on, everyone who watched this are big fans.  The movie was great because they had a time limit so they didn't waste it and cram as much comedy as they could.  

But they ran skits into the ground in this show.  How can you do a couple of Jesus skits, that just got less funnier each time and then do a completely different one shot Jesus that killed.  AND then called back to end the show with."
Lovely Horribly,"Yeah, there was so much talent involved but so little effort put into it."
Lovely Horribly,"I have only seen a few scenes from Blazing Saddles, but those didn't make fun of white men as much as they made fun of Ku Klux Klan."
Lovely Horribly,"Thanks, I will skip to that."
Lovely Horribly,the russian revolution ones just got worse and worse and lasted forever
Lovely Horribly,"The whole town of Rock Ridge being racist (including against the Irish) was satirizing how bad white people were. There’s tons of racial humor throughout. Mel Brooks’ governor is racist, Madeline Khan is like “all Black men are well hung” type racist, the white bosses trying to get the Black workers to sing work songs and then the bosses singing “Black” and the workers singing “white”….lots of jokes about racism, usually to the (deserved) detriment of white people. Funny trivia: Richard Pryor worked on the script with them. He gave the approval on if a joke went too far or not, but only wanted to write jokes for Mungo haha."
Lovely Horribly,"That sounds like it makes fun of racism in general, which is fine."
Lovely Horribly,"Those are all on HBO, which has a reputation for being pretty dark."
Lovely Horribly,The only one of those I've seen is last of us.  Maybe it is just the majority of what you choose to consume.
Lovely Horribly,"i think creatively, everyone is coming out of COVID, so everyone's material is dark.

the only uplifting show i'm currently watching (besides the recommended Ted Lasso) is Abbott Elementary.

Schmigadoon is coming out soon too, but that's very niche, idk if broadway is your thing.

I also like the company you keep. it has a very ""catch me if you can""/guy ritchie vibe!"

I'm not joking."
Lovely Horribly,"I used to think people would watch depressing shows and then feel depressed. If they just watched happy shows they would be ok.

Then I realised that some people at least are looking for something in the world that echoes how they are feeling inside because they can't express it themselves and need to feel seen or understood. By watching those shows they can express it and hopefully get that feeling out a little bit.

Zombies etc often represent fear of death in popular media.. the feeling of lonliness in the show seems to reflect the lonliness of our modern society and a fear of being alone."

Lovely Horribly,I noticed that a lot of the shows that have gained notoriety have been darker recently.
Lovely Horribly,Good thing Ted Lasso is about to come back.
Lovely Horribly,"There has definitely been a turn toward dark settings and dark characters the past decade or so in popular shows. Zombie and post apocalypse fiction is still going strong as ever despite just retreading the same ground.

The audience also seems really receptive to ""cold bad ass"" characters that are basically just violent sociopaths. I was watching Foundation and fans hated a scared teenager whose ""grandfather"" calls an abomination, too wimpy! Same with House Of The Dragon, fans respond to ""stone cold"" characters.

I realized if Breaking Bad came out today Walt and Jessie would probably be too wimpy for most audiences."
Lovely Horribly,"Unfortunately that is the trend but I'd try out The Bear.  That wasn't  depressing and has a hopeful vibe throughout .  Perry mason just came back and while it has some dark aspect, I'd say it's pretty positive overall in that perry fights against corrupt power structures and defends the innocent, which is refreshing nowadays"
Lovely Horribly,"I've not watched Wednesday but, I assume, it wasn't morbidly depressing and dark and that was one of the most watched shows in the world recently.

In other words it's just you dude. You can choose to watch popular shows that aren't dark and depressing."

Lovely Horribly,"Don't fall into reddit's ""prestige TV"" trap. It's perfectly fine to watch something lame that makes you feel happy.

If you want a drama that isn't super serious *You* is actually pretty great. It gets weird sometimes but it doesn't give you that feeling in the pit of your stomach.

For something much lighter *Business Proposal* (Kdrama) is a delight.

*Marvelous Mrs. Maisel* is a high quality show without being too dark.

If you're looking for prestige TV that isn't dark, *Mad Men* is fantastic.

There's also *Downton Abbey* which has drama but is ultimately a feel-good show.

I'm with you though, I don't have much time for TV, I won't watch shows that make me feel bad. I could watch White Lotus, Succession, or House of Dragons for that reason."

What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story.

Angels Last Mission: Love,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation.

Angels Last Mission: Love,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."

Angels Last Mission: Love,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
Angels Last Mission: Love,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"

Angels Last Mission: Love,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too.

Angels Last Mission: Love,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
Angels Last Mission: Love,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
Angels Last Mission: Love,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
Angels Last Mission: Love,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
Angels Last Mission: Love,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
Angels Last Mission: Love,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's mire pretentious than anyobe else deeply connected to a story would be."
Angels Last Mission: Love,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
Angels Last Mission: Love,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
Angels Last Mission: Love,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
Angels Last Mission: Love,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
Angels Last Mission: Love,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
Angels Last Mission: Love,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
Angels Last Mission: Love,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"> But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
Angels Last Mission: Love,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
Angels Last Mission: Love,It’s more than just the bloodline of the ff it’s all bloodlines potentially
Angels Last Mission: Love,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
Angels Last Mission: Love,Retcon
Angels Last Mission: Love,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"

Angels Last Mission: Love,"No one’s acting like it’s black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that’s being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have “literally” saved humanity because he couldn’t handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren’t conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It’s not black and white but he’s absolutely “narrative term here” the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It’s not at all ambiguous, it’s a moral debate. I don’t think you understand the term ambiguous."
Angels Last Mission: Love,Glad you enjoyed it. Guess I just have a different perspective working in the film industry with these types. Wish we had heard more from the other co-creator who actually made the game.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
Angels Last Mission: Love,Why the downvotes?
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
Angels Last Mission: Love,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
Angels Last Mission: Love,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
Angels Last Mission: Love,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
Angels Last Mission: Love,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."
Angels Last Mission: Love,"People think crossing an arbitrary border to save your child's life is evil, why the surprise here?"
Angels Last Mission: Love,That's not his child!
Over Water,My wife's water broke during bingo at a local club. That was in 2001 and she hasn't been brave enough to go back there in case someone recognizes her.
Over Water,My mom’s water broke in a Harvey’s restaurant during a 6 year old’s birthday party. I feel for whoever had to mop the place that day.
Over Water,Yes it does happen 100%. I was standing in line right next to some lady who was very pregnant… I thought a water bottle spilled on the floor and some on my leg. No sir. Her water broke.
Over Water,How old are you?
Over Water,"My mum's broke in a pharmacy - she was then in labour for about 4hrs so the ""this baby is coming NOW"" notion is a bit hyperbolic for most, but I believe they had a job mopping up the aisle she was in....whilst she was finishing up her shopping in there waiting for my dad to come get her."
Over Water,Wait until you learn about sneezing.
Over Water,yes....
Over Water,"Would love for you to tell that to a woman 9 months pregnant. Ya know, how gross it would be if she went into labor somewhere near you. Yea- please say that to a pregnant woman."
Over Water,"Have a buddy that owns an auto repair shop, remember him telling me a story that shortly after he baught the place and struck out on his own rather than being a dealership mechanic, he had a pregnant lady who brought her car in for repairs,  and her water broke in the shop's waiting room. He didn't really have any employees yet at that point so he wound up having to clean it up."
Over Water,[deleted]
Over Water,A taxi driver once told me a passenger's water had broken in his cab while he was stuck in traffic. I'd have enjoyed the story more if I wasn't now sitting in the same seat only a few days later.
Over Water,That's a bingo!

Over Water,"I would say it because it is gross. It's one of the nastiest things. Every type of body fluid, just everywhere. Fucking nasty."
Over Water,Wow!
Over Water,[deleted]
Over Water,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Over Water,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Over Water,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Over Water,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Over Water,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
Over Water,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Over Water,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Over Water,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Over Water,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Over Water,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Over Water,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Over Water,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Over Water,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Over Water,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Over Water,🙂💕
Over Water,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Over Water,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Over Water,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Over Water,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Over Water,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Over Water,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Over Water,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Over Water,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Over Water,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Over Water,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Over Water,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Over Water,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Over Water,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Over Water,"I like hyping Black Summer. The first season was just s series of action vignettes which was kind of nice as an antidote to the grim plodding nonsense of the Walking Dead.

 But even enjoying s1 I didn't think it was sustainable but you're right S2 was more ambitious with the way the story was structured. While they kept their vignette format the coming together of the separate storylines did allow the characters to build in a way that made me care more for them, in particular the mother and daughter. 

I wouldn't call it HBO calibre but the central cast are pretty good and I do hope they have plans for an s3. Unfortunately not a lot of people I know watched it so I am not betting on it."
Over Water,S2 was incredible. But I have zero faith Netflix will do S3.
Over Water,"Glad to see some love for it here. It wasn't that popular but I honestly think it had some of the coolest most intense action scenes of any Netflix series. If you like the infamous hallway scenes from Daredevil and Punisher. The first season is like, entirely a ""hallway scene"" lol."
Over Water,Yeah season 2 was really good so dont expect a season 3. Just netflix doing netflix shit.
Over Water,"Poll time: was Spears’ buddy from the old world actually there in real life or was he some kind of mental guilt/death manifestation in Spears’ mind? As far as I remember we never see him interact with anyone else or do anything that Spears couldn’t have done if he was alone. Either way it’s a great episode, just wondering what others think."
Over Water,The long takes are soo impressive. These actors cardio is next level.
Over Water,How much does it matter to have seen S1 if I just want to watch S2?
Over Water,Why can’t the zombies see through windows? People just close the door on a zombie and then walk in front of a bay window at night with candles and a fireplace going. Why don’t the zombies just don’t smash through?
Over Water,"I watched it straight through without stopping what a ride.  They paced the show perfectly.  It didn't drag in the middle episodes at all and really went deep in the slower moments not feeling contrived at all.

All the characters were quite interesting and I love how the show makes you think about each of them and what their backgrounds could have been.

I have faith we will see Season 3 news soon.  Netflix supports a lot of foreign content moreso now as those are their markets in this point in time.  Black Summer will get views I think to continue.

Season 3 I think Anna drives Rose and Ray Nazeri back to the ski lodge; interesting character development there how things ended in S2.  I think Mance will arrive there too.  The leader of the group that captured Ray was locked in the warehouse with the zombies I presume dead but maybe not if climbed in a plane or on top of something.  There will be conflict and resolution to whatever the source of the problems were at the beginning of S2.

Sun meanwhile will arrive somewhere.  Rose and Anna will make contact aboarding a plane meeting Sun at the compound.  Think Day of the Dead for 3rd season inspiration and citing the origin of the outbreak.  This will wrap things up pre-Z-Nation."
Over Water,"I appreciate a good action scene, and I really appreciate the way these were shot, especially for how over the top they were. They were insane and ridiculous but I never felt lost, you get to follow the scenes all the way through. I thought season two struck a great balance between the action and story. I would have loved a third season. Something to complete the series for a change of pace.

The Walking Dead had the worst action scenes, they were so lazy. Just a bunch of disconnected shots of people firing at someone off-screen, then cut to the next character, repeat, no one gets hit. You rarely have a clear idea of where people are or where they are being shot from."
Over Water,"Yeah, I doubt it’ll see a season 3… but then again I said this after season 1."
Over Water,Same. My only point is the drastic improvement over the course of 2 seasons.
Over Water,I thought Rose was such a refreshing main character. So many protags like Rick Grimes make so many weird decisions to amp up drama but if Rose doesn’t like your vibe she will shoot you in the fucking head. Felt very realistic for a bloodthirsty mama bear in the apocalypse.
Over Water,I wonder this too. I’m banking on he was a hallucination brought on by the side effects of being close to death
Over Water,"I mean, u can watch season 2 without finishing one but IMO it would be far less rewarding. Season 1 ISNT BAD… it just isn’t great. And I think season 2 is great. Watching season one first, though, definitely escalates it."
Over Water,"You don't need to see season 1 first.  

I think Season 2 stands on it's own.  

You can tell who survives Season 1 and see how characters have changed is the only reason for 1st season but really might be more.rewarding just begin with Season 2 and go backwards I think."
Over Water,People close doors in this show? I nearly fell of out my seat when they used their guns to shoot a zombie point blank
Over Water,"City doors vs. Country Doors.  

The zombie in the 1st episode smashed through doors and glass but the guy who killed after stopped to help had it coming.  I think the Zombies sense someone's Karmic energy.

They did break the metal doors in the hangar too."
Over Water,Again good point. I never felt spatially lost with any of the action scenes. Good choreography
Over Water,Fuck TWD
Over Water,"I’ve also been rewatching TWD lately and after watching Black Summer the action feels like a joke lol. I loved the decision in Black Summer to make the zombies reanimate in seconds, makes those wild gunfights so tense when you immediately start hearing the growls and shit gets out of control so fast. I also liked the choice to have pretty much no music at all in the action scenes, made it so eerie and haunting.

Not to completely diss the Walking Dead, the acting is pretty good on average and the characters are engaging. For awhile, that is."
Over Water,"It had no buzz at all, the subreddit ist practically dead and production is probably very expensive but I still have hope. Usually Netflix clearly announces it very early on if they cancel a show, but there wasn't an announcement since the s2 release, so technically it's not dead!"
Over Water,"Rose didn’t feel like an actress. Rose felt like this was all reality. I love Rose, such a believable performance. I’d rather the first season a 6/10. Second season, though, 10/10 no question."
Over Water,"First his name isn't Spears I don't think?  That was a lie he gave at the beginning with the guy claiming he knew him?

I think he made the fire earlier and was tackled by the zombie so was real but also a repressed memory to make amends with.  He might have gotten infected in the woods and knew it was time to depart or maybe just worried about it and will be back in Season 3.  Bygones was the lesson he gave as he rode off is how I choose to interpret it unless the show says otherwise."
Over Water,They take their time between each season treating it as an anthology as we didn't start season 2 at the stadium which is what I remember.  You just fill in that the mission was to get to a private airfield multiple groups vying to do so.
Over Water,"90s jokes everywhere would be awful. That 70s Show seemed to be about people that happened to take place in the 70s. It sounds like you want That 80s Show, which to me was just one 80s joke after another that happened to have a cast."
Over Water,"The more I think about it, the more this shows sucks. It completely relies on nostalgia to work. If this show had to stand on it's own and That 70's show never existed. This would be a massive flop. And as far as the new characters go, Gwen is the only one I like. Ozzie is a massive jerk. Why would anyone be friends with him? The acting also isn't very good in general. And what's with Leia forcing herself on boys at the mall?? Let's reverse genders a bit and have a boy do that and everyone will be shouting rape. I was a teenager in the 90's and i cannot identify with these people. I watched some of the best bits of the 70's show again on Youtube after this and that show was just leagues ahead. Kelso's pocket exploding still has me in stitches. The 90's show is a pale imitation that should not have seen the light of day."
Over Water,"All I have to say is that I really enjoyed that 70s show, and as someone who was a teen in the 90s, this just doesn’t feel at all like what I experienced. The 90s references are forced and the style is way off. Also, the jokes aren’t very good and are killed by the constant laugh track. My husband and i turned it off after the second episode to find something better to watch."
Over Water,"I don’t think you understand what they were going for with Leia. 

The whole plot about Leia trying to get a kiss was not out of some lustful nature but because she felt behind compared to her friends, especially in comparison to the guy she was interested in. So her chasing down a kiss was literally her trying to accomplish a goal tied to her sense of maturity. I’d go as far as to say that she’s one of the more tame members of the group, so your characterization is rather odd.

She’s not rewarded for her behavior for the 4th of July as we see from Eric and Donna’s reaction, especially the former who had to be thoroughly convinced to let her stay. And we see this even further when Donna literally drives all the way to Wisconsin on the mere assumption that her daughter is having sex.

I understand the points you’re trying to make but at the same time some of these takes are a little misconstrued."
Over Water,"I think it’s cute and fun and I love it, personally.

Also, teen girls are just as horny and awkward as teen boys. Kind of weird to say she’s “too horny for a teen girl”."
Over Water,"I'm with you.

Some of these jokes and situations worked in that 70's show cos the characters were 17 (maybe 16) in the first season, these guys are 14."
Over Water,Sounds like you just don’t like there’s a girl lead lmao.
Over Water,"My wife and I along with 2 friends binged the whole thing yesterday and we all enjoyed it. I thought the kids were better than the trailer showed but some things about them are a bit sloppy. I think if the show continues, they will find their groove like the original cast just never be quite on that level though. As for all the original cast, it was fantastic especially Red and Kitty. One of the very last scenes of the last episode did actually make me bust out laughing but no spoilers so I'll let everyone see for themselves."
Over Water,"I’m not hating it. A nice turn your brain off for 39 mins show. Gotta say though they have a perfectly diverse friend group for Wisconsin in the 90’s though, lol"
Over Water,"While it was great to see the OG cast reprise their roles, Red and Kitty definitely carried the show. The writing, direction and especially the editing, were all over the place that was akin to Nickelodeon/Disney Channel sitcoms. The chemistry between the new cast isn't there yet but they tend to work a bit well in their little moments together."
Over Water,"Couldn't get past the first episode

Loved that 70s show growing up and this was just awful and I wish it was never created"
Over Water,I find Netflix has a problem of targeting almost everything to teen girls and/or women.
Over Water,The stereotypical forced diversity cast is always a killer for me. It's 90s Wisconsin not current day NYC
Over Water,If I could ship my kids off to stay with my parents for the summer I totally would. I don't blame Eric.
Over Water,I too thought it was totally weird for a 14 or 15 year old to be drinking. It made sense in the 70s when the drinking age was 18 but in the 90s seems a little young but I could be wrong.
Over Water,"Its really, really bad. The laugh track is intolerable. Of course I hated the original show too though."
Over Water,I just think it's weird that a couple of 14yr olds are getting high in the Basement. I just can't fathom that. It's those things together with the drinking that make the show a little weird
Over Water,It’s so bad
Over Water,"This word you use, timeless. I don’t think it means what you think it means"
Over Water,No no not at all! And I agree with what you said about that 80s show. The production for this came across too much like a Dan Schneider-esq show with some weed and sex jokes. Like for example if I walked in on my daughter watching this I would assume she watching a Disney or TeenNick show. That's what I don't like.
Over Water,"

>She’s not rewarded for her behavior for the 4th of July as we see from Eric and Donna’s reaction, especially the former who had to be thoroughly convinced to let her stay.

How is she punished then? The punishment sure isn't staying with Kitty and Redd. That's what she *wanted* the entire time. So how is making her stay a punishment when that's exactly what she wanted? And Eric didn't want her to stay because *he* wanted to be with her. Not to mention she just struts in there, beer in hand and, talks shit... at 14. In That 70s Show kids could drink at 18 and everyone still had to hide their beer and stuff around Redd. In fact there are whole episodes dedicated to the kids stealing beet from Red or trying to get beer in under his nose because they weren't cool with it.  In the 90snthe drinking age is 21 and they're suddenly cool with a 14 year old getting crushed? They didn't seem to care. They grounded her after the rave then hand her a car.

Also Red is so much softer on her. He hands the keys to the Cruiser over with a heartwarming speech right after sge gets caught sneaking out to a rave? He *never* did that shit for Eric. In fact Eric begged for Vista and Red sorta held it over his head as something to earn for multiple seasons. They softened him up like crazy. 

>The whole plot about Leia trying to get a kiss was not out of some lustful nature but because she felt behind compared to her friends, especially in comparison to the guy she was interested in.

I get it. It's was just awkward and unfunny. It was honestly cringe and leaned hard into TeenNick territory."
Over Water,[deleted]
Over Water,And they're *casually* drinking too. When I was 14 1 or maybe 2 beers and I was obliterated. They're tapping kegs and filling up multiple cups and aren't even affected.
Over Water,... what?
Over Water,As someone from wi in the 90’s we were not diverse. However I’m glad that it’s not an all white cast. We have had enough of that.
Over Water,"> I wish it was never created

Things should only exist if you like them?"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I think nobody is talking about Joel and Tess being together for at least 13 years. That was huge revelation for me. Makes Joel’s loss that much bigger.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Joel explained how the fungus rapidly spread through tainted food. This shined light on how the elderly neighbor was infected in Episode 1.

Edit: Plus Joel forgot to get a cake from the store, which presumably would have infected his family too."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,The most important part of the episode is Joel understanding the message Bill left for him. Joel is now on board with getting Ellie to this lab to find a cure. It’s why he asked her to show him her arm again.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,From the tension in the piano scene I thought someone was going to die.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"The way the episode was directed was fantastic in my opinion. I like that they don't need to show the couple's corpse at all, it was done really well. In the end of the episode when they were zooming out the window I'm going ""pleeease don't show them, we don't need to"" and sure enough they didn't! Great episode."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"While everyone is rightfully praising the actors, I want to shout out to the writer Craig Mazin for fleshing out a side character and gave us this beautiful story. 

Mazin was also responsible for writing Chernobyl, which also had some beautiful writing with amazing character relationships."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Once that Max Richter song came on to start off that montage, I was like ""guess this is my cue to cry happy sad tears now"""
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Nick Offerman should win an Emmy for his performance

Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Nick Offerman laughing at the strawberries was the moment that got me. That laugh of pure, unburdened joy. It was perfectly used."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I wasn't expecting the direction this episode took at all.

Nick Offerman made me cry.

Everyone can have their own opinion but to me this was art, not filler."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This episode was perfectly produced. My only complaint was when bill just shooting from the middle of the street with no cover.. bill seem way more intelligent than that from everything else we saw in the episode.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I'm hearing either, ""Best episode ever made!"" or ""What the hell was that, pointless!""

It wouldn't be interesting if everyone agreed I guess."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"It was well made, told a kind of slice-of-life story about living in the post apocalypse. Well written, well shot, well acted.

I can't rightly think of another episode like it that isn't filled to the brim with various genre tropes like one of them getting inevitably infected."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"It was incredible to see Bill’s growth as a person once Frank came into his life. From an angry, closed-off, highly introverted man to someone who became happy, open and loving. His vulnerability in the very beginning of their relationship and Frank’s patience and calming presence was one of the most moving things I have ever witnessed in a television show. The scene where he and Frank giggled over strawberries was truly heartwarming. I genuinely started crying when they revealed that Frank was terminally ill and love that their journey ended together. Nick Offerman should absolutely win an award for his role in this episode. It is some of the best television that has ever been made."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I loved this episode. I can forgive a deviation from the source material if the new material is written well and executed well. And this episode did exactly that. Nick Offerman killed it
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Ugly crying!
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Honestly didn't expect to cry so hard to an episode of The Last of Us about a gay romance of two one shot side characters
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,As a massive fan of the game since day 1 & never usually like something deviating TOO far from an original story... I thought that episode was fucking incredible
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This episode slayed me. Was totally unprepared. Beautiful.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,All this from a video game adaptation. We've come so fucking far.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I've been very happy theyre sticking to the OG story so closely. This is the first major change theyve made and its great. These are side characters I barely even remember existing, so they play a minimal role in the story. Fleshing out their backstory doesnt detract at all. The addition of a well written, well acted side story like this adds immensely though"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"People asked what more a show could do to expand on TLOU and this is exactly it. It’s expanding on the heart of characters trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world.

I genuinely cried, it was amazing"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I appreciated the nods to Ron Swanson's birthday dinner.

Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I don’t feel anything very easily. Nick Offerman is one of those actors that I have had this idea of in my head as being a one-trick pony. Boy, was I wrong. This episode had me weeping. I walked away feeling all kinds of stuff I can’t even explain."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"No episode of tv has made me cry like that since Not Penny’s Boat, that’s all I’ll say"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I haven’t been broken like this from a TV episode in a looooong time
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Love the ending shot is through the bedroom window. However it bugs me that it looks like it is a second floor window but their bedroom is on the ground floor for easy access.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Just finished the episode. As a long time proponent of please stick to the source material I can safely say that this episode was just absolutely fantastic.

Performances are tremendous, it fleshes out the world the characters inhabit, how they’ve changed over the course of time in a world that’s hopeless. 

If you want a 1 for 1 retelling of exactly how the game is, go play it but for me this  is a video game adaptation (key word is adaptation) done exactly right 

I hope both guys get nominated for many awards for their performance."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"""I like you older. Older means we're still here."""
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"> The Last of Us' just made an early claim to ~~one of~~ the best TV episode~~s~~ of 2023

Only been a month, and maybe Succession will give it a run for its money, but so far it's way out in front. One of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.

This show was just like, ""by the way, here's the most beautiful and devastating love story ever squeezed into an hour"" while helping establish a totally authentic post-apocalyptic setting and give leagues of depth and subtext to the stories of Joel and Tess, all in passing."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,[removed]
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I do like that they used a mortal kombat 2 machine instead of the fictional arcade cabinet
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,“I never liked you…but I do respect you.” Straight up Ron Swanson.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I totally recognize that the episode was sad because of the ending, but I couldn’t help but feel happy for Bill & Frank. In all that chaos, they built a great life together. Frank had all those amazing paintings, Bill overcame his grudge against humanity, they grew strawberries!!

How many people get undisturbed time (work, school,  obligations) for over a decade with the person they love?  I was really happy and proud of them for that.

Also, very classy of TV Ellie not to raid Bill’s magazine collection, 😂"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,[removed]
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Much preferred their story here than the game’s version and glad some story beats are changing.

My biggest complaint before was that it I personally was finding a 1 for 1 recreation slightly uninteresting (feels like a harsh word as I’m still think this is a fantastic tv show), part of me was wishing I was just playing the game instead.

This episode was a brilliant change of pace, a perfect filler episode."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I think this was the first time I actually cried while watching something incredible performance
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,It was a good episode for sure.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Last time Ive cried this much from a show/movie was Titanic.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This episode made me weep like a child
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"So I can’t find any comments addressing it and I kinda wanna see what you guys think. What exactly is Bills profession before this??? That house is expensive. You can see the Boston skyline in the distance. He has an arsenal that seems like it would cost nearly $50,000 not including ammunition or any of the other doomsday supplies. Maybe his mother left him the house, who knows. My guess is a degree in Engineering. That’s the only way I see someone putting together some town like that. Sure someone could slap some stuff together but realistically would probably end up hurting themselves trying to set all that up."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Well, this is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.  
  
My *emotions*."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"At the end of that episode I crawled into my boyfriends lap and cried for ages. Best bit of telly I’ve seen in a long time, absolutely amazing writing and performances."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I think a lot of the criticism of it being a filler episode is from people who lack media literacy. It is really not difficult to see how the story told in the ep fleshes out and contextualises some of the wider themes of the game/show
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I adored it. Felt like one of those classic artsy post-apocalyptic short stories you might have read in high school. But gay as hell.

I also thought the bedroom scene hit exactly the right notes. Not too schmaltzy, not too lurid, but not shying away from it either. It was sweet. Loved seeing this uber macho prepper guy suddenly trembling like a leaf with how nervous and self-conscious he was."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"This episode actually gave me a stomach ache— I mean besides the blatant sobbing it just made me ache. I also laughed out loud more than once (all Nick Offerman).
That scene with Bill and Frank when they are sitting in their suits quietly exchanging rings BROKE ME."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"When bill was shooting in the street, it was so dumb tho."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Early yes, but hard to disagree. As someone that loved the games, the whiplash of expectation to such a radically different approach to show determination and tenderness in this world was exceptionally effective. For those that have experienced the game and are even remotely media literate, it was phenomenal. I cried, I laughed, I cried a whole lot more. I told my wife that ""that episode was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time,"" and she agreed. 

For those coming in fresh, it was a remarkable way to show depth and complexity and motivation. Taking an episode to do this in an emotional and beautiful way is no waste. It does the functional story moving that the game did in a completely different way. 

I get people having their own tastes and their own opinions, but it's hard to think about people upset for deviating from this show being a play through. I did that. I experienced it. I let it take me along for the story and experience once, why wouldn't I allow this different medium to do the same?"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Man, this was the episode I was most looking forward to/most worried about. I had conflicting feelings on the Bill/Frank stuff in the game. But holy shit was this just one of the most touching, heartbreaking and beautiful queer love stories I’ve seen.

The game was super progressive for even including an overtly gay character but the game kind of makes Bill’s homosexuality into a joke with the discovery of the gay magazine. Hence my complicated feelings on it. This episode knocked it out of the park. It’s so rare to see gay romance depicted in this way, as an aging couple. I think this has a lot to do with the AIDS pandemic and how we lost a massive percentage of a whole generation but seeing a gay couple be able to grow old together was far more moving than I expected it to be. Phenomenal episode imo."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Throughout the episode I couldn’t place where i had seen the actor who played Frank before. When I found out he was from White Lotus I couldn’t believe it was the same guy. Great actor.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"One of the most intense and surprising things I noticed was how Bill and Frank are likely the only couple on earth to have such a picturesque, ‘romantic’ ending. They lived and experienced the joys of the old, pre-infection world like maybe only a handful left on earth could experience.

Everything outside their utopia is an apocalyptic dystopia. Most people die in horrible ways, or in substandard, poverty-like conditions in the QZs. It would likely be hundreds or thousands of years before what they had would once again become at least somewhat common."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,It made the notebook look like the emoji movie
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I ugly cried with this episode
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This is when The Last of Us did World War Z better than World War Z.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Everyone go watch Devs, it's the best Nick Offerman role IMO."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Holy sweet goddamn that show rocked me.

I don’t think I’ve ever been moved that much by tv or a movie.

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett were unbelievable."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Best thing I’ve watched this year. Loved it.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,One of the best Episodes I’ve throughly enjoyed because the World building occurred during this time. I do hope if other seasons are commissioned from this franchise… I’ve seen lots of negativity about this and it’s not been enjoyable to read.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Never played the game. Coming in cold. This is one of the greatest (IMHO) episodes of TV that I’ve ever watched. The writing, the acting, the directing. All perfect. So much tension at he start, then the twist, then the gut wrenching ugly man crying at the end. I need to watch it again but I’m not sure that I can take it right now."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Fuck this episode, I watched it for shroom zombies and instead got my 46 year old straight male heart ripped out from under my guts while cried like I haven’t since I was at least 5, not cool with your fancy writing and excellent acting and directing catching me so hard over what was probably less than 30 minutes. Now we never talk about this ever again"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This episode was incredible
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,That damn shutter island/arrival song 😢
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Watching it! That wink when he’s painting 🥲
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Did anybody else think Bill would be alive when Joel arrived? I thought it possible that he would fake dying to relieve frank of the guilt of leaving him alone
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I played the game in 2020 but forgot who Bill and Frank were lol, so I wasn't expecting the episode to go in that direction. I cried like a baby during their last meal. The score was fantastic as well and probably triggered more emotions. Such a beautiful episode all around."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This episode was like a long version of UP's love story. loved it.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"This particular episode had it all: acting, writing, story, pathos. It’s one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. If the quality stays this high it might be the best series ever."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"This episode was so fucking touching I almost cried in front of my folks. I don't like crying in front of people (which is normal), but this brought tears to my eyes."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,[removed]
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,One of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time.  I suspect the right wingers are going to loose their minds.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"What a masterpiece. 

And on episode 3. Going to be hard to compete with that one. Man this is a great show."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"All I can say as a straight white cis guy watching a show about zombies, I never expected to be in literal tears at the end of a gay love story. I pretty much just consume TV for entertainment and while I really enjoy some shows I don't really get to emotionally invested. This episode gave me so many of the feels."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,IMHO the greatest queer love story in television history. I'd totally watch a spin off show of Bill and Frank's domestic adventures in post apocalyptia.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"It was definitely the best episode of tv of 2023 so far. A touching tale, both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I hope that the guest stars get remembered come awards season."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This show is incredibly good. My family was spellbound and quite pleasantly surprised.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This is how you tell good stories. I wonder if the writers of rings of power watched it.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,That really was so good. I was fucking bawling.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I knew Nick Offeman was a great actor but gat dam!
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This show is HBO caliber in the best possible way.  I don’t even like the genre per se and know nothing of the game but when acting and writing is this good I just pop some popcorn and wait until next week impatiently.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,They introduced a gay Ron Swanson and then killed him in one episode.  :-(
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"This was a good ep ill admit. Def carried by the actors. But what bothered me about it, and its been done so many times in other shows is.....Bill, standing there....standing straight up, poppin shots with a BOLT ACTION RIFLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Why...just...why do so many shows do this shit. Im to believe this (probably vet), mega prepper gun ""enthusiast"" has no tactical training at all?! That mf'r would be behind cover, dick in the dirt poppin shots from a comfortable distance at his leisure. Not standing straight up in the middle of the fucking road....god i hate that shit, takes me right out. Murray bartlett was incredible tho so...i guess theres that"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Beaujolais Villages.  My family’s go to wine. Never heard anyone ever mention it. I was hooked from then on.  What an awesome episode!  Incredible all around. Well done!
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Incredible episode. The Bill story in the game was good, but they really took it to another level here. I'm happy they're sticking to the game in certain areas, but this was an inspired change. We got a fantastic, emotional story that still imparts the same lesson to Joel and let's us feel his pain over Tess through Bill's experience."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Just watched the episode tonight. Brilliant first few minutes when he meets frank. My wife and I were just WAITING for frank to kill him. Especially when he sat down at the piano... 50m later were both crying at the love story. 

Brilliant story telling. Absolutely loving the series so far. LOF is a top 10 game for me so it's especially awesome to see the carry over. My wife whos never had interest can't stop watching either!"
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,This was a powerful episode. It’s the kind of rare and unexpected storytelling that I’ll remember for a long time.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Ron would be disappointed.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Every now and then, you are watching TV, and you become aware that what you are seeing is far above the level of quality of most TV. This episode was o e of those times. As it ended, I just sat there, stunned. It has been a LONG time since I've seen anything as good as this episode on TV."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Idk I thought it kinda dragged.. I enjoyed the 1st and 2nd episode a lot more
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Waterworks non stop. Finally a gay love story I can rewatch.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I cried. That's it.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I'm sad that they cut Elllies and Joel's scenes with Bill, those are some of the best scenes in the game (including the ""sticky pages"" in the car afterwards.."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,It was good. I was just disappointed that we didn't get the great back and forth exchanges with Bill and Ellie like in the game.
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Maybe an unpopular opinion. First off, I loved the episode. Not saying it wasn’t great. But in the entirety of an hour long episode, in the end Joel and Ellie just get Bill and Frank’s stuff and leave. What’s the point of having that entire backstory and flashback for that?  I’m not criticizing it at all, just a genuine wonder about the screen time spent just to show a small connection to Joel in the past and then him and Ellie just move on."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"I get that anyone who criticises the episode will be labelled as homophobic but seriously though, they decided to waste one of only 9 episodes on that? What the fuck."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"There was such an absurd amount of hype around this episode...

... and, yea, it lived up to it."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,"Man the one thing that really pissed me off about this episode was the raid attack. Why the fuck is Bill standing out in the middle of the street with no cover?

So far the series has been good about these sorts of decision making on the characters parts but Bill is made out to be a survivor yet he makes such a stupid mistake.

Also seems odd to me that they would have had in all that time just one raid? It's clear to see that the town has supplies, it is fortified so there definitely would have been other groups who invade. Especially considering it's close proximity to Boston.

Excellent episode otherwise but yea that just didn't sit well with me. Not sure why Joel and Tess would continue going back to the QZ instead of stake out with Bill and Frank and live a comfortable life when it's clearly less stressful and more ideal.

Felt like a place totally disconnected from the horrors of the world. Needed more emphasis on the constant fight for survival like the games really try to hammer into you.

Still, excellent episode that didn't follow the tropes of most media."
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,Well we just decided the song we want to walk down the aisle to this summer. Thanks zombie apocalypse movie!! And thanks Nick and Murray!
Frank Elstner: Just One Last Question,I'd argue best episodes of TV ever. I like this show a lot more when there's no zombies.
