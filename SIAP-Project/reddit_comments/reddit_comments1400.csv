TV Show,Comment
Vai Anitta,cool she speak english
Birth of a Beauty,Loved utopia...especially this scene gave me chills.
Birth of a Beauty,"What a great show. The contrast between the production's vibrant colours and the grimness of the plot was unsettling yet brilliant. Definitely worth watching if you liked Fargo.

I'm eager to see how badly the remake turns out."
Birth of a Beauty,"Eh, Utopia season 1 was brilliant, but Season 2 completely lost me, I've never seen such a decline in writing/story quality (acting and production was still great).

Also this monologue kind of predated modern ""doomer"" culture and is a really silly way to look at the world and environmental impact. Just taking his point about an individuals contribution, OK, but what if that kid becomes a researcher or activist whose actions lead to a 100x reduction, or more? The initial statement of her having the child as being selfish is just wrong, it's unknown. It's a dice roll over whether someone will have a positive or negative effect on the world, though on the whole, people tend to be trending towards the world being a better place, so the odds are in her favor

*oh no the doomer kids are upset"

Birth of a Beauty,"I always loved how this is the cold open to the last episode, and yet it works very well as a standalone clip to show to people as a recommendation."
Birth of a Beauty,"The US remake? It came out in 2020. Unless there's another remake happening. 

p.s. it was okay in and of itself, but pretty bad as a Utopia remake/reboot"
Birth of a Beauty,It’s a shame David Fincher’s version was cancelled. I doubt Fincher would have tried to make the exact same thing.
Birth of a Beauty,"It didn't predate anything, people were talking about this shit back then"
Birth of a Beauty,Reddit moment
Birth of a Beauty,The US one only kept the brutal violence but it didn't have any of the style that made the original unique.
Birth of a Beauty,Well if they were it wasn't as pervasive or as common as doomers are today
Birth of a Beauty,I always thought it was funny that backwards ass Pawnee had a thriving gay bar.
Birth of a Beauty,Greetings from The Snakehole Lounge!
Birth of a Beauty,"In my small town young people hung out at the Waffle House or just in grocery store parking lots because the bars all had a gross, older alcoholics vibe."
Birth of a Beauty,Maybe you just don't get invited to the good parties.
Birth of a Beauty,"So you're telling me that not every female in Letterkenny, Ontario, is a slim tall attractive woman who wears short shorts in mid winter?"
Birth of a Beauty,"My first night living in a classic American small town after leaving The City was basically exactly that though.

Old timey but fairly nice bar. Lots of wood. Great bands. Attractive people dancing. I was actually staying at the house of the good looking female bartender that knew all the local dramas.

Looking back now, it's kinda funny."
Birth of a Beauty,"It’s not that they haven’t been outside of LA, it’s that the reality of small town life isn’t anything anyone wants to watch.


Why do people always assume in accuracies are unintentional?"
Birth of a Beauty,good thing tv is not real and a local watering hole where the who’s who of the small town hangs out is a convenient story setup
Birth of a Beauty,"You bring back fond memories of the one evening I spent in Arkadelphia, West Virginia.  The fond part is the fact that it was only one night, and then we escaped."
Birth of a Beauty,The young people usually move away before they're 21 here
Birth of a Beauty,"I always assume those kinds of trendy small towns are on the west coast. They're definitely not here in the south lol

I think Resident Alien is a good example of this. A little mountain town with a small population where everyone is well-educated and dresses nice. I'd love to live in a place like that if they actually exist."
Birth of a Beauty,I get your point but…would you really want to watch a show that sticks closely to real life in a small town?
Birth of a Beauty,"I live in rural Midwest town and we have two bars.

One is small and occupied/kept afloat by the same 10 guys who are there (almost) every night. They even have holiday parties at the bar with just those guys and their wives/families. I went there once and it was like walking into a slightly less depressing Moe’s Tavern.

The other bar is the “younger” bar where generally people in their 20s go. There is a dance floor but no one ever dancing. No live music, but a juke box that people rarely use. And a couple pool tables. And always, always full of smoke. They really only open on Friday’s and Saturday’s because it’s the only time they get any business. It only stays open because it’s connected to and owned by a family that also owns a successful restaurant in town."
Birth of a Beauty,I actually stayed a couple of nights in a small town whilst travelling through Texas. They had a bar which was pretty much in a strip mall but it was ace. The decor was a bit dated but they had duelling pianos and line dancing and I went a couple of nights and it was bouncing
Birth of a Beauty,My favorite thing is those Hallmark movies where a single woman runs a tiny antique shop in a small town and somehow earns enough to drive an Escalade and own a five-bedroom home on 10 acres.
Birth of a Beauty,Why do people think that if something isn't exactly like they've experienced then it means it's not true or realistic
Birth of a Beauty,"I’ll clue you in on something…

Real life is shitty and doesn’t look, sound, or feel like most things on TV. They’re selling the audience an escapist fantasy where they can see pretty people do awesome, stupid, interesting, dramatic, cliched things. 

Most people don’t want to watch sort-of-6-but-small-town-solid-8 people make awkward conversation at a sticky bar leading to depressed, shitty choices."
Birth of a Beauty,"You often need a way for various characters in shows to interact in a natural way. The small town bar trope exists because it’s cheaper and easier to have one set of a central location where all your characters could believably interact with one another and have both private and public conversations. 

A bar allows you to have characters share information with one another/the audience that they normally wouldn’t/shouldn’t disclose. It allows you to use many various tropes that will further the plot easily. Like [“Drowning My Sorrows,”](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Drowning_My_Sorrows) [“In Vino Veritas,”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas) and many more. 

Generally in a small town in the USA/Canada you have a market and some stores, a local diner/restaurant (along with some chains), a movie theater, schools, a bar (or bars), some type of amphitheater or assembly hall, churches, city hall, etc… A bar is the single location that works best where ALL your characters could have an excuse to be at during various times and is a location where you can have “secret” conversations, private conversations, and public discussions/proclamations/speeches with all your characters. 

A school or church or most anywhere else, wouldn’t make sense for [a drifter](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter) to make a natural appearance and espouse dialog that furthers the plot. 

There is also usually a TV in the bar which allows you to further the plot and bring news from outside of the town via [“Coincidental Broadcast.”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast)

You also get to use the [“Recovered Addict”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoveredAddict) and  [“Off The Wagon”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon) tropes to enable [“Character Derailment”](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment) and other tropes and divulge to the audience some tragic backstory or important plot details. 

The bar is usually used as a window into the outside world and way to get information from the rest of the world to the townspeople."
Birth of a Beauty,"If it's what you're looking for, 'Horace and Pete' is essentially a direct response to this trope. Enjoy."
Birth of a Beauty,"This really depends on where you are. If you have a college near by? Yes, I see that all the time. Tourist area that has a solid local population? Yep. Oilfields or quick cash towns? You betcha..."
Birth of a Beauty,"It always baffled me when there'd be a nightclub where all the teens went, as if an underage hangout would have top notch bands/djs. Think Buffy or Save the Last Dance. Or Smallville, but I believe that one was mostly a hip coffee shop"
Birth of a Beauty,Just watched The Peripheral tonight. I think they do a decent job of showing a small town bar replete with pine and shitty tvs.
Birth of a Beauty,"I, too, watch Virgin River"
Birth of a Beauty,"The small town I'm from didn't have jack shit when I lived there. Just the one rough biker bar. About ten years after I left they got a night club. It didn't have live music, but it played rock and country pop music. And it was packed. Like a damn high school reunion, but for them it was just Friday night. It's where everyone went to hook up and get laid. It was the only party place in town, so you never had to wonder where everyone was. And everyone just seemed to end up going home with everyone else eventually. If I had stayed there a month, I could have knocked boots with every girl I went to high school with that wasn't married."
Birth of a Beauty,I agree but Twin Peaks has all of those things and it's brilliant.
Birth of a Beauty,"I don't know how to tell you this, but TV isn't real life and sometimes creative liberties have to be taken for storytelling/worldbuilding purposes."
Birth of a Beauty,"The local coffee shop has ten times the average daily traffic as both of the local bars... and this ""town"" has two bars, one coffee shop, one gas station, and a pizza joint that's open about two days a week to launder drug money. 

That's it. The bar that does food gets ten times as much dinner traffic as they do bar traffic."
Birth of a Beauty,"It's not a TV show about an average place, it's a TV show about an extraordinary place; That's why there's a show about it. 

That's the way I look at it at least."
Birth of a Beauty,"[And yet, the bar from New Vegas' prologue exists, in the middle of nowhere, is not a tourist spot (well, maybe a little), and is straight up from a Hollywood movie.](https://youtu.be/89sOyZdtVA0?t=2960)

I really don't know what to do with this. BUT it just hit me why being a biker in Nevada is so fucking cool.

And here I am, in Poland, Europe, where every square meter is the same. Everything mixed together for hundreds of years, all in the same, mid climate... boooring. I don't admire your electric grid Texas, but... you attract me."
Birth of a Beauty,[deleted]
Birth of a Beauty,"I feel like the Vampire Diaries was notorious for this. Small town but they would not only have a packed restaurant/bar, but full on balls with evening gowns at some fancy estate. Whole town would be there."
Birth of a Beauty,"While I enjoyed Schitt's Creek, it annoys me that it's clear no one affiliated with that show has ever been to a small town."
Birth of a Beauty,My Ex grew up on an island of 800 people off of north Wisconsin….nah it be’s like that sometimes.
Birth of a Beauty,Haha- so true!
Birth of a Beauty,I've seen this in multiple small towns around the country. Sorry yours doesn't.....
Birth of a Beauty,"When our bar has live music it's a super heavy metal cover band, cause I live in the midwest and apparently that's the music everyone wants to hear. No one dances except for 2 or 3 really drunk women who are in leather and fringes. If you can't take the sound level, you hang out in the parking lot."
Birth of a Beauty,"Blues legend boxcar Charlie plays there every night and never leaves, even though he could be touring the world with a record contract"
Birth of a Beauty,"""New to The Yabba?"""
Birth of a Beauty,The bar in Banshee was pretty slow.
Birth of a Beauty,Most bars are mostly males and most of the women in the bars if they are there are older women.  But the media has always created this element of harmony in whatever set is being shown in the tv show.
Birth of a Beauty,"They usually forget the impoverished white families, meth addicts, and lack of jobs and hospitals."
Birth of a Beauty,a thriving gay bar plus a night club that is seemingly full or at least bustling on work nights
Birth of a Beauty,"The show shows Pawnee as 60,000 to 80,000 people not the most rural-ness place and even smaller somewhat ass backwords towns can have that kind of 
dichotomy. 

* Rural Decorah, Iowa with a population 8,000 of puts gay pride flags up during pride month and yet has ""Club 45"" a bar named for Trump 's presidency. It has a liberal arts college in town

* Suburban/rural Waverly, Iowa with 10,000 people voted for Trump in 2020 yet has city owned power/water and gigabit internet. Also, was the city owned power company was the first utility in the Midwest to have a wind turbine. The the smaller liberal arts college in town has a drag show and this year went off with zero protests. 

* Cedar Falls, Iowa(40,000) and Waterloo, Iowa(60,000) metro which Waverly exists in is has a two day Pridefest every year. 

* one of the years I worked at a Boy Scout camp in Eastern Iowa had a camp staff that was, for those under 30, 27% LGBT: 3 Bi gals, 2 gay guys, 4 bi guys, and 2 who have started their transitioning from guys to gals."
Birth of a Beauty,Just stay away from the owners crazy daughter Janet.
Birth of a Beauty,"Jesus I remember how often we used to just go to Walmart. We were restless and needed to go somewhere but had nowhere to go because we were 16 and the only other place open was the casino.

I remember one night we swore to God we weren't going to go to Walmart and we ended up going to a Walmart in another town. It's one of my favorite memories."
Birth of a Beauty,"I always felt like they came close to getting the small town bar right..  They over exaggerate the attractiveness of the few women in town but the people there are actually pretty average and the slim pickings are accurate.  

Except for the hockey players, for whom there’s just far too many hockey groupies for a small town."
Birth of a Beauty,Did you live in a Netflix show set in the rural West but actually filmed in Canada
Birth of a Beauty,It's also because they need to have a small number of sets. That's why everyone is always hanging out in the same places. Keeps the budget lower.
Birth of a Beauty,is that a real place?
Birth of a Beauty,Didn't they have a fancy French restaurant in that show?
Birth of a Beauty,"People on this subreddit watch TV solely so that
they can see the least interesting aspects of their lives faithfully recreated on screen."
Birth of a Beauty,"Yes, this is the rural midwest town that I am quite familiar with indeed"
Birth of a Beauty,"Most of these places are kept open by the illegal high stakes poker game that starts after midnight and ends as the sun comes up. You have to be invited, otherwise you will never know that it occurs. Often, local officials make up most of the players. This is the real Midwestern small town."
Birth of a Beauty,And the antique store is not filled with junk.
Birth of a Beauty,Saddest show I’ve ever seen.
Birth of a Beauty,This terrifies me. I prefer the city where I may hang out with a stranger and then never see them again.
Birth of a Beauty,"Yes - but Twin Peaks is 100% ""David Lynch has never left LA"" - it's supposed to have a population of 50k people and still be a ""small town"" - 50k people would make it the third largest city in Washington that's not a suburb of Seattle, Spokane or Vancouver."
Birth of a Beauty,"The sketchy dive bar/human trafficking hot spot owned by criminals and sitting on a random highway outside of Twin Peaks that somehow managed to book Moby, Eddie Vedder, and Nine Inch Nails, among others."
Birth of a Beauty,"Are you saying I made a bad decision relying on the local population to purchase organic goat cheese and artisanal body milks from the boutique apothecary I established!?!

I will never financially recover from this."
Birth of a Beauty,Or they just don't want to make the show worse for the sake of making it small town accurate?
Birth of a Beauty,"Honestly though, I felt Schitt’s Creek really did show small town life somewhat accurate. The whole concept of having one restaurant where everyone eats, few shopping locations, gossipy small-town politics and having to drive half an hour plus to anywhere is pretty accurate. Now I do think that Schitt’s Creek wasn’t accurate in showing a great number of hip, attractive twenty-somethings because that was definitely not my experience in a small town."
Birth of a Beauty,"Laid back, chill place"
Birth of a Beauty,Doesn't Pawnee have like 70k people? That's not a big city but it's above what I'd consider a small town.
Birth of a Beauty,And a jazz club.
Birth of a Beauty,I grew up in a small tourist town we would sit in one specific parking spot in kfc outside the car. Because the tourists basically never went to the kfc
Birth of a Beauty,"No, it was just Silverton, Oregon."
Birth of a Beauty,"Yes.  It’s in the panhandle.  Draw a straight line from NYC to Dayton, Ohio, and it goes through Arkadelphia, so my friend who was planning the trip thought it would be a good place to stop for the night."
Birth of a Beauty,"And another thing, how come Breaking Bad never had an episode where Jesse just scrolled on Reddit for 45 minutes!!!"
Birth of a Beauty,"I just think it's weird how people in cities who have no understanding about what life in small towns is like, and then they get jobs as writers that shape what what other people in cities will think small towns are like who will then get jobs as writers and perpetuate the cycle indefinitely."
Birth of a Beauty,And the store is doing well enough that she can employ her sassy best friend Jodi as a full-time cashier.
Birth of a Beauty,"It is a long slow dirge of hopelessness and compromised dreams and an examination of the damage we do to each other to compromise them.

Honestly though, Laurie Metcalf's monologue was completely astounding and made me appreciate her as an actress - just incredible stuff."
Birth of a Beauty,"I couldn't do that even in a city. Always ran into the same people. Though, if you drink enough, it seems like you are meeting them for the first time."
Birth of a Beauty,"That wasn't his fault, he and Mark Frost wanted 5000 people in Twin Peaks. The network demanded more for some reason.

So they added an extra digit to the sign...and then continued to write it like a town of 5000 people anyway. The sheriff's department is *4* people in the original show."
Birth of a Beauty,"You dummy, you're supposed to market those towards the tourists!"
Birth of a Beauty,"[Great drinks, too!](https://i.gifer.com/NTil.gif)"
Birth of a Beauty,If 70k is small town I’m a velociraptor
Birth of a Beauty,I think the jazz club was actually in eagleton
Birth of a Beauty,What would you do? Just hang in the parking lot?
Birth of a Beauty,"So, kinda both at once."
Birth of a Beauty,"Might be difference in expectations.  Some people think 10,000 is small town, but to others it's more like 500-2000.  A town with 10k (like Silverton) is usually able to have a bit better bar these days than the small ones, which often can barely even operate."
Birth of a Beauty,What
Birth of a Beauty,He knowingly planned a stop in a place called Arkadelphia?
Birth of a Beauty,I don't feel like Jesse is the type to go on reddit. Maybe Badger. Who then forwards the content in the group chat.
Birth of a Beauty,He was busy eating Cheetos and masturbating all day.
Birth of a Beauty,You’re missing they key point: nobody wants to watch a show set in a real small town. They’re boring.
Birth of a Beauty,Lots of the people in cities grew up in small towns. It isn't like they forget it all when they move
Birth of a Beauty,Just how horrible they all were. Every single one. Just like the rest of us. It never received the attention or praise it deserved. Louis was at his peak.
Birth of a Beauty,I'm sorry about the time you've had to spend with Chris Pratt.
Birth of a Beauty,Yeah sometimes someone had a guitar or some booze.

Welcome to Waikiki,"Shows you like completely disappearing is definitely the worst thing about the streaming era for viewers.

Welcome to Waikiki,If you watch international shows you’ll still have plenty to pick from. Very US centric take.
Welcome to Waikiki,"That's the new motto of the Hollywood press. And it's not true. I read yesterday that Apple has 28 new shows finalized for premiere (scripted adult shows only), plus 11 filming and 10 in pre-production. Not counting all new seasons. Peak TV isn't over; they're just looking the wrong way. Traditional studios don't have the money that Amazon and Apple do, naturally, so it's time to follow the money. It's sad? Perhaps. But that's how things are. The studios thought it would be easy to be a Netflix and launched a race that, in the end, was going to be about money. Patience."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Much like housing, tv is in a bubble...wayyy too expensive to keep all these subscriptions and we are now getting less and less for our money."
Welcome to Waikiki,"This story has been recycled in various forms many times.  I think the only difference now is the streaming world modifies the market on a quicker cycle than we previously experienced.

I didn't get any further than that. You would have to be incredibly naive to believe that one low monthly was going to give us access to everything forever."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Oh yea, sure. Sorry that the fucking PANDEMIC slowed down your fill of mind blowing television. You know that we are still one of the few industries in America that still has to wear fucking masks to set every day and get tested multiple times a week? That shit is insanely expensive."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Yeah, it's called capitalism. It happens to every industry ever."
Welcome to Waikiki,I think one of the biggest problems with TV now is every show wants to be prestige TV. Everyone is so busy trying to make art that they forget to just make stuff that's entertaining for entertainments sake.
Welcome to Waikiki,"If a show or movie is no longer publicly available from the producers or IP owners, it should enter the public domain. Full stop. 

“Burying it alive” as it’s referred to in the article should be a tacit admission that they can’t benefit financially from it and there’s no reason to protect the copyright. 

Am I oversimplifying things? Sure. But I don’t think that anyone should have the right to simply make something disappear. Maybe the actual content creators should. But a corporation definitely should not. It’s too much power and too easily used to create losses for tax purposes and risks abuse toward content creators."
Welcome to Waikiki,Wait until those c suite executives find out that people won’t stick around for shit tv.
Welcome to Waikiki,The Nevers sucked
Welcome to Waikiki,"We've been spoiled with a golden era of television for 20 years. It's made studios reckless, sacrificing quality and craft for the quest of jackpot payouts. Studios need to stop throwing enormous money at bad writing, bad acting, and inexperienced show runners. Small or medium shows have more room to grow as investments. You only need one out of a portfolio of them to pay off.

I'd name a show here that exemplifies this but I'd expect a bot army downvoting the comment to oblivion."
Welcome to Waikiki,"2022 was the last year of Peak TV, definitely. I predicted that a big streamer would bite the dust during the next recession; I don't think that's happened yet.

The crash is going to be wider than TV as well. The Marvel money machine might be slowing down majorly. *Ant-Man 3* is looking likely to be the lowest grossing MCU film that wasn't dual-released and will likely make an overall eight-figure loss. Disney itself is only staying profitable via the parks.

The studios can't rely on China any more - the PRC is getting very picky about what it allows in now - and they have also lost the biggest European market, Russia, for this year at least."

Welcome to Waikiki,"With that being said it is somthing that has happend forever. There are 10's of thousands of movies and TV lost by not making the jump to DVD. There were 10's of thousands of TV shows (even number one shows) that were shot on video and are now unwatchable. There are also many shows and miniseries you can view due to strange rights issues. 
The top two I can think of is from the earth to the moon on HBO and Steven Spielbergs taken. I also remember wanting to do a michael J fox marathon a few years ago and 2-3 of his movies you just can't watch. Also cocoon the movie can't be streamed. And so on."

Welcome to Waikiki,">  While cancelling shows mid production is just a tax write off for companies maximising short term profits.

Welcome to Waikiki,"The problem with 'the vault' is that your content only has value worth bottling if it ends appropriately.

The current model of two seasons and an abrupt cancellation on a cliff hanger don't really make the value for long term storage: if they had only made two our of three Lord of the Ring movies, cancelling the last one due to costs, I doubt they'd be as popular as they were."
Welcome to Waikiki,“A tax write off” 😂
Welcome to Waikiki,This is such a young people problem. Content disappeared is nothing new.
Welcome to Waikiki,"I would say that low quality shows is the actual worse part. Massive over expansion to create content has lead to an initial relief and opened new possibilities but quickly lead to a glut of poor quality products. Volume mattered more than anything and the hope was for massive hit rather than investing real time and effort nurturing something then entire studio believed in. Everything is so rushed, no one is sitting in a writers room like Breaking Bad or The Leftovers to make something last and improve. The insult to injury is that even if you do manage to find something you like, they’ll pull the rug out from under you (the audience and the staff) so why invest the effort at all?"
Welcome to Waikiki,How is canceling a show mid production a tax write off?
Welcome to Waikiki,">Streaming allows companies to manipulate supply and build demand for shows being held in the vault

So could TV... Not sure why you bring this up as a streaming only problem. The companies that chose what was on TV were able to do the exact same thing. Streaming, however, just makes it easier for everyone since they can choose when to watch it, given that it's there. Or, you know, create a video on demand of something you want to watch...

&#x200B;

However, any movie or show that is ever streamed will be archived forever, which we didn't have the same with film, or TV. Call it piracy if you want, but capturing media and archiving it forever is a pretty good deal, considering we have shows and movies that all copies to have been lost, that's basically impossible now."

Welcome to Waikiki,"For the general public, Apple lighting money on fire to make shows no one will watch is of little consequence."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Maybe read the article before dismissing it? You’re reinforcing their point. There is *too much tv* for the audience and the industry to handle.

> When Landgraf first uttered the words Peak TV back in 2015, he wasn’t hailing a new golden age but warning of an imminent saturation point, after which there would simply be more scripted TV series than anyone—networks, studios, viewers—could possibly handle. That was when there were an estimated 370 scripted shows on the air. In 2022 there were 599."
Welcome to Waikiki,"And as bad at that is, cable TV worse – like Slim Pickens, they're going to ride that bomb right into the ground.

But, yeah – subscriptions of all kinds are all heading towards pricing themselves out of many markets."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Personally, I feel like I'm getting a lot more bang for my buck. I just subscribe to a service, watch what I'm interested in, cancel, and move on to the next. I've yet to touch Apple. But I think they have enough content now to where I'm ready to pick them for a bit. I used to pay a lot more for tons of cable channels that I never watched."
Welcome to Waikiki,"> Much like housing, tv is in a bubble...wayyy too expensive to keep all these subscriptions and we are now getting less and less for our money.

That's not the bubble. The bubble is all these services dumping huge amounts of money into programming in the hopes of getting subscriber revenue that isn't materializing. We are facing what happens when it dawns on them that their business model is unsustainable."
Welcome to Waikiki,"I'm preparing to cancel everything. my friends had paid me their half of the Netflix sub for the year, so I'll wait it out but i have watched only two series in two years.

There is both too much and not enough with Netflix"
Welcome to Waikiki,How is housing in a bubble lmfao…it’s low supply keeping prices high. As in the opposite of a bubble. Literally Econ 101 supply and demand price action. Dear lord.
Welcome to Waikiki,Housing isn’t a bubble.
Welcome to Waikiki,the housing market today is nothing like 2008. the borrowers and owners today are 100 times more qualified than the mess that caused 2008
Welcome to Waikiki,"The film and then TV industries have been pretty cyclical all along. It's sort of built-in. But launching/merging all those services, it was clear that some serious financialization was at work."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Also one of the few industries where an entire workplace can lose days/weeks of pay because one person gets sick so they have more reason to spend money to mitigate the risk

The real irony is when people like Woody Harrelson speak out against ""restrictions,"" ignorant of the fact that the protections are there to keep him from getting sick because if he gets sick it's the crew that gets screwed not him"
Welcome to Waikiki,Really? Even after California canceled the emergency status?
Welcome to Waikiki,your industry voted for that stuff
Welcome to Waikiki,"Holy shit that is terrible. Still wearing masks?? I am so sorry. Can’t imagine the long term mental effects of that, not even counting the insane costs like you said and jobs lost bc of cancelled productions. So so stupid"
Welcome to Waikiki,Not true at all
Welcome to Waikiki,"Eh, not really. Netflix is proof that subpar mindless entertainment still is loved—and that is fine."
Welcome to Waikiki,"This is why shows like Cobra Kai and Wednesday or even Peacemaker get such strong reactions. Not everyone wants to watch prestige tv all the time. Sometimes you just want to kick back and have fun watching something that is good but isn't taking itself too seriously. 

Prestige tv should be a thing that is only merited by the concept and if it makes sense. There's so many shows where I think ""you know if you weren't trying to be the next Sopranos, this show could actually succeed with a little more levity and willingness to keep it simple""."
Welcome to Waikiki,"I also miss when characters actually felt like friends. Half the shows I watch now, I’m like “There’s no way these people would hang out with each other outside of school” 

I also miss random holiday episodes and bottle episodes where they got to play with character dynamics. 

With 8-10 episodes, there’s no room for any of this anymore. 

It’s why I still like and watch a Riverdale. Because yes even though it’s batshit insane, it at least tried something new every season just for fun. Plus it’s one of the few shows with 20 episodes"
Welcome to Waikiki,Have you even watched Netflix?
Welcome to Waikiki,"This sounds like when they ""option"" a good script and then let it sit unworked."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Bad tv made Garry Marshall rich:

Welcome to Waikiki,I thought the first part of season one was great. Second part not so much.
Welcome to Waikiki,Name a time where you couldn’t name two corny predictable shows that were offensively bad and hugely popular?
Welcome to Waikiki,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgIMJcBpqKI
Welcome to Waikiki,I’m just waiting for the return of CornHub
Welcome to Waikiki,He didn't do fuckin' shit. He didn't rig shit!
Welcome to Waikiki,It's okay to show them because they ain't got no souls!
Welcome to Waikiki,That's what she does!
Welcome to Waikiki,Found Rick Morty quotes!!!!
Welcome to Waikiki,You gotta watch snail down
Welcome to Waikiki,Someone clearly isn’t up for the bird 😒
Welcome to Waikiki,"And then you get shows like WKRP in Cincinnati, where it was released on DVD, but they didn't want to spend to get the rights to the songs they used, so while they have the show, it's never going to be the same."
Welcome to Waikiki,"From… is fantastic, I highly recommend. I pirate, I had no idea it was hard to stream. But I have noticed a few times that what seems to be an underrated series turns out to be just not available to modern legit audiences."
Welcome to Waikiki,Bad examples maybe? I found your post interesting so looked them up. Ftettm is on hulu or foxtel here in Aus. Taken and cocoon are for sale on DVD from Amazon.
Welcome to Waikiki,I'm still annoyed I can't stream or buy Breaking Bonaduce anywhere
Welcome to Waikiki,"Yeah I remember the annual news cycle of which shows networks picked up for another season, which are getting canceled, and what new pilots are on the docket, back when I used to tune into series on ABC/NBC/Fox/CBS as they aired, and way before streaming was a thing. 

One of the most memorable ones is when NBC didn't pickup Law & Order when it was on the brink of hitting a seasons # record, and Dick Wolf was peeved about it."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Yeah, that's the point, we HATED it the other way. It's one thing when TV only had a certain amount of broadcast hours, when we can call up any show we think of but the studio is like ""no lol we decided deleting it made us more money"" that feels worse. Calling it the worst part of the streaming Era is a little odd since the trend only started in earnest last year though"
Welcome to Waikiki,"Also, I’m not sure about other people but I never had the ability to go and buy the DVD of every movie I wanted to watch (I was a child). I had to make do with what was on TV and which DVDs we already had, or if it was a Friday, visit blockbuster and *rent* the movie. It’s the same thing."
Welcome to Waikiki,"Maybe I've been lucky and most tv series from the 90's and 00's have been available on dvd.

Wanted to re-watch a few series that only ended in the last five years and they are no where to be found because the primary streaming service removed them from their library."
Welcome to Waikiki,"There was a minimum episode count in order to enter syndication. So if a show was cancelled before it hit that number of episodes, it just went away. More shows met that fate than went to syndication. And it's typically the ones that enter syndication that are the ones we remember the most. (and as such got home video release and eventually streaming)"
Welcome to Waikiki,Or the rights are eternally damned like Tales from the Crypt. Many of us would snap up a full Blu-ray set but we can’t.
Welcome to Waikiki,">Was there an era where this wasn't the case for TV? Plenty of TV shows would disappear and then that was it, you'd never see it again.

In that era though, you missed the timeslot, you missed the episode entirely. Different expectations altogether."
Welcome to Waikiki,Firefly... Arrested development. There were horribly canceled early and mismanaged shows. At least by Fox. It's why HBO stood so tall.
Welcome to Waikiki,They just write it off!
Welcome to Waikiki,"Yeah, you wind up with a bunch of half finished shows that no one is going to want to watch.

The current Netflix model sucks. If you don't tune in the very first week, then the show isn't popular and it won't be renewed. If you tune in the very first week, you'd better hope the show is popular and it doesn't get cancelled.

I know there were three Netflix shows I enjoyed this year and they didn't get renewed. I am that much more reluctant to start a new show. Meanwhile I am enjoying the heck out of Banshee, a Cinemax original that I had missed 10 years ago."
Welcome to Waikiki,To be fair this is only really a problem with Netflix.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Loved that show and all the characters.   Definitely a must watch!
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"> “You’ve got a lot of love in you. More than anybody I ever met. It’s bursting out of you. You take in the world in these big gulps and you can’t help but to let yourself get drowned in it. It overwhelms you and makes you live like you’re ready to explode at any minute. They don’t see it. I do. It’s a burden you carry.”

Aaaaaaaaaaaaanddddd I heard it in his voice again.

Halt and Catch Fire is A GEM."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Towards the end of the show, I went back to watch the first episode and damn, the feel of the first season was so completely removed from the last. It was like an entirely different show, with different characters and plotlines. Seeing them grow over multiple seasons was amazing. 

Also, the last episode ended with the same line as the first episode started. That might be my favourite thing about this show."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Watched the first season and loved the history of the tech industry. But I never returned. Is it worth going back to?
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"You know, I opened this expecting it to be yet another two sentence post about how good the show is with little else. Glad you took the time to explain the specifics of what you liked and how it related to your life.

I will echo the fourth point you made. What was amazing about the show for me was each of the main characters had points where they were likable and unlikable. I started the series hating Gordon, he was a drunk who had fits of rage in S1. By the end of the series, he was the rock of the core characters. Conversely, Donna started as someone to root for until she made the moves she did in S3 and became somewhat of an antagonist for S4. It made the characters feel real.

I wish there were more shows that tackled this era."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"One of my absolute favorite shows. Currently slowly watching through it again myself. Just started season 4. 

It’s close to perfection for me."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,I literally just finished watching it now (about 40 minutes ago). One of the best shows I have ever seen.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I haven't been able to watch the last episode. I'm not sure why. Those characters were very real to me somehow. It hit me very hard when Gordan died. 

Ugh, I don't even like thinking about it now."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"This is so weird to me. I watched this show as it aired from the first episode all the way to the end.  I never talked with anyone about this show because literally every time I brought it up in conversations, nobody had even heard of it.

So glad it’s finally getting the attention it deserves. Might be time for a rewatch!"
Beyblade Burst Evolution,its a very under rated show. I ended up loving it as well
Beyblade Burst Evolution,[removed]
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Saw this few years ago, and absolutely loved it! I started watching it because of the tech hook, but was impressed on how it was so much more than that. Every season was essentially about an era in computers which is so interesting to follow, but they layer with such intrinsic character development that you realize that you cannot root for anyone, or hate anyone."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Loved the opening theme in the last few years!
Beyblade Burst Evolution,kind of forgot about it after season 2 and not sure if I should continue again because I can't remember anything about the current character situations anymore
Beyblade Burst Evolution,I really didn't care for the last season. Also every season became very predictable because it ran the same formula just different people as A B and C.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I don't know, I liked it until season 4 when I realized it was all about knocking the men down and going full on girl power. Donna is the most unlikeable character in the history of television. And Joe becomes a teacher? This is so unlikely it destroyed all realism in the show."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I am trying to think of the shows that left me with this much satisfaction.  Breaking Bad was right up there with Halt and Catch Fire for sure.  After that, things get a bit murky.  So many shows like Jessica Jones and Longmire ended well, but they were not as good."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Bos was by far my favorite character, he was just too lovable"
Beyblade Burst Evolution,This is a great point. I didn't catch that until you mentioned it.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I thought the first season was good, but every season after that becomes better and better.  So yes, its worth coming back to and you don't have to rewatch season one to come back."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Yes.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Yes. I enjoyed the first two seasons, but three and four pushed it in to greatness."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"The first season is good, the later seasons even better...especially once Cameron and Donna are given far more to do."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Yeah same. It felt like a Mad Men clone that wasn't as good or as compelling as it.  I did enjoy the setting but the characters weren't as interesting.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I'll be the first to say it, probably not if you have other shows you've been wanting to get to. Seasons 2-4 are kind of just repeating many of the same themes and situations of S1. I really liked the show, but I think S1 encapsulates the show as a whole well enough that if you stopped you wouldn't miss a ton.

Before I get downvoted into oblivion...I really enjoyed the show and would recommend it overall, but I'm not in the same camp as everyone and think the S1 was heads and shoulders better than the other 3 seasons. It just felt more natural and planned out evenly."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Absolutely worth watching. IMHO it does character drama better than Mad Men did.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"First was my least favorite, the show honestly just gets better and better. The tech progresses and is still crucial to the plot, but the characters get much more involved."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I think because I work in technology is the reason why this show resonated with me so much.  The constant change and the evolution of the characters through four seasons and many years was great to see.  It really did align with my experience in IT.  When I started work in technology back in 1993, I was a helpdesk guy.  Then I moved into a supervisory role in helpdesk which morphed into a network admin job.  One of my most memorable roles was an infrastructure manager role after that for 6 years.  I moved into a IT manager and Director role after that and stayed in management for 10 years.  Now I am a consultant focused on security for the last 6 years.

I look back at everything I have done and when I saw these characters working on projects ranging from building a portable computer to building a web search page, I see the same evolution that I went through as a tech professional.  The best part of what I liked is that they loved the work.  Just like I have loved the work that I have done for the last 25+ years.

I know I just finished this series, but right now I think very highly of it and I am sad that it is over.  I haven't felt this way since I saw Breaking Bad.  That show didn't have as close of a personal touch with me though, but it still left a lasting impression."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Most of the best memories of the show happened in season four.  Probably because it was so well written.  When I had to think of all the memories of seasons one through three, it was a bit harder to come up with ideas.  Season four just left a very lasting impression upon me that will not go away anytime soon."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,OMG!  I forgot about this line.  What a great one.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I didn't see it as knocking men down.  The women in the show had nowhere to go but up.  Donna was an overworked wife who rose to prominence through the show.  Cameron started as a student who was in college and came in on the ground floor to show off that she was a prodigy.  In the meantime, Joe was very successful at IBM, and with Gordon's help, they excelled at Cardiff.  They went from project to project finding success as time went on. 

I also didn't find it ironic that Joe became a teacher.  Maybe it is because I find myself joining higher education when I reach a certain age and no longer want to push myself technically."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,">  you don't have to rewatch season one to come back.

Should I though, for max enjoyment? Been quite a long while since I watched that first season."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,I think the characters are far more interesting than Mad Men.  You really need to watch it through though.  It's a show about relationships; the tech background is just that - background.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Joe becoming a teacher is the perfect culmination of his arc. His entire business life was built around taking something from someone else and making it his own. When he realized he did the same thing to Haley, it broke him. Teaching is his way to make amends, giving of himself to help the new generation."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,[removed]
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"yes - i had watched S1 a while ago when i went to catch up with the entire series, so i started from the beginning again and i was so glad i did!"
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Its up to you.  I enjoyed the first season a lot, but each season after that got better and better.  Maybe reddit while you watch?  That way you pick up the high level things?"
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Yeah, like most TV drama settings. The main character was just such a forced example of ""tortured genius"" I'd seen, he wasn't anywhere near as compelling as Don Draper, and the writing for him in the first season was very poor in parts. The show was a struggle to get through the first season, it wasn't completely without merits or interesting parts and the acting was good, but it didn't give me enough reason to commit to watching 3 season more of it."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,Not only that but they were both two extremely flawed characters all along the way. Both were arguably way more fucked up than both Gordon and even Joe who were both somewhat self aware at least. So getting to where they ended up was sort of a cathartic.
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"I'll do that then, thanks."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"Just finished the series, really enjoyed it."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,"everything shifts from that focus, though, once S2 gets going, so you might want to give it another chance..."
Beyblade Burst Evolution,The characters change quite a bit throughout each season of the show. It's definitely worth watching if you're into these sorts of shows as it only gets better as it continues on which is a rare thing.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Kal Penn worked in the White House for the Obama administration for a couple of years, so he did have an ""in"" to help land this interview.

It's always been funny to me that we live in a timeline where someone could take a leave from a position in a sitting President's administration to go film *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas*."
Interviews With Monster Girls,Would love to see Joe on Between two Ferns personally
Interviews With Monster Girls,Kal penn is a safe host for biden. I dont imagine theyd want hasan minhaj there asking real questions or marlon wayans there just inevitably making biden say something weird about black people. Kal can just guide him into not saying anything too dumb
Interviews With Monster Girls,I enjoyed Kal Penn on Designated Survivor.
Interviews With Monster Girls,hope they announce a permanent host soon!
Interviews With Monster Girls,And here comes the softball questions.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Thank God it isn’t Korn Pop. That dudes bad
Interviews With Monster Girls,It’s only comedy show when it is convenient. It’s easy to see the double standard here.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Life imitating art
Interviews With Monster Girls,Buncha softball BS PR stunt. Not worth watching.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"curious to see how Penn does on the daily show...he def has the political knowledge, but his comedy output is def more on the cheesy/corny side (i might also be biased, the only thing ive seen him in recently is that santa clause disney plus show lol, where he is a complete ham)"
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Voted for the guy, but I really hope this isn't just Kal sucking up to him. They should take him to task on screwing over the railroad union."
Interviews With Monster Girls,Bunch of softball questions with a random impassioned and amazingly ignorant rant about taking away guns.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Climate change the hot topic? Not out of control housing costs?  Food costs? CoL in general?
Interviews With Monster Girls,Nothing but softball questions and compliments. Not even surprising. I guess you have to get a Republican on there for there to be a real interview.
Interviews With Monster Girls,I’m sure some tough questions will be asked
Interviews With Monster Girls,I’m sure that only the toughest questions will be asked!
Interviews With Monster Girls,What a schmooze fest that’s going to be.
Interviews With Monster Girls,I hope they go with Sarah Silverman. She’s already politically inclined. Tried to do a similar thing with that America series. And Fox already hates her.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"I kind of like this rotating host system they have going on. That said, if they do make the change to 1 permanent host, it needs to be Hasan Minhaj."
Interviews With Monster Girls,So it's more of a reelection campaign commercial with The Daily Show label.
Interviews With Monster Girls,“Lands”. As though it wasn’t all strategically planned.
Interviews With Monster Girls,pointless to interview any President when the interviewer is a puppet for the administration
Interviews With Monster Girls,The one interview for the year. Won’t see him again after this.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Great score. Really happy to see this.
Interviews With Monster Girls,who wants to take bets on the youtube vote ratio
Interviews With Monster Girls,Daily Show ain't what it used to be for sure
Interviews With Monster Girls,"So wild to me how much of a big deal it is to get an interview with the President in the USA, in my country (Australia) the Prime Minister has to do an interview everyday, and generally does more than that, and pretty much every question why are you so shit, and they just have to laugh it off every single day"
Interviews With Monster Girls,TIL Kal Penn is hosting The Daily Show
Interviews With Monster Girls,Didn’t Kal Penn also serve under the Obama Administration?
Interviews With Monster Girls,Don’t even need to watch this to know all the questions are going to be softballs.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Oh the propaganda channel got the interview? How unexpected
Interviews With Monster Girls,Absolutely riveting.  I’m sure it will smash records.
Interviews With Monster Girls,I'm shocked a democrat would risk going on this show.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"“This is a job I want, I want people to know I want this job”

I see you Kal. I was pulling for Hasan but his guest host week didn’t really blow me away. I think he’d need to switch the shows format up a bit more so he can be more dynamic like Patriot Act. Looking forward to what Kal has up his sleeve"
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Well, don’t expect any harder hitting question than “what is your morning routine?”"
Interviews With Monster Girls,Kal Penn is such a hack. He hasn't been interesting since Harold and Kumar.
Interviews With Monster Girls,He's a friendly.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Imagine if we had Hasan Minhaj. He would have went straight for the jugular instead of h to see softball questions. Hope he gets the full time gig.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"The whole interview is unwatchable, gladly I only saw a few clips to see how bad it was. Kal Penn sitting there like he's learning something new or amazed at his statements was laughable. 

Kal's job in Obama admin was a joke of a title, look it up."
Interviews With Monster Girls,don’t forget he left House M.D. for the White House gig.
Interviews With Monster Girls,I watched the first season of Designated Survivor. Pretty cool he actually had real world experience for that role.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"> where someone could take a leave from a position in a sitting President's administration to go film *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas*.

And bless them for letting him"
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Guy took administrative leave from the white house to get filmed getting his dick stuck to an icy pole

Honestly I just respect the grind."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Wow I did not know he took a leave to go film that. More power to this guy, he’s always been a wholesome dude from what I can tell. Looking forward to the interview."
Interviews With Monster Girls,Kumar cutting his pubes with Harold's scissors to making his way all the way to the white house. Kal has an interesting career.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Especially when the person is incredibly well rounded, intelligent, and charismatic, rather than a disgrace lol."
Interviews With Monster Girls,A competitor between Zach and Joe to see who can invade the others' personal space the most
Interviews With Monster Girls,Hasan really took the Shark Tank guy to task over FTX. I hope they go with him as the new host cause that's a tough act to beat.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Kal Penn worked in the Obama White House, he probably has a hand in setting it up. And how can you call him ‘safe’ when we’ve not even seen him host?"
Interviews With Monster Girls,I love Biden and voted for him but he can be too candid at times. Personally I think it is part of his charm but people have used it against him in the past. I'm not sure Kal Penn will 100% prevent that but he couldn't hurt.
Interviews With Monster Girls,They're planning on doing this until the fall so I wouldn't expect an announcement until the summer.
Interviews With Monster Girls,It’ll be Roy Wood Jr and Mayim Bialik splitting the hosting duties
Interviews With Monster Girls,I’m fully expecting Roy Wood Jr. to be the permanent host.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Well, I believe Biden has until 2024 at least."
Interviews With Monster Girls,Would want to see more Wanda Sykes tbh.
Interviews With Monster Girls,It's the Daily Show are you expecting journalism?
Interviews With Monster Girls,[deleted]
Interviews With Monster Girls,And why are you expecting hard hitting questions from the Daily Show?!
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Yeah, its only worth watch if they have a Republican on. That's the only time they ask the hard questions."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Softball questions or not, focusing a portion of the interview on LGBT rights was good for the country, good for the program, good for Kal Penn, and good for Biden and Democrats."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"If it were Jon Stewart’s new show, he’d grill tf out of him. That show is excellent"
Interviews With Monster Girls,I don't think Biden knows much about softball... but I wonder if he'd be able to make contact against someone like Jenny Finch.. I'm guessing no. But I guess that's why we ask these questions.
Interviews With Monster Girls,they've been playing that game for a long time
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Yeah I hope the actor who used to work for Biden when he was VP does a good job taking him to task on the Comedy Central TV show, too"
Interviews With Monster Girls,You'll see harder pitches at tee-ball games.
Interviews With Monster Girls,It’s the daily show dude. It’s a comedy show.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"brave of you to admit that at this point.  most qualify it with an 'i really wanted ______'.  if you say Bernie, you'll get reddit karma btw."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Why lol, it’s basically a comedy show. It will be as tough as Fox “News” questioning a republican.

Both are „entertainment” channels."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"I think the Hulu series ended after one season because she didn’t want to continue. I might be wrong. If I’m right, that indicates to me that she doesn’t want to spend most of her time on something like this. 

But I hope I’m wrong; she was great."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"She has been my favorite so far. Leslie Jones was great, too. Did not like Marlon Wayans or DL Hughley. Any others would be good imo."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"I liked that show, but it was around the time when there was like a dozen political comedy shows, they’re mostly all gone now though"
Interviews With Monster Girls,I feel bad because Kal Penn is great and deserving of his own show--but not The Daily Show. I think Hasan comes the closest to Jon Stewart and his energy.
Interviews With Monster Girls,People aren't puppets because they disagree with you.
Interviews With Monster Girls,This show airs on Comedy Central. It’s not journalism.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Yep as Obama Administration's ""Principal Associate Editor for Public Engagement"" before going on to play a similar role in 2016 on the TV-Drama 'Designated Survivor'

 So really just a soft-ball interview by a familiar friend of the Administration handed to the Daily Show to be spoon fed *erm* I mean aired to their audience."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"I think it was rather sudden departure too, was he the character that the writers Unalived himself?"
Interviews With Monster Girls,He also helped Lex Luthor try to kill Superman.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Holy shit it's thingy form House!!
Interviews With Monster Girls,[removed]
Interviews With Monster Girls,Same. Seeing him as a host made me remember how good he was on Patriot Act… it’s a shame that got canceled.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Agreed, thought it was awesome too. I actually thought the shark tank guy was pretty impressive too, he rolled with the interview and actually looked like he enjoyed the back and forth. Maybe an act but he did good getting his point across too."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Hasan is 100% John Stewart's spiritual successor. He's great and is only going to improve with age.

John Stewart was 33 when he took over The Daily Show and it took him a while to find his groove.

Hasan is 37 now and very much hitting his stride.

Hasan could bring back The Daily Show in a big way."
Interviews With Monster Girls,They won't. The corporate overlords will want someone safe.
Interviews With Monster Girls,Yea agreed he’s exactly what the show should be but also a liability to interview biden on a temporary contract
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Because to reddit, anyone who isn't an angry, extreme liberal who's going to blatantly attack anything that isn't left enough for them is ""too safe"" while they reframe TDS as a hard hitting liberal circle jerk session instead of.. a comedy show.

Basically they want Hassan Minaj screaming about how Republicans are Nazis and anything less is ""too safe"""
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Shot:

>Kal Penn worked in the Obama White House

Chaser:

>And how can you call him 'safe'"
Interviews With Monster Girls,How often do you think they call Jon Stewart and offer him more money?
Interviews With Monster Girls,Has Al Franken been on yet? He and Silverman were the only 2 I was interested in.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Not OP, but when I watched the daily show with John Stewart, whenever they interviewed politicians, local or otherwise, they usually either gave them awkward questions, or (more likely) edited the interview to make the politician look a little foolish or out of touch.

As you say, people watch the Daily show for entertainment, this feels like little more than pandering and trying to make Biden 'connect' with the younger voters. Not expecting much from the interview and I doubt they do anything that will make Biden look silly."
Interviews With Monster Girls,"I wish I could expect it to be non partisan 

Think they would toss a republican softballs?"
Interviews With Monster Girls,They seem interested in real journalism when it's something targeting conservatives.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Nahhhh, this sub can’t have it both ways. You all talk about Daily Show and John Oliver being team journalism but then, if any criticism comes up, you immediately revert back to “it’s just a comedy show”.

Edit: downvotes prove I’ve hit a sensitive spot"
Interviews With Monster Girls,reddit moment
Interviews With Monster Girls,"Before the 24 hour news cycle blew up, news became partisan, and networks needed to play ball to retain access to political figures, journalists would regularly challenge any and all political figures. 

So yeah, back to THOSE good old days when the FCC fairness doctrine was still in place.

EDIT - But to be fair, The Daily Show couldn't exist with the fairness doctrine in place. Or would have to be more directly a parody."
Interviews With Monster Girls,When was the last time Biden did an interview with a non allied interviewer?
Interviews With Monster Girls,If you’re talking about Trump then I would say that Biden isn’t that much better.
Interviews With Monster Girls,"If Daily Show are going to invite politicians they should at least try to ask tough questions rather than kissing their asses.

If not then don’t invite them."

Voice,"When someone inevitably comments “*Who wanted this?*”

It is I. I wanted a Flintstones animated reboot. 

Jetsons next, please, though that is overdue for its live action treatment that’s been collecting dust in Hollywood for ages."
Voice,"Sounds like an interesting concept. I'll check it out. I hope the art style is similar to the original style and not some unique off putting hybrid. 

>Joe Lo Truglio as Barney

I'm sold."
Voice,Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is absolutely perfect casting
Voice,Wasn't Seth MacFarlane trying to develop a Flintstones reboot at one point?
Voice,Stephen Root is amazing.
Voice,Is this based on the comic where [Yabababadoo](https://loginportal.funnyjunk.com/comments/I+greatly+enjoyed+the+flintstones+comic+_3630d2d2c835f69a58fe8575740d3a76.jpg) is a nonsense phrase to help veterans deal with trama from the war?
Voice,Amy Sedaris is a national treasure. I will watch anything she is a part of.
Voice,"Whether this turns out to be good or not, if you are a Flintstones fan, you absolutely owe it to yourself to read the DC comic by Steve Pugh!

It's such a truly fantastic retelling of the story and creates a very nuanced and much more interesting Bedrock."
Voice,"I hope they take inspiration from the recent Flintstones Comics, which really delved into modern issues as reflected in the weird Paleolithic pastiche of The Flintstones universe. [Like Fred's pals Adam and Steve.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1sb55) 

[Or this infamous panel.](https://external-preview.redd.it/XahAdnM9U9vhLUmGkHlK3IRQw3jDzOlfSVl31KuVzyU.jpg?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2449c02c1798f8941b05266f8386e7fe515a9aa) 

It's a fantastic satire."
Voice,Hire Mark Russell!! His 12 issue comic series on them is GOLD!
Voice,Elizabeth Banks and Manny Jacinto as the adult pebbles and bambam makes so much sense in a way I really can't explain.
Voice,Alright. This sounds really cool.
Voice,Of wow it’s happening. Last time I heard of a flinstones reboot it was sarah underwood on attack of the show on G4 announced that Seth MacFarlane was going to run it. Then right after that Kevin Pereira made a fun adult comment that went over my too young boy brain.
Voice,"Hope it takes some inspiration from the 2010s DC Comics reimagining of the Flintstones, which I recommend people check out."
Voice,Yo that cast looks bonkers! Bortles!
Voice,This is something I didn't realize I wanted until I read about it LOL
Voice,"> Manny Jacinto as Bamm-Bamm.

Dope."
Voice,Now I've got that Ram Jam song in my head.
Voice,Wow that’s a pretty talented/funny lineup behind the voices
Voice,"I have nothing against it personally, but why is it okay for other races to be cast for a white role (disclaimer: I’m not white), but when a white person plays a non-white role (like the Simpsons cast, for example) people are “offended”?"
Voice,Seth McFarlane had this reboot ready to go and they shelved it at the very last second.
Voice,I really hope there is some Boyle Boys' love between Fred and Barney.
Voice,"I smell another ""Velma""."
Voice,Didn’t  Seth MacFarlane work on this for years?
Voice,"let me guess, Fred and Barney are dumbasses and Wilma is the real empowered deal"
Voice,Predictions on who is gay? I’m going with bam bam.
Voice,Ok this is what we need
Voice,I was wondering if anyone would revisit this property soon and here we are. Interested to see how it turns out.
Voice,“Idk cast the latino as bam bam”
Voice,More trash 🤮🤢
Voice,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAqlx_9lv0
Voice,Of course Wilma is voiced by a black woman.
Voice,Just please don't Velma it.
Voice,I hope this doesn't replace The Great North.
Voice,"is it going to have horrible modern flash animation


also nicole byer so totally does not seem like Betty at all"
Voice,[removed]
Voice,How?
Voice,"This is going to be another Velma, right?"
Voice,You had me at Lynn and Charles Boyle as Fred and Barney.
Voice,This is still a thing?  I assumed this had died years ago.
Voice,I remember Seth MacFarlane wanted to be involved in this.  Almost Sade he isn't.
Voice,"If you want to do an adult oriented (Bit of a misnomer since the cartoon was Primetime in the 60s) Flintstones, they should go with the comic DC put out a few years ago."
Voice,You know I'm kind of interested in the premise. A technological shift from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age? I dunno that sounds like an interesting jump start.
Voice,"Solid as hell cast there.

 Now they just need to toss in Paul reubens as the great gazoo."
Voice,So is this before Bamm bamm and pebbles had a kid?
Voice,Were the bronze and stone ages only 20 years apart? 😜
Voice,You had me at Amy Sedaris.
Voice,Holy shit Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is an awesome casting choice.
Voice,Stephen root as Fred is an instant sold for me
Voice,I want a continuation of the Harvey Birdman Flintstones.
Voice,"I’m honestly surprised how long it’s taken for a true to form reboot. This premise looks interesting, but just making a modern take on the original feels like a nobrainer. It’s not like sitcoms ever went out of style."
Voice,"Jetsons would be cool, that 60s retrofuturism and so on... I know people have this head canon of them being in the sky and the earth being a dead zone beneath.  I think that's a bit too much, but I like the idea of other cities being the future as envisioned by other decades.  So we have an 80s cyberpunk city, a 30s deco city like Metropolis, a Y2K silver/aqua fluid organic type of city, etc..."
Voice,"Also, Seth MacFarlane. He's talked about it a lot, and I'm guessing he's sad he's not involved with this"
Voice,We need Danny Devito as Mr Spacely.
Voice,They’ve been trying to make this for a long time. It was attached to Seth Macfarlane. I think he used to talk about it in interviews.
Voice,"They need to make a live action Jetsons ASAP, while Danny DeVito is still around to play Mr. Spacely."
Voice,"""Who wanted this?"" is the dumbest (whatever it's called... *trope statement*?) that has ever existed.

Are creators supposed to poll everyone before they create? Fuck off

The most awarded movie in cinema history,  EEAAOA... did anybody want that?"
Voice,"There are a lot of shows you can justifiably ask, ""Why?"" This is not one of them."
Voice,"Yeah, but one true to the original, no?  Or what are you hoping for?"
Voice,"This appears not to be a reboot, but a sequel."
Voice,"Joe Lo Truglio and Nicole Byer being Barney and Betty is inspired. And manny jacinto as their son?

Cue the vince mcmahon meme"
Voice,"""Every time I have a problem I hit it with a club and scream out my own name and just like that I have a new problem."""
Voice,"Oh man, Bam Bam figured it out? This is a new low."
Voice,Oh dear heavens it's Jason.
Voice,"""BORTLES-BORTLES!"""
Voice,"yes, amazing casting"
Voice,Very inspired casting.
Voice,"Apparently part of the reason it didn’t pan out was because he couldn’t figure out how to distinguish Fred from Peter Griffin. Not that he *wanted* them to be similar, he genuinely didn’t seem to know Fred acts nothing like Peter to begin with. That should tell you everything."
Voice,"That fizzled out about a decade ago.

He doesn't seem interested in making animated sitcoms anymore."
Voice,Thankfully that didn't work out. Don't think we need the Flintstones with rape jokes.
Voice,Yes
Voice,"The link is broken, but I don't believe it's based on the recent satire series."
Voice,"Have you, by chance, seen [The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drunk_and_On_Drugs_Happy_Funtime_Hour)"
Voice,Exit Stage Left the Snaglepuss Story is also a phenomenal examination of McCarthism and its effects on the theater industry and I'm not even joking
Voice,What an odd tone. Is there comedy in between or is it just straight up serious/dramatic the entire time?
Voice,"I've been reading the series recently and it's been fantastic. Really good satire about everything from capitalism, consumerism to PTSD. Highly recommend."
Voice,">Homo Erectus

Brilliant."
Voice,Literally only clicked this thread to see if someone mentioned the comic. Great little series.
Voice,"The issue that most people have isn’t that voice actors can only voice characters that are the same race as they are. The issue is that in an industry that is predominantly white, even the few POC roles that exist often go to white actors."
Voice,Isn’t it for a voice role?
Voice,because white people bad
Voice,Because white actors aren’t underrepresented in media. Now can people stop asking this question?
Voice,"I'm still wondering why if a character is biracial, it's not okay for a whole white person to play the part, but it IS okay for a whole black person to play the part."
Voice,That was my first thought too. Like isn’t this supposed to be racist now?
Voice,"The secret is no one really cares about that either. Most of it has been voice actors voluntarily stepping down. 

I dont think just about any regular person cares."
Voice,I mean that would be just like the original...
Voice,"So, The Flintstones then."
Voice,"Too easy. Actually it will be revealed that Barney and Fred were, uh, more than friends all this time."
Voice,"It's one thing to be racist, and another to be so racist you can't tell the difference between latinos and someone who's chinese-fillipino."
Voice,Jfc y'all can't even get your fake outrage right.
Voice,"Yea that’s actually a solid spin on the original. Turn Fred & Wilma into Boomers who don’t get new tech.

What do you mean you drive without feet now?"
Voice,"Relevant

Voice,The Great Gazoo is honestly not even one of the top 10 stupidest things on the original show. Everyone just ignores that there's a Bewitched crossover in it for no apparent reason.
Voice,oh hell yes I need Pee-Wee Herman as Great Gazoo
Voice,"""Don't do that. Don't make me hope"""
Voice,"They were 0 years apart.

But the Bronze Age was not 20 years away from the dinosaurs."
Voice,"No, but they also didn't celebrate Christmas and have talking elephant vacuum cleaners during the stone age."
Voice,"I mean it depends what you mean, parts of the Neolithic age was technically.

Of course due to lack of safe travel in those days and scarcity of resources, you could cross from the stone age into the bronze age and back again, over a span of maybe two hundred miles."
Voice,Your dead to me can opener!
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Good lord, this turned me from someone who didn’t care at all about the whole mythos into an ardent follower.

Turns out imperialism and magical girls is the secret treat for me.

I want more Entrapta, is all."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Super gay. Love it. 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"In all honesty, I absolutely love this series.

I mean, I know it's made for kids, but it's a show with a great story, great characters, and beautiful dynamics, art and music.

It took an old cash-grab at the feminine audience and made it a proper cartoon.

It might also lead to a He-Man reboot, so, that's also amazing."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I've binged 11 episodes and I LOVE it. I'm 30 years old, by the way... 

I loved Avatar (The Last Airbender) and I think this definitely goes a way to filling the gap left. The humour, vocal talent, relationships, morals etc.

I can't wait to watch more :) "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"This was a really really good season! Can't wait for more!

&#x200B;

Seeing such a diverse cast and no over-sexualisation was so refreshing! "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Wow I watched it all in one sitting! It was better than I thought it would be.  Having Catra be more complex than just a simple bad guy was great, it shows great character development and I actually was rooting for the bad guys at a point (I think I still am?)"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I think this series is just okay, but *good lord*, the alt-right are going crazy over backlashing this series. I know the writing suffers from some tell don't show problems and the character designs aren't all that spectacular, but Jesus, to go as far using this as a dummy to attack the ""damn dirty libs""?!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I liked it overall. I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10.

Positives:

* Character design for She Ra and Catra is fantastic. The diversity is a really nice aspect as well. I love seeing something other than the ""copy+paste skinny white woman with high cheekbones"" approach to character design from the original show
* Catra has some really good potential as a villain
* The scorpian lady is a gem in every scene she's in
* Charming characters and a nice, positive vibe
* Good animation and nice art style overall
* Catra and Adora have a really good chemistry as former-friends-turned-enemies

Negatives:

* The characters make plot driven decisions instead of character driven ones (the Princess Alliance dissolving, Entraptra swapping sides (although the actual scenes of her with Catra/scorpian lady are really good, I just wish they'd given a better motivation for her switching sides). This is the show's biggest flaw in my opinion. It's hard to be as emotionally invested in a conflict that is cheaply manufactured 
* Lack of long-term plots and character arcs (most of the characters seem to have a lot of temporary drama that is brought up and solved within a single episode). it would be nice to see some more seeds planted for future drama
* Shadow Weaver was pretty pointless overall. Which is a shame because I thought the theme of her being an abusive 'parent' towards Catra and treating Adora as the golden child was a really interesting one and is one of the few long-term conflicts that I think the show sets up effectively. SW herself just wasn't that interesting and didn't seem to ever be a genuine threat.
* How quickly Adora abandons her former home. Star Wars had this problem too, with Finn. The whole soldier-defecting arc is really cool...and then 5 seconds later, they're mowing down members of the organization they spent their whole lives working for. Adora's previous group of friends (minus Catra) play an almost inconsequential role and she doesn't seem to care or think about them at all. She doesn't have any kind of stockholm syndrome or doubt where Shadow Weaver is concerned. She resolves her inner torment about leaving her whole life behind in a couple of episodes

Overall, the show has some really charming characters and a weak plot. Which makes it enjoyable and interesting but lacking in some departments. I'm excited to see what happens next season."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I’ve been really enjoying it. I don’t remember much from the original series, but I loved the jokes with Madame Razz talking about her friends being her broom and Loo-Kee, but he’s always hiding! 

Reminds me a lot of Last Airbender, and I think it has some clever problems for the character to solve and I like how they address the relationships. "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Honestly really enjoyed it, thought the art style was good and the voice actors were perfect (especially  Catra, Bow & Entrapta). I don’t understand the hate at all, and i’m excited for the next season!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I like that not every episode is solved by Adorra turning into She-Ra and saving the day. 

One episode actually has Adorra and She-Ra incapacitated and the others save the day. 


I quite like it so far. 

Seahawk and Bow are great."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Overall I really liked it. The characters have a lot of depth (though the villains get more growth and detail than most of the princesses). The only thing that really bugs me is that She-Ra is not as good a fighter as Adora. She moves slowly and pretty much stands straight up with her knees locked. Adora and Catra both move like they know how to kick butt (when they are fighting anyway) and Scorpia carries herself like a powerhouse when she’s not being a big goof. She-Ra is pretty static and passive in comparison. I get that the animators are trying to make things look like they are effortless for her, and that she is supposed to look like she’s posing for a statue a lot, but I think they overdid it, because it makes her seem much less dynamic. None of She-Ra’s action scenes play as well as Adora’s because of the rigidity. "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Saw three episodes and I love it!! Gives me a lot of Star Wars vibes mixed with magic lol. I like it’s an easy place to start from while having some callbacks to the first show at the same time. Can’t wait to watch more!

Catra is turning me into a furry RIP"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"The world felt really flat to me. For one, it never really felt like the hoard was a threat. They're talked about like they're basically the evil empire of the series, but outside of attacking some boarder territories, they don't seem to do much. They're mainly just chilling in their home realm, and the other kingdoms are pretty much alright on their own. They didn't really feel present for the most part. The kingdoms themselves are also pretty empty. You generally got a small location or a few buildings with a dozen or so people. Makes it hard to get invested or really see what they're fighting for. "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I liked it. The plot is kind of boring but the characters and their interactions are very good. I really like how the backgrounds look like they’re from a comic book, no surprise that the creator comes from comics. I love the variety in the character designs. I’ll watch future seasons, I hope the plot gets better.

I only wish they gave Swift Wind a ridiculous voice like in the original series, lol."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,[deleted]
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I just watched all of it. I loved every second.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Fun fact: this trailer has more frames of animation than a typical episode from the original series.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I like it, it’s cute. Liked the relationship between Adora and Catra especially.

It has filled the gap of something to watch together with my kid while we are waiting for the last season of Voltron. Appeals to kids but plenty enough to interest adult viewers too.

(I mean, it isn’t as good as Voltron of course, but I’ll give it a chance, it’s only just started!)

Also, side-note, I thought Adora / She-Ra was drawn as very pretty! I don’t get why people keep saying she’s ugly!

"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Oh my god this series is exceptional. The art style is lovely, the animation is consistently great (at its worst it could just do with being a bit more dynamic), the characters are all so endearing and compelling and distinct and have such fantastic design, and the GAYNESS HOLY SHIT

Like, we've got multiple queer background characters (via the prom), two minor characters who're explicitly queer (Netossa and Spinnerella), multiple characters who are implied to various degrees to be queer (Adora, Catra, Sea Hawk, Mermista, Scorpia, Perfuma, Kyle), and a goddamn **trans black dude who's strongly implied to be attracted to men** as a *main character*. And this is just Season 1. Lord in fucking heaven this show delivered when it comes to queer representation.

And, really, all its representation is exceptional. Characters of all body types and skin tones, in a cast dominated by superb female characters, with a handful of gorgeous male characters.

Everything about this show is charming, engaging, fun, emotional, all of the above, and freaking more. I love it so much. I cannot *wait* for the next season.

I also love Hordak's little demon-toddler/tape-recorder/Bakugo-cosplayer. And I'm pumped for them to eventually return Etheria to its original dimension, bringing in Eternia and with it, Adam and my boi SKELETOR.

Also Bow and ~~Zarya~~Scorpia and Kyle and Adora are my darlings and I love them with all my heart. Especially Kyle, that sweet, anxious, useless boy with his shock of fluffy blonde hair. And also especially Bow, who has just the absolute best facial expressions and is the absolute sweetest. Okay, maybe especially all of them. I love them all. This show is very good."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Saw a lot of parallels to ATLA so I'm excited to see where the series is headed. Catra redemption arc when??
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,i enjoyed the whole thing
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I like this show, and I would probably like it even more if I was 10 years old."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I'll just copy paste what I wrote on my tumblr.

This first season is... pretty much establishing the dynamic between all these characters, and the world in which they live in. As such, we don’t really get to know a bunch of the other Princesses and Sea Hawk outside of their designated debut episodes, and episode 9. After that, they pop up in the final battle of the season and that’s it. It’s kind of disappointing, but hey, we already know there’s gonna be 3 more seasons, so there’s plenty of time to get to know them all more, and from the time we’ve gotten to know them, they’re all great. My favorite is Mermista, her incredibly dry delivery brought out the biggest laughs out of me.

Speaking of the characters, these are really where the show really shines for me. The dynamic between Bow, Glimmer and Adora, were the single best part of the first season. These three work off of each other incredibly well, and the voice actors really knock it out of the park, especially Glimmer’s.

And... let’s talk about Catra and Adora. Holy shit. Catra and Adora’s relationship is basically the foundation of this show, and is easily the best part of it. The writing for these two is phenomenal, and episode 11 showcases their incredibly complicated past, and how it lead to their separation. I loved these two, and I’m really happy that their relationship is such an integral part of this show’s plot.

Speaking of which, that’s the show’s biggest problem for me. The pacing. It’s... kinda wonky. Granted, this gets ironed out later on the season, like I said before this season is pretty much all establishment, and as such, the pacing gets kinda slow at times, especially in the beginning episodes. But by episode 7, it gets ironed out, and the show really kicks into high gear and delivers some of the strongest writing I’ve seen out of a cartoon in a really long time.

So, that’s basically my thoughts on SPOP! A little bit of a bumpy first season, but it’s natural when it comes to a show like this. Noelle Stevenson and the team have created something special here, and I get the feeling it’s only gonna get better from here on out."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Okay so i've watched the first seven episodes or so of this, and was actually looking forward to it but i don't think i'll keep watching it. And I see a lot of praise for it, but so far its just been very bland to me. The only things this show has going for it are the good backgrounds and nice voice acting. But for the writing, I can't help but feel that everything happens in the least interesting way the writers could possibly think of, which is completely functional, but not at all engaging. The same could be said for the action scenes, sure i can tell what's going on, but it doesn't really feel impactful. Did anyone else feel like this? Does the show get better later on? "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Watched the first two episodes during lunch. Pretty good, probably more plot and character development in just those two than the entire Filmation series.

Best joke: ""I didn't know being a princess was *contagious*!"""
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Approaching this as a younger Masters of the Universe fan - 

Things I disliked ***(Spoilers):*** 

**1)** Hordak's Horde - It's not really a horde, just a bunch of stale goons in tacky green armor and a handful of robots that get jobbed immediately. There's no sense of threat from the enemy, they're as bland as can be.

Hordak, the scariest villain in the franchise, doesn't exactly have this realm in a steel-taloned vice. Relegating the representation of his forces to an ill-used cast of youngsters who only exist to get knocked over was really lame. 

The most success I've seen so far was a brief kidnap plan at a... Princess prom. 

Hordak himself is cool when he shows up. He *looks* like Hordak, sounds like a menacing Hordak - and I've been desperately believing his real horde is out razing the rest of Eternia off-screen. 

__The Shadow Weaver was useless.__ 

**2) Plot events are ham-fisted. 

She-Ra's change of allegiance at the beginning was pretty forced, considering she was bred and trained from birth to be a zealous fighter in Hordak's horde. All it took to sway a heavily indoctrinated soldier was some food and dancing? We didn't even see the village getting razed, it's like the horrific destruction was an afterthought. *(Does anyone else remember the skiff-riding Horde guys shooting at the trio once then literally just riding off?)*

Later interactions suffer from this too. 

'She-Ra went off to do something useful. Wow, how inspiring! Guess we'll all rally now that someone went off on a vague escapade! Flower power!' 

'The wacky tech-princess ran in and got herself killed despite She-Ra's warning about the doors. Turns out warmaking is dangerous and this adventure might have been lethal. Huh. Time to disband the gang!' 

'Hello wacky tech-princess. Your friends totally ditched you, want to turn evil?' 'Ok.' 

It's hard to tell who the plot is intended for. Kids aren't stupid. Shows in the past decade (Avatar, Batman TAS, Justice League (and JLU) , Gargoyles) had no problem taking their time to flesh a character's arc out, even if it took the entire episode - or three. Or just all throughout the season! What's wrong with proper depth?

**3)** Never really feels like a MotU show - Without the main character or antagonist names being dropped constantly there's not much else that I felt really nailed the MoTU aesthetic. None of the environments made me flush with nostalgia or were really all too recognizable to me. I understand this is probably to keep things rooted in the characters but my real point is none of the areas seemed to hold any real importance or emphasis, in stark contrast to prior iterations. Nothing was iconic. 

**4)** Inconsistent action - Most of the time I had little issue with the animations when the action got heavy, but I agree with what people have pointed out where the fights sometimes get reduced to one-shot frames. New Voltron did this a **ton**, it makes fights stale! 

To wrap up the complaints I'll cap it all with this: I understand this is mostly a light-hearted show with vibrant colors and whimsy, so Hordak maiming, killing, and burning across the land probably wasn't meant to be in emphasis here - but kid series in the past had no issue hinting at death or gruesome concepts. The 2002 MoTU struck the proper balance even if it got a bit formulaic. 

I dunno, I just prefer competent and threatening villains. The new Voltron suffered the same thing, after Season 2 I quit feeling any suspense because I knew no matter what the heroes would always win and the plot would bend itself out of shape just to make sure whatever scrape they got in was surmountable. This robbed it of any tension for me and I got bored. I don't like the thought of them doing this to Hordak or Skeletor, who had their moments and victories in the cartoons and comics.  

**What I did like:** 

**1)** Art - I thought the art-style was charming and didn't mind the simpler aesthetic. It's probably a lot quicker to draw. 

**2)** Tone - The cheeriness between the main three characters was contagious, and some of the humorous snippets had me chuckle. Not all of it, but enough for the show to seem witty sometimes. 

**3)** She-Ra and Hordak - I know I just spent a few paragraphs ragging on the incompetent / barely existent threat of Hordak's horde - but Hordak himself is cool looking and scary sounding. They *nailed* Hordak - I just hope he gets scarier and more intense. 

She-Ra the character is fun to watch, for me. Not too peppy. Not naturally good at everything or cripplingly incompetent like some cartoon antagonists. Really, her backstory seems well utilized. She's a trained cadet who was taught to hit things first and use words after - and she applies this *to everything*, sometimes to her detriment. I appreciate that flaw. 

None of the other heroes annoyed me either. I hate characters like Orko, or Snarf. The absence of that character template are a relief. 


Ultimately I'm sitting in the middle between liking the show or deciding it's pretty, charming, but ultimately just filler. I'll watch Season 2, assuming they succeed in making it. I just hope they give us some honest villains and make proper use of Hordak. 

In all likelihood I'm probably going to be left wanting for my gritty MoTU reboot I'll never get to see. Something in the vein of CN's cancelled Thundercats from several years ago. Maybe if they reboot He-Man?"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Since the previous thread seems to have been deleted: 

I'm 1.5 episodes in, and enjoying it. The animation is decent, the character design updates are great, the backgrounds look really good. The voice acting has been excellent. So far, there have effectively only been six characters introduced, and the show is doing a very good job defining them and their relationships with each other. The humor is nice; lines like ""You're... GROUNDED!"" and ""I just touched the sword and suddenly I was wearing a tiara"" (I may have the lines slightly wrong) are delivered with great tone and comic timing. 

It reminds me a little of A:TLA in that it's a show clearly aimed at an early teen audience that I think holds up fairly well for older viewers. "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"The only a few eps in and was expecting not to like it, but it is much better than I thought. I just wish, and this goes for Voltron too, there were more callbacks to the original theme music. Both had epic themes even of the rest of the shows don't hold up as well"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Seen three episodes and I liked it. Not the best of Netflix animation, but still a good show.

I specially love the schizo tech look of the world.

My biggest problems would be that in some parts it looks a little bit cheap (the majority of the time looks good, tho) and that some dialogue is a bit cheesy."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I love this show. Great characters. I like the art. I really like how both heroes and villains have character and they’re all likeable. I wasn’t expecting to like it, but this is definitely good. Kind of has a similar feel to Steven Universe. It’s like a mix of Steven Universe and He-Man. The only thing I noticed is that the animation gets worse as the series goes on. Like their budget dropped a bunch after the first few episodes."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Art design is nice, character design and overall plot is good, voice actors are good...

But it's not quite ""mature"" enough even for a kids show. It feels like it's shooting for Avatar and landing on Disney Kids. And when I say that, I don't even mean Ben10. "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Q: is Bow wearing a hat, or is it a hair fade?"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Really good stuff to start, i agree with a lot of the praise it’s been given. However, they need to aim for a more mature target demographic in my opinion. The stakes need to be higher to really sell it. Think like Batman The Animated Series tier. Serious cartoon for kids and adults. If they can find a way to get in that space, theyll be golden."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I've generally liked what I've seen so far. There's good humour and the writing h been strong so far.  I hate the character art though, it just doesn't sit well with me, but it hasn't been enough to drag my overall enjoyment of it down."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Eh, it's alright. I get that it's a kid show, but it still feels cheap in terms of how it's presented.

I do like the character development that went on in the three episodes I watched and I do like it more than I thought. Plot was pretty straightforward and there were more than the fair share of tropes, but, again, it's a show for children who probably haven't been exposed to those with as much frequency as I have. The voice acting is really great. 

The animation is nice, but feels very rigid and unpolished. There aren't as many frames as there should be for good movement, which is surprising considering the more simplistic art style. It's feels like a rushed product. Fight scenes have all been pretty lackluster and She-Ra is so stiff that I'm not comfortable considering those to be 'action' scenes.

The shading, or lack thereof, is especially jarring. For whatever reason, only the background art has any kind of depth to it and the characters and objects just feel like they're hovering on top of it all. Very disappointing that they just inserted one or two random shapes on skin and called it quits for the day.

Not really a fan of the theme song, feels a bit trite. I know, I know, it's a kids show, but the OT isn't even particularly catchy. When I was a child, the theme song was the thing that would get me really pumped up for every episode.

Anyhow, it's a pretty decent show. Not sure why there was so much outrage over it. Who cares how someone reinvented a character or two from a show that was a cash-grab in the 80's? I know damn well a majority of the people complaining probably didn't even watch the show because it was an 'only for girls' thing. He-Man had a good couple of reboots, let She-Ra get in on it too. Also, why is everyone saying that Adora is drawn badly? She looks perfectly fine, I really don't understand that."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,does singing He man has a cameo in  it?
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I'm most of the way through and really like it. The only minor downside I had were the voice choices of a few characters.   One was a surfer dude and the other a valley girl.  Every time they spoke it took me out of the show. Other than that the show is great. 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"It would be way better if every ep was like EP11, good soundtrack, good revelations and explanation for motivations, unexpected decisions (nothing is really that much unexpected in this show, mostly because of the age restriction in my opinion), i felt like a was watching avatar, but kinda not so good. I liked it, but it could be better if it were more serious or if they could find some more reasonable reasons for some characters, like Entrapta being suddenly bad, i mean, i now she is kinda dumb as character wise, but come on, there could be a better reason for her turning bad, or for they leaving her behind, like srsly? they didn't even tried, it would be cool to see Adora at least trying in a drive of rage or something..."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Downvote if you want, but I didn't like it at all.  Gave it 3 episodes.  The animation was lazy and cheap looking.  It looked like a youtube flash series with some seriously awkward moments that had me cringing.  I thought the character designs were god awful, and it comes across like this show is holding up a big sign saying ""look how progressive we are with our representation!!!"" to hide the crappy story, ugly character designs, and bad artwork.  I'm a 37 year old woman who watched the original and loved it.  The original is pretty bad, let's be fair, but I really hoped that even as ugly as they made She-Ra in this one, that I would still be pleasantly surprised with maybe the story or animation or whatever.  Very disappointed."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Entrapta is serious nuts. I really like her. 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I saw a twitter comment ""So all the political spectrum of She-Ra is Fascism, Monarchies, and a Communist horse""

I'm totally ok with that.
"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,>Its absolutely fantastic
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I just womder how they could do he man? I feel like even the suggestion would bring about the wrath of tumblr for not letting the female show stand individually 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I did too! Hopefully, they get a bigger budget for next season. I would love to see more cartoons like these. Voltron, Niko and the Sword of Light, Dragon Prince, Hilda they've all been great to watch. Hopefully, more people give this a chance to grow and to enjoy before complete bashing it."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Same, fam. It's been slow at my work with the holiday coming up, so I've watched it over the past two days. It has some seriously great heart. "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"45 year old, male, dad of two awesome kids, trying to convince my 13 yo daughter to watch She-ra. I totally loved it, and my 9yo son watched it with me. I want to see many more seasons on their own. All this First One's tech lore is really helping understand the purpose of all the extra power/magic - and I want to see it connect with He-Man."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"32 year old dude checking in, almost done binging the season!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,The episode where they're trapped together and had to relive their past friendship was so emotional. 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Really good points.

Though I do think that there is still time enough to explore more on the relationship with Shadow Weaver in the second season.

I would also expect a bit more stockholm syndrome though."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,It made me think of Avatar too! Bow reminded me alot of Sokka with his humor and propensity so cheesy group names
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Bow is the best, except for one moment when he abandons poor Kyle."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Seahawk is like the team pet.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I love seahawk
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"During the final fight against moon shine, it felt so empty. 50 hoard soldiers vs a  kingdom of...3 people and a queen + a few princesses. What happened to the guards? 

I overall enjoyed the show and loved Catra, but you're right about the world feeling very flat.
 "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I watched this moment over an over again, because it was so touching."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,What scene are you referring to here?
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"To be fair having better animation than OG She-Ra is not hard at all, Filmation shows were infamous for constantly using the same animation frames due to budget costraints."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Having more of something doesn't automatically make it better.  The older series (from what I've seen) has more detailed characters and more fleshed out character designs which helps sell the high fantasy atmosphere better, including grandoise of scale (there's a part in the 2nd episode where the three go into a supposedly abandoned relic from the originals but they never establish a sense of scale or atmosphere and design-wise it doesn't look any different architecture-wise from the typical buildings and sites the characters are used to).

  I think the lack of details is kind of really hurting the show's sense of scale in certain areas.  Also despite how vast the planet is it seems sparsely populated in the new series, and there's a lack of structure to certain things like Hordak's army, like we're supposed to infer these things exist instead of them being shown at their most opportune moments.  "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Yet still looks uglier just by virtue of god awful art and character design.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Wait bow is trans? Did I miss something 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I don’t recall Bow being trans but I’m convinced he’s bi. Also Seahawk. Cause no guy who looks like that can be totally straight.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,The animation itsel is pretty bad lol. Look at the faces and the facial movements better
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"  I thought this show was supposed to be for kids, so why are grown adults so hyped over the queer representation?  You really think little kids care about queer representation (let alone relationship and romance stuff at all, even heterosexual-wise) at THAT age?  :thinkingemote:

  Like, I can smell some fierce hypocrisy there, after all those same grown adults were telling adults with legitimate criticisms of the show and its marketing ""it's not FOR you!"".  :thinkingemotex2:

  ...I'll just leave it at that."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Especially when they put catra on the big metal boat with scorpia to capture she ra...felt really zuko-iroh ""avenge my honor"" to me!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I'm on board 100% to watch this show, but I'm dying to know if they hint at She-ra's backstory/Eternia/He-Man at all.

I don't expect it to be the She-Ra & He-Man Christmas special, but I'm hoping they tie that part of her story in at some point."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I found that episode 7 is right when it really started to pick up. 11 is definitely the high point.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"The show is very cute and I enjoyed it but I agree that the plot is very bland. 

You should at least watch the 8th episode. IMO it felt a lot stronger than most of the other episodes. Better plot, better drama, better character interactions, etc. Plus, everyone gets dressed up!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,So did you end up watching the rest?. If so how did you feel? 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,">I feel like the show is what it is.  It doesnt change tone or pace and its great.  Its for 8 yr olds.  if you accept that theres no need to hate it

&#x200B;"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"\> It's hard to tell who the plot is intended for. Kids aren't stupid. Shows in the past decade (Avatar, Batman TAS, Justice League (and JLU) , Gargoyles) had no problem taking their time to flesh a character's arc out, even if it took the entire episode - or three. Or just all throughout the season! What's wrong with proper depth?

Kids are a *little* stupid. If the show is aimed at fourth and fifth graders, they probably aren't thinking too hard about some of the plot holes (I've never watched the original She-Ra but I'm guessing it probably wasn't really that well written either, it was basically ""Let's make a He-Man for girls so we can sell more merchandise"" like most 80s cartoons were for the time period).

Kids cartoons \*can\* be complex and interesting and well written and kids will definitely appreciate them - but a kid's show doesn't \*have\* to be well written for kids to enjoy it. At a certain age, kids will watch almost anything with a lot of movement and bright colors and quippy one-liners."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Sounds like they could have taken a page from the old Xena Warrior Princess run.  ""Main Char starts off serving evil.  stays evil for quite a bit.  When changes from evil, for a good long time everyone else still treats her as evil for all the crap she did before'.  earns her redemption/etc."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"> A:TLA

What is A:TLA?"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Previous thread deleted? Was there like...an alt-right invasion that happened?!
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Yeah, the animation is a bit jaunty. The lack of shading for any depth kinda threw me off a bit, too, but mostly it's that some of the facial expressions look like my early '90's attempt at edgy anime style before I understood how faces worked."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I didn't see any animation quality drops. Body proportions are all over the place and inconsistent though.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"how is something not mature enough in a kids show?

&#x200B;

epecially if it features death and torture??? lol"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,How does it compare to the 2002 He-man series?
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I felt the same way, the show also reminds me of Jake Long: American Dragon(before the art change) in style."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Same. I was surprised to enjoy the show as much as I did considering that I strongly dislike this art style and some character designs.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,no.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Believe me, it could be so much worse. 

Behold the vocal horrors of OG:

[Perfuma](https://youtu.be/pJgeO2wL8zE?t=1334)

[Catra](https://youtu.be/syAskSqoXcs?t=6)

[Scorpia](https://youtu.be/osYdrYZpcdw?t=65)

And [Huntara](https://youtu.be/5Ip1lTZPu2I?t=395)

Truly an embarrassment of riches, and I do mean embarrassment."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I'm really not sure how the show is holding up a big ""look how progressive we are!!"" sign to you besides having a cast that's not entirely white people, but alright. The animation and character design also seemed just fine considering its target audience of young girls. Could you elaborate more on what your problems with it are?"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I didn't like the art either. I tried to give it a whirl based on story but the art was so offputting I couldn't hack it. Not my thing.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,">I really hoped that even as ugly as they made She-Ra in this one

I love She Ra's design. I agree that most of the other characters have some unstellar clothing but She-Ra and Catra had some really good character design IMO. 

&#x200B;"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Lmao blasted for going against the hivemind
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I feel like instead of going with the main plot of she ra. ( which alot of the younger generation wont understand)  They dont even know why she says for the honor of gray skull.  Or that she is hemans twin brother who was captured by hordak and the sword was given to her by him. Or that catra is a theif and has a magic mask that turns her into a cat to fight.   Anyways.  They forced diversity . Im all about diversity but do it with new characters that you can evolve and make that known.  In doing so they removed alot of the characters already established backgrounds.  Most people dont know that she ra was a woman power icon in the 80's because if you were a lesbian or a tomboy you were not alloud to play with boy toys.  So thoughs of us that watched the orginal and had her as a role model as a kids. Will have a hard time liking this new version.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I'd call her ""chaotic neutral"""
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Prehensile hair is awesome



"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"In all this, I oddly identify with Swift Wind."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Well, I mean, so long as it doesn't look like He-Man has always been the end goal, then I think people would be fine.
But besides that, He-Man, Eternia, Prince Adam, etc is all a part of Adora's origins. If they don't explore that I'd be really mad. They also have the option of redesigning He-Man to promote less male toxicity or something"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"I can't really fault it in any major way.

Sure it's not perfect, but show me a series that is. My favorite program of all time is probably Buffy, and some of the episodes are terrible haha. But I cam safely say that the new She - Ra has has a very strong start, and it's definitely a refreshing and exciting interpretation on the original :) it's loyal enough to appeal to fans, but different enough to be its own show. I can understand why it might not be for everyone but I think it's mint! "
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I wasn't sure if they would tie it in but they mentioned Greyskull so I have hopes for the next season
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Lol when the team horse is a more compelling character than Seahawk
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Time for a shanty!
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Yeah, that definitely wasn’t great. Never felt like the stakes were really high due to how small and empty most places felt."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,*/cue laughing animation/*
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"Yeah, it’s not much of an accomplishment, lol. The studio is infamous for cheap animation. You really want to see bad? Check out their Star Trek animated series. Great writing, but just as cheap as the original series. (though being animated, it has more freedom than the original series did)"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I'd rather the characters not move like paper cutout stop motion than have cheekbone lines. 
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Every female character in the original show looked like the same person in different clothes
Age of Tanks,[deleted]
Age of Tanks,"This sounds really good, thanks for the recommendation!"
Age of Tanks,"Correction it is a French, German and Russian co production. It aired a year or so ago first in Germany. One of the experts is even from the German tank museum and speaks German in the German version I don't know if he does that in the English one as well."
Age of Tanks,"One thing that has annoyed me, in the first 10 minutes they basically give Gunther Burstyn credit for all the ideas of a tank, even the tracks. But one of the only claims to fame Stockton, CA has is the birth of the Caterpillar tractor by Benjamin Holt years earlier. The documentary itself shows footage of soldiers moving artillery with tractors. "
Age of Tanks,">  I'm really enjoying this series, which is obviously French in origin. At the start of Episode 3, the narrator states, referring to the Germans, ""The world's nations rallied together to stop them. Mightiest among these allies was the Soviet Union.""

This isn't true. The USSR was sitting WWII out. It was German's invasion that prompted USSR to enter the war against Germany. To claim that the USSR was allied with England and the US is simply absurd.  


>   find it refreshing to hear a documentary acknowledge that it was the Soviets that really crushed the German war machine; that in the European theatre, the Americans weren't the mightiest allies.

The Soviet Winter, a scorched earth plan, Hitler's insanity and poor decision making and the USSR having no problem slaughtering millions of its own citizens is what bled the German's dry.  The USSR just had to not loose. "
Age of Tanks,"They say WWII was won with British intelligence, American steel and Russian blood. 

I would definitely recommend watching this.

Each episode focuses on a specific war, and tells how tanks evolved through each one."
Age of Tanks,"It is really good. It shows the history from WW1 than WW2 up to modern times. They have experts from Germany, Britain and other places comment on developments and all."
Age of Tanks,"Ww2 was won with Russian steel and blood. In the scene of things American material contribution was minuscule.
"
Age of Tanks,"As soon as I finish up Ozark, I will give it a try."
Age of Tanks,The Lend-Lease program was minuscule? 
Age of Tanks,The biggest contribution America made were trucks and transport equipment. American armaments such as tanks were not well suited to the eastern front
Age of Tanks,"Genuine question, were the American tanks ever destined for the Eastern front though?"
Age of Tanks,M3 Lee and m3a1 stuart mostly. Death machines for the crew.
Age of Tanks,"Thanks for the info, thought they held all US equipment for the Western offensive.  Haven't looked into tanks much so that would explain that gap.  cheers."
Age of Tanks,"Aw man, he was the perfect first. The show has its high and low points, but for a pilot, he couldn't have been a better candidate. That's really sad, hopefully they do a tribute."
Age of Tanks,that’s sad to hear. I loved Tom and his redneck margaritas.
Age of Tanks,That episode made me binge watch the show.
Age of Tanks,"> He once dropped the iconic line, ""You can't fix ugly.""

Sad. Rest in Power 🙏🏿"
Age of Tanks,"That’s sad. He was pretty much off the deep end with his far-right politics before the show and then returned to the status quo not long after, which is pretty depressing considering how open and friendly he was to the Queer Eye team. Can’t have been an easy life for him. Seemed to get a bit worse after his dad died. Poor guy."
Age of Tanks,"Glad that Queer Eye became such a hit thanks to episodes like this one, but it's unfortunate that it went to such a disgusting man. Must've been difficult to shoot with him."
Age of Tanks,Well shit .....
Age of Tanks,"I wonder how the farmer guy in last season who was literally having alcohol withdrawals (unaddressed) during his makeover. 

Like yeah apologize to your ex we can’t fix all this byeeeee"
Age of Tanks,"Meh, he was a bad person. Just protect Mama Tammy"
Age of Tanks,"Aw man, he was a sweetheart. RIP."
Age of Tanks,No!! He seemed like such a sweet man!
Age of Tanks,"Oh, sad. He seemed cool"
Age of Tanks,"I’m sad when anyone dies of course, but why do people like this guy? He was an alt right conservative weirdo. Not a cool person."
Age of Tanks,This episode had me SOBBING. Rest In Peace to a kind soul 🥲
Age of Tanks,Fuck Cancer
Age of Tanks,"Now I read about his political beliefs ,just yuck on that aspect.
Still anyone dying of cancer is sad"
Age of Tanks,We’re all wondering. Did his final outfit in the casket have a French tuck or not?
Age of Tanks,"Cancer is such a scourge.. sad to hear, he seemed like a good dude."
Age of Tanks,"I remember this episode as someone willing to be open to what he didn’t know. 

There was that great teachable moment when Tom asked in a gay marriage who was the husband and who was the wife. You could see the lightbulb go off through the parting clouds when they said they were both husbands. 

I don’t want to call it a seminal TV moment but I firmly believe many people learnt a lot in that exchange. Tom was open about not understanding but he was also open to learning. It was very powerful."
Age of Tanks,"I enjoy Queer Eye, learned a few things from it, RIP Tom. To soon my friend."
Age of Tanks,Rip great episode
Age of Tanks,that is the most qualified obit headline I've ever read
Age of Tanks,So why are people hating on this guy what’s the backstory?
Age of Tanks,That was an amazing episode!!!
Age of Tanks,Daaaaaamn ♥️
Age of Tanks,Slow news day eh
Age of Tanks,So much for the makeover
Age of Tanks,I remember that episode
Age of Tanks,The title has to be so long to explain why this guy was relevant to pop culture.
Age of Tanks,"But this episode my my bitch ass cry :(

He was so happy, he really couldn't believe that he had ""something to work with"" and when they helped him see it it was genuinely incredibly touching."
Age of Tanks,"He was a great first on the show.

I hope his life was good."
Age of Tanks,Aww I remember him ❤️
Age of Tanks,Time to rewatch 1st episode . I’m just about caught up on the rest of the series. I actually prefer the American original Queer Eye show . I do like this one as it’s growing on me
Age of Tanks,Gonna go pour out a redneck margarita for my homie
Age of Tanks,Who gives a shit?
Age of Tanks,News?
Age of Tanks,"63 is so young :(. RIP, King ❤️"
Age of Tanks,Thank you Tom.
Age of Tanks,"Could he go on QE and spout Fox News? Ya. They gave him a new outlook, not change who he was. It’s his ignorance with LEARNED racism. Tom made friends that day AND Tom is a product of his environment..It’s very southern."
Age of Tanks,"He was really kind . Didn’t seem to know what to expect at first with the guys, but they grew on him and was very grateful for the help. He was so nice."
Age of Tanks,Shit. That's a bummer. Is that show coming back?
Age of Tanks,oh man… that’s so sad
Age of Tanks,"Probably the only episode I watched of the full series. Hus margaritas and his jorts were the main takeaway. RIP man, you were an absolute legend"
Age of Tanks,What was his cocktail? Mountain Dew and Vodka?
Age of Tanks,"That’s sad, he was lovely"
Age of Tanks,[deleted]
Age of Tanks,:/// he was so sweet
Age of Tanks,"Such a sweet man, RIP"
Age of Tanks,[deleted]
Age of Tanks,"Coincidence? I think not…

(/s tho, seriously)"
Age of Tanks,"Nope, don't like that"
Age of Tanks,We hardly knew ye.
Age of Tanks,Crab people
Age of Tanks,NOOOOOOO
Age of Tanks,<\3
Age of Tanks,"Oh no, I only saw 2 episodes and that was one of them :("
Age of Tanks,RIP to a legend 🙏
Age of Tanks,RIP legend
Age of Tanks,"Although I'm not gay/lgbt/whatever, I remember enjoying the original Queer Eye show in the early 2000s. It was a happy show where they made crappy homes look high class. I learned a couple of useful arrangement/display tips from that show."
Age of Tanks,Argh.  He was a good guy.
Age of Tanks,He seemed like a nice guy.  Press F.
Age of Tanks,That was a great episode
Age of Tanks,RIP Brent crystals
Age of Tanks,My dad is 63. Tom did not take care of his body…
Age of Tanks,Noooooo
Age of Tanks,"RIP, I'm sure he's leaving in style."
Age of Tanks,[removed]
Age of Tanks,Fuck cancer man!
Age of Tanks,RIP Bert Chrysler
Age of Tanks,RIP Bert Kreischer
Age of Tanks,rest easy
Age of Tanks,"Tom was a really kind man. I met him about 20 years ago and sadly, he looked old and similar to how he looked on the show cause of his health issues. I assumed he was in his 60s then! I was so happy to see him getting some of his vibrancy back from the glow up. His big heart was always there and you were lucky to have met him.

RIP Tom. I hope you wore that hat until the end. You know the one. I wanna say you can see it briefly in the episode but it’s not the one they bought for him."
Age of Tanks,I’ve only watched random segments. What are the low points? Just clients who weren’t good tv?
Age of Tanks,This is so sad! I teach ESL to adults and I still use his episode in class sometimes because students always ended up falling in love with him. Sad news.
Age of Tanks,Remind me what that was?  Wasn’t it like vodka and Mt. Dew?  This guy was really cool and I hope he went peacefully and surrounded by love.
Age of Tanks,Oh me too - he was such a sweetheart.
Age of Tanks,"I heard my girlfriend and her friend crying in the next room, assumed it was just some average reality TV, sat down and joined in, and it was a done deal from there, goddamn."
Age of Tanks,I’ve never forgotten this line since I saw this episode. He verbalized what I’ve always felt about myself. This is so sad. He seemed like he had such a sweet soul.
Age of Tanks,"NO. Not “rest in power”. Do not say this about this man. This is a white, alt-right dude. At best you can say “rest in peace”.

Edit for the deleted comment:

**Rest in Power is used for people who have died due to oppression (e.g., racism, homophobia, transphobia…), and activists against the oppression.**"
Age of Tanks,"Where’d you get the info on his politics and stuff??

But it makes sense, sometimes the environment you’re in can make it hard to leave that way of thinking for good."
Age of Tanks,You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.
Age of Tanks,"Holy shit, just looked at his Twitter account and yeah it’s full of dumb political takes"
Age of Tanks,"Yeah they definitely “reach across the aisle” and sometimes make a genuine connection but a lot of these bumpkins probably turn around celebrate their free stuff and go back to Fox News dumpster in a week acting like they conned the gays, Netflix and Hollywood to all their friends."
Age of Tanks,They might have just kept it simple and shot around issues.
Age of Tanks,He was a racist arsehole. They edited him to seem nice.
Age of Tanks,Apparently he wasn't. Made some offensive comments to Tan and Jonathan
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"The statement that labor gains are one of the main drivers of inflation seems spurious.   Larry has been quoted saying (paraphrasing) that the US needs much higher unemployment, in the range of 7.5 to 10% to tamp down inflation.   There's no agreement on how to get inflation under control however increasing unemployment will be devastating to many families.   Fuck those people, amirighr?"
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,Larry Summers doesn't seem to consider that people who are out of work still need to have a roof over their heads and to eat.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,Summers hasn't looked this silly since The Social Network lol.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Jesus Christ, that is one smug prick.  It's amazing how people still say yes to interviews with Jon Stewart and think they can match wits with him."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,larry summers was so smug when corporation profits is a huge contributor to inflation is somehow a non factor. Fuck this guy.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"This guy embodies everything wrong with the economic system of the last decades. Its appalling to watch him talk with such disregard for truth. 

And why shouldn't he? He has gotten away with it so far, treating the working masses like cows while he and his billionaire friends, the shepherds, are guiding us all to a brighter future as is their god given right for being so much better, so much more competent, intelligent and hard working than the rest of us. 

This man is a cancer. And the fact that he has been in leading positions in the highest echelons of government, education and economic policy for decades, is the clearest sign that the system was broken, is broken, and will remain broken unless we, the working masses, do something about it."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,Larry Summers is the embodiment of neoliberalism and all of its ills.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Anyone have any idea what Stewart's sources are here? Stewart makes this claim:

> The San Francisco Fed says, that is, demand is maybe 30 to 35 percent of the inflation, wages are really around 20 percent of the inflation. There's a huge corporate profit aspect to it, there's a huge supply chain aspect to it. But our method for controlling it seems really much more focused on wages and employment.

I was searching for a while, but the only thing I could find from the San Francisco Fed [was this letter](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/june/how-much-do-supply-and-demand-drive-inflation/), but which mentions demand being responsible for a third of inflation but doesn't give any number for wages, and doesn't claim corporate profits are a reason at all.

Also, Stewart's attitude on interest rates is contradictory. When Summers says that some people think we shouldn't have had low interest rates so much in response to the recession, Stewart excitedly agrees with that point. But just a few minutes later Stewart is extremely opposed to getting rid of low rates, because he says it will hurt workers."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,It is with complete lack of surprise that Summers says employees should seek a wage as high as they can get and NOT that companies should pay a wage commensurate with the value that is being produced. Somehow disconnecting the value of the company's good and/or service which is rising with the demand and the value of the people producing said good and/or service. He somehow believes that increase in profit is solely the domain of the  company and it's executive management simply because they can.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,No mention of Summers’ affiliation with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein - post conviction. Yikes.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Stewart is really out of his element here tbh. Summers was right about inflationary fiscal/monetary policy in early 2021 and he’s mostly right here about the so-called “greedflation” though he could communicate it better. 

Stewart’s retort that he would call himself negotiating a higher tv show host salary “gouging” is a serious error that Summers doesn’t unpack. 

Corporate profits/greed have little relationship with inflation rate (see the 1980s for a dramatic inverse correlation). 

Stewart has brought on progressive (I mean Summers is hardly right-wing) economists before like Goolsbee, I would be interested in him bringing in any on his podcast/show to see their view on the matter."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Stewart has a very predictable method with his interviews. If he agrees with you, he does them in person, unedited, with an audience (see all his panels on his new show where they  and the audience all agree with each other)

If he doesn't like you and plans to jam you up, it's prerecorded. He will take hours of interview footage and only air a few minutes of it, to cast his subject in the worst possible light. Many of his subjects complain about this. He doesn't post the unedited interviews anywhere. And his fans are in awe with how clever Stewart is and how he always seems to nail his interview subjects. Almost as if it was edited to come off that way. 

Usually he finds some 2nd rate politician (Summers would be an exception) to beat up on who either doesn't know his tactics or doesn't care and wants the publicity."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Should take the time to watch The Power of The Fed from frontline. Great doc. 

https://youtu.be/9RbL8lTsITY"
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,People want to celebrate Obama as some vanguard of the left but this guy (Larry Summers) is the guy who Obama chose to lead his National Economic Council.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"This is the first time in years that I watched Jon Stewart and didn’t follow his logic. I watched that interview and wished he would let Larry Summers finish a thought (also how I felt during the prior round table). The thing Summers said that resonates is that the Fed is a bank - it only has two levers, interest rates and money. So while corporate profits are a problem, so is climate change and neither are things within the Fed’s governance. With the levers the Fed has, raising interest rates is the prudent choice. It is noteworthy that despite low unemployment, poor Americans are drowning with inflation - paying as much as 30% of their income on gas. There is a real downside to such high inflation and trying to slow it down isn’t just overlooking the poor to do what’s convenient for capitalists."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Summers is a believer in the wage-price spiral, and that theory has likely gained more traction in economic and political circles as inflation has proven to be stickier than anticipated in the last two years. Sticky high inflation brings up uncomfortable memories of stagflation for older policymakers, so to them, inducing a recession, which is deflationary, is a better option than going through another decade of stagflation. This is a relevant and telling quote about his mindset on this issue from a Feb. 2023 interview with Fareed Zakaria:

>The benefit we can get from pushing unemployment low is on almost all economic theories and likely not to be a permanent one. But if we push inflation up and those issues become entrenched, we're going to live with that inflation for a long time.

To that end, he supports the Fed's rapid increase in interest rates, though the Fed itself is trying to do a ""soft landing"" -- cooling down the economy while avoiding a recession. In this sense, Summers and Powell (chairman of the Fed) are somewhat at odds, as Powell is more optimistic, at least publicly, about a soft landing while Summers is pessimistic.

FWIW, Summers made that speech about higher unemployment (6% for 5 years, 7.5% for 2 years, or 10% for 1 year) in June 2022, when the 12-month percentage change for inflation was peaking at +9.1% despite the freight rate for containers declining. That was around the time when people started fearing that inflation was not as simple as reducing supply-side bottlenecks. Since then, that figure has steadily fallen every month (currently 6%), and he has also moderated his opinion as new positive data has rolled in. During that same Feb. 2023 interview with Zakaria, he admitted that it ""looks more possible that we'll have a soft landing than it did a few months ago."""
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Unemployment jumping all the way to match the highest levels of the Great Recession? With no other economic consequences - like, say, a Greater Recession? Is he an idiot?"
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"No, there’s the beautiful part.  When wintertime rolls around, the ~~gorillas~~ poors simply freeze to death."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,People like Larry Summers won't be happy until the average American has the same standard of living as a Bangladeshi peasant.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Isn’t his plan that these out of work people just die, so then they won’t be spending money on milk, DRIVING UP THE COST OF MILK!?

Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,Easy pickins' for Jon 😎
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"It's hilarious that Summers thinks his Apple comments are some big ""Gotcha"" and Jon turns it right around on him lol."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,That's what being surrounded by sycophants and potato-brains does to a motherfucker.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"its more like, the first thing in the 09 recession was how do we save the companies and lowering interest rates sustain the stock market while many people lost their jobs, houses, etc. 

Now with high inflation, the government is coming at it with the 1k to everyone somehow caused 50-90% inflation all while wages have been stagnant for decades so we should up the interest rates which will cause unemployment. WHILE corporations are using it as an excuse to bump up margins with no accountability. its not the interest rates since its just a tool its why are we always using employment and wages when its been such a low factor vs. corporations, profit that benefits/utilize the most for inflation. Basically PPP 1 billion vs. everyone else 1M oh it must be the everyone else fault."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,I think Stewart was speculating there. I agree with him though. It isn't all one thing.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"I think the biggest issue is that this argument conflates two somewhat separate issues:  inflation and corporate profit maximization.  What Stewart is trying to say is that during this inflationary period corporates took advantage of the climate to raise their prices, not to meet inflationary Pareto efficiency, but above and beyond that…to reap additional gains.  He doesn’t land that plane though, and Summers tries to tease the two issues apart.  So this whole thing is basically like they are speaking two different languages.  Frustrating and not one of the better Stewart take-downs IMO."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,You're out of your element. Austin Goolsbee is not a progressive. See his work for Obama to build demand for cutting Social Security.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"> Many of his subjects complain about this.

Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"He's certainly not an idiot, he's an economist - no compassion or empathy."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,It’s always hurt everyone but the extremely wealthy. Tale as old as time.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,But he'll tsk-tsk about it so there's that.
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Yes. He's one of those ""isn't it sad"" types."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"> its more like, the first thing in the 09 recession was how do we save the companies and lowering interest rates sustain the stock market while many people lost their jobs, houses, etc.

> Now with high inflation, the government is coming at it with the 1k to everyone somehow caused 50-90% inflation all while wages have been stagnant for decades so we should up the interest rates which will cause unemployment.

Lower interest rates in general stimulate the economy - jobs, stock market, profits, etc., while higher rates in general do the opposite (lower job, the stock market, profits in the short term). Anyone who wants to be intellectually consistent can't just ignore the benefit to the jobs market talking about the low interest rates in '09, or ignore the benefit to the stock market and profits when talking about current rates.

If anything, the negative effects from the recent rate hikes seem to have hit the stock market and corporate profits earlier than they've hit the labor market."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"They're not really separate issues though.  That's the point.  The core of inflation is the price of the same basket of goods becoming more expensive.  Businesses took advantage of the crisis of the pandemic that people were expecting some things to go up some, to just across the board increase prices on everything way more than ""necessary"", and then not increase the wages they were paying to produce those goods, and then bragging about the profits.  And while there's been no action to address that, the talk in economic circles is purely focusing on the idea that hurting workers more, so they don't have any leverage to ask for more money to keep up with the prices, so that would force the inflation to stop when people can't afford goods.  Which is incredibly fucked up."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"They were both talking past each other and just trying to get ""gotchas"" with each other. Summers was trying to get Jon to bow to his Apple overlords and obviously Jon wouldn't. 

If Summers really wanted to hammer his point through, he should've asked the most easiest way to lower Apple product prices. And that's to decrease demand."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Right, and Obama is totally far-right in europe and so on.

Goolsbee also is more sympathetic to Jon’s argument with regards fo corporate concentration having an effect on inflation, so it would be interesting to hear an actual substantive case for it rather than corporations bad. Summers’s point at the beginning of the interview (Corporations didn’t wake up after 40 years and decide to be greedy) is hard to counter."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,He's also an idiot because the economic impact of 1 out of every 10 Americans out of work would be far greater than any impacts it had on inflation...
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Right, he's probably got the theory correct here.

But in borrowing the wise words of the great The Dude, ""You're not wrong Mr. Summers, you're just an asshole..."""
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"I remember in the late 90s people said things like 'unemployment is dangerously low'. I always wanted to punch those people. 

Of course, for any position you can take there is an economist out there who will agree with you. And usually they are neither 100% right nor 100% wrong. The economy is a complicated thing with many variables.

But yeah, Summers kind of has his head up his ass here."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"There is a difference between low rates and the ultra low rates. Rates should def have been lowered after 2008, but the level of cuts is what's being disputed. 

His point still stands though that inflation is more supply-side than demand-side. This has been echoed by plenty of research houses and the Fed is purely focused on addressing the demand side. Summers doesn't even entertain the notion there there are other ways to also address this like price caps.

That point about free market for corporates but not for workers really drives home his point."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Well they’re not separate issues because the fed and the government’s economists, along with corporations have fucked with the whole underlying equation.  Inflation on its own isn’t a problem.  The theory suggests that prices may increase, but it has to be for a *reason* (or a basket of reasons).  Inputs are more rare, demand went up, labor costs more, etc.  “But we just want more profits” is not a valid reason for inflation per an efficient markets theory.  In an efficient market all profits are already maximized and there is no dead weight loss.  I.e.  the issue isn’t inflation itself, it’s that these corporate jerkoffs and the fed economists hide behind the efficient markets theory when it suits them (like how they explain their interventions to fight inflation) and then distance themselves from it when it doesn’t (like when anyone brings up corporate greed).

The most interesting part of the interview for me was Stewart comparing pricing products to pricing labor. He was onto something there and it seems like maybe they edited that part of the conversation."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"It's not *just* that they're using the double-speak of efficient markets only when its convenient, its also that they're specifically doing it to talk indirectly about who they're directly targeting for pain.  Both of them are why this issue is frustrating to watch people defend exactly why the Fed is raising rates now.  But you see just the slightest flash of the latter being illuminated right as the clip ends, but even when as Summers is forced to acknowledge that, he tries to still play it down and walk it back.   Some of you may die/lose your livelihood, but that's a sacrifice Summers and his friends are willing to make."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"All this moral pontificating ignores that people like yourself or Jon (or sen Warren quite frankly) have no real attainable solution to inflation as opposed to rate rises that will have a credible effect on inflation, so they retreat to conspiratorial nonsense. Summers doesn’t get up in the morning seeking to raise unemployment, he’s a partisan Democrat."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"It depends on what you define as ""attainable"".  Raising tax rates, both on personal income of high-earners and of corporation, will also have a pretty direct effect on inflation.  As will throwing the Justice Dept at the problem of trust-busting.   But Larry and his orbit obviously would rather no one talk about that side of it, so he does everything possible, as showcased in this interview, to brush that off as ""unrealistic"" or ""not the real problem"" and ignore it, even when directly questioned."
Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Larry has advocated for raising  corporate taxes.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-22/summers-says-raise-taxes-right-now-to-help-battle-inflation


I’m skeptical that trust busting or corporate concentration is an effective tool tbh. Inflation is a global problem that is effecting all industries and I don’t see compelling evidence that corporations are leading it. It’s normal for yoy profit margins to look higher in a year of dramatic economic recovery and rising inflation"

Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Sayid in Lost. He'd been one of the main characters through the whole series, then in the final season they do a fake out on his death, then imply he's been compromised in some way and might be evil, but then nothing really happens. Jin and Sun have this really emotional tragic death, and then it's just like oh yeah Sayid died in there as well. Really strange.

Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"Tasha Yar.  First, they kill her off for no reason.

Whats Wrong with Secretary Kim,"A lot of people mentioning Carl in here, which I agree, was a mistake for them to kill him off. But honestly what made me so mad and I lost respect for the writers was Glenn’s fake-me-out dumpster death.

First and only time a characters death made me do that. I get that her actress was a main character on another show, so she couldn’t stay on this show forever, and they had written the character to the point that killing her was the only logical way to get her off the show, but it’s just the way they did it that pissed me off.

First they had her die right after having sex for the first time with the woman she loved. Than they kill her by having her accidentally walk into a bullet not meant for her. This was a slightly altered version of what they did with Tara on Buffy and it was still just as awful.

Why not have Lexa knowingly take the bullet for Clarke. Maybe she walked in on the fight, saw what was happening and tried to deescalate it, but when that failed, chose to jump in front of the bullet, that way her death would be her choice and not just ‘Wrong place, wrong time’. The death would still have sucked, but at least it would have been the characters decision and not completely random."

The Queen of Flow,"It makes sense, schools are closed, loads of kids at home, and not everyone wants to watch the funeral, and not everyone has paid tv or streaming service."
The Queen of Flow,great. Probably the highest ratings the Emoji movie has ever had
The Queen of Flow,"Shit, now it's only going to be on every other channel."
The Queen of Flow,"So the option is to either watch the most morbidly depressing thing ever televised, or the funeral?"
The Queen of Flow,That’s fine. You don’t need 27 channels showin the same thing. Children do t want to watch funerals
The Queen of Flow,"It’s the equivalent of the tv having cartoons on for the young kids in the living room while the adults are gathered around a dying relative down the hall. I’m just an average person and even I can see that, what the fuck."
The Queen of Flow,"It's not exactly as if Britons don't have other options for watching it (as noted in the article). There also wouldn't be much Channel 5 could do in terms of funeral coverage that the other channels aren't already doing. Like ITV and Channel 4, its news program(me)s are outsourced to [ITN](https://www.itn.co.uk) which is presumably focused on producing the ITV coverage."
The Queen of Flow,Should have been King Ralph.
The Queen of Flow,"Channel 5 is taking a leaf from [Japan's TV Tokyo](https://kotaku.com/does-this-japanese-television-network-even-give-a-f-k-1541117837), I see, who had a notorious reputation for absolutely refusing to interrupt their regular programming for any breaking news. 

Whether its the great magnitude 9.0 earthquake of 2011, North Korea firing their missiles everywhere, or news of Brexit or Trump getting elected.

People jokingly say the world will truly end if TV Tokyo actually interrupt their programming for something."
The Queen of Flow,"What’s even sadder is that the entire country has shutdown for this funeral. Shops, restaurants and a lot of pubs are closed.

So some poor sods without internet are stuck between watching the funeral or the Emoji movie."
The Queen of Flow,Kids may not want to watch a funeral of an old lady.
The Queen of Flow,"... i mean, who cares?"
The Queen of Flow,"People act like children wanted to watch the queen get buried instead of flashing pretty lights and colours.. They don't, I promise."
The Queen of Flow,"Unpopular opinion, don’t give a fuck about the queen and the emoji movie wasn’t THAT bad - in fact, I enjoyed it for what it was lol"
The Queen of Flow,Like seriously so what? It was on every other fucking channel
The Queen of Flow,Who pulled the higher ratings?
The Queen of Flow,Probably the best ratings that movie has ever gotten
The Queen of Flow,Based
The Queen of Flow,And I bet the movie was watched by millions because the funeral coverage doesn't interest everyone for a week straight
The Queen of Flow,"Good! I remember being a kid when Ayatollah Khomeini died in Iran and we had the day off school cause everything was shut down to mourn, and the tv only showed stupid mourning videos and prayers.  All I wanted was to watch cartoons!

I guess that’s when I first started to truly hate the regime."
The Queen of Flow,"I wish they'd been around when Princess Diana died. Aged 5 I was distraught at the lack of children's TV programming and we only had BBC, ITV and Channel 4 at the time."

The Queen of Flow,I have never felt more alien in this country than I have the last week. We are ridiculous.
The Queen of Flow,"UK kids: ""Mum this is so sad! Can we just watch the funeral instead?"""
The Queen of Flow,"Good? The fact everything stopped was rather weird. The BBC have had 24 hour coverage of the queue to see the queen. literally  people standing and waiting. I've just been avoiding TV.

Reading the ""mocking"" tweets, they sounds more like people having a joke then any attack on channel 5."
The Queen of Flow,Both are equally important

The Queen of Flow,As God intended.
The Queen of Flow,🤷‍♂️
The Queen of Flow,"I'm not trying to sound contrarian/edgy or anything, but can someone explain why the Queen's death is such a big deal? Does her death have any real world consequences besides the whole media circlejerk?"
The Queen of Flow,"Believe it or not….. some people don’t give a shit about the queen’s funeral, and are sick of the 24/7 queen-centric news coverage of the past week+"
The Queen of Flow,"As I recall, for a couple of days after 9/11 happened it seemed like every channel was running news feeds. Even ones like Nickelodeon did for a while, you couldn't escape it."
The Queen of Flow,"Not everyone likes funerals even if it’s for a loved one. I don’t like looking at coffins and dead bodies in real life. I avoid funerals like the plague. It’s depressing. Constant reminder of my own mortality. Let the dead bury their dead. I’m alive, let me live life to the fullest. When 127 years old and maybe  dead we can always discuss death 🤣."
The Queen of Flow,"Good. If someone wanted to watch the funeral, they could switch channel. If someone wanted to watch a movie they could use this one.

What fucking sense does it make to have the same bullshit going on on each channel in the country, for the sake of fuck."
The Queen of Flow,“Anyone not watching the funeral must be punished most severely”
The Queen of Flow,"ok, so what?

that's a serious question.  is every channel in the entire country supposed to carry the same programming simultaneously?"
The Queen of Flow,I was watching The young Ones on BBC Two....oh wait that is not until 9th November...but I guess I was watching a sneak preview of it.
The Queen of Flow,"I don’t see a problem with this.  The entire Commonwealth is all but shut down.  Kids are at home and probably bored, and there are other people probably want to watch something else besides the state funeral."
The Queen of Flow,"I don't think this was a bad idea. I wouldn't want my child being shown a funeral on live TV all day, and would like to think that if Channel 5 had followed suit with the Queen's funeral coverage then we would've seen a huge spike in streaming services activity.

I respect the royal family and monarchy, but fair play to channel 5 for thinking of children and those who shouldn't really be exposed to the concept of death and funerals at a young age. If it was movies for 7-15 years old however then I'd have an issue but young children, nah."
The Queen of Flow,I'd rather watch a hundred funerals than the Emoji Movie.
The Queen of Flow,Probably the highest ratings that movie has ever seen.
The Queen of Flow,I see this as an absolute win!
The Queen of Flow,"Who cares, I’m sure the whole country doesn’t want to watch a funeral"
The Queen of Flow,And we’re outraged about this why?
The Queen of Flow,"In Australia, one radio channel interrupted with the news of the queen, and then straight back to techno music"
The Queen of Flow,"Probably the most viewed channel in England that day

Edit:  I lived through princess di tragedy and 9/11 thank God cable tv is irrelevant in 2022.  I remember 3 weeks+ coverage of airplanes hitting buildings over and over nothing else on any other channel"
The Queen of Flow,Maybe kids need something else to watch
The Queen of Flow,"I really hope the trash the monarchy, this display is just pathetic. I’ll have to hear about it at least once more in my life. I’m sorry for her family but it’s about time England retires this. People will visit the castles without royals in them"
The Queen of Flow,Finally some good content
The Queen of Flow,Honestly a better watch.
The Queen of Flow,"Well, the Poop Emoji is played by Sir Patrick Stewart."
The Queen of Flow,It's what the Queen would have wanted.
The Queen of Flow,If I was there I would be watching the movie
The Queen of Flow,"A more accurate title: There are some channels that didn't show the funeral, though most still did.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I really hate our clickbait/rage bait culture.."
The Queen of Flow,[Luckily other channels have their priorities straight.](https://i.imgur.com/0tAM365.jpg)
The Queen of Flow,"This is like a f you to both monarchists and republicans. It's an f you to the monarchists because they couldn't watch the funeral, and it's a f you to the republicans because they had to watch the Emoji movie.

Brilliant piece of trolling, really."
The Queen of Flow,"At times like this I think of Adam Faith's final words:

&#x200B;

>""Channel 5 is all shit, isn't it? Christ, the crap they put on there. It's a waste of space"""
The Queen of Flow,The daily mail is going to shit it’s pants over this
The Queen of Flow,"I'm no fan of the monarchy, I couldn't care less. Plus funerals are boring as shit. But dear God id watch the whole funeral twenty times in succession than James Corden"
The Queen of Flow,I would rather watch a coffin for two hours.
The Queen of Flow,I think I would of rather watch the funeral..
The Queen of Flow,I think I’d rather watch the funeral than the Emoji movie tbh; couldn’t they have put literally anything else on?
The Queen of Flow,Somebody’s gotta counter program.  I’d have used Adam Sandler personally. But I’d say the emoji movie fits the same demo Adam would.
The Queen of Flow,"I laugh, but it's a sensible move really.

Less sensible is the advert breaks for every channel still existing but just bring empty b locks of nothing."
The Queen of Flow,based
The Queen of Flow,Is that a bad thing???? Other channels aren’t showing it????
The Queen of Flow,"In the most polite way possible, this is not news, TV news, or anything remotely relevant. It's a clickbait title with no substance featuring clickbait movie with no substance."
The Queen of Flow,"I mean, its well known that the Emoji Movie was Queen Elizabeth's favorite piece of cinema."
The Queen of Flow,Equally as funny
The Queen of Flow,Lmao I thought it was Andrew Callaghan at first
The Queen of Flow,Gosh. The choice of a funeral or the emoji movie. That's depressing all round
The Queen of Flow,People don't know this was the queen's favorite movie 😔
The Queen of Flow,There was a rule that all channels were not allowed to show any comedy content during the period of morning. I’m glad Channel 5 respected that.
The Queen of Flow,Who cares
The Queen of Flow,“The President is on. He’s on every channel! We’re gonna miss Flipper!”
The Queen of Flow,It makes me very sad that this is somehow considered newsworthy.
The Queen of Flow,TJ Miller strikes again!
The Queen of Flow,Well it only committed like half the atrocities that the crown has. Lesser of two evils
The Queen of Flow,So what
The Queen of Flow,To be fair it's not like they broke the rules by showing something funny.
The Queen of Flow,"Jeez, give me the funeral instead!"
The Queen of Flow,"They decided to punish anyone who chose not to watch the procession, LOL."
The Queen of Flow,"If they decided to, fine by me. I never got why multi channels will be showing essentially the same event. You'll be able to see it in 4-5 other channels. if one decides it's alternative programming, let them."
The Queen of Flow,"The one and only time I’d ever watch the emoji film! 


Fuck those cunts"
The Queen of Flow,"Poor souls had to sit through that, or the funeral."
The Queen of Flow,"That's just to have a control group in terms of viewer-ship ratings systems.

Which is why the Emoji movie was the perfect choise.
One can hardly think of a more perfect piece of media to judge ""Really Really strong disinterest to watch the funeral."" against.

Say about the queens funeral and her person whatever you like. But at least it's not the emoji movie.
Even the test pattern would have introduced bias of SOME people preferring THAT."
The Queen of Flow,Good
The Queen of Flow,"It makes sense, even if they're showing a movie that's shit as, it's solid business sense to be the one channel targeting the demographic of ""people who want to watch something other than the royal funeral"""
The Queen of Flow,Assuming channels 1-4 had it covered
The Queen of Flow,I am guessing that the target demographic doesn't really care.  Does everything have to stop for her funeral?
The Queen of Flow,Good
The Queen of Flow,"What’s channel five usually? It’s not channel one, innit?! No. Not even channel two. It’s five. Where you leave the kids for a minute, and talk to Shirley next door. She’s been through a few things, Shirley. But she’s good for a laugh and a few words over the fence. She can tell a story, share a bit of gossip, whatnot. If she’d just turn the tv down with the windows open."
The Queen of Flow,My only takeaway from this thread and article is that there are only 5 free channels in UK.
The Queen of Flow,"Makes sense, who wants to watch an immoral old bag get buried?"
The Queen of Flow,Did a robot create this article? It sure looks auto-generated.
The Queen of Flow,Not seeing the issue
The Queen of Flow,Hahahahahahahahahahahah
The Queen of Flow, It’s what she would have wanted

Medal of Honor,"This is a great concept for a show, hope they do it justice."
Medal of Honor,"Seems to focus mostly on the U.S. Army MOH rather than other services. Hopefully they expand as the series goes on and include Marines, Navy, and Air Force. "
Medal of Honor,"My boy Ben Schwartz is in an episode of this as Vito Bertoldo, an American soldier who held off enemy troops by himself for 48 hours straight, killing over 40 of them. They were also in tanks and had armored cars. "
Medal of Honor,"Can't watch trailer yet as as work, but I approve of this.

It'd be good to see more in-depth, television-form war shows."

Medal of Honor,Was excited till I seen it’s a documentary. Big pass
Medal of Honor,"More US propaganda on Netflix? Now, that's a surprise ..."
Medal of Honor,To the point that when they translate them to cinema they have to tone it down to make them believable.

Medal of Honor,Holy shit those stories are almost unbelievable 
Medal of Honor,What's the concept?
Medal of Honor,They did it justice. One of the best .military documentaries ive ever watched.

Medal of Honor,Damn. Thats hardcore. Dude definetly deserves a MOH.
Medal of Honor,Well now I need a series on people who haven’t but should get the MoH. Produced by Zemeckis. 
Medal of Honor,It’s not propaganda if it’s only heavily subsidized by the military instead of outright payed for. /s

Medal of Honor,I mean...you got a point
Medal of Honor,"Honestly, any time someone does an edit and whines like a little bitch about downvotes, I *always* downvote, even if I agree. Lmao, ya bitch"

Medal of Honor,"There's a book that covers a few of these as well as some navy seal missions, I can't recall the name... But I remember reading it and feeling like I was being told a fictional story. I hope this series does these men justice, and doesn't sensationalize anything—there's no need for it. Their stories are best told raw."
Medal of Honor,"From the trailer, it seems like it's going to be reenactments of the stories that earned these men and women the medal of honor."
Medal of Honor,"public school, huh?"

Medal of Honor,"In real life he got shot by a sniper but kept going. At the end of the movie, the men carry him off the hill in a stretcher. In reality, he made them stop and carry someone else instead, while he crawled. You can Google hacksaw ridge accuracy to read up more on Doss"

Medal of Honor,"In the movie he jumps and kicks a grenade out of the air to save a man on a stretcher. this also actually happened, I figured it was total BS when I watched it "
Medal of Honor,"I am up to episode 5, have watched 3 episodes today. I think I need a break; it’s emotionally taxing. I cried every episode and feel massively humbled by these exceptional humans. "
Medal of Honor,"I really enjoyed this, especially the story about Edward Carter. What a legend.

edit: and Vito Bertoldo, and Hiroshi Miyamura.. "
Medal of Honor,"Very emotional and doesn't glorify the military, but rightfully glorifies the people that served their country in the highest. Loved it."
Medal of Honor,I know the producers and this was a true labor of love! 
Medal of Honor,. . . Is that Jean Ralpheo? 
Medal of Honor,"I came looking if it was the same for others, 2 episodes in, i feel overwhelmed by this stories"
Medal of Honor,I had to pause multiple times to just sit with my head in my hands and cry. It became too much at times and took me a while to finish. I want to hug each and every one of those men and their families. 
Medal of Honor,Vito Bertoldo was pretty much a real life Steve Rogers
Medal of Honor,"I watched the 3rd episode ""Edward Carter"" last night. Wow I was in tears and I never cry to this sort of thing. So touching."
Medal of Honor,"I rarely cry for docs or movies, but this one made we well up 6 episodes.

So inspiring. Makes you really motivated to do something positive in our society. It certainly has made me appreciate the human spirit in midst of all the craziness going on today. 

FYI: Only thing that sucks is that there's 10 to 15min of either the actual MoH ceremony or more commentary that automatically cuts off when credits roll thanks to Netflix code. "
Medal of Honor,I don't ever cry. But this series has had me in tears for the entirety. This was an extremely well done series that showcases courageous Americans.
Medal of Honor,"I was kind of sleeping on this because I usually do not care for reenacted docuseries, but now I will look it up. "
Medal of Honor,He got run over by a lexussssss
Medal of Honor,"That episode was one hell of an emotional roller coaster.  I cried, then I was angry, and then I cried again."
Medal of Honor,"I cried on every episode, true heroes, such a great docu series."
Medal of Honor,"I've only seen Clint Romesha's episode, having met him IRL before, but it was great. I feel like it could maybe do without some of the cheesy History channel reenactments though."
Medal of Honor,Torrenting a show is a significant investment for you?
Medal of Honor,Decent shows i wouldn't really say its propaganda. It's just a recount of the things they went through to get their medal of honor.
Medal of Honor,"Dude buy a Netflix subscription and stream it, it’s worth it. "
Medal of Honor,why Yes it is. 
Medal of Honor,[deleted]
Medal of Honor,That was my initial thought as well.
Medal of Honor,"I’d say they reinforce stereotypes and create a vicious cycle. Gang culture both creates the tv show archetype and then feeds off of it and feeds into it, spiralling.  

Often it does so uncritically.  

Like who wants to find out street thugs make less than they would slinging burgers?"
Medal of Honor,"Episode 5 and 9 are my favourite episodes of The Pacific. If you loved episode 9 I can't recommend Eugene's Sledge's memoir enough. The extra depth to the story, and some of the fine details are harrowing. I read the book 6 years ago and Sledge's account is so vivid and terrifying I can't help but remember little anecdotes when I rewatch the series. If anything his description is more brutal than the episode."
Medal of Honor,How does it compare to the best of Band of Brothers?
Medal of Honor,Interesting. I stopped bothering watching after about episode 4 or so. It just felt so much worse than BoB.
Medal of Honor,"I finally watched this a few weeks ago while recovering from surgery. It was amazing, and inspired me to watch Band of Brothers again. Amazon Prime is worth paying for just for all the old HBO shows on demand. Just found Come and See on youtube. Thanks for the tip. Im sure the translation via CC wont be great, but I'm about to find out.
"
Medal of Honor,Already plan on it!
Medal of Honor,"Allow one of the paratroopers to answer that for you. In the show as one of the Marines comes back home he pays his taxi driver who fought in Europe but he refuses to take his money. He tells him ""I might have jumped into Normandy, but at least I got some liberties in London and Paris. You Gi-rines, you got nothing but jungle rot and malaria.""
"
Medal of Honor,Its just as good as B.O.B. Nice username.
Medal of Honor,"This is totally subjective but I liked The Pacific better than Band of Brothers overall. Every year on Memorial Day I like to marathon one or the other. I have both on Blu-Ray and liked The Pacific better. I know everybody had it rough in that war, but after watching The Pacific I feel the Marines had a much worse time of things. The Japanese make the Germans look like pansies in comparison. And the conditions of the Pacific islands were simply hell compared to Europe."
Medal of Honor,Worse in what way?
Medal of Honor,"Before giving up, definitely watch through episode 5, when Eugene Sledge's story begins in the invasion of Peleliu. The action really picks up. Personally, I only watch episodes 5, 6, 9, and 10 (Sledge's story)."
Medal of Honor,"Seems like it's heavily divisive for some people. I prefer *The Pacific*, but it's definitely less ""feel-good.""

My advice for people watching it after *Band of Brothers*: don't expect it to be the same, or even all that similar. Treat it as something completely different, not a sequel. "
Medal of Honor,The Pacific really shines with showing the hell of war and is a really strong contrast in both scenery and how the japanese fights compared to the Germans. 
Medal of Honor,"I agree, and still to this day, I have never seen anything come close to the brutality and the weight that The Pacific gives."
Medal of Honor,"The writing, acting, music, story, cinematography and sound editing.

...I wasn't a big fan."
Medal of Honor,"Rami Malek as Shelton seriously gave me the creeps for a few episodes. He did a really great job, and, yes, overall The Pacific is much darker "
Medal of Honor,"Yeah it became really obvious that the Japanese would have fought to the last man, woman, and child. They were fanatics. The Germans weren't that different from us. They were fighting for their country but all in all they'd rather not be fighting. The Japanese were a whole other story. It's a big argument behind dropping the bomb. That kind of destruction was the only way they would surrender."
Medal of Honor,"I mean not to take anything away from what the Army faced in Europe, but The Pacific paints a much more brutal picture with what the Marines faced in the Pacific theater. After that one stint in Australia, they basically had no liberty. Their ""time off"" was sleeping in tents on beaches of these Pacific islands infested with crabs. It was a truly horrific scenario."
Medal of Honor,I cant understand that point of view at all. 
Medal of Honor,"I still have the scene where he's throwing pebbles into something off screen burnt into my mind.  It finally shows him casually tossing the pebbles into a dead Japanese soldier's head, which has the top part blown off and sounds like it's full of rainwater from the small splashes.

"
Medal of Honor,"Not really.  Japan wanted to surrender.  Their only requirement was that the Emperor be allowed to remain on the throne. The US insisted on unconditional surrender.  Spend billions on the Manhattan Project and not the drop?  No way.

The bombs were the first act of the Cold War, not the end of WWII."
Medal of Honor,"My point exactly, it bothers me the lack of attention given to the Marines and the entire Pacific campaign when World War 2 is taught. It's always ""Europe this, D-Day was bad, the Nazis!"" Politically Europe was worse, combat wise... the war aspect of it. Nothing touches the Pacific theater, and I think that is important. People will never realise how brutal combat is and that's why I feel that teenagers think it's okay to disrespect o
ur vets. And like I said, the ones who are informed, still glamorise the European theater. "

Super Drags,Feels like castlevania season 1 came out years ago.
Super Drags,"Fox had a [*Locke & Key* series in development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locke_%26_Key_(TV_pilot)) almost a decade ago. A pilot was shot and screened for critics whose response was favorable, so of course Fox decided against picking it up to series."
Super Drags,I really want Locke and key to be good.
Super Drags,Season 4 of Travelers is them trying to fix their mistakes from Season 3. Once we finish season 4 then they’ll release season 3 and it will be the corrected timeline. 
Super Drags,"They're probably not on the list because their seasons just ended but the ways that Luke Cage and Iron Fist S2 ended make me really excited for their next seasons, if they do them."
Super Drags,"Wait they got Locke and Key? Somehow I missed that. Also can not for the life of me see Jupiter's Legacy working, I feel like it would need a huge budget."
Super Drags,I'm so excited for Castlevania.
Super Drags,Interesting that these are all scifi and fantasy from what I can tell. Except perhaps Apostle which doesn't seem supernatural from the trailer. 
Super Drags,"Umbrella Academy, Jupiter's Legacy, Locke & Key. Move over Marvel/DC, the indie comics are taking over."
Super Drags,No Altered Carbon?
Super Drags,No Ozark s3?
Super Drags,Does anyone know what bird box is? Is it a tv show or movie? I know about all the other shows or movies except for bird box.

Super Drags,I loved the graphic comics. I hope they do them justice. 
Super Drags,Guess I won't need to buy the rest of the books :)
Super Drags,"This was the biggest part of the trailer/reveal to me, one of my favorite shows when I was a teen."
Super Drags,"They have to do a second season of OA to explain the first.  Theres like 3 different meanings behind what people see in the season.  Personally i believe the most radical idea, that there was only ever 1 actual person captured in the basement, the rest were coping mechanisms for the first.  "
Super Drags,"Never have I binged a show that was so problematic yet so bloody fascinating from end to end.

Also, a bit of cool trivia: The filmmaker/director, Zal Batmanglij, is the brother of Rostam Batmanglij of Vampire Weekend fame."
Super Drags,"Weird as hell, but I was so hooked.  I hope Netflix gives it a chance to tell it's whole story, though after the cancellation of Sense8, my hopes aren't high that'll it'll make it to season 3 :\"
Super Drags,I've watched it twice now and every episode just makes me want to watch the next one but I'm never sure if I enjoy it or if I just want to know what happens next
Super Drags,"Im with you, really waiting for that season 3, people sleep so much on The Last Kingdom."
Super Drags,Can I get a source on that? Tried looking it up and can't find anything
Super Drags,"Last season?

"
Super Drags,Are you sure?  NPH said a while ago that he was not returning for another season of it on his twitter and he has not posted ANYTHING related to the show.  
Super Drags,"Yeah, that one has me excited. I loved the original comic series. "
Super Drags,Even the creator of Travelers is confused: https://twitter.com/bradtravelers/status/1041766568722456576
Super Drags,"They'll suck as much as they can from those contracts, since Disney/Marvel isn't doing another one."
Super Drags,"I don't get where they could go with a Jessica Jones 3, the last one was too long \[again\]"
Super Drags,yeah as someone who doesn't watch the marvel shows I'm not too excited about this list
Super Drags,"for the better. they would cancel it after one or two stellar seasons. they need sweet, sweet space for simpsons and x-files, you know?"
Super Drags,They both haven't been renewed either. I'm pretty sure they will be though.
Super Drags,"It's because the Twitter account that posted it is Netflixs official twitter account for sci-fi and similar stuff

https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix

Welcome to NX: The @netflix space to live everything super, sci-fi, the fantastic, and beyond."
Super Drags,"It's in the video like right at the beginning, but not in op's list."
Super Drags,Two seasons of that boring and sour breaking bad rip off is bad enough.
Super Drags,I think bird box might be based on the book by josh malerman. It was a good post-apocalyptic thriller. Super creepy. 
Super Drags,"It's an upcoming film (scheduled to release on december 21), starring Sandra Bullock and Sarah Paulson.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_Box_(film)

"
Super Drags,"No, at least not the text ones in the end (and probably not a good part of the others either) "
Super Drags,I totally forget about that little gem! I hope its brilliant!
Super Drags,"I think Chilling Adventures of Sabrina will be a good indicator, considering it’s also a popular horror comic."
Super Drags,I never even considered that idea... I love that idea. 
Super Drags,Sorta hoping the second season is the final one. I love the show but don't know if I really trust Netflix to no cancel it like they have done with many other shows. 
Super Drags,"The ending was so god damn awful, I WANT to watch season 2."
Super Drags,Sense8 cost a fuckton more money to make than the OA. I mean their biggest expense is a choreographer 
Super Drags,I remember reading an article where the OA creators said they already have it laid out for 5 seasons and Netflix executives were really receptive towards it. I really hope we can make it there too! Just seems like I'll be dead before all 5 are released with how long it is taking them to release 2. 
Westside,"Congrats OP, a bunch of click bait sites are going plagiarize this and itll pop up on my home page some time next week."
Westside,"I shit you not, I am currently re-watching Friends and had this exact same thought. You however, took it to the next level.

How the hell did they get away with it? For anybody watching at the time, was it ever mentioned? I really hope this doesn't get buried.

There was also that thing about who was best friends with who amongst the guys on both shows.

Edit: I'm pretty sure they stole a bit about someone else sitting in their usual seats at the bar too, like in Friends when someone is sat in their normal seats at the coffee house."
Westside,"Even though I greatly prefer How I Met Your Mother (ignoring the finale), it's almost impossible to deny that it's an unapologetic ripoff of FRIENDS."
Westside,"> Joey (womanizer) dates Rachel, Ross’s ex 	

> Barney (womanizer) dates Robin, Ted’s ex

Maybe the biggest difference between the shows. Joey+Rachel lasted a few episodes and the writers were smart enough to scrap it. Barney+Robin lasted 6(?) seasons and many fans felt like there was no going back."
Westside,New Girl is also basically LA Friends.
Westside,"I would venture it's more a similarity in the style of relationship sitcoms that these are more so than these two shows in particular. I would bet you could find a lot of similarities if you compared another show to these two like ""Rules of Engagement."" Most of these writers in Hollywood work on multiple shows or borrow ideas from each other."
Westside,Wow! The birthday one being the same actress- that must have been on purpose? Hilarious nonetheless.
Westside,"They both had pretty lame sixth seasons and ninth seasons compared to the rest of the show.

Mind you, I don’t mind HIMYM season 9 (And the finale, though it could have been an entire tenth season (Or at least mini-season). But it’s definitely lame.

Also, Janice’s actress is in both shows. Don’t know if you noted that."
Westside,Awesome list. Looks like it took a lot of effort.
Westside,It is almost.. almost like there is a formula to these shows.
Westside,"40 years old, if single we get married. Ted x Robin, Phoebe x joey/ross"
Westside,Ross knew Rachel in high school since she was his sister's friend.  Ted doesn't meet Robin until the show starts.
Westside,Ross’s ex is Carol not Susan. Great list though!
Westside,Only thing is that “Friends” is infinitely better than “Boy meets umbrella girl who later dies and turns out to be a dumb pay off/HIMYM”.
Westside,"There are also lots of similarities between HIMYM and Scrubs, two shows I have rewatched multiple times. Stylistically they are completely different but plotwise they often dip into similar stories and jokes. 


The one that instantely comes to my mind is when both JD and Ted move out of the shared appartment. First their best friends, who for both happen to be couples, are happy about it and they enjoy their newly found freedom (having sex outside the bedroom for example). But quickly after both couples realise that JD/Ted were super reliable flatmates and did a lot of the chores around the appartment. They also realise that their best friend is fun to hang out with. In short, they start missing them and are glad when JD/Ted move back in. There are differences as to why and how but overall it plays  into the similar joke.


I guess similarities like these are bound to happen, if your show is about a group of friends who spend every single day of the week together."
Westside,"I thought it was always pretty obvious that HIMYM was ripping off Friends? Or at least, heavily inspired by it. I still liked HIMYM way better, series finale aside."
Westside,I believe neither was filmed in New York
Westside,Now add a column for Cheers!  And one for Happy Days!
Westside,"A character is dumped on her birthday. In both shows, that character was played by the same person - Anne Dudek."
Westside,And they are both equally bad for different reasons. HIMY story and writing went to shit by the final few seasons and it ended so poorly that it tainted the entire show. Friends the charm of the 90s wears off pretty quickly and the entire cast is horrible people that you desperatly want to find something good about them to no avail and with no redeming qualities with your main characters why bother watching.
Westside,How did you make a table?
Westside,[deleted]
Westside,Unpopular opinion - they both sucked
Westside,HIMYM is “Friends” with “Seinfeld” quality writing.
Westside,Man add Seinfeld to both are copied form it
Westside,"I got one . 
The Fight with bullies in Friends, and In himym. Both was because of the booth , and the both groups were scared to fight."
Westside,I don't think so since it's not new information on an old show. It's impressive op laid out specific examples but when HIMYM was still on air plenty was pointed out about how it was friends with a bar instead of a coffee shop.
Westside,12 similarities....YOU WONT believe number 6!!
Westside,Yeah he should've watermarked it
Westside,Lmafoaoooo we are so monitored this day and age
Westside,It was well known. If you have Hulu or access to himym go watch the opening scene of S2e7 - Swarley (great episode btw). The make a bit about how hanging around a bar is more fun than a coffee place.
Westside,"To your question - how did they get away with it?

One - because the show is still entertaining.

Two - because similarities are to be expected in this genre. A group of friends hanging out together for 10ish seasons only has so many combinations of new factors, especially between the same 5 or 6 characters. Things like cheating, pregnancy, jobs, marriage, hanging out in bars, relationships with coworkers, etc., etc., etc., these are all very common tropes within ""hangout"" shows.

Admittedly, this one is hilarious:

> Mike dumps Precious on her birthday.  
> Ted dumps Natalie (the same actress) on her birthday."
Westside,"To be clear, I enjoyed both shows and didn't make this to say HIMYM is a Friends ""knockoff""."
Westside,"HIMYM was pretty much marketed as *""New Friends""* in some places"
Westside,"I watched HIMYM during the original run and these similarities where part of the reason why I liked it so much.

Friends happened during an era when I was a kid and HIMYM started off when I was in college, so it was a lot easier to identify with."
Westside,I mean I saw it more as referential than anything. Friends itself  has its roots in even earlier sitcoms.
Westside,Friends is a rip-off of a 1992 Fox show nobody remembers called [Down the Shore](https://youtu.be/UKGEw2EX99Y).
Westside,"Friends also ripped off the plot to Living  Single, according to Queen Latifah"
Westside,"That’s because many fans loved the pairing and a lot of the backlash to the finale was undoing it. 

Ross and Rachel were THE hottest thing on tv since like season 1 and I think everyone knew Friends was going to be about whether they got together. Also Ross was more likeable than Ted and Joey was a bit too much of a one comedic character until he started dating Rachel while Barney had a little more depth."
Westside,[deleted]
Westside,Also shot with a single camera and no laugh track.
Westside,The characters on New Girl are miles ahead of any character on friends
Westside,Not really.  The base template is kind of similar but the shows themselves are very different unlike HIMYM which is extremely similar.
Westside,"Yeah I think that can be found in all of the sitcoms of the same concept so there are those same concepts. New Girl or TBBT are the same, I'm sure there are some that are shared.

Then you have the family concept (The Middle, Modern Family, Malcolm in the Middle,...) which I'm sure are sharing some stuff too. Same for the workplace (Parks & Rec, B99, Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock).

I'm not sure there are that much similarities though because when you see it like that, it makes a lot. But HIMYM was always advertised as the new Friends."
Westside,"Season 6 was one of my favorites of HIMYM. Not up to Seasons 2-4, but still one of the better ones, IMO. Barney's and Marshall's arcs with their respective fathers was great. The Captain was an extremely well done character. There were a ton of standout episodes including Natural History, The Mermaid Theory, the Clue episode, the countdown episode, Blitzgiving, Last Words..."
Westside,Also Ross and Monica's mother is the same actress as Lily's grandmother.
Westside,A lot of these are oversimplifications to prove the point.
Westside,Ha. Can't believe I missed that. Updated!
Westside,"Yea Ted reminded me of JD a TON.

I think Ted even drank an appletini at one point.  The Bromance with marshall was imilar.  Their both overly sensitive, obsessed with their hair etc - even kind of look like each other.

And they both dated Sara Chalke!"
Westside,The rightmost button in the editor
Westside,"Barney's brother James is Wayne Brady. 

Ross dates Aisha Tyler at some point."
Westside, Touch and hold a clip to pin it. Unpinned clips will be deleted after 1r knkjjnfrstgynzatigyy nnawu
Westside,buzzfeed will do it for sure
Westside,Friends did it. Central Perk was shown to be a bar before the owner sold it and was remade into a coffee shop.
Westside,"There was such a big gap between the last time I watched Friends and the first time I watched HIMYM (I think I got into it when the last season was still airing) that only the blatantly obvious things I noticed were the setting, 3 guys 3 girls etc. But when OP has laid it out like, this, Jesus. It's as if they just stole bits from it and rehashed it slightly."
Westside,Also has a Cheers reference at the end of that episode
Westside,"I think a lot of what makes HIMYM interesting too is that they were using the same format and general idea of friends, but made it way more meta and absurd. A lot of HIMYM is making fun of itself, between the family guy style cutaways, the musical numbers, the running gags, and narration of the show make it absurd in a good way. It also happens to have some pretty decent writing and some fun characters."
Westside,"On some level, its also just checking off a bunch of common 'life things you go through in their 20s\30s', its just an updated version for a new generation."
Westside,"Yeah, no doubt the show was still entertaining. However, when it's laid out like OP has, you have to admit that 'similarities' is a bit of a stretch."
Westside,Precious/Natalie also died on House and was one of the girls cloned in the Wayans Bros classic White Chicks.
Westside,"Yeah, I mean I think if you take any other show with the same premise - for instance, family sitcoms where there's 3 children - you'd find there's a ton of overlapping points too. For instance there's a lot of shows that have ""character volunteers at an old folks' home, but either their old person dies or just doesn't like them""."
Westside,"Even if it is, there's nothing wrong with a well done knockoff. Which i think most people would agree it was, at least until it ended, where opinions diverge."
Westside,"> HYMIM

How You Met I Mother"
Westside,"Whoa, wait, this just taught me that Pamela Adlon is Pamela Segall Adlon, and she was Oji in TNG.

I only ever think about her voice or how she looks more recently..."
Westside,And all of us who watched both shows when they originally aired can confirm this.
Westside,I thought most people hated Joey+Rachel for existing at all.
Westside,"And IMO a better show, but that is subjective."
Westside,Written to be a single camera format show vs. a 4 camera with a mostly live audience.
Westside,hard disagree but Winston is one of the best characters of any show anywhere but they dont write him correctly until 3 seasons in
Westside,"Yeah like Ted not marrying Stella because of Robin, when it was because Stella left with Tony"
Westside,These similarities were discusses a decade ago though. This is just formulaic tv [https://lukraakvars.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/friends-vs-himym/](https://lukraakvars.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/friends-vs-himym/)
Westside,Who’s the third girl in himym?
Westside,I mean they're all just typical sitcom plots
Westside,Yea this was basically the point which made sense because it replaced coffee with alcohol. It really was just an updated friend's for people who didn't grow up on friends.
Westside,"himym characters were a lot stronger the friends, having the straight man passed around between people instead of it being focused in one(chandler) made it a lot better"
Westside,I liked the concept because I think the characters themselves made sense they were portrayed as the two most conventionally desirable people on the show who had the most outgoing personalities and the actual start to their relationship was pretty good. They just threw it completely away when it made sense and then revisited it way later when the moment had passed AND by that point Joey was too much of caricature to take seriously
Westside,"To give Tony some credit, he did try giving Ted that sweet job designing a murder house."
Westside,The mother but in reality it was just whoever Ted was dating
Westside,updated friend's what
Westside,Haha true
Westside,"I know it's messy right now, I'm updating the format and trying to squeeze in as much info as I can. Any help finding sources would be much appreciated. =)"
Westside,"An useful list for a hopeless TV addict like myself, thank you."
Westside,Breaking Bad comes back August 11
Westside,"I really hope Go On gets renewed. I know I'll be hated for this, but it reminds me of Community, but better. I like Community, especially the first three seasons, but it's gotten way too self referential and meta. Go On reminds me of early Community, and hopefully we get more of it."
Westside,"Mad Men is ending in it's seventh season, not the 6th if I recall."
Westside,Community is on the uncertain renewal twice 
Westside,"Mad Men is currently airing its sixth season in the summer, not in the fall, and I'm pretty certain that the series finale will take place in season 7, not season 6. "
Westside,Missing Southland
Westside,I will definitely save this. Thanks 
Westside,"Has Whitney been cancelled?

"
Westside,"You have on your list ""•Untitled John Mulaney/Lorne Michaels Comedy"" and ""•Untitled Lorne Michales/John Mulaney Project"" Might want to get rid of one unless they are working on two projects :).
"
Westside,Forgot Rectify! Started last night
Westside,Boardwalk Empire and Homeland should both be returning in September.
Westside,"Why is 2 Broke Girls listed as a summer show?

There seems to be some duplicates too, like the Untitled JJ Abrams series and Sleepy Hollow, unless there's going to be two different versions.

Shocked to see The Tomorrow People listed, it turns out that it is a remake of the British series. I'm sure I remember watching that."
Westside,"I'm pretty sure the Cleveland show isn't going to get renewed.

I'll be kinda sad if castle won't return."
Westside,Archer's final episode of the season was aired last week
Westside,"Smash is all but cancelled.  I work at an NBC affiliate and they're not even *talking* about it.  No promos, no marketing whatsoever.  It's dead."
Westside,"Needs just a few corrections, but its more than I could do. Great list, I appreciate it."
Westside,you're missing warehouse 13
Westside,Do you have insider access to which pilot shows that have been picked up or are you predicting them based off Deadline's pilot watch?
Transfers,"Haha nice try, no dice."
Transfers,"It's not an act of kindness or good will, they're gonna toughen up on account sharing for sure.

Good luck to the guy betting on more people actually getting their own accounts instead of pivoting to piracy again."
Transfers,If I can’t leach off of my moms Netflix anymore I’m not buying a subscription
Transfers,"You know, I didn't want to pay for what I was getting for free, but now that you've made it easy to do so, here's my money! /s"
Transfers,"> On Monday, **Netflix is launching Profile Transfer, a feature that lets anyone on an existing account migrate their profile to a brand-new account while preserving all of their personalized recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games and other settings.**


> **Profile Transfer, which Netflix says has been “much requested” by customers, will roll out to all members worldwide starting Monday**. Users will be notified by email when Profile Transfer becomes available on their account...

> **Netflix developed the profile-transfer feature for a test launched in March in three countries — Chile, Costa Rica and Peru — to address illicit password sharing. In that test, members who share their accounts with people outside their households are able to pick lower-cost options to add those password-piggybackers as “Extra Members.”** As part of that test, Netflix lets subscribers transfer user profiles to either a new account or an Extra Member account. In August, Netflix launched a separate test of an “add a home” feature (in Argentina, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras) to enable access for non-household users at a price lower than a full standalone membership...

> **Netflix’s moves to try to wring revenue from password-sharers** comes as the streaming giant hit a wall in subscriber growth — and in fact **shed 1.2 million subscribers in the first six months of 2022.** The company is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 earnings Tuesday, Oct. 18, after market close. 


A day before their Q3 report.

Edit:

Netflix 2017: [Love is sharing a password](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/840276073040371712)"
Transfers,Wildly delusional.
Transfers,">Password Freeloaders

Nice loaded language there. How about this:

""Penny-Pinching Corporation Raises Prices Despite Shrinking Library and Cancelling Originals in Order to Make it Easier for Subscribers to Quit."""
Transfers,"I don’t think Netflix understands why we pay for multiple screens.  

This will only cost Netflix money from me if I can no longer share my password to locations outside of my house"
Transfers,"“Password feeeloaders”

Pretty sure it was called “sharing is loving” by themselves just a few years ago. Also, Netflix has been openly charging people for having more simultaneous screen for YEARS now, they’ve profited it from people sharing”"
Transfers,"i still dont understand how this is supposed to work. there are a few places that i personally use my own paid-for netflix account, how are they distinguishing the difference between someone you shared the account with, and just using your own account somewhere else?"
Transfers,"Netflix’s problem is that they failed to convince enough people that their service had value. Once people get used to stealing something, making it easier for them to purchase it does nothing to convince them it was ever worth paying for in the first place."
Transfers,"Dear Variety,

Thanks for showing your bias in the title, letting me know your article isn’t worth reading."
Transfers,"Ah yes, because a profile that recommends the same shows to everyone is worth paying."
Transfers,"This would have been useful several years ago. Unless I can merge a profile from an old account that hasn't been touched in 3 years with a profile on a different account that has been used the past 3 years, this isn't currently useful to me."
Transfers,"This is the carrot. The stick, I assume, is forthcoming"
Transfers,I just use a family members acct. Not really that invested in Netflix so don't see the point of having a profile.
Transfers,That’s not the barrier keeping people from getting their own accounts.
Transfers,They don’t grasp the definition of freeloaders.
Transfers,I wonder if I could transfer my profile on a torrent website...mmmm...
Transfers,"Lololololol. Yes the reason why they weren’t switching was because they we’re afraid they’d lose their curated library and where they were on specific shows and not…you know, not having to pay for it"
Transfers,I cancelled my Netflix for the first time since 2012.
Transfers,I'm paying Netflix in exposure
Transfers,"What about when I have some freeloaders come over to my house and watch my Netflix account with me?  Are they stealing Netflix because 5 of us are watching instead of just me, the only person who paid?"
Transfers,"Let's see what's new and good on netflix this week?

Nothing?

OK then I'll go back to the other services i sub to"
Transfers,"'password freeloaders' 

fuck off you pieces of shit."
Transfers,This would have been great when the lady and I consolidated accounts over a year ago...
Transfers,"Freeloader?! Excuse me, I prefer saying I have a Parasite account."
Transfers,"And yet, when someone stole my account and I could verify all of the information that had been there less than 24 hours prior, they couldn’t give me back my account."
Transfers,"Netflix really overestimates itself. They really think we are gonna pay 20$ a month for a platform that releases 3 good movies and shows in a year.
No, thank you."
Transfers,"Oh damn I think Netflix is about to have a seriously hard reality check.

I have my in-laws account but can't tell you the last time I actually watched Nf. If they stop password sharing, I don't think I'll even notice."
Transfers,"Do you want me to cancel and pirate your content, because this is how you get me to cancel and pirate your content"
Transfers,"Finally! I've been waiting so long for this, because their impeccable algorithm that recommends stuff based on what I have watched and liked is so amazing and the idea of having to start out from zero on a new account has been the one thing that has kept me from getting my own account.
 
#/s"
Transfers,"Netflix is still calling my mom names, I see."
Transfers,"“No, I don’t think I will”"
Transfers,"The same company  that promised unlimited dvd rentals then throttled you if you returned them to quick now has profile sharing after they were rather open about the fact they didn’t care people shared log in information 

Oh Netflix I quit you a long long time ago.  I would sign up for blockbuster online again before I give you another shot"
Transfers,">Freeloaders

Piracy all day"
Transfers,Lol. Pirating is free and Netflix is getting more expensive every year. It’s a nobrainer really.
Transfers,Like how they skew against the public by calling people “freeloaders”. Great way to demean those who share with family and friends.
Transfers,My mom owns the account. I pay for it. Everyone in the family enjoys.
Transfers,"Why do I need to transfer my account, works just fine and free."
Transfers,What the fuck. “Makes it easier!” As if it’s a benefit somehow. I hate neo-feudalism so much lol.
Transfers,"Just deleted my account after being hacked even though I haven't been subscribed this year. They somehow managed to change my accounts phone, and then email address. Luckily, Netflix dealt with the issue quickly. But there's no way I'm coming back after this security issue."
Transfers,No thanks Netflix.
Transfers,Password freeloaders is an amazing phrase! Haha
Transfers,"Everyone complaining about having to pay for Netflix, thousands of film workers salute you. Thanks for considering us."
Transfers,"I want the opposite. My wife and I don't use netflix separately enough to justify two accounts, but we both have tons of stuff saved in our profiles. Instead of being able to export a profile to a new account, I want to be able to merge two profiles into one account."
Transfers,"My folks use my Netflix, I use their Amazon prime. Win win."
Transfers,HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ZERO CHANCE IM GOING TO USE THAT.
Transfers,[deleted]
Transfers,"Yeah but there’s other uses for the feature too. Seems fairly common for people to share Netflix accounts among friends and significant others, and sometimes people fall out with those they share an account with. It’s nice you can rescue your profile from an account you’d rather not keep using or else might soon lose access to. Or maybe you just want to join a different account instead of the one your profile is on. It’s a good feature to have even if you never plan on using it, just maybe not 100% for the reasons Netflix imagines"
Transfers,The moment Netflix pulls sharing I'm out. I'd have been gone a long time ago but my kids use my account.
Transfers,Eh.. it's not a bad thing. You share your password with a spouse and want to transfer your shit after a breakup. Or you move out of your home or whatever.
Transfers,"I’ve already cancelled and started my own Kodi library. It’s filled with exactly what I want and costs essentially nothing, and requires very little maintaining once it’s set up. 

Im past paying for tv now."
Transfers,"Adobe had the best stance on understanding piracy: Basically they would rather someone use a pirated version of Photoshop than use their competitor’s software.

Although they did switch to a subscription model. I have no idea how that effected piracy of their products?"
Transfers,[deleted]
Transfers,Aye Aye Matey
Transfers,"Netflix is the only thing I pay for because they started the streaming wars

6,7,8 shit I don’t even know how long of a loyal customer.

But the prices went from 7.99 to like $24 all in now?

It’s getting too expensive ."
Transfers,Where are all these dumb Netflix dick riders coming from? Are they seriously happy that they lose features and deals? It's so stupid
Transfers,"So.... ummm.... problem solved.

Why do you think THEY needed YOU?"
Transfers,"Good, fuck off

Edit: I revel in your irrational netflix hating downvotes"
Transfers,Convenience has always been a huge argument for paying for a service like this. I'm baffled people here see it as a net-negative somehow.
Transfers,That’s exactly the argument pro piracy been using since Napster lol.
Transfers,This plus the rushed launch of the advertising tier have me firmly believing that Netflix are going to report further subscriber losses in a worse than expected set of Q3 results. This all has the feel of preemptive damage control. Might be Q4 before we see a return to subscriber gains. I expect Europe to have performed particularly poorly given the economic hardships there right now.
Transfers,How dare they ask people to pay to use a product.
Transfers,[Yep.](https://twitter.com/netflix/status/840276073040371712?s=20&t=QmhRI7KYVAFE_lbZX-upyw)
Transfers,The same way that credit card company fraud algorithms are very good at distinguishing between your personal shady purchases and actual fraud.
Transfers,[deleted]
Transfers,"Well, some people pay only to know what episoded they have already watched and what they still haven't! 🤣"
Transfers,"It was the barrier keeping me from making my own account last year, when my brother stopped paying for his Netflix sub that I had a profile on. I ended up paying for his account myself, since there was an option to take my own history with me and have my own account."
Transfers,I canceled mine a few months ago. This company lost sight of what made them good.
Transfers,Cool pimp
Transfers,What are you gonna do about 1899 man?
Transfers,"Yeah, relative of mine had several profiles for a few of us within the family and cancelled when Netflix changed the rules and increased the price. Then had to contact them four months after because someone in Hong Kong had somehow got into the account and changed email and phone number while the account was dormant due to Netflix's policy of keeping an account for six months after cancellation in case of a return (unlikely in this case).

The hacking had happened twice before, too."
Transfers,"No worries fam I'll pay more for a worse service so that executives can have more money and you have exactly the same.

On second thoughts, nah."
Transfers,If they do it in India ( where netflix has lost miserably) their subscriptions in the country will halve
Transfers,I love it when people espouse completely wrong things as facts with complete confidence. Netflix's most mature market is US.
Transfers,Shitty Technology Adoption Curve.
Transfers,"Honestly I’ve just heard of this and love this new feature. I share an account with someone who lives with me and have been thinking of getting my own because I might move. I had actually been not excited at the thought of having to start a new profile on a new account. Not that profiles matter THAT much, but this one’s already tailored to me and has my watch list, so it’s great I can now just zap it over to a new account when I move."
Transfers,"How are they ever going to limit sharing within a family like this? Just because we're at different addresses doesn't mean i can't get a one-time password, get something activated, etc..."
Transfers,"Well, there are pre-cracked versions of Creative Cloud 2022 on torrent sites, so I'd guess not very much."
Transfers,reminds me of [this classic](https://pics.me.me/who-would-win-the-entire-adobe-creative-cloud-suite-one-43141643.png)
Transfers,"Very true, but they also offer enterprise software. Their actual money is made on the B2B end of things, rather than B2C.

With Netflix, there's no B2B market segment like that."
Transfers,"Exactly. When HBOMax launched, it was $15/month- the most expensive single service offered at the time. That $15 goes SO much farther considering how much good shit is on HBOMax. 

Like in 2022 alone I’ve watched over a dozen originals as soon as they air, as well as 25+ docs and mini-series’s. I’m not a superhero/action fan, but the Warner back catalog is DEEP, especially now that they’ve added criterion.  I’m not sifting for hours to find a semidecent movie- there’s always something I love available to rewatch or something I want to see new to the platform. That’s not even getting into all the older tv shows, both quality HBO originals and Warner-produced, easy watching stuff like Friends. 

Meanwhile Netflix has… Dahmer? Generic action movies that cost way too much? I guess the crown is okay, but I bet it’d be better if it was made by HBO. And they had some really great movies for a bit before an unscripted exec steered the company away from the auteur-driven prestige stuff (Roma, mank, marriage story, Irishman, etc).

I’m pumped for white noise and another season of black mirror, but I’m not gonna subscribe just for that. I can’t justify paying $2.75/hour of use on Netflix when my HBOMax usage averages out to less than $.30/hour - for better, more consistent content."
Transfers,Dick riders is a bit harsh lol but I agree I’m also surprised with the amount of people who are apparently ok with this. They must be the ones paying for everyone’s accounts
Transfers,"In a sea of horrible streaming services that lose their value relatively quickly, it’s so strange how much people want others to hate Netflix in the depths of their souls."
Transfers,They just launched a feature aimed at that person
Transfers,[deleted]
Transfers,Netflix is gonna go under without this dude’s 10 bucks a month
Transfers,Money
Transfers,Netflix isn’t going to text you back bro
Transfers,Thanks for paying for my content🥰
Transfers,"This small convenience might be the deciding factor in x-amount of users actually signing up for paid plans. As long as the costs for coding it weren’t that high, this is an easy smart move that will surely eek out some amount of retention. That so many redditors don’t see that just speaks to their own lack of savvy"
Transfers,"I was really surprised about this too. Seems like a smart move on Netflix’s end. Creating your own account should be as convenient as possible. Them however adding restrictions about using the same IP and whatnot is bullshit since those were the terms of the agreement and it is unethical to change it post factum.

This crowd is crazy sometimes like when everyone here was mad that adobe charges you when you cancel your yearly subscription which is specifically cheaper than the monthly subscription. They also clearly let you know about this when you get said subscription. The entitlement is something to behold."
Transfers,"Anything Netflix does short of cutting prices in half is going to be seen as a negative by this sub.  And even then, I'm sure the top comment would still be, 'Yeah, still not gonna subscribe.'"
Transfers,"I think a big part of it is that Netflix has lost a lot of audience goodwill. These days, consumers (at least in the US) are pretty critical of them. 

They've already pissed people off with things like early cancellations, declining quality of original content, and rising prices. So people are poised to be critical from the outset with this kind of thing."
Transfers,"Families that share plans and such will now be forced to pay more. How is that a net positive for these users?

Netflix already doubled its profits in the past two years from 2.7 billion to over 5.4 billion. And I guarantee you that the people making these decisions make far more money than your average poster.

It’s a decision made out of greed. Because it’s never enough for these people. They need more vacation homes, private jets, yachts, islands, etc…"
Transfers,"Inputting someone else's password is more convenient than paying for it yourself.  


By golly, I think you're onto something. It's all about the convenience."
Transfers,"I mean this isn't piracy, they allowed it until their numbers stopped growing to infinity."
Transfers,"In term of new content, Q3 was abysmal imo. Only 'The Sandman' was interesting, didn't care for the other 100+ series that were released during Q3."
Transfers,"People DO pay to use a product. My mother pays for four screens so all of her kids can watch Netflix on her account. 

If Netflix doesn’t want that to happen, I would be happy to help her change her subscription to pay for 1 screen."
Misty,"It is one of my favorite episodes in all of TV.

""I don't understand what's happening.""

""Me neither ... ... it's OK.""

And yeah, from the karaoke *Homeward Bound* all the way to the end of the episode is just straight waterworks for me."
Misty,"It's so emotional. That ""then you come over to my house"" after he'd been shot by him. 

And then he walks into his own dark home expecting it to be empty and it's not. Not at all."
Misty,"Season 2 was so good all the way around. The acting by everyone, especially Justin Theroux, is really top tier. I think that anyone who gets invested in the show and characters would have an extremely difficult time not tearing up during the karaoke scene.

My biggest complaint with The Leftovers is that it's one of the greatest shows I've ever seen that I feel like I can't recommend to anybody."
Misty,Season 3 gets a little more surreal but is ultimately worth it and the ending is one of those that will keep rolling around in your head for a while as you think it over. I wish I could watch this show again for the first time. What a masterpiece.
Misty,">when John asks “what if no one is ?” And he says “then come over to my house

Theroux’s performance on this show gets overshadowed by Carrie Coon (who wouldn't), but he is a monster in this episode. There so much determination and humanity in that moment.

And the whole scene is such a perfect example of the show’s “hope and humanity in the face of grief and nihilism” ethos. I love it."
Misty,"""I don't understand what's happening. Me neither. It's okay. Okay. Okay. It's okay. You okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What if there's nobody home? Then you come over to my house"".

The emotions I felt seeing John and Kevin with everyone else at his house. Ffs I was so moved. 

I wouldn't be upset if they ended it there....if we weren't living in a reality where the INCREDIBLE and arguably better, season 3 is an actual thing. 

Top 5 season finale for me."
Misty,"* will i forget them?
* never."
Misty,'...nope.'
Misty,"> the most emotional ~20 mins of TV I’ve ever seen

using this to recommend station eleven for a similar reason- the finale of S11 has *my* most emotional 20 minutes of tv I've ever seen.

Anyway, Leftovers rules."
Misty,"I love the whole show and that episode, but my favorite moment is when Erika runs onto the bridge. It's such an intense scene from so many angles. We see her relief in thinking that she has found her daughter, only to realize that something is wrong and that she actually doesn't really ""know' her. Chokes me up every time, Regina King kills it."
Misty,In my opinion it's the best season finale I've ever seen. It has a little bit of everything and it's so uniquely chaotic and special.
Misty,"I watched this show as s3 aired live, and just finished my first rewatch a few weeks ago. Man, this show is something else. Total masterpiece from start to finish."
Misty,This is the pinnacle of tv for me. The leftovers isn’t in my top 2 but that’s because it’s not as fun to watch as my favourites. I do however think it could be the finest show ever aired and this episode is unmatched perfection.
Misty,Incredible episode. The ending with Kevin looking at everyone in his house and then ending with Nora was masterfully done.
Misty,"I genuinely think once you understand the stakes and put yourself in the mind of the characters both in the town and outside of it, season 2 is the finest, deepest, most interesting single season of tv I’ve ever seen. Well put."
Misty,"I've felt the itch to rewatch this show for the past few years, now. I just don't know if I can. It's the ultimate catharsis."
Misty,Might be my favorite show ever. Glad you’re enjoying it!
Misty,This whole season was the absolute best.
Misty,You will never stop thinking about the Leftovers.
Misty,"Season 1 was good, Seasons 2 and 3 are some of my favorite seasons in all of television. 

Enjoy season 3, it's another doozy."
Misty,"One of my favorite shows of all time. 

Funny story, I’m an aspiring writer and I was working on a script a few years before season 2 was out. And my script featured a character stuck in the afterlife who had to sing karaoke in order to gain entry back into the real world. 

I was dumbstruck when I saw the season 2 finale. In my own script, I never landed on which song the protagonist would have to sing, but “Homeward Bound” would have been perfect.

Obviously it’s all just a coincidence, but I guess it felt pretty good that Damon Lindelof and I both thought up the same crazy idea."
Misty,"I loved season 1 but kinda hated seasons 2 and 3.  The cult who's whole deal is they don't want people to forget the rapture (sorry, forgot the term the show uses) targets and attacks the only town to talks about it daily and makes sure people don't forget."
Misty,Is that the season where Cousin Larry from Bosom Buddies shows up? Because that was cool.
Misty,"I find it funny how the season 2 finale seems to be so fondly remembered because I recall reactions being mixed at the time. 

A lot of people thought it went out with a whimper given Meg’s grand plan for Jarden turned out to be her simply walking in."
Misty,"dont forget the soundtrack. it just perfectly fits its situations.

i think it was the first show i watched of this kind. with the trailer i thought its something scifi'ish and almost dropped it after the first episode. it just wasnt what i expected. i think there was a preview for the rest of the season after the third episoded. it looked intresting enough to keep watching and im SO glad i did."
Misty,Pretty sure I cry every time I see that final exchange “what if no one’s home” “you can come to my house” 😭
Misty,"[The scene, for those interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-auEtFgEToE)"
Misty,"That show has a few scenes that are just some of the best in television, ever.   This is my favorite from season 3.   The Wrong Kevin.  

https://youtu.be/qIFfzM3ZAx4"
Misty,"But also, they way he says “Nope” is one of the funniest things in the whole show."
Misty,"Yeah if it was any other show he would be the bad guy, or at least fully cemented as one by the time he shoots Kevin, but how they humanized him at the end and their ability to still care for each other.. amazing."
Misty,"I've gone a step further than recommending and talked someone into re-watching it with me (their first time.)

I was recommended it by a friend, who told me about the guilty remnant, I was intrigued by that."
Misty,Get new friends you can recommend it to!
Misty,I had the ending of season 3 in my head for weeks after. And that performance by Carrie Coon. So phenomenal.
Misty,Szn 3 ending is perfection. One of the most emotional moments in all of television.
Misty,"Shot, reverse shot"
Misty,"ATFEC are the real heroes of that season

When they drone bombed that Guilty Remnant party I cheered and fist pumped"
Misty,"I always felt Christopher Ecclestone was the best performance on the show, each of his individual episodes were incredible and I think his performance in no room at the Inn was my favourite in the show"
Misty,Such an incredible scene and when I really felt the show was special. This scene and the one where Tom takes Wayne's story and tells it to the group are so emotionally impacting
Misty,Yeah I liked that show a lot too. This was a little better for me but both are great
Misty,Regina King is amazing. For some reason the bomb stuff didn’t grab me quite as much but I think part of that is that I’m just so frustrated at them lol. Which I’m sure is intentional on the writers part so still expertly playing with my emotions
Misty,Love to hear that
Misty,What are your favorites?
Misty,I just did it recently and thought it was totally worth it. Appreciated it even more a second time around.
Misty,"Haha great minds! Yeah it’s wild how well that song works in the context of the show, almost feels like he heard it first then wrote the show around it"
Misty,"I mean, it's more than just wanting people not to forget it. They want people to be incapable of moving past it, they want them to be existentially adrift and captured by the trauma of it indefinitely.






It happened and now there can never be 'normal' again."
Misty,"Same.  I really don't get the love for this show.  So much in fact I gave it a second watch just to make sure I wasn't missing something.  Loved the weirdness, style, and story in season one but found the rest incredibly boring.  I did appreciate the acting though, some really talented actors who did an amazing job, but show didn't connect with me."
Misty,How did the Emmys miss the acting nomination and win?
Misty,I’ve somehow managed to avoid most of John Murphy’s actors  work but he was so good at that role in the leftovers. I have Snowfall and Blindspotting on my to watch list so I’ll see him in something new again eventually but in the meantime I see him regularly every time I rewatch The Leftovers 😂 and yes I already commented else where but I love that exchange
Misty,"It’s the best series finale ever. The entire episode was just perfect. 

Six Feet Under has the great epilogue, but Leftovers has the best episode"
Misty,"When they dance at the wedding to Otis Redding, waterworks every time."
Misty,"Same, best performance for me too!"
Misty,Matt Libs in the finale!!
Misty,"because of this post i started rewatching it damn. i watched first two last night, watching it with knowledge feels great."
Misty,"I get teary eyed just thinking about Kevin singing Homeward Bound. The whole sequence and payoff/result is an emotional sledgehammer.  

If you wanna have you spirits lifted, read the interview with Justin Theroux about him finding out he has to sing in front of people it was apparently one of his biggest fears lol   

[Here's the article](https://www.vox.com/culture/2015/12/6/9859094/the-leftovers-finale-recap-season-2)"
Misty,I’d probably go with Deadwood and The Expanse
Misty,So they were mad that Miracle was seen as maybe lessening peoples grief over the event?
Misty,"Kevin Carroll was the MVP in that episode IMO. He kinda gets overlooked in discussions of The Leftovers I think, partly because, well, just look at the rest of the cast, and also his character was a bit neglected in season 3... But in the season 2 finale he really shines - his response when Kevin tells him he knows about Virgil's abuse, and then those final scenes of course... Mwah! Chef's kiss."
Misty,They kept saying there would be no closure (trying to be the opposite of Lost) so the ending really surprised me (in a good way)
Misty,"I kinda hated it. It was such an anticlimax, so much time spent dancing around the reconciliation…

And I guess like Lost, it focused on the characters rather than any of the supernatural aspects.

What did you like most about it?"
Misty,Just tbinking about the SFU epilogue gets me all verklempt
Misty,"Aw, that was lovely. Thanks for sharing it."
Misty,Nice. I haven't seen Deadwood but The Expanse was great.
Misty,"I think a large part of it was the whole town being so sanctimonious, their original theme song and prayers constantly talking about how they were ""spared"" or ""saved by god"" and that it was a special place where the water will even perform miracles.

The Remnant's whole thing is pretty much ""this is the end of the world,"" so the idea that the people who remain were ""spared"" or ""saved"" would seem like a sick joke to them.  They wanted the town to experience the same kind of pain that every other place in the world had gone through."
Misty,"I'd put it like this...





The GR believe we went through an unfathomable, unexplainable loss and we should not - can not - ever move past it. Their scheme in S1 is more or less this, bringing in the body doubles to forcibltly retraumatize people.





In the S2 dream/afterlife ep Garvey tells Patty she hates families. Absolutely she does. Family, the people we love, that's an important mechanism by which people create meaning out of a meaningless existence.




Now comes along Miracle, a town that didn't have any losses? That is happily moving on? That even deludes themselves into believing they're exceptional in a world where nothing matters BUT the rapture? It's morally offensive. 





And of course, they have Evie as a perfect recruit, someone who was told nothing is wrong in their town because this one bad thing didn't happen so she shouldn't have this gaping hole in her heart but she does and it hurts."
Misty,"Its an entire journey for Nora about how she can change, then you see the rest of the world has moved on from the event, but Nora and Kevin are still stuck there, until the end when they can finally move on. The entire episode is just full of leading them to the place where they can do that. The series before it was how they tried and failed."
Misty,"Thanks, I like that.

Do you think that holds with the mundane explanation of the machine? Whether or not she knows it’s suicide, she steps out."
Misty,I do. We don't need it all explained.
Misty,How could you believe the machine worked? What is the likelihood of them having the ability to come back to the normal world and no one thought to do it or try it. She's delusional
Misty,Why couldn’t it work? She could be lying or not. It’s up to each person to decide.
Misty,"I'd have to watch the scene over again, and its an artistic choice for anyone watching it to decipher...but the way I remember it, the story was so illogical it was obviously fake. 

To me, if someone made it to that other realm, and that one person was able to track down people and parts to remake the machine to come back to the normal world, how is it she was the only one to think of that and do it? Someone coming back from the afterlife/the other world would probably be seen as literally jesus, and yet no one there thought to do it before or after her? And I dont even mean doing it for praise and glory, but just to literally change millions of peoples lives, not a single other person came back? Thats just so illogical that theres no way I can believe she was the only person to think of and execute that."
Misty,Desmond - Lost.
Misty,Lucille Bluth
Misty,Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Misty,George Costanza.
Misty,"Roger Sterling in Mad Men, he always got the absolute best lines and stole almost every scene he was in."
Misty,Lorne from Angel
Misty,"I didn't realize how important the townspeople of Mayberry were to The Andy Griffith show.

The guy who played Floyd the hairdresser was just fantastic. Gomer Pyle didn't get really funny until a few seasons in. And if there was an episode where you had two or three of them combined with Barney, you know something hilarious was going to happen."
Misty,[removed]
Misty,"Some of my favorites have to be almost the entire supporting cast of Cheers but specifically Norm, Coach, and Woody."
Misty,"Robbie Reyes (Ghost Rider) in Agents of Shield, I loved every second he was on screen."
Misty,Christopher Moltisanti
Misty,"Carmella Soprano & Christopher Moltisanti from the Sopranos. James Gandolfini is a powerhouse of an actor, & they go toe to toe with him."
Misty,"Arthur Dietrich - Barney Miller

Granny Clampett - Beverly Hillbillies"
Misty,"Buster Bluth in Arrested Development 

Ava in Abbott Elementary 

Lowell in Wings"
Misty,Jesse Pinkman
Misty,"The nurses station at county general, ER:

Laura Cerón - Chuny 

Yvette Freeman - Haleh 

Abe Benrubi - Jerry (clerical/admin)

The show is packed with great chars but they were the backbone imo.

Also, Scrubs:

Janitor, Carla, Ted, Jordan, The Todd, Laverne, Appletinis."
Misty,Patti Levin in *The Leftovers*.
Misty,"Ds9 had an amazing crew of characters, naming one of them would be cheating since it was an ensemble, so I'll say General Martok: strong, deeply in love with his formidable wife, whom he fears, bold, tired, ironic, stubborn, proud and a paternal figure to Worf. Loved him and the actor"
Misty,Misty Quigley
Misty,"Michaletto from the Showtime version of ""The Borgias,"" played by Sean Harris, is one of the most compelling and complicated characters on the show. To call him an assassin with a heart of gold would be an oversimplification. 

Elim Garak, played by Andrew Robinson in Star Trek Deep Space Nine, for similar reasons. Despite being the in-universe equivalent of a former Gestapo leader, his charm and the bonds he builds with the other characters as he grows away from his former life make him surprisingly likeable even when he recommends shooting someone in the back.

Ironically, both of them have a superficial similarity: deadly cutthoats who've lived lives based on betrayal, but who hold a powerful loyalty to the people they end up caring about, and in the process steal scene after scene from the lead characters."
Misty,Brutha
Misty,Definitely the best character in the show. Every line she has is great.
Misty,Our favorite teacher and wish was our dad. Allen wasn't bad at all but FEENIEEE!!!!!
Misty,"Eh, it’s a little-known fact, u/GamingTatertot, but Cliff Clavin appeared in exactly 273 episodes and worked for the United States Postal Service."
Misty,"I'm still gutted that his spinoff at Hulu couldn't get off the ground :( 

Hopefully Disney+ can get on it."
Misty,"> I'm still gutted that his spinoff at Hulu couldn't get off the ground :(

And then, when they wanted to do a Halloween special and were specifically interested in a Hispanic lead, they do Werewolf by Night instead of bringing back Ghost Rider and Gabriel Luna? Seriously? Grr."
Misty,I don't think she's a hero by any means... but she certainly is a very fascinating and well-played character.
Misty,">Her first Very Bad Decision – to destroy the plane's black box and therefore remain valuable to her teammates – is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from her also Very Bad Decision to kill Jessica, because this time she does it not out of desperation, but because she knows that she is valuable, and acts from that place of self-assuredness.

Yeah, sorry, that's a reach. There's no way to justify that decision. Misty is not a hero."
Misty,"Whoever wrote this seems to be unable to distinguish malicious, hurtful acts to the purpose of inflating feelings of self-worth with self-empowerment"
Misty,"I like it. Doesn't look too sci-fi, looks like an actual prosthetic "
Minecraft: Story Mode,One of the upcoming Black Mirror episodes will have this feature too.
Minecraft: Story Mode,It's not the first of it's kind for netflix.  They made something similar for Puss-n-Boots and another show called buddy thunderstruck.

Minecraft: Story Mode,"Not exactly the same, but Mosaic from Soderbergh aired earlier in the year on HBO. While there were interactive elements, you couldn't really alter the plot, just gain more backstory and choose which perspective you viewed things from. 
"
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Tried it out. It's obviously for kids but god was it boring.

The cool part was seeing Minecraft in such a glorious fashion. Not even current shader mods can get the game to look like that. I wish there was a way to get the game to look as polished as it does in story mode."
Minecraft: Story Mode,How did this still come out?i know kirkman was supporting finishing the walking dead but as far as the rest of the studio was concerned they were gone last i heard. 
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I'd love the developers of Late Shift (check it out, great game) and the Sherlock Holmes games to develop some stuff for Netflix."
Minecraft: Story Mode,tried it. made it about 4 minutes 
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Ahaha, sweet summer child, Puss in Boots did this ages ago. Have toddler, will travel."
Minecraft: Story Mode,"lol, this company is dead, did they sell their shit to Netflix? "
Minecraft: Story Mode,I hope it fucks me up
Minecraft: Story Mode,Is that the same episode coming out on 28th December ?
Minecraft: Story Mode,I honestly can't wait to see how that unfolds.
Minecraft: Story Mode,it should be awesome
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Source?

EDIT: how would it work if it isn't on Netflix? I use Plex. "
Minecraft: Story Mode,"From what I understand, this isn't an adaptation made by Netflix. It's literally the [Telltale game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft%3A_Story_Mode) that was available on PC, converted to video and made playable *on* Netflix. That's not just a first for Netflix; it's a first for anyone."
Minecraft: Story Mode,And stretch armstrong.
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I can imagine with a platform that can be cross-played on TV and mobile, it would be impossible to implement QTEs."
Minecraft: Story Mode,Didn't Telltale close? I heard rumors about another studio finishing season 4 but nothing came of them.
Minecraft: Story Mode,Which is essentially how Telltale makes it's games. Like Tales from the Borderlands you just change things like what weapons you pick and such. In the end you kill guys no matter with whatever you picked. Just the way they die is changed.
Minecraft: Story Mode,I looked at the gameplay and I swear there were shader mods back in beta that looked better than that. I remember using shaders and realistic water for so long and it made the game a beauty.
Minecraft: Story Mode,I think Netflix was going to try to get some of the staff to do more stuff like this but I may have misread it as news about this particular thing.
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Fuck it up, Kenneth! Kenneth, fuck it up!"
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I would imagine it doesn't. Plex doesn't stream straight from Netflix asfaik, so your download of the episode may not even exist or will just contain all of the options one after another."
Minecraft: Story Mode,Here is the report from October: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-01/netflix-is-said-to-plan-choose-your-own-adventure-black-mirror
Minecraft: Story Mode,If you pirate it then you probably just won’t get to see it 
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Its got a few modifications from the Telltale game, most notably doing away with the quicktime events, making it much more akin to a choose your own adventure rather than a game."
Minecraft: Story Mode,And a streaming platform.
Minecraft: Story Mode,"It was recently announced that Robert Kirkmans (creator of the walking dead) company, Skybound, is finishing the final 2 episodes of the game. "
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Skybound entertainment, the publishers of the comic have taken over production. They only recently restarted development after sorting out all the acquisition details and rehiring developers."
Minecraft: Story Mode,They could still sell off what they’ve already made 
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I don't know but season 1 would probably do better without 2, 3, and 4 because it goes downhill at terminal velocity. "
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Right now Sildur's Vibrant Shaders are by far the best out there right now. Close to default, adds all the right bells and whistles, water and glass still visible and colorful, easy to see at night, the lights have a warm glow at night.

I agree, it may be nostalgia goggles but I feel like I remember having a shader and a windwaker style texture pack that made the game look like a beautifully lit windwaker scene."
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Haha yeah, I figured it would be a pain setting it up for users, etc. I may have to get a Netflix trial for that episode. "
Minecraft: Story Mode,You can easily have a pirate video of this. Matroska files already support choose your own adventure  videos using menu streams.

Minecraft: Story Mode,"season 2 was kind of bad because they forced clementine on us, like yeah we like the character and all but u cant make it so a bunch of adults rely on the wisdom of clementine... that was really bad.

season 3 was much better imo."
Minecraft: Story Mode,Probably not on Plex though 
Minecraft: Story Mode,Yeah everyone craps on Season 2 and 3 but I thought S2 was just as good as S1. S3 was good but didn't connect with me the way the others did. 
Minecraft: Story Mode,Everyone seemed to actively ignore Clem in my playthrough of s2. 
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I agree. I don’t really understand the hate for season 3. Sure it’s not as good as season 1, but that’s to be expected after how good season 1 was. On its own it’s still really good. "
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I could immediately tell you were an Avatar fan from the title.

I read half the post but it's longer than expected.

People are allowed to like what they like doesn't matter the genre or target audience. Everyone is looking for different things and the main purpose of these shows is entertainment. So whatever you find the most entertaining would be your favourite show and you shouldn't feel influenced by others opinion's. Although it's easier said than done even I often let other's opinions influence my own. The ""best"" shows are all subjective."
Minecraft: Story Mode,Have the people downvoting bothered to read at least half of this OP? I don't think I was unreasonable in my writing.
Minecraft: Story Mode,Loud house was banned for homosexuality. No dip Sherlock
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Seconded\^

You're allowed to like something, don't let anyone convince you otherwise."
Minecraft: Story Mode,"I'm a fan of a lot of kids' shows. I love Avatar, but there are other kids' shows I love just as much. What made you think I had to be specifically an Avatar fan based only on the title? I'm curious.

I believe in maximum art plurality, including art that is not for me. Taste is very subjective, hence why I never use the word ""overrated"". And also why any list of best shows is always gonna piss off some people, but it shouldn't.

My problem with people who don't like a show that happens to be a kids' show is that they are arrogant and condescending. They say stuff like ""how could adults like and recommend this?"", or ""You must be infantile, a man-child to enjoy this"", and more. Those people also seem to hate children as protagonists, and complain about kids acting like kids! Those people also seem to be devoid of sense of wonder.

If people are not a fan of a horror movie, they don't bash the genre and/or fans of it. 

People should stop being judgmental over what art deeply touches and moves someone else.

EDIT: Why the downvotes?"
Minecraft: Story Mode,What do you mean with this comment?
Minecraft: Story Mode,">What made you think I had to be specifically an Avatar fan based only on the title? I'm curious.

I've been a fan of Avatar since it first ever came out, it's my all time favourite show.

I thought you were an Avatar fan from the title because a lot of Avatar fans have the need for everyone to accept the show as one of the best things ever created many of them also get upset whenever anyone calls it a ""kids show,"" which leads them to making posts like these.

>. They say stuff like ""how could adults like and recommend this?"", or ""You must be infantile, a man-child to enjoy this"", and more. Those people also seem to hate children as protagonists, and complain about kids acting like kids! Those people also seem to be devoid of sense of wonder.

I've definitely seen a lot of people act like that. You can't really do anything about it except allow them to eventually find a show that challenges their preconceived opinions.

>EDIT: Why the downvote?

Wasn't me."
Minecraft: Story Mode,"Avatar is a kids' show, and I don't like Avatar fans defending it by saying ""it's a kids' show"". Kids' shows shouldn't be seen as inferior. I primarily love great kids' shows overall.

EDIT: Why the downvote? I'm an Avatar fan!"

You paid hundreds of millions for the rights to CFB, especially the SEC (the hottest conference the past ten years). Why would you skimp out on that? 

If your big names (Cowherd, Skip, Tirico, Erin Andrews, etc.) have all left in the past few years, you're doing something wrong. Maybe you skimped out on them too like you are with your customers. "

The Package,King of Kensington?
The Package,"I really, really hope this is the slam dunk it sounds like, because I love Janelle Monae but almost everything she's been in as an actor has been not good. Basically: Hidden Figures and Moonlight (two great movies to have on your resume) vs. just a long string of disappointments and straight out messy, messy flops. 

Also would be cool if we could get a new album but I know that takes time."
The Package,"> The focus of the drama will be on Baker’s role as a spy for the Allies during the French resistance helping defeat the Nazis, and on her experience as one of the world’s most iconic, talented and glamorous entertainers.

The Package,Oh my stars.
The Package,Josephine Baker is 100% excellent subject material. I really hope her story is well told and portrayed. Looking forward to it.
The Package,Everything she does is perfection.  She's got to be one of the most talented individuals on the planet right now.
The Package,They should hire an actress instead
The Package,Janelle Monae kind of sucks
The Package,Who? Portraying who?
The Package,Is Janelle going be to binary in this role?

Edit: I see at least 37 people think Josephine Baker was an ugly woman. I still maintain she was beautiful"
The Package,Here I am waiting for her to star in futuristic science fiction in the realm of her albums.
The Package,Metropolis parts 6 & 7 when 😭
The Package,"I wouldn't Call it a long string, it makes it sound like she's been in dozen akf movies with two good films when in reality she's been in 9, two of those (Rio andady and the Tramp) were VA roles that at worst are mediocre with another two to three being solid to great films. That's leaves 4 actually bad films. Not saying it's a miracle of proof or anything but that the way you frame it exaggerates how many flops she's atcually been in."

I did not like Season 2 at all."
The Package,Not her season.
The Package,I can’t remember did that end or get canceled?
The Package,"Not OP though they make it sound like she's been in more than like 6 films but Welcome to Marwen, Antebellum, and UglyDolls were pretty awful, not that hard to see what their original point was"

The Package,Pierre is out of a job!
The Package,Now someone take the Olympics away from them and give them to someone who just wants to show every event without commentary

The Package,i bet you've got a big stick.
The Package,good luck finding a company like that in america
The Package,"Unpopular opinion, I like the commentary. Peacock showed aired a decent amount of winter sports without commentary this year and it lacked a certain something."
The Package,Especially with sports that you aren’t watching all the time. I wanna hear what the stats mean and miscellaneous rule clarifications provided by commentators for most of the different Olympic sports.
The Package,"For those who don't understand why this is a big deal, music rights have prevented the show from ever getting a proper DVD release, so syndication is STILL the only legal way to see it. And it hasn't been on anywhere in a few years."
The Package,Cleveland Rocks!
The Package,"A severely underrated sitcom. The first 5 seasons are incredible, even 6 and most of 7 are still really good. Mid 7 thru the end is where they try changing the way it was filmed and the sets and the cast and it was just too much. 

It’s a shame this show will never be able to be celebrated the way it should be because of shitty music rights.

It was a truly groundbreaking, innovative show that tried a lot of stuff (Drew Live, April Fools, the Emmys episode)."
The Package,"A lot of these old nostalgia channels have some good stuff on them. There are the usual suspects (Growing Pains, Family Ties, Three's Company etc), but rediscovering the lesser known shows that I missed during their original runs is always fun too."

The Package,"Kate (Christa Miller) was one of my first crushes. 

It's a little mind-blowing that the Drew Carey Show has just a few fewer episodes then Friends."

The Package,Aww yes. Can finally crack open a Buzz Beer again and pretend to fuck Mimi.
The Package,"I acquired the entire series via the ""high seas"" years ago. Its all syndication tv recordings but its perfectly fine. I would love to share it but I can't figure out a way to do so short of mailing USB sticks."
The Package,"shame it's sped up on RewindTV. if you can find the LAFF network rips from mid 2015s, they aren't sped up"
The Package,I always wondered why Christa Miller who played Kate left the show. It felt different after she left
The Package,Thanks for the heads up. Just added to DVR
The Package,I really hope they figure out the music rights so it can AT LEAST be on streaming
The Package,[Enjoy](https://reboot.tube/x/drew)
The Package,"Also, the last 3 seasons are [available in 16:9 widescreen on RewindTV.](https://youtu.be/LNtEgKIFWOo)"

Music right have been used as a scapegoat. Plenty of music heavy shows, like Scrubs, have been released just fine.

Its also available on United planes"

The Package,"A musical episode too, long before it was a common thing."
The Package,Didn't they have a 3D episode too?
The Package,Saw some cast photos from the later seasons and they've got a blonde chick instead of Kate and Mr. Wick has long hair and I'm like what. Don't remember any of that stuff. So weird they cut out Kate.
The Package,All of those are free on Pluto TV too.
The Package,"> Drew ~~Alice~~ Allison Carey

FTFY"
The Package,I remember that scene too!  😆
The Package,Ran only one season less (started the year after Friends) but the mid seasons had close to 25-28 episodes in some of them. It was originally designed to be the “blue collar” version of Friends and then after s1 they break away from that and it was off to the races. Just an outstanding show.
The Package,Mmmm Kate.
The Package,"I always thought they ended it after 3 or 4 seasons, so TIL the show ended in the mid 2000s."
The Package,"I wish it could be a streaming service because I can’t afford the Cox TV package my parents have that carries it.

If it were a $6.99/month platform I’d pay it just for ‘The Drew Carey Show’ alone."
The Package,Agreed; I don't have it in my area and really wish it would come here
The Package,"You do you, guy.    😂"
The Package,"Kathy Kinney has an interesting imdb page... should basically be shown to anyone wanting to become an actor with a warning that ""this is pretty much as good as it will get"". One ten year long show a bunch of one off appearances and another 3 years on a show"

The Package,you could always “drive” to them
The Package,Id buy a drive!
The Package,"She left to go do Scrubs, which her husband ran."
The Package,No problem! Glad I could spread the word.  😎
The Package,"Not sure why, but the only episode I’m seeing is Season 6 Episode 9.  🫤"
The Package,Does anyone enjoy the final three seasons?
The Package,"They changed lots of the songs and music in scrubs and you can tell a difference where it doesn’t fit the show.


*edit*
/u/thebruns blocked me so I can’t read the replies. He couldn’t have discussion and did it over something so silly. Someone else reading this tel him i know and he/she’s  a dork"
The Package,"A scapegoat? For what? Just not wanting to release it? That makes no sense. Some shows, like Scrubs, don't need every needle drop. Others, like Moonlighting or Without A Trace, would be crippled without it. It's not some conspiracy.

And come on, you have to know the average person isn't watching The Drew Carey Show on United airplanes, you just want to get all technical and argumentative."
The Package,I prefer the 5'oclock world intro.
The Package,I went to price is right and asked Drew if he still remembers how to do the dance from the intro.
The Package,Yeah two of them but all the ABC shows on those specific nights did
The Package,"They didn’t cut Kate. She left for a full time gig with Scrubs which her husband was EP on. The addition of the blonde (Kelly) was the beginning of the end but she wasn’t the worst thing about the last two seasons. 

Also, Wick only guest stars in a few episodes in 8 and 9 as Craig Ferguson left to pursue a movie career and soon thereafter the Late Late Show. 

Plus it was getting too expensive to keep that whole cast together. By the last two seasons, not only did Kate and Wick leave, but a lot of other side, auxiliary characters left, Ryan Stiles started to miss a lot of episodes and John Carroll Lynch left because he was starting to become a somewhat bigger name in Hollywood. 

The show had a huge budget in s2-6 because it was such a huge hit those first few years but when ratings dropped and the time slot got moved around, the budget dried up quick. Hell, the last season of the show didn’t even air in order or all together, it was aired sporadically throughout 2003-04 and ended in summer 04."
The Package,"Don't think they cut her, she wanted to go work on Scrubs with her husband."
The Package,"I mean... She's worth like $5 million, is famous, was on that show for a good long while, and can probably still book lucrative appearances if she wanted to. I'd be thrilled to have her career, if I was into acting, considering how they usually go."
The Package,Her and Chip from Whose Line had a touring improv show that came to my college about a decade ago
The Package,"Please, this. I vaguely remember this show, was only 12 when it ended. But it was fantastic. Take a trip down G Drive."
The Package,With MY luck you'd be FBI.
The Package,Nice.
The Package,Indeed. So?
The Package,"> A scapegoat? For what? Just not wanting to release it? 

Correct. There were disagreements between Drew Carey, the studio, and Disney in the last 3 seasons.

>Others, like Moonlighting or Without A Trace, would be crippled without it. 

We're not talking about them. Nice attempt to get all technical and argumentative."
The Package,Where my Moon Over Parma fans at?

Brainchild,"as a 26 year old, I always thought of adult swim as way pavers. I remember falling asleep on the living room couch of a 4 room, 700 sq ft apartment instead of in my bed so I could watch some samurai champloo before bed at 11 at night as a 14 year old. I even vaguely remember flcl and even after all these years, the one thing that stood out was the fu-ri-ku-ri television robot. 

are millenials the generation of nostalgia? have we progressed to quickly? "
Brainchild,"I'll never forget that fucking April Fool's Day. 4 years ago.

Midnight, seeing what Adult Swim had in store for this April Fool's. Steve Blum apparently made a vague random tweet earlier that day. But I didn't see it.

Soon The Room played. Again, like last year. but then suddenly *boom*. Motherfucking TOM. Then Bleach started playing. Thought it was a good joke. Then the bumpers played. ""No way."", I thought. Then I was watching the end of the Cell Saga. Holy **SHIT.** Then it was Gundam, then Trigun. Goddamn. 

Ironically it was one of the highest ratings Adult Swim got in years. A month later, Toonami was back. It went through a bit of rollercoaster of ratings. A few duds(Casshern, Samurai 7) but also a few golds(Kill la Kill, Space Dandy, One Punch Man).

Now, Toonami is going to give us a new season of Samurai Jack, and new season of FLCL, a new Production IG series(people who made IGPX), and (next month) Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Brainchild,I was in a really bad place 15 years ago and this late night spot gave me smiles as a preteen. Lots of laughs and some great anime. It really brightened up my life till college. I actually met my husband on the adult swim message boards. He still watches some of the shows :) 
Brainchild,You didn't mention Robot Chicken. The Star Wars specials are some of the most priceless stop-motion gems ever.
Brainchild,"Awesome post.

I tried to think of why they would cancel ATHF, and I now believe that it has to do with the fact that Adult Swim is stronger than ever. That makes me feel confident that they will bring back ATHF when they need a boost in ratings. The show needs to recharge for a few years.

Master Shake and Carl are two of the greatest characters in the entire Adult Swim lineup."
Brainchild,Wow this is incredible. I didn't realize I witnessed the birth of Adult Swim. What a ride it's been. Thanks for this fucking amazing post. 
Brainchild,"No mention of ""Venture Brothers"". For Shame."
Brainchild,">(The Critic has been off for 6 but who cares?)

Brainchild,"I'd point out that season 3 or Moral Orel was quite serious, but I guess it wasn't really serialized that much. Still one of my favorite shows."
Brainchild,"I remember when it first started. I was a teenager, and was just wowed by the abject absurdity of shows like Space Ghost, Sealab 2021, and Aqua Teen. It also introduced me to anime through Cowboy Bebop. The downside, at the time, was that it only aired on Thursdays and Sundays at midnight. I'd not yet accepted my night owl tendencies, so I didn't get to catch it every week. But it was definitely a reason to stay up late. I was particularly obsessed with Space Ghost and Brak. It was the Napster era, and I made an entire playlist of Brakisms. Over an hour of nonstop Brak. It was a good time to be young and weird."
Brainchild,Holy fuck I miss Mission Hill
Brainchild,"Wasn't Lucy, Daughter of the Devil on adult swim too?  That show was awesome."
Brainchild,And yet Korgoth was never picked up :(
Brainchild,"I got the honor to meet and chat with C. Martin Croker, voice of Zorak and Moltar on Space Ghost. He said originally that Lazzo wanted to create new Hannah Barbara serials from old animation reels of A-List characters like Yogi Bear. They were told no and instead could purchase the animation reels, and rights, to D-List characters like Space Ghost and Sealab 2020. 

Of those reels was the Wacky Races, which Lazzo wanted to take and create something called ""Wacky Races Coast-to-Cost"" which would take all the previous episode animation reels and make one big event out of it. And, as Croker said, Lazzo had a fever dream the night before of production of the prototype in '93 and instead told the team they'd be creating a new adult themed cartoon talk show. Long story short, the prototype is presented, green lit, and aired as Space Ghost Coast-to-Coast. "
Brainchild,"adult swim bumps basically created my current day taste in music

For those who wish to reminisce on the old CN and includes Adult Swim. Plays out like you're actually watching tv back then. First timers should check out the schedule to see what it's all about.

Also check out http://nreboot.com/watch#cnr"
Brainchild,"Space Ghost Coast to Coast, pre-Adult Swin days, were just amazing. I don't even remember how I stumbled upon it, but I remember watching it at my grandparents house when I was about 8--- and my mother walking in to see why I was up so late and what I was watching--- and laughing significantly harder than I was. 

The entire thing was bizarre.

I also remember those old Hana Barbara Space Ghost + Bird Man + Herculoid episodes that were airing late at night with laugh tracks that my father found both nostalgic and hysterical.

I loved it, because my parents would watch cartoons with me, even though I didn't really understand half the jokes."
Brainchild,"I don't even watch TV. Never really did. But I've always kept up at least a little with Adult Swim. These days I like getting stoned and watching Off The Air. Superjail satisfies my twisted side. I want Brak back.

Brak 4 President"
Brainchild,"This is a great write up.  I was in college when it started, we had a fun group meeting up to watch that insanity when it was on. Sealab was my favorite.  When Venture Bros. hit, though, wow. 

It's also where I first saw Cowboy Bebop, unreal.  "
Brainchild,"Man...I remember staying up late to watch FLCL when it first aired. I was 13, and wasn't supposed to be up that late, so I had to turn the volume almost all the way down where I couldn't even understand the dialogue. All I heard was mumbling and the (amazingly done) soundtrack behind the crazy visuals, and together it made for such a surreal experience, it was amazing. I remember craving the feeling it gave me and I'd scour the internet for anything related to FLCL. This was long before youtube so the best I got was a fanmade page with some sparse info and I must have read it over 20 times just waiting for Sunday night to come again.

 The whole thing had such a profound effect on 13 year old me and I attribute so much of my taste in movies/TV/music to sneaking episodes of FLCL on adult swim. 
"
Brainchild,[deleted]
Brainchild,"Great write up, Adult Swim revitalized the animation industry in some aspects, leading to more animation jobs within the country, and given entertainment the ability to ""be weird"" again. I don't think we'd have Bob's Burgers, Archer, Bojack Horseman, and more without it."
Brainchild,"Alan Resnick is just by favorite person in the world, and I follow all of his writings, and took part in the ARG, and I can't wait to see what's coming next"
Brainchild,"Most importantly. It gave us Rick and Morty.

In all seriousness, I remember watching adult swim as a child and being engulfed. I would stay up late to watch these not so child appropriate shows and giggle my ass off. Thank you Adult Swim for bringing joy to all us TV addicted kids around the world. "
Brainchild,">It boosted the careers of Killer Mike, Flying Lotus, Odd Future, MF Doom, Danger Mouse, and completely made the career of MC Chris. It introduced Killer Mike and El-P

Funny thing, I barely knew about Adult Swim and never watched before I started listening to MF Doom, Madlib and Dangermouse. Those guys legitimized the channel for me. The first time I watched it there was a commercial or promo that used ""Accordian"" and I was sold. "
Brainchild,"Frisky Dingo was everything. I love how you can see and hear the roots of so many Archer memes, while still having a show that stood on its own and was honestly edgier in many ways. Although no bus driver ever knows how to respond when I ask if they go to all pet stores."

Brainchild,"""Natatorium, what's a natatorium?""  Not even google spell check knows, that's funny.

As a college student during 2001, Adult Swim came out and was amazing.  It was perfect background noise and perfect comedy.  I loved every moment.  My favorite moment you didn't mention.

[Aquaman Dance Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpopXL2h33U)

Everytime an ADP came on I fell in love with Adult Swim more and more.  There was never and reason given why he was dancing, no background, just dance.

Little shameless promotion, but it inspired me years later to recreate it.  

So I [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WE-_SJCq-0) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3435-lYmX4) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD_yOJMBWYk) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfwHycU65aU) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD5wPODXUcg) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLji2OXVlDA) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEJDum4vdGc) and [did](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zYyzgvbAzr8/hqdefault.jpg?custom=true&w=336&h=188&stc=true&jpg444=true&jpgq=90&sp=68&sigh=6UKk9iy3uQSVjUamlXqGLKMAwbA) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9juG_YLWBZQ).

Thank you adult swim, thank you.

Brainchild,The comedy has fallen flat. It's like a competition to be weird and random now.
Brainchild,"Does anyone else remember before adult swim was on the air, the time between Rocky & Bullwinkle ending at midnight and Jetsons on boomerang at 5(?)am was filled with hours of the cartoon network logo sitting in a desert scene. Nostalgia, I'd love to see that station signoff again but I've never been able to find it!"
Brainchild,"""Oh my God, Zorak has picked up a folding chair!""
Seminal moment in my sense of humor. "

Brainchild,Cartoon Network is the only thing keeping me subscribed to cable. I just realized this.
Brainchild,The first two seasons of sealab 2021 with Capt. Murphy are like my Citizen Kane.
Brainchild,Moral Oral #1 show
Brainchild,"I really miss the Adult Swim intro with a man over the intercom asking people to clear out so the older crowd can swim.

*edit: and with a quick search on youtube, here you go! https://youtu.be/5tIarxPla0E *"
Brainchild,This TV block will always hold a special place in my heart.  Got me through a lot of lonely nights.  Thank you so much for this write up.
Brainchild,"i've been living with major depression and other mental health issues since i was ten, drug addiction since fourteen. i'm twenty nine now and the gifts of hilarity, amazement and inspiration provided by [adult swim] shows during some of those dark nights has very likely played a part in my decisions to refrain from suicide. thanks [adult swim], i owe ya several."
Brainchild,"I remember the birth of our little Adult Swim like it was yesterday. Lazzo and the crew gathered the whole network into the photo studio studio deep inside of the Turner Mansion to explain that we were no longer just fighting against Disney and Nickelodeon for eyeballs. The Internet and the PlayStation were the new threat. And we had a new plan, thus Adult Swim was born.  

Super secret Easter egg!!! Pickup your ATHF Season One DVD set and look on the back cover. There's a graffiti tag on the brick wall that says ""Rx"" short for Ryan. Only time In my whole career I ever hid something in my design work. I pulled one over on the man, well not really. If I remember right, Matt's wife's name is on the cover too Haha!  "
Brainchild,"Probably the most epic Adult Swim moments for me:

Delocated, Season 3 finale and Series finale

Aizen's finger, his fucking finger! (Bleach Soul Society finale)

Aqua Teen series finale (honorable mention- the fake finale getting unconfirmed)

Harvey Birdman's finale

FullMetal Alchemist's penultimate episode (the first anime)

Rick and Morty when the alternate Ricks get revealed

Code Geass R1 finale

Venture Bros pre-season-6-special

Hellsing Ultimate premiere

Robot Chicken, where the chicken fights everybody

Frisky Dingo, when the annhilatrix goes off


It is a demographic I'm proud to have been in."
Brainchild,Couldn't live without rick and Morty. Also pretty sad that they didn't give hellbenders their TV show but its still impressive what adult swim has done
Brainchild,"Ah the days of rushing home from school so I could watch Sailor Moon, DBZ, Outlaw Star, Ronin Warriors, and Gundam Wing.

Then as I grew older, so did the network, introducing me to adult swim and Chrono Crusade, FMA, Evangelion, etc.

Here's to you guys for making late nights later and better!"
Brainchild,Not a single mention of Robot Chicken? I am *disgusted*...
Brainchild,"This is unrelated but I figured this is where you I could be helped.

29 here. Grew up loving SuperDaves and Adam Wests. Grew up with YTV.  Rugrats, Street Sharks, Mummies Alive, Biker Mice From Mars, Reboot, Beast Wars etc etc the list goes on.

You know what type of kid I am now.

Late night telethon.   Bondage puppets having sex during commercials. Some crippled head and his crippled buddies rich. I need names of these shows late at night..

Most importantly.. Some drab, dry humour from what I remember space cartoon.  A super famous StarShip Captain trapped on a planet with a weird day night cycle or something.  Anyone know the name?"
Brainchild,"So I was watching the first night, in my parent's basement. I was 13. I recorded it and kept the tape for a long time - it might still be at my mom's house. 

SGC2C is 100% responsible for Adult Swim existing, no matter what the execs say. Dave Willis et al were responsible for the aesthetic of fucking with the audience. SGC2C did this for 2-3 seasons before Adult Swim existed. This informs an entire generation's idea of what comedy is. 

Without SG2C2 there would be no Tim and Eric. And no matter how you feel about Awesome Show or TGTTM, you cannot deny that those dudes have had an enormous impact on comedy in the 21st century. 

And let's not forget The Eric Andre Show, directly influenced by SGC2C and produced by Tim and Eric's production company, which has been huge during this election cycle. 

AND - perhaps the biggest Adult Swim-related ""political"" guy of all - Vic Berger, a former editor for Awesome Show. 

Somewhat unrelated but just as influential are dudes like Jon Benjamin and Brendan Small. Both have continued to make a huge impact on modern comedy since Adult Swim started. 

There's also David Wain/Paul Scheer's crew - NTSF:SD:SUV, Children's Hospital, Newsreaders, etc. All those guys were successful before, but Adult Swim gave them the freedom to do their own shows. 

And of course, there's Morel Orel which is the reason Rick and Morty exists. 

(Also it ""saved"" Family Guy but who gives a shit, we're talking about comedy) 

TL;dr: Adult Swim is most likely why you are laughing today"
Brainchild,"""Saved Futurama""...

*Cries because Futurama was cancelled*"
Brainchild,"And now this amazing network is bringing back Samurai Jack rated MA. 

It's a good time to be a Samurai Jack fan boy."
Brainchild,"When I was in college and just out of it in 2000-2005 adult swim was an absolute staple.  Sealab and Athf were great and bebop and champloo blew my freaking mind.

So many good times and honestly helped get me laid more than once."
Brainchild,"Man I remember as a kid staying up late on Saturdays after my parents went to bed just to watch adult swim.  Yu yu Hakusho will always have a place in my thoughts that show was the shit.  

Then in high school my friends and I would sit up play video games and watch aqua team hunger force like it was our jobs.  Best idea cartoon network has ever had along with toonami"
Brainchild,"""Pod six is jerks!"""
Brainchild,"I honestly don't think that Adult Swim's role in bringing Anime west could be downplayed. While Toonami played a large part as well, Adult Swim followed through in bringing many people in contact with more mature animated shows and shared in a rarer approach of giving a product that had been very sparingly edited for American audiences.

Also, the Brak Show and Harvey Birdman have remained two of my favorite shows since I first watched them."
Brainchild,"I remember growing up with adult swim, starting just with family guy, and seemingly every year I would get to stay up a little later and experience a new hilarious show - Aqua Teen, then Venture Bros, then Tim and Eric, Drinky Crow, 12oz Mouse - and they always got weirder and more enthralling the later it got. At this point it produces the only shows I can watch over and over again. It introduced me to so many new forms of comedy and humor, how can you not idolize the crazy minds behind it all. "
Brainchild,"I still remember the night Adult Swim premiered.
Working as a security guard for a then soon to be defunct VC business, down in a basement across from One American Center. Surrounded by all the perks of a startup - arcade, soda stand, and tv and not a single soul in sight. I had seen the commercials but no idea what to expect. 

I. Loved. Every. Minute. Of. It.

Watched every new show, laughed at the absurdity of Sealab and couldn't take my eyes off of Cowboy Bebop. Good times made better with Adult Swim, I wish they still played Anime during the week instead of just Saturdays though.
Just wanted to share my first memories and be a part of this thread. "
Brainchild,I remember it being advertised late at night before it premiered when I was in middle school and thought that I had to watch it at all costs. I was fortunate enough to have cable television in my room back then. I still remember watching it the night of the premier and being super hyped about how amazing all the shows were. I remember getting my friends into it and within a month pretty much everyone I knew at school would be talking about the shows that aired the night before. Those were great times.
Brainchild,Great job! 
Brainchild,"FLCL is getting a second season? well motherfucking shitballs, i can almost forgive adult swim for putting seth mcfarlene in position to rain his garbage on us just for this.

edit: two more seasons."
Brainchild,"I was 11 when adult swim started and I remember always being super pissed when cartoon network ended at night and they put that weird adult cartoon crap on. Even before that, I hated Space Ghost when I was a kid for the same reason. Now I see how stupid I was.
"
Brainchild,No love for Frisky Dingo?
Brainchild,I shed a tear
Brainchild,All I want is a new episode of Space Ghost. I keep hoping they'll do it just to troll the heck out of us someday.
Brainchild,"I remember watching this when it started in my bedroom at age 6, I was not the right age for this, but I turned out alright"
Brainchild,"Still a damn shame to me that they haven't been more front-and-center with The Venture Bros, seeing as how it's now been running for 13 years and features the **iconic** Brock Samson, who's back with Team Venture again."
Brainchild,"I've been wondering for years when Adult Swim would garner enough popularity and capital to have their own independent TV channel. Unfortunately, I don't think the state of TV will allow for this. At any rate, Adult Swim is a juggernaut and will probably continue to exist in some form for a long time."
Brainchild,"I remember when Adultswim happened. My parents were pretty mad at the time that Cartoon Network would be showing adult content instead of ""cartoons"""
Brainchild,Their bumps are always entertaining.
Brainchild,"I think when they first started airing, I just found it because I liked Space Ghost Coast to Coast but the airings before AS were always done inconsistently and at horseshit hours. Also their original bumps were weird and all set to [this music](https://youtu.be/WGZDDgQvDMc?t=2m16s) for as long as I can recall."
Brainchild,">Even back then at a children’s focused channel like Cartoon Network, however, it was obvious animation wasn’t just for ~~adults~~  

children  

Also, your home movies link is broken. (ish)"
Brainchild,Swear it was longer than 15 years
Brainchild,Shameless plug for everyone to watch Last Stream on the Left today at 7:30pm Eastern! Megustalations.
Brainchild,man that was a great writeup. thanks for taking the time to do it.
Brainchild,"Was anyone else surprised that ""15 years ago"" was referring to 2001?"
Brainchild,Harvey Birdman and Sealab were the GOATs.
Brainchild,Fooley cooley season2!!!!!???
Brainchild,"Until I get season 5 of Metalocalypse and closure to the story line, my motto is ""fuck adult swim"". I'm putting my blinders on to the plethora of awesome shit you do since you shit on the most awesome of them all."
Brainchild,"Adult swim changed my life and made me realize anyone can make shitty, ridiculous, and fun cartoons. I now do it as a job and while its not always perfect, I never regret it. I really do love adult swim and the person it has helped shaped me to be. "
Brainchild,"So Metalocalypse is never getting finished? 

That is a sad thing. It was the best thing ever put out on AS. 

"
Brainchild,"Interesting read. All I knew about Mike Lazzo was from this copypasta on 4chan.

* has disowned his involvement in Space Ghost Coast to Coast
* gave Home Movies low priority compared to Williams Street originals, sometimes airing new episodes at 3 AM and months apart from each other; eventually cancelled it because it was cheaper to rerun Family Guy in it's place
* told the creators of Moral Orel to make the show darker, cancelled it for being ""too dark""
* cancelled China Il and Aqua Teen without letting the creators have a say
* refused to give Stroker and Hoop a Season 2 pickup despite previously stating otherwise, leaving the show to end on a cliffhanger
* bought the rights to millions of dollars in FOX reruns which squandered the budget for Mission Hill's potential revival
* has a hard on for Tim and Eric and Seth McFarlane shows 
* won't give Metalocalypse another season to wrap up the series because of a petty argument over creative control with Brendon Small
* was a major proponent of Loiter Squad and was instrumental in keeping it on air as long as it was
* almost passed up on Rick and Morty in favor of Mr. Pickles
* got into some random internet fight with Jon Benjamin and David Cross for some reason
* will all but let corporate sponsors fuck him in the ass at this point; wants Adult Swim to be ""more like TBS""
* is now pushing for the development of ""a Tosh.0 type program"" made in conjuncture with Worldstar Hip Hop.com
* his favorite Adult Swim program of all time is apparently Robot Chicken"
Brainchild,I miss space ghost coast to coast... I still watch the old episodes sometimes on my hard drive.
Brainchild,"I refuse to watch that station due their dickbag attitude towards Small and Metalocalypse fans. But whatever, keep rerunning the shit Family Guy show for the next generation of college kids."
Brainchild,Adult swim airing anime is what made it more known in the West. Such an influential network. Kudos.
Brainchild,Hard to imagine who I'd be if Adult Swim wasn't created.
The Masters Sun,"Kevin Smith's worked with her before and seems to be a big fan, so that makes sense."
The Masters Sun,Why isn't SMG continuing in the role?
The Masters Sun,I totally thought that the show was over lol
The Masters Sun,"Honestly, I know it got a lot of complaints due to He-Man not being in most of it through the first half...but it was a pretty well-done series.

It held true to the spirit of the 80s show but wasn't, y'know, Filmation crap just made to sell toys. 

I'm happy there's going to be a second season."
The Masters Sun,"Just keep it inside

Learn how to hide

Your feelings"
The Masters Sun,"I know I'm in the minority, but I'm really looking forward to the new Skeletor story arc after his final scene in the previous season. Seems creepy/badass."
The Masters Sun,Jewel of Wilson’s foul domain
The Masters Sun,"Give me some quality live-action He-Man already, damn!"
The Masters Sun,"Skimmimg through the article, I thought for a second that William Shatner was doing the voice for Skeletor, imagine that."
The Masters Sun,"Seeing as she’s literally married to He-Man, I’m not surprised."
The Masters Sun,Didn’t fans hate the last one of these shows that they made?
The Masters Sun,This show is still on?
The Masters Sun,"Amped they're continuing this! I thought the S2 finale could have been much better paced, but overall I really enjoyed this."
The Masters Sun,I really enjoyed the first season so I'm happy they are making more. Don't really have an opinion on the voice acting change.
The Masters Sun,"I'm going to get downvoted to hell but dear god I loathed both seasons of this show.  And Teelah was the most god awful protagonist.  She had to be coerced and pulled from one scene to the next, was joyless and just uninteresting to watch.  And that's not SMG's fault, the writing was just bad.  

To the show's credit I was interested in Evil Lynn and Orco's episode.  The animation was top notch.  

But He-Man got sidelined even Skeletor got sidelined.  And for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes.  But this show wasn't for me as an 80's kid.  It sold itself as being for me, but it was a complete bait and switch."
The Masters Sun,Super
The Masters Sun,"Definitely an upgrade. Though I don’t think her husband had a great He-Man voice. A good Adam but he lacked that booming bass from the 80s show.

Edit: Melissa Benoist as Wolverine’s daughter:

https://youtu.be/YJku_F1cXow"
The Masters Sun,She was super girl right?
The Masters Sun,Didn’t they already ruin this franchise?
The Masters Sun,"Is this a new, new series or a continuation?"
The Masters Sun,I'm honestly surprised this show is getting another season. The first was a monster turd.
The Masters Sun,Awe that sucks! I thought she did a great job! I hope it's just a scheduling conflict
The Masters Sun,How has this not been cancelled yet?
The Masters Sun,"My take is it just needs to be a “He-Man” show… like the original was… 

And then, at least, all us OG He-Man fans would love it. Because we loved that show. 

You can always make a different show, centered around a different character, and still call it “He-Man.” You can do that, it’s a free country, but then you risk alienating the people that liked and enjoyed the original show. 

Maybe you can have greater success without the original fans… that’s possible… but it’s not the direction I would have gone with the IP."
The Masters Sun,"The actual star of He-Man, Teela is getting an new actor? 

Somehow, some way, we shall be okay."
The Masters Sun,"This is such a lowkey powerhouse piece of IP. New toy line, two animated series and a live action show all in the last ~5 years."
The Masters Sun,…..and it’s cancelled
The Masters Sun,Idek what another season would be about. Teela is the most powerful being in history and STILL has He-Man for backup
The Masters Sun,this dumpster fire gets a season 2? and yet netflix cancels good shows? what kind of power does kevin smith hold over netflix?
The Masters Sun,Okay but like... give that the first part was awful why even bother.
The Masters Sun,Why won’t Sarah Michelle Gellar reprise the role? I really love anything that she’s involved in.
The Masters Sun,I like Melissa and I like the symmetry ofThe Vampire Slayer being replaced by Supergirl
The Masters Sun,"Netflix cancels shows people give a shit about, but greenlights one of the most derided misfires of the last decade? Oof. If even SMG didn't want anything to do with it you know this shit is even more DOA than the first series."
The Masters Sun,Good. She was miscast.
The Masters Sun,"Bruh, Masters Of The Universe series does Netflix have?"
The Masters Sun,"I don’t think SMG was good in the role, but I also don’t think the show was very good period."
The Masters Sun,Would anyone even care?
The Masters Sun,"Please don’t destroy my childhood, I can’t go through another Footloose situation"
The Masters Sun,I wouldn’t touch that project with a 50 ft pole either.
The Masters Sun,This show was utter garbage
The Masters Sun,Netflix canceled so much. Why are they making this trash?
The Masters Sun,"That is going to continue?
Bold move from Netflix."
The Masters Sun,Boooo
The Masters Sun,Are we doing another He-Man-less He-Man cartoon again?
The Masters Sun,Why not the show as a multiverse then you can have both women as the character?
The Masters Sun,I always wonder if those actors whom rejects roles still filthy rich or what got on their minds to pass important roles.
The Masters Sun,"That show, it's fans & haters. Lol"
The Masters Sun,"I thought that the season was told out of order. They second half of the season should have been shown first, with minor tweaks to have it flow better, and the second half be second. It'll give us fans some time with the characters before killing them off. Then kill them off in the fifth episode for some shocks value and then continue with how the episodes in the first half but now the second half. It works out wonderfully and the series might have actually been better."
The Masters Sun,"I hated this show and say that with full confidence after watching too many episodes of it. I'm utterly shocked it's getting another season or that Netflix will waste money on it versus other shows like Mindhunters, etc."
The Masters Sun,… and hosting me too like some brain-dead AOL-er
The Masters Sun,Whatever her projects and films I'm always support her.  She's the greatest super girl.
The Masters Sun,Had no idea this was in the works
The Masters Sun,"Plus the voice actor for He-Man is her husband, they met while working together on Supergirl."
The Masters Sun,"They are friends, and he likes giving his friends work."
The Masters Sun,"She doesn’t like to work. 

I don’t mean that in a disparaging way. 

She comes and goes as she pleases within show business, choosing carefully when she works and when she doesn’t so that she can take care of her family. With her already producing and starring in a show, she likely just doesn’t want to work on a second one at the same time."
The Masters Sun,They did not say.
The Masters Sun,I’m assuming she will be busy filming season 2 of her new Paramount+ show.
The Masters Sun,Maybe she watched the first series
The Masters Sun,"if it isn't scheduling conflict or her being too buzy , maybe it's because of the reaction to her character in season 1 as she was mostly the lead instead of He-man and grown men took that personally."
The Masters Sun,You didn't catch the final episode's teaser?
The Masters Sun,"I'm kinda surprised it was renewed.  I have no strong feelings about it (watched the first episode and a half, decided it wasn't for me), but it was an odd choice to try to harness the nostalgia of He-Man fans, and then write He-Man and Skeletor out of the show in the first episode, lol.

People tried to pretend online that the backlash was just about sexism, but like Ghostbusters 2016, the backlash is probably just because you made something that sucks."
The Masters Sun,"Genuinely, compared to Transformers War For Cybertron it was a fucking masterpiece."
The Masters Sun,AND HE PRAYS!
The Masters Sun,I just wanna link [this legendary cover](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C7Q10bfWEMQ&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)
The Masters Sun,A lullaby the breezes whisper..
The Masters Sun,"I didn't hate having Teela be the fous but I DID hate turning Skeletor into Joker and giving him the same exact abusive relationship with Evil Lynn.

We get it Kevin, you love batman and Mark Hamill but come up with something original."
The Masters Sun,I think it was over hated and I loved some aspects of it.  I do kinda question the direction it took though.  Who takes a show called HE-MAN and decides to make it mostly about the female side character?  Its odd.  Like a Barbie reboot that focused entirely on Ken.  But it was still overall enjoyable.
The Masters Sun,I didn't watxh the original  but the show was 80% good but the 20% that was bad really slowed down the show. Like you would have this great story then we would stop and focus on 1 issue or character and pause everything else. Made the show clunky. I am sure there is a version with a little editing it would be really good.
The Masters Sun,I loved it.
The Masters Sun,"No, just noisy Internet people."
The Masters Sun,Yes we did
The Masters Sun,"They wanted to flesh out the side characters so they took away He-man and Skeletor for the first half of the season and ""killed"" them off. Anyone with a half a brain knew they were coming back but half brains complained about wokeness because Teela was the main character. He-man and Skeletor come back in the second half of the season. The whole thing was done really well. Outside of the Fisto jokes that were cringey and get old quick I enjoyed it."
The Masters Sun,They watched it and talked about it. It doesn't matter if they liked it or not.
The Masters Sun,Hard to say. A certain portion of the internet definitely complained the loudest (many after not watching it or only watching the first episode or two) but if it got picked up apparently Netflix was happy with the numbers. So not sure it wasn't more noise than anything.
The Masters Sun,"It's nice to see people can finally dislike the show on this sub without being downvoted to oblivion and called sexist. I'm glad people have chilled out a bit.

I had a more mixed reaction to the show. Teela was a real drag and although Evil Lyn started off great, her character and arc fell apart after she supplanted Skeletor as the main villain. The side characters (including Adam which is weird to say about a He-Man show) were handled well though, so I think the show has some untapped potential if Smith forgets about the culture war and just writes a good show. I am cautiously optimistic about a second (or third? Who even knows with Netflix's release strategy) season."
The Masters Sun,"> nd for the most part the show was a joyless slog that damaged one of my childhood heroes. 

Watching old He-Man cartoons as an adult damaged the show/character for me."
The Masters Sun,The show is utter trash. Just awful.
The Masters Sun,"No one without a paper thin agenda is going to drag you over shitting on a Kevin Smith production

Although, i’ll give credit where it’s due, the Clerks cartoon was pretty good and probably the last decent thing he worked on."
The Masters Sun,Not sure if I totally agree with it being an upgrade.
The Masters Sun,Yup
The Masters Sun,sounds like a continuation
The Masters Sun,Was also hoping it would start fresh. But no.
The Masters Sun,Maybe her role in Wolf Pack?
The Masters Sun,The new He-Man show was mostly derided by a few weirdos on YouTube and their fans who didn't watch it; it's great.
The Masters Sun,"Huge fan other both MotU and SMG and I have to agree. Not the only one in that series either. I loved how much it celebrated the original toys and show but somehow it all came together as a meh show. Still glad we’re getting more, though."
The Masters Sun,The Tron one hasn’t been renewed yet.
The Masters Sun,How so? It was extremely successful for them.
The Masters Sun,See if it works out for 'em
The Masters Sun,They love losing money
The Masters Sun,Read the show title again...
The Masters Sun,"You do know that they quickly brought him back to life, right?  Like who didn't see that coming.  And it was actually cool seeing the other characters try to get by without relying on He-Man for awhile."
The Masters Sun,"He-Man was literally in the majority of the episodes lmfao

He was only absent from like two or three of them"
The Masters Sun,Forgot that Adam was voiced by Mon-El. Clearly Smith loved Supergirl.
The Masters Sun,"One could even say they’ve collaborated on multiple things.

Edit: I see you edited your comment to reflect their marriage."
The Masters Sun,I wanted them together in the show badly. Then I found out they’re married IRL and somehow my universe felt complete haha
The Masters Sun,Who doesn’t?
The Masters Sun,"Good for her. If I was successful enough to pick and choose what I worked on, I'd absolutely do stuff like this or being in awful movies for a free vacation. I'm never going to get mad at an actor for prioritizing a good time over their career.   
EXCEPT FOR YOU, TAYLOR LAUTNER! You thought you were too good to be Shark Boy again, but we all know where you came from, you coward!"
The Masters Sun,"No one likes to work.

I also don't mean that in a disparaging way."
The Masters Sun,"I have so much respect for that, and the way that somehow she and Freddy Prinze Jr have been able to keep their private lives mostly private.  Seems like one reason they are a successful couple. 

Married 20 years and they both look amazing and seem to have the right idea about work in general."
The Masters Sun,"Oh thank God.

I thought she had done/said something horrible. 

This was a much more benign explanation."
The Prince of Tennis,This is a bad idea
The Prince of Tennis,Still too much *Teen Titans Go!*
The Prince of Tennis,[deleted]
The Prince of Tennis,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
The Prince of Tennis,so what would be a better idea to you?
The Prince of Tennis,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
The Prince of Tennis,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
The Prince of Tennis,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
The Prince of Tennis,more scooby doo
The Prince of Tennis,[deleted]
The Prince of Tennis,was that supposed to be funny?
The Prince of Tennis,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
The Prince of Tennis,this entire post is a joke no?
The Prince of Tennis,[deleted]
The Prince of Tennis,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
The Prince of Tennis,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
The Prince of Tennis,I wonder how Christopher Eccleston would have reacted.
The Prince of Tennis,I liked the part where he danced shirtless to celebrate having sex
The Prince of Tennis,"he was fantastic at it, down to the slight limp the Prince carried all his life"
The Prince of Tennis,"The Queen apparently watched it too. I remember reading an interview after season 2 released. She said she enjoyed s1 and it was somewhat accurate, but she said s2 was a bit too dramatic for her but she still enjoyed it. In that same interview she said Prince Phillip hated the show and refused to watch passed a few episodes lol"
The Prince of Tennis,Wouldn't it be too awkward to watch a show about your family?
The Prince of Tennis,The Crown actually shows the Queen in a very good light...he'd have no reason not to like it tbh
The Prince of Tennis,"Nice disguise, Daemon"
The Prince of Tennis,I wonder what would happen if he saw Morbius
The Prince of Tennis,It must be pretty crazy seeing a dramatized account of his family while knowing the real story (which is probably much more boring let’s be honest)
The Prince of Tennis,"Tbf, there's probably a lot that the family doesn't talk about amongst themselves."
The Prince of Tennis,"Well Harry has a development deal with Netflix now, so that shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise lol both he and The Crown’s production team have the same boss"
The Prince of Tennis,"Once Dr Who, always Dr Who"
The Prince of Tennis,"after hearing Charles speak for the first time, he sounds remarkably similar to Matt Smith to the point where I misremembered who Smith actually played in the series."
The Prince of Tennis,Matt Daemon smith
The Prince of Tennis,Who wouldn’t watch such a personalized tv show. I imagine harry and Megan watching it together and he’s correcting shit along the way like “um not at all what happened” or confirming the narrative.
The Prince of Tennis,Where did Prince Phillip hide Caraxes?
The Prince of Tennis,"Why is this surprising? Of course he would watch it. It's about his family. Who wouldn't want to see how they portray your family?   


They also watched Hamilton, and that doesn't give a very positive portrayal of their family."
The Prince of Tennis,I want Matt smith to push me up against a wall
The Prince of Tennis,"After watching him on House of the Dragon, now I'll have to watch the Crown. Great actor."
The Prince of Tennis,I’m sorry. I can’t see Matt Smith without a bow tie on. It’s the Whovian in me.
The Prince of Tennis,"Harry seems to be the only cool royal, the rest are just MEH"
The Prince of Tennis,This has big “The Windsors” version of Harry energy and I love it. (And if you like absurd British humor lampooning the royal family for the love of god go to Netflix and watch this show. [It’s so dumb and I love it.)](https://youtu.be/w_DCYMviMsU)
The Prince of Tennis,Matt Smiths seasons were the best imo. Seasons after I was born seem less appealing.
The Prince of Tennis,"I’ve never seen doctor who, should I watch it all?"
The Prince of Tennis,MATT SMITH IS IN THE CROWN?! I would’ve watched it ages ago if I’d known!!!
The Prince of Tennis,[deleted]
The Prince of Tennis,I wonder when they’ll do the Epstein Island episode
The Prince of Tennis,"Why of course, not only one of the best doctors but royalty too."
The Prince of Tennis,"“People watch television!!!!””

Anyway"
The Prince of Tennis,Wouldn’t you watch a show about yourself?  Of course you would.
The Prince of Tennis,Mad respect to this guy. Don’t know him but he just displays the attributes of a good solid dude.
The Prince of Tennis,Or he just read somewhere that Matt Smith played his grandad.
The Prince of Tennis,Harry is so cool. I love him.
The Prince of Tennis,Of course he’s going to watch a show about his own family.
The Prince of Tennis,What did Prince Harry call Harry Enfield?
The Prince of Tennis,I think Matt's performance was great.
The Prince of Tennis,The sexual pairing we didn’t know we needed
The Prince of Tennis,i love matt smith
The Prince of Tennis,That must've been *weird.*
The Prince of Tennis,If you haven’t seen the series…Matt Smith brilliantly navigates Prince Phillip’s persona.  Bravo 👏
The Prince of Tennis,Harry arguably seems like the only average Joe of the family in terms of attitude.
The Prince of Tennis,"I can’t stand the thought of royalty, simply by birth right…..f the monarchy….

May Elizabeth be forgiven of her sins and Rest In Peace."
The Prince of Tennis,Must be weird watching your family portrayed on tv.
The Prince of Tennis,What a dumb article. How is this news?
The Prince of Tennis,In other news I don't care about the royals.
The Prince of Tennis,Could just be confused regarding who his real parents are
The Prince of Tennis,Hi sunshine sachs!!
The Prince of Tennis,Look! The gracious Prince looked at my show! Ah I feel so fortunate!
The Prince of Tennis,Of course they watched it. It’s like sucking themselves off.
The Prince of Tennis,I wonder if Harry still has his nazi uniform?
The Prince of Tennis,"Hey I know that guy. He's the ""haaaave sex! Haaaavee sex"" 🎶🎶🎶 guy from Morbius"
The Prince of Tennis,Fuck the monarchy
The Prince of Tennis,You perfectly captured grandfathers racism and idiotic ramblings.
The Prince of Tennis,s-should someone tell him?
The Prince of Tennis,None of these things ever happened
The Prince of Tennis,England is such a sad joke now.
The Prince of Tennis,Harry and Meghan admitted they watched The Crown during that Oprah interview
The Prince of Tennis,Is this news?
The Prince of Tennis,Boring post…. 💤 😴
The Prince of Tennis,Iiiiiii doubt it.
The Prince of Tennis,They’re just like us!
The Prince of Tennis,So what?
The Prince of Tennis,I hope Matt Smith is prepared to get a knife on his back courtesy of Hazbeen and Nutmeg.
The Prince of Tennis,He didn’t even go see his granddad before he died. Go figures he would credit an actor over his actual relatives.  Such a shame he is useless now
The Prince of Tennis,No one give a shit
The Prince of Tennis,It's settled then: id I ever meet Kevin Costner I'm calling him my great-great-great-grandfather
The Prince of Tennis,"Wait till the Targaryen incest starts…wait, too late"
The Prince of Tennis,"I thought he played Prince Phillip, not James Hewitt’s dad."
The Prince of Tennis,Harry watches Netflix all day
The Prince of Tennis,Just like the judge who singed off on the raid at mar a lago?
The Prince of Tennis,Harry's wife let him watch the show?
The Prince of Tennis,Would you _not_ watch a show about yourself and your family? Of course he watches!
The Prince of Tennis,Who gives a shit
The Prince of Tennis,Billy likes to drink soda.
The Prince of Tennis,It’s interesting that Matt smith’s whole thing now is playing princes
The Prince of Tennis,I hope Harry runs into Tobias Menzies as well.
The Prince of Tennis,"I think because of this role, and him playing my favourite version of Doctor Who, when I watched the first episode of House of the Dragon and saw him in that brothel I cringed and had to look away."
The Prince of Tennis,I think he admitted to watching the show in a James cordon interview a couple years ago.
The Prince of Tennis,Of course he watched the show. His whole family did. Who wouldn’t watch a show about themselves?
The Prince of Tennis,"With the show rotating its cast one more time, I have a wonderful idea for this actor's last gig:

https://www.newsweek.com/queen-impersonator-retires-out-respect-after-34-years-1742091

Just one more time, please . So it's perfect."
The Prince of Tennis,Granddad or Granddaddy?
The Prince of Tennis,Maybe he’ll move back to his country now
The Prince of Tennis,Is this the start to a porn???
The Prince of Tennis,OMG LIFE LIKE TV SHOW AND BIDEO GAMES 😱
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Just make cookies, we're all fine with it."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Kind of a weird episode, but has GBBO been in a ""fall from grace?"" First I've heard of it."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,The Swedish fish cakes were way worse
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,">Making a chocolate and chilli concha seems like a good idea, but using birdseye chilli instead of the myriad indigenous Mexican chiles seems like a bad one.

Birdseye chillies are native to Mexico. Also the article misspells the plural of chilli."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"It was a bad episode, but I hate all this talk about Bake Off being on some sort of downturn. I watch the show for the good vibes, charming bakers, and cool bakes. Why do people insist on stoking a bunch of drama around it?"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Can you imagine if they told them to make dulce de Leche with a can in the technical? That would have been great fucking TV lol.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,The old lady peeling the avocado IS Iconic!!!!!
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I thought for a second it was the Mexican version of the  show but still called ""Great British Bake Off""."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"If anyone has ever tried Mexican food in Europe, this should be no surprise. It is absolutely insane how Mexico has one of the best cuisines ON THE PLANET and it gets botched so thoroughly anywhere outside of the Western Hemisphere. 

Mexico has such fantastic food, PLEASE try it Europe."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"It was dumb to have a technical that doesn't involve any baking, but other than that, I thought it was a good episode."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I’m half Mexican and I didn’t find the show particularly racist or offensive, except to good taste. Matt Lucas’ bad, hacky jokes and the taco challenge were pretty cringe. It’s like they didn’t do any research at all because there are plenty of other Mexican baked goods they could have done for the technical. Heck, even if not baked, I find tamales to be a huge PITA to get the texture right and they take hours to make so perhaps that wouldn’t have been fitting with the show’s limits. Sweet tamales are a big thing in Mexico too. 
My Central American roots think empanadas would have been a pretty good challenge too. Heck, they could have made the episode “Latin American” themed to cover more options. 

I still like the show and will continue watching it but this seems like it was a missed opportunity to highlight some amazing cuisine from Mexico to Argentina."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"There are literally dozens of other baked goods they could have made instead of fucking tacos, that part was delusional. I liked the idea of a Tres Leches Cake but again they were nothing like what you would get at a mexican bakery here in the states.  


It was a decent episode, but they could have at least had a mexican baker as a consult to help them make it reasonably good."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,I will never accept jokes about American cultural ignorance from a Brit ever again.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,This reeks of the same shit that happened after the Japanese episode
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"The dragging on Twitter has been delightful. The perfect thing to fall on Hispanic Heritage month as it gives us all something to laugh at. Episode was mostly harmless, but good god England"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I just took it as a Mexican-themed episode, not a tribute to authentic Mexican cuisine. How could it ever be that with a room full of amateur British pastry chefs? What a bizarre controversy."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,">Beyond being grievously offensive to Mexico, its people, and its culture

Good lord. This English fancy lad should talk to some actual Mexicans or Tejanos. ""Grievously offensive"". A shame he doesn't live in the US, because then he wouldn't have to put out this shlock to pay off the loans for his apparently useless journalism degree!

Part of the fun of watching this show is watching the parochial people on that side of the pond flail comically at some of our food in other places. But young people, often hopelessly rootless and alienated ones, tend to cling desperately to the only cultural signifiers they have, like culinary culture, as fetishes to be jealously possessed rather than a source of joy to be shared and enjoyed. And yes that includes watching hapless brits screw it up!"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"As a Mexican, I could not stop cringing from how corny and fucking stupid the humor was."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Eh. I thought there was a fair amount of ignorance when it comes to Mexican food (not quite sure if Paul is clear of the difference between a taco and a tortilla but whatever). It was a little aggravating to see some of my favorite things get trampled on by people who don’t know what they are doing but that’s just part of these shows. I don’t know how to prepare a lot of dishes from far off countries and I’m in the kitchen cooking 5-6 days a week. My only experience on the UK was a rainy bus ride from Gatwick to Heathrow so I’m not qualified to speak to the number of Mexican restaurants or even Tex-mex, cali-mex or any other local American version of the food available in the country to use for comparison. 

Also amusing, fajitas are technically a Tex-mex dish made by Mexican ranch workers who got paid in meat (usually less desirable parts like the skirt). Not a Mexican one. Similar but not the same."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Where did I put the glocky-molo?
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"This article is ridiculous. It takes small random things and tries to make it out to have had more screen time than a second. These are not professional bakers,  the REASON we watch them is that they are imperfect, they don't know everything.  There are shows with all pro's competing against each other.  People watch this show because the mistakes can be entertaining as well as making the accomplishments delightful. They were NOT disrespectful at all in the show. Geez, everyone has to go after everything these days. It was a show of inexperienced bakers, who were NOT racist in any way, doing the thing we watch the show in the first place for."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,People acting like Mexican week was the worst are ignoring the blatant hate crime that was the pizza signature bake.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"When Carole said ""guacimolo"" I almost lost my shit lol"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"""Tack-ohs""  My ears were bleeding."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"If anyone went into that episode expecting anything more than fumbling attempts at Mexican cuisine, well, that’s on you. I grew up in the Southwest steeped in Mexican and native culture which I doubt the average Brit gets to experience short of extensive travel, and still couldn’t make a proper taco or pastry. It just made me want to go to that Mexican bakery the next town over and pick up some Marranitos."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"On a side note - I thought the weirdest thing was the older pink-haired chick staying and Rebs getting the boot instead.

Rebs' cake must have been just terrible, like beyond inedible.  The other lady was was dead last in each of the other challenges."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Who uses the word nadir?
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I think the show has lost it. 

Mel and Sue, and Mary, have been replaced by people really charmless. A guy who dates teenagers, a guy mostly famous for doing blackface and making fun of the poor and disabled. Which would matter less if they managed to be funny but they aren’t- it’s just intensely self satisfied mugging. 

And Prue - who is a massive tory (and her son is literally one of the worst MPs in the Commons). Have disliked her intensely since Great British Menu. Probably the least likeable mainstream TV personality out there. 

The fun of the show should be in seeing amateurs and hobbyists make high-end, complex or classic baked goods, the stuff you might come across but have no idea what would actually go into making it. I have zero interest in ‘make a replica of your nan’s garden out of a [insert cake]’. I think the curveball stuff they’d have saved for the finale in previous years is just every week now. 

I think some shows just end up feeling out of step with the times, Bake off is one."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"For one, why were they making tacos on a baking show…? Two, I’ve never been to a Mexican food place that puts refried beans on a taco. Not even that, refried beans are typically made with pinto beans, but they gave them black beans…???"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Wut. The episode might not have been the best ever, but it was still a decent episode.

The only episode of this show that sucked imo was when that young female finalist a couple seasons ago (sry can't remember her name) had a breakdown over her bakes going badly. That was pretty gloomy to watch."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I mean if it was the 1950s I could see this as them saying ""yep, nothing at all wrong here. "". But one thing I noted in the UK, there aren't Latinos, no Mexican food. But Indian food and Jamaican was readily available. Halal. Just a different part of the world. Contrast that with our ignorance of Indians."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"From the article:

>Why does this show not want to teach people anything?

I would posit that a big part of the appeal of the show is I *don't have to learn anything*. I can put it on, stare at pleasant people making food, and comment that ""that probably tastes amazing"" to my roommate. When I want to learn stuff in my programming, I watch different shows."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,This smacks of an offended person looking for things to get offended about.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"This person obviously hates the show and took this bad episode to try and take them down I guess? There are plenty of shows that can teach you things, this is just a light hearted competition show that has amateurs trying to make things. There is zero nefarious action here."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Being a in a blended family of Mexican Americans, was super damn disappointed. Like seriously, a big mustache on a cake is NOT racist? Uh, not cool, and from a POC too. And then, don't get me talking about the tacos. Tacos are NOT baked, nor do they belong on a baking contest. It shows a sincere lack of engagement with the Mexican culture."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Was the worst 🤣
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,The only thing that really got me was the Taco competition. There was barely any baking. It was all stovetop.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,I remember the “Japan” week lmao
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"""One does not bake a taco."" Yes!!! I kept screaming at my TV during this segment."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Clearly, they need to stick to bakes from cultures Britain has occupied in one point in history. Mexican bakeries have some AMAZING foods in very vibrant colors and flavors this was an awesome opportunity squandered."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"You guys remember the American episode? Where Paul Hollywood spent the entire time bashing pies, they all of them made a tart, not a pie, in the most disgusting flavor combinations you've ever heard of, and then agreed it's because American pies are inherently terrible?"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Swear to god it’s always just the same group of white people getting upset on behalf of another culture and writing articles about it.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Do people really think the show is not good any more?  I mostly watch it because my wife likes it, but honestly it's the only baking show I can stomach, but I haven't noticed a significant difference in the show now compared to the early days.  I think Noel and Sandi were the best hosts, but I'm not sure the appeal of the show is necessarily the hosts."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"This is all overblown just like the asian week a few seasons ago. Yes it’s cringey british interpretation of mexican cuisine, what do you expect? They’re nowhere near mexico. The show is still all charm, so what if they’re silly and have extremely british takes on food from other places."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"It wasn't a great episode, but this article is ridiculous"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"There was nothing offensive about this episode, stop the bullshit."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,I think you need to be the race or identity that is supposedly offended before you can write about the supposed offense. This being offended on behalf of others is actually offense appropriation. And is NOT ok. *literally shaking intensifies*
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Nadir? So it’s getting better again?
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"All in all it wasn’t as bad as social media made it out to be, there were definitely some terrible stereotypes there’s no getting around that but I wouldn’t call it the downfall of the show. That woman peeling an avocado though…. I wanted to climb through my TV and smack her."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Not seen the episode so only a limited understanding of what went on in the show.

But is this really that offensive? It feels in this overly sensitive age we are giving ammunition to the right. This makes them feel justified in calling us snowflakes and saying the left is ridiculous. 

And that means there is room for genuine racism and other bigotry to slip in which is unacceptable.

Sterotypes can be in poor taste, or sometimes something fun. There are many about the English, bad food, poor food etc yet those who make those are not said to be racist and I am not sure the Mexican stereotypes are either."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"It's pretty gross, though, the number of people who reacted to this trainwreck by saying stuff along the lines of ""white people shouldn't cook Mexican food."" Food is food (and Mexicans be white anyway). Let's stop with food-related racism.

The episode itself may have gone poorly but I like the idea of them branching out. Like, okay, Victorian sponge, jaffa cakes, hobnobs, fraisier cakes, over and over again. It's good to have a little variety. The main problem was there wasn't much *baking* happening. Why did they have to make guacamole?? 

Also the people throwing fucking hissyfits about them not saying stuff like taco correctly?? It's called a regional accent. And there's one person who was like ""They're practically next door to Spain and they can't pronounce these things correctly"" like??? They're pretty far apart from each and also, again, accents. 

If I were in charge I think I would've done an international bread week instead of this. Like for the first round they have to make traditional Irish soda bread, the technical is challah, and the showstopper is Norwegian Skolebrød. All of it involves baking, nobody has to figure out how to open an avocado (but why wouldn't you look up how to do that beforehand? They're told what the challenges for the episode except for the technical are a week ahead of time, wouldn't you figure ""gee it's Mexico week, maybe I should look up how to open an avocado *just in case*""??)"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Huh what a weird article to make
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,They have the fucking worst jokes. Why the hell would you put a little Britain star as a main stake of this show.!??? They have no jokes that are family friendly and sound like a dummy when they deliver
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,So far!
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"So is it an inaccurate stereotype or cultural appropriation? It can't be both.

(edit: I'm well aware that at the very least it's blinkered, ignorant bullshit)"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,People are so sensitive
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"The way people lose their minds over a show about baking cakes astounds me. I've seen about ten threads on Reddit about Mexican week. People need to accept the show for what it is, and get out more."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Honestly enjoying the show as much today as the first season, idk what the hubbub is about. One meh episode a “nadir of downturn” does not make, and there have been PLENTY of less exciting episodes. It’s a feel good, fun show that just doesn’t require this sort of critical eye to me. Honestly, who cares?"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"This whole article is terribly cringe and dramatic. GBBO is far from a “fall from grace”.

Its still charming, creative and wholesome."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"terrible job 
by far the worst GBBS 
I feel bad for people that watched this and “learned” about Mexican cooking/baking unacceptable I lost respect for British folks on this"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Bake Off sucks now which sucks because it was one of my fav shows going back to Mel and Sue, no surprise America and Netflix got a hold of it and it’s declined ever since"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,White people get offended by the weirdest things.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,[deleted]
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"It was a poor choice. The contestants had no idea what tacos should taste like. Mexican food is the opposite of English food. Mexican food is spicy, flavorful, and a smorgasbord of flavors and textures. Tacos (when done right) come topped with fresh lettuce and fresh diced tomatoes. English food is… not."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,it's fine. Relax
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding getting their comeuppance would bring me joy
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Is that buttery biscuit base bloke still on it?
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"In the UK’s defense, Mexican cuisine is really only known in the New World in any reasonable manner. While Asian and Africans from the Old World have brought their food traditions to the New World as well as Europe, Mexican—and Latin American cuisine overall has not made it out, likely due to migration patterns. 

Ingredients have, but not techniques or recipes."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Prue kill another kitten?
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Japan week was pretty bad: pandas and kowai cake. 

Pandas have never lived in Japan, and ""kowai cake"" is ""scary cake"". (They meant ""kawaii cake"", or ""cute cake"".) Great Canadian Baking Show made the same blunder with ""kowai cake""."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,TL;DR: ***Stop liking what I don't like!!!***
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I just couldn’t get over the fact that their “refried beans” were just beans and onions cooked in a pot and then put on the taco. The refried part was non-existent. I was expecting them to get judged on the fact that no one actually did the refried part, but then it wasn’t even mentioned. Churros would have been a way better technical."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"The only thing that was a ""disappointment"" was Rebs not getting voted off earlier, and I didn't have the actual tacos in front of me. It was a weird episode for sure, but I've watched far worse things than an usually charming one show doing something slightly different."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I feel like the hate for this episode was wildly overblown? I watched the episode expecting absolute disaster from what I had heard all week, and it was just fine? Some of the jokes were naïve/ignorant, but I didn't feel like there was anything mean-spirited about anything they did."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,As an American I absolutely loved watching British folk try and mostly fail to cook Mexican food. The show is still great. The contestants last season were better (THE JURGENATOR!!) but the show is fine.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,I mean besides the single joke at the beginning and the fact they made tacos which didn't require baking at all was weird but this is just a silly article
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Nadir is weirdly the word of the week. Covid, GBBO, etc."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,The real hate crime was what they did to my cultures food. They could have made them make so many different things but it got left on the sidelines
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,They were fine
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I stopped watching last series , is it still good… my interest waned, can’t put my finger on it , maybe it’s just run it’s course ? Or are people still loving it ?"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,so far.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I think this is a bit of an exaggeration. Fall from grace? Hardly. Lazy writing and poorly thought out challenges? Absolutely. 

Aside from the horrible pronunciation of some of the bakes and a misunderstanding of the concept of a taco, it feels like the production team didn’t know quite what to do with Mexican week but went on with it anyway. That’s a shame because these assignments were stupid and didn’t send the right people home. Carole should have left weeks ago.

But yes, the stereotyping wasn’t funny and the assignments bad. Just a bad episode and hope they will do better. Dessert week was already lots better so it goes to show: stick with what you know."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I’m Mexican and this was hilarious, I was literally cracking up with my friends. Thank you for making this entertaining shows! ❤️ Made my night 🤣

And of course we Mexicans don’t take offense! Mexican cuisine is designated by UNESCO as a cultural treasure 😋 you’re missing out on all the flavorful dishes that we offer to the world 🌎"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"S'mores technical challenge says ""hold my beer"""
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I was most offended by the lack of hygiene. One lady tastes her product with her finger and goes back to cooking, then right after another one sneezes into the open. There's no way I'd have tried any of it without ample hand washing"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"As a baker, Texan, and Spanish speaker (with a British husband), I was offended on many levels by their lack of understanding of a tres leches cake. And the fact that everyone in the episode kept calling the “tortilla” the “taco”."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Or bread!  Actual loaves of bread.  Pizza, a pastry, and a cake made of sandwiches is not necessary!"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,So many pastries they could have done!
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,Oh the days where contestants were asked to make Farthing Biscuits...
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I'll be honest, this series hasn't grabbed me like previous years have"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"The sketches are annoying, the show works better when it's just the stuff in the tent"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,There was a noticeable dip in quality once Mary Berry left. Also Noel and Matt arent really suited to hosting a baking show.
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"It's been on a downturn ever since they got rid of the cool ~~lesbian~~ extremely funny comedienne hosts and brought on the Mall Goth and Mr Dumbshirt. They're not funny; most of their 'jokes' are making things more difficult for the contestants and then laughing at it. They resort to gimmicks over actual humor.

EDIT because I apparently misremembered how one of them were described."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I've always preferred the Australian, Canadian, & Kiwi versions myself."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I gagged for that entire segment, and I love fish OR cakes."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I’m a Swede and I had to google to find out what a ""Swedish fish cake"" even is. If it is what is essentially a patty but made with fish instead of ground meat I can’t see how that was part of a baking show. The heck."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"Also they still had to use items they had readily available to them in the UK. So even if they wanted to use other ingredients, they likely had to use what they could."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"I was gonna say, I’m no pepper expert but my fancy recipe magazines associate it with Mexico, it’s just often subbed for Thai chilles if you can’t find them"
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"> the article misspells the plural of chilli

""Chiles"" is listed in dictionaries as a legit variant. There are lots of spellings for chillies."
The Great British Baking Show: The Beginnings,"All of the contestants collectively disrespected pizza in the previous bread week episode, which was so much more offensive. =p"

Girl from Nowhere,AND FOSTER'S REBOOT TOO!
Girl from Nowhere,So does this mean the live action CW show is dead?
Girl from Nowhere,Animated and I’ll watch that shit.
Girl from Nowhere,hope they can bring back all the voices too.
Girl from Nowhere,"Hey, at least the original creator is working on it this time. Just hope the VAs from the 90s will come back as well."
Girl from Nowhere,Will this all end up in hbo max?
Girl from Nowhere,I am so happy to be able to say that Powerpuff Girls could learn a thing or two from Beavis and Butthead
Girl from Nowhere,"Hope they bring back ""Bis"" [who performed the credits theme from the original show.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6epMQlNWtI)"
Girl from Nowhere,Powerpuff Girls getting another reboot makes me so frustrated because the Kids Next Door crew were ready to do a continuation like 7 years ago and CN turned it down. They don’t seem to have any love for their legacy shows aside from PPG.
Girl from Nowhere,"Literally the only reason I give a shit is cause Craig’s back. Hopefully the Magic’s still there, I’m cautiously optimistic!"
Girl from Nowhere,"Well if Craig McCracken's involved, I have hope that it'll be decent at least."
Girl from Nowhere,Fosters reboot too
Girl from Nowhere,"They can finally do justice to the most under utilized villain, the salami swami!"
Girl from Nowhere,Thank goodness Craig is involved as here is a friendly reminder that one of the writers from that god awful reboot [insterted himself in the show and shipped himself with Blossom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCk19DiEM5g)
Girl from Nowhere,Okay this will be the third one in like 6 years.
Girl from Nowhere,I thought they already did?
Girl from Nowhere,"[Me when I hear there's a yet another Powerpuff Girls reboot](https://morbotron.com/img/S02E11/165131.jpg)

[Me when I hear it's a Craig McCracken project](https://morbotron.com/img/S02E11/170353.jpg)"
Girl from Nowhere,"Does this mean the CW show is dead in the water?

Edit: Apparently not"
Girl from Nowhere,Again?
Girl from Nowhere,"Where do they think the market is for this? I was a fan of PPG but I never thought, you know what I wish they'd bring back?"
Girl from Nowhere,As long as it’s not the live action version cw was going to do
Girl from Nowhere,The Powerpuff ladies.
Girl from Nowhere,no i want the dumpster fire cw one to watch ironically
Girl from Nowhere,But will there be a proud gay black woman? That’s what I need to know.
Girl from Nowhere,"Unless we are getting a gritty, tv MA anti-superhero show, I don't think I have the capacity to care about any additional reboots of Powerpuff Girls."
Girl from Nowhere,I thought Lauren Faust was the creator for these shows. Silly me.
Girl from Nowhere,I wonder why? It can’t be because random equal comedy isn’t as profitable as they think it is.
Girl from Nowhere,"A fosters home reboot as well, I'm definitely tuning in."
Girl from Nowhere,I’m still waiting for the Rowdy Rough Boys spin off..
Girl from Nowhere,**Johnny Bravo!**
Girl from Nowhere,"Am I going crazy? Wasn’t there already one?

ain’t a bad thing but yknowt"
Girl from Nowhere,"after seeing these CN reboots, live action remakes, and other sub-par prjects

""fine... i'll do it myself"""
Girl from Nowhere,"a new, new new reboot?"
Girl from Nowhere,Another Powerpuff Girls reboot?
Girl from Nowhere,"i hope the reboot will be as dark and serious as Batman: The Animated Series, while the girls themselves will be as ridiculously overpowered as Silver Age Superman, with as much toonforce as Popeye, and yet the villains must be remade into serious characters

remaking the show needs to be serious, there is alot of potential into this, if done right. McCracken needs to have full creative control, i hope CN will not screw him over"
Girl from Nowhere,Kid Cosmic was absolutely phenomenal and anyone who hasn't watched it yet should seriously give it a go. Craig McCracken hasn't lost a bit of his mojo and I'm super excited to see him back working on PPGs again!
Girl from Nowhere,"> The live action Powerpuff Girls show is separate and still in development.

No idea why PPG even needs a live action adaptation, or that anybody asked for it.  I remember Chloe Bennet dropped out of its development pretty early on.  [Probably because the script sucks](https://movieweb.com/powerpuff-girls-script-leak-fan-reactions/).  Shame that Donald Faison seems to be still on it though, I feel like the dude could probably pick better projects than this."
Girl from Nowhere,I see that name and all i hear is [Dear McCracken ](https://youtu.be/aWGolv2iqM0)
Girl from Nowhere,Can the new Foster's Home show even be considered a reboot if it doesn’t have the same setting or characters? Why not just call it a spinoff.
Girl from Nowhere,"Dude! Foster’s Home reboot!! That’s kick ass!

I really hope that the reboot tones down Bloo’s asshole-ishness a bit.

Also, for a show about imaginary friends, the last 2 seasons felt kinda stale and unimaginative in their story telling, and felt like they were relying on reusing ideas way too much.

The first 3 seasons were stellar though. Kinda like SpongeBob. Up to “Good Wilt Hunting” which feels much closer to a finale type special."
Girl from Nowhere,Knew Craig was up to something after seeing this [April 2022 Twitter post](https://twitter.com/CrackMcCraigen/status/1510118383999610884?t=VMWA17PO9QQIgEiSXWqf4A&s=19) when he visited Cartoon Network Studios.
Girl from Nowhere,"Well the pre-school not-really-a-reboot-but-idk-what-to-call-it of Total Drama Island was awful, I know this is a completely different show from different people but..."
Girl from Nowhere,Pre-school reboot of Foster's Home? Why not just a reboot :(
Girl from Nowhere,"Dude, nice. Fosters gang"
Girl from Nowhere,"Or have one of the writers write himself into the show and has Blossom fall in love with him.

I'm not kidding."
Girl from Nowhere,Hope the new voice actor for The Professor might be decent. Same with HIM.
Girl from Nowhere,That moment is burned in my memory.
Girl from Nowhere,Did that actually happen? I thought it was all a fever dream that got canned before production.
Girl from Nowhere,"And the most amount of times Cartoon network has rebooted a series, and longest running on technicality beating Ed edd and eddy"
Girl from Nowhere,This is the one I'm excited for.  BLUE CHEEZE!!!!!
Girl from Nowhere,Okay so years ago when CN had their website filled with fun flash games they also had these short clips.  One of them was a fosters remix/video of bloo going ‘look at me dancing around lalala dancing around’ x2. Been looking for it ever since but it’s been stuck in my head all these years.
Girl from Nowhere,"From the article:

>A live-action CW reboot, titled Powerpuff, was first announced in 2020. A pilot starring Chloe Bennet (Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) as Blossom, Dove Cameron (Schmigadoon!) as Bubbles and Broadway’s Yana Perrault as Buttercup was filmed in 2021, but was not picked up to series. Bennet has since exited the project, **which TVLine is told remains in active development at the network.**"
Girl from Nowhere,"I hope not. That script was the greatest thing I've ever read


>Blossom’s fine. I saw on her Insta 
that she has a boyfriend, I saw on 
her LinkedIn that she got promoted, 
and I saw on Facebook that she 
still talks to Grandpa despite 
their political differences."
Girl from Nowhere,Let's hope so.
Girl from Nowhere,You'd think Zazlav would have cut that shit loose. I mean how much money is he gonna sink into that? They canceled Riverdale for christ sakes. The golden calf
Girl from Nowhere,CW has been going scorched earth on their original programming. I’d be shocked if this ever sees the light of day.
Girl from Nowhere,I hope the Nexstar buyout took care of that
Girl from Nowhere,The Powerpuff Girls had a very unique art style that I still love to this day. The 2016 series was too bright and simplified for my taste.
Girl from Nowhere,Sadly Tom Kane won't be able to return due to suffering a severe stroke recently.
Girl from Nowhere,"Tom Kane won't be coming back for obvious reasons, but I definitely hope the bring as much as the original cast back as possible"
Girl from Nowhere,"Almost everybody, except Tom Kane."
Girl from Nowhere,Of course. It's not like anyone still watches the cable Cartoon Network channel.
Girl from Nowhere,"I hope they bring back the violence and darker moments. The 2016 series lost me when it was mainly focused on slice of life and more comedic focused. The original show was this at times but not 100% as the 2016 series. The episode Speed Demon where the girls go to the dark future of Townsville fucked me up as a child!

The entirety of Townsville: ""It's all your fault! Your fault! Your fault!"""
Girl from Nowhere,The Kids Next Door reboot would been perfect for HBO Max.
Girl from Nowhere,They tend to focus on the more popular shows so I assume the kids next door show didn’t do as well as they wanted but I wouldn’t mind a reboot. I just don’t think they would be able to get away with the same kind of humor or darkness the original did.
Girl from Nowhere,I trust Craig McCracken more than the people at CW.
Girl from Nowhere,goddamn
Girl from Nowhere,"fourth, if you count the anime, but I can't recall how long ago that was a thing."
Girl from Nowhere,There's a big difference between a show that's being made and a show that hasn't been cancelled yet.
Girl from Nowhere,I'm all in since Craig McCracken is working on it. Which is why I've avoided the 2016 reboot and the grittier take by CW.
Girl from Nowhere,"Honestly it's probably just so they can push more merchandise imo.

It isn't a juggernaut like Space Jam was/is in that department, but I still see PPG shirts and stuff all over the place in my local Walmart and Hot Topic.

Plus, it'd explain why WB has tried to reboot/continue it as much as they have (at least three times not including this one and the live action CW project)."
Girl from Nowhere,"If it's good, the market is the same exact market as any other cartoon + nostalgic parents."
Girl from Nowhere,"Something I've realised from when the CW was talking about a reboot....there's some weirdly obsessive Powerpuff Girl fans out there, who absolutely care passionately."
Girl from Nowhere,They are still working on it apparently.
Girl from Nowhere,Then again Lauren Faust does have a similar art style as Craig McCracken. So I don't blame you on that one.
Girl from Nowhere,Kid Cosmic is fucking fantastic.
Girl from Nowhere,"He kinda/sorta [put the PPGs into *Kid Cosmic*](https://catherinecavadini.com/the-ppgs-appear-in-the-netflix-series-kid-cosmic/)*.* :D  Laughed my butt off when the voice credits for the Planet Protection Group agents went by.

I will also point out that I think part of the feelz on *Kid Cosmic* may also have been from the fact that Francisco Angones *(Ducktales 2017* co-showrunner) took a part in the development/writing, too."
Girl from Nowhere,"Yeah, but the fact is Netflix killed their entire animation department so now McCracken's back on Cartoon Network."
Girl from Nowhere,Discovery will drag that thing out behind the barn and double-tap it.
Girl from Nowhere,"> No idea why PPG even needs a live action adaptation, or that anybody asked for it.

Reminds me of the live-action *Kim Possible* movie that ended up being the disaster everyone had predicted."
Girl from Nowhere,they already made the pilot and it was so bad they'll never air it. I imagine they're completely reworking the script. they need to scrap the entire thing.
Girl from Nowhere,Rumours are that Chloe Bennet droped because she is in Secret Invasion or something.
Girl from Nowhere,Maybe it's a sequel series.
Girl from Nowhere,I'm just praying we finally manage to get a third season of Wonder Over Yonder
Girl from Nowhere,I like cheese
Girl from Nowhere,The Foster's reboot is aimed at pre-school kids and stars a different cast.
Girl from Nowhere,"I think unlike DramaRama, which was still meant to be a comedy for 7 - 11 year olds, this new Foster's show will *actually* be a preschooler show, aimed at preschoolers. CN does have a preschool block now."
Girl from Nowhere,"Wasn't there another writer on the show that would post about weird fantasies with teenagers?

Just seems like a gaggle full of great people on that staff."
Girl from Nowhere,[deleted]
Girl from Nowhere,"Man...I should have figured this was happening in cartoons. because it's been happening in comic books for a long time which us why that industry is hanging by a thread. Instead hiring decent writers (who are all going independent) they just hire psychopaths from twitter who do nothing but make self insert fan fiction. The only prerequisite for getting hired is that you have to have the right politics.

I don't want to post pictures of real people, but man. There are articles pointing it out. Showing these goofy looking characters who all look exactly like their creators. And all of these have super low sales. Because no one wants to read about the overweight depressed daughter of a pretty super hero or about super girl popping her pimple and being covering in her own puss. 

The Blossom thing has a big layer of creepy though. bleh. People do that all the time on deviant art, but it's usually actual kids doing that with different characters. Not adults who are supposed to be professional."
Girl from Nowhere,oh yeah I forgot Tom Kane unfortunately had a stroke.
Girl from Nowhere,"Sadly yes, and don't get me started with Bliss."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Luna:

>“What this character does in ‘Rogue One’ is quite remarkable, and what we are building shows what needs to happen in someone’s life to be willing to sacrifice everything. For me, this has always been a story where the people bringing change, the ones you can call heroes, are just regular people doing extraordinary things.”  

>“There’s no time for the hangover. You wake up the next morning and there is always something to do.” 
  
>“This is the last season for ‘Andor'. It is just a two-season show, which is really important for my mental health. But knowing this is the end, I want to enjoy it and get the best out of this experience.”"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I am glad they have planned a natural endpoint for the series. It makes logical sense because of the time leading up to Rogue One. It’s good to see the producers won’t milk beyond believability in-universe.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,He said almost the exact same thing about his role ending on Narcos and the mental toll it took to play Felix.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"> As a teenager, **his foray into Mexican cinema came at a time when actors lent their own clothes and cars for the part.** 


> “It was well known that if you were asked to do cinema, **the last thing you would do is think of getting paid,**” he says. 

😲 

A tough industry."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"If it stays on the same quality im perfectly happy for them to wrap it up at their choosing.  
Sure i would like more, but they know what they can do with the story and their pacing has been excellent so far."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Ending after two seasons sounds a whole lot better than we don't know when or how this is going to end.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"This is great news. It means the story has a plan, and will finish on its own terms.

Andor is the best Star Wars product since the original movies, and unlike way too many shows that were milked to death until they became silly and boring, this show will tell one *good* story with a real ending, then be over. 

I'm happy to get two seasons with a coherent, consistent, well thought-out narrative over a show that drags on and on to squeeze out as much profit as possible before being canceled with no conclusion."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Get this man 'Yabba the Hutt', he'll do 10 seasons of Andor."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Andor made me realize that I don’t care about lightsabers or Jedi at all. It’s the fight between the Rebels and the Empire that matters.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"for those who love Luna, please watch Y Tu Mama Tambien"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"At first I wondered why Andor got a show in the first place. In this world of Jedi, Sith, Mandolorians and Clone Troopers, why that guy from Rogue One? It took a few episodes, but I am glad Andor proved me wrong!"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Also important for a good story that it will actually end!

I wish more TV shows did a few good seasons with a coherent story and then ended it."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Honestly, 2 seasons is perfect."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Really hope they stick to the early plans & have it end where Rogue One begins.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,More shows need to have a set of end-date. Otherwise they end up like Lost and just meander endlessly.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"This is good to hear, Andor doesn’t need to be a series that should just go on for no reason. Looking forward to S2!"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Not many shows have the foresight and confidence to end deliberately and not stretch things out. Sounds like there was a lot of corporate pressure to milk this thing and Gilroy fought them. Good for him. Much better for the show's legacy.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"It's kind of odd to me, since his role on Andor is almost that of an observer for much of it.  He's a good actor and I like him but it didn't look like a particularly demanding role compared to others. I mean I'd more understand it if Adria Arjona said this."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I love when shows have a clear path for the entirety of the story instead of either just dragging it on or getting canceled before it's finished.  I hope we see more of these.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I think a show like this could really go awry if it had too many seasons. If it ran for too long, it would have risked jumping the shark and compromising its own tone. It's good that it has a planned end point."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Hopefully they find a cameo appearance for Gael Garcia Bernal.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"“With everything going on in the world, it’s really hard to play pretend”"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,It makes sense that it's just two seasons.  It would be gluttonous to cram too much stuff between his origins story and the beginning of Rogue One.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Much prefer a short show that ends it when it's supposed to end rather than milking a show for 5 seasons. Sort of what happened to Stranger Things, Season 1 was glorious, but everything after that has been just above mediocre with a few glimpses of greatness here and there sprinkled in."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I’m sad to see it go, but I understand. 
He’s great in it, and it’s an amazing show"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Me too Diego. Me too.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Only 2 seasons FeelsBadMan I would have loved atleast 3-4
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Good. End it before it Disney ends up filling it full of moped biker teens and kitschy space pirates.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,It's good for a show to have a planned end point instead of just going on and on until the network decides to axe it.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,If only Felix had the same insight to stop before it gets outta control
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Spoiler alert: Andor’s story is a limited run series.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,it just started.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Rogue one is one of my favorite movies ever.. not just star wars movie but all.

Remember going to see it in the theater and it being wayyyy beyond anything I was expecting. It blew me away. The intensity of it all..backed by great performances by some of my favorite on screen talents. Forest Whitaker..ben mendelson..donnie yen..(really hope he shows in in some manner again)..mads mikkelsen.. wasn't really familar with Luna or felicity jones at time but both great. Some others too.. also probably my favorite droid and one of if not the best Vader cameos ever.

Understand the mental health comment.

Andor is a great show but it is makes me anxious as hell. Really tense. Part of what makes it so good."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,thank god it’s a prequel with a destined ending before thingy mouse wants juice it for another 5 seasons
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Andor has been the best Star Wars show by far, which makes sense because Rogue One was the best of the recent films."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,By far the best Star Wars show. Sad
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Honestly, more North American TV needs to be given an end date - all shows. Get the ark, tell the story, end gracefully."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Same
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Well good thing he has enough in the bank to go lay on a beach for as long as he wants afterwards lmao. I think he'll survive.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Diego Luna knows that anyone who acts too long in a Star Wars property will suffer a terrible fate (dealing with Star Wars fans)
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I still need to watch Season 1.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,My favourite show of all time
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Chill Diego, you’re literally living every boys dream."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,That’s odd.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"The weird part for me is that Andor is probably some of the best Star Wars content, and yet Andor himself is the weakest part of he show."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,This show is really good. It stands out grub the dozen other projects.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Andor is Star Wars for adults.  I’m also glad, as mentioned elsewhere, that there is a definite conclusion to the story of Andor."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Reminder he was in the best modern Star Wars film.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Noooo, that's not the news I wanted to read today. :("
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Good, Andor especially doesn't need to be milked like a thala-siren"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,best SW show imo
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"It's genuinely possible that Andor is the best Star Wars related thing ever.
And this is coming from someone who very much dislikes rogue one"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I have to think Disney was ready to milk every single show on its D+ plate until recent MCU outings like Quantumania made them rethink their strategy from flooding the market to actually crafting fewer, prestige content that people want to consume.

This is a great thing."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Genuinely the best Star Wars content in decades and I’m thankful that the people charge have a goal and plan. Thankful for Diego and his performance glad he gets to rest and do what he loves without hurting himself too much mentally 

Love you Andor, thanks for making Star Wars so wonderful to be a part of again"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Andor will finish as easily the best Star Wars product ever
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I don’t understand:  is he struggling with mental health issues that the pressures of the show are exacerbating? Or did he choose his words poorly to state that it’s a relief to know the shows timeline?
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"It's a sad state of affairs when underpaid mental health professionals have to endure in their highly taxing jobs for decades while we celebrate highly paid actors who don't want to do more than 2 years in a role because it's taking a mental toll... I mean, c'mon 

Good for Diego Luna, he is awesome. But it makes me sad and angry nevertheless to see how my psychotherapist friends are struggling."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Great show, but he's the least compelling character, IMO"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Yet another Disney actor implying that working for Disney was akin to cruel and unusual punishment.

hhhmm..."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Man I need to watch this show but I just can’t with more Star Wars lol..
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Come roof with me in July and I’m guessing acting would sound pretty easy in comparison.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Actors bitch whine and moan while they struggle to get into the business and ""make it."" Then when they ""make it"" they bitch whine and moan bc the work is hard and hurts my mental health."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Actors are so fuckin annoying
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,End after Season 2? Wait what?
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Awww pour guy.
he deserves a break"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,“My mental health” gtfo my god
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Andor at least qualifies as Star Wars, but to me much of the first season fell way short of “peak Star Wars”. Hopefully the 2nd season doesn’t disappoint."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Why do people like this series so much?  I tried a few episodes and it is boring putting me to sleep each time.    Mandolorian, Bubba Fett and even Bad Batch are way more entertaining.

Edit:   I guess Ill give it another whirl with some caffeine on the first few episodes

Edit 2:   Watched through E6.   Boring.  You can keep it.  I give up."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I still don't get Andor. I watched three episodes and absolutely nothing happened.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Lol this show went from a 5 season plan, to a 4 season plan. Now they’re only doing 2 seasons? What the fuck is happening??"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I do worry that now that andor has mainstream attention disneys gonna start really meddling in the script for season 2, whether that happens or not is yet to be seen but my money is on a weaker second season at best sadly."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Important for your mental health?? Bro you’re an actor on a tv show. You’re living better than everyone. Life couldn’t be more comfortable.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,How very precious of him.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I can’t imagine the mental health crisis’ anyone working for Disney faces on a daily basis. That company exploits every team that works for them, even the stars now, who are treated like commodities and actors at Disneyland."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I don’t like that show
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Weakest male to ever get a starring roll in a film.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I hope he survives and they show him in Mando years later.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Us too, 5-6 threads a day from disney PR is a bit heavy on the subreddit."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"You're an actor, bud. It's really not that hard or taxing on your mental health lol."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I didn't even know Andor was getting beyond 1 season. We cannot get into it. It's so, incredibly slow."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Couldn’t make it past ep 5

Lol Reddit is mad"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Ok, knowing this show is only 2 seasons, and it has Luna in it supposedly doing a fantastic job, I guess I will have to give it a shot even despite how lame Star Wars is to me"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,They push this show pretty hard but was it getting the views?
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"If rumors of viewership is true, Disney is glad it’s not getting a season 3 too. 

It’s actually very good and will benefit from binging as it is a slow roll type story."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Hand up to replace him in season 3
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,mine too
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,He says that now.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,If the ending is good and satisfying then I’m happy. Good show. Very talented cast and crew.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Star Wars, the Chihuahua of Fandoms"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Man, my respect for this show keeps compounding. 


Show'em how it's done! 👍👍👍"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"It would probably be good for my mental health if I could stop working and take some time off, too. In my dreams."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"Idk if he is doing it but this is the problem with method acting. It messes up the person, especially if they are playing a scumbag"
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"I get it, I’m fine with the show ending but any actor who can’t last more than 2 season in a show due to “mental health” shouldn’t be getting roles in shows that people love."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,If only he had range as an actor
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Putting a positive spin on a dying franchise. Smart man.
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,I heart this. It is so important that actors take care of their mental health. They may be rich and all the fame but they are still humans who work work work to earn them zeros at the end of the one. Good for him!
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,"What I really want to see in season 2 is the focus on characters he meets in Rogue One, like Chirrut Imwe and the other rebels."
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Dude would be an absolute nobody if not for 'Andor'
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,Mental health? Is his character even doing any dark shit like the succession son lately that’s been on the news lately with his method bullshit? Irs a Disney show FFS
My ID is Gangnam Beauty,This isn’t about you Diego!
The Degenerates,"Somewhat better lineup this year, accidentally let the queue continue after watching and it slipped into the first season; significant drop in quality."
The Degenerates,Fawk yeah sock cuckahs!
The Degenerates,"If you switched Donell Rawlings and Big Jay Oakerson, you'd get one great season and one terrible season. That's just me though."
The Degenerates,tss good one cocksucka.
The Degenerates,"What a weird way to end her career. When your whole identity is built around being nice, funny, silly etc and it turns out to all be a façade. 

Just when you think you know someone."
The Degenerates,"Not such a privilege that I would treat literally anybody else involved with anything that resembled respect, but a privilege nonetheless."
The Degenerates,I genuinely thought she stopped doing the show back when she was called out for her abuse. Was surprised to see new episodes still airing recently.
The Degenerates,"The privilege was all yours, Ellen."
The Degenerates,"I did an Internship on the Warner Lot around where Ellen films her show and I remember one of the people I worked under tell me "" If you see Ellen try not to make eye contact, she hates that"" I laughed it off as a joke until news came out about her."
The Degenerates,She was horrible to the staff. Very few knew about her behavior over many years. She needs to disappear.
The Degenerates,"These stars like Ellen with their “Don’t Look At Me!” lunacy. They literally believe normal people should not be allowed to look at them, they are so great and above them. It’s not just her, lots of celebrities think this way, it’s disgusting."
The Degenerates,"Back in the early 2000s, my mom was a big fan of Ellen DeGeneres. She also wasn't really keen on the idea of Gay Marriage. ""It's not what Jesus says marriage is."", or something along those lines. 

Once Ellen came out, Mom was far more open to LGBT rights. I'm sure my mom isn't the only boomer she had that effect on. Yeah, she was a self-absorbed tyrant on her TV show later on, but she did that much at least."
The Degenerates,"I feel like she always had an very edgy and pugnacious side to her personality as well as a nice side.  

The nice thing worked for her on her show in terms of ratings and she really leaned into it.  Maybe that left her feeling like she was only expressing part of her self and the way she expressed the other half was by being especially demanding and confrontational with her staff. 

She probably would’ve been better off being honest with her audience about who she was from the beginning.

One of the good things about being open about your emotions is that people then feel comfortable about openly talking to you about them. 

If you’re a little grumpy sometimes or in a bad mood and you own that and admit to it then people will feel comfortable about calling you out on it when you cross a line. 

However if you build your career on some façade of always been nice and agreeable and then there will be this intense pressure among the people who work for you to not contradict that myth or call you out when you cross a line."
The Degenerates,"""I'm so glad I had the privilege to be put in a position where I could be terrible to people and face no consequences"""
The Degenerates,Who the hell still watched this show after everything came out about her?
The Degenerates,Why do these terrible people keep getting their final moment in a positive light? Fuck off Ellen
The Degenerates,Vaya con Dios the most famous and meanest lesbian of them all.
The Degenerates,"Fuck her

Less we hear about her the better"
The Degenerates,I’m surprised the show is still on…
The Degenerates,My friend worked for her.  Upon hearing the news she wrote “good riddance” on her Facebook page.
The Degenerates,[deleted]
The Degenerates,[deleted]
The Degenerates,"I didn’t realize Ellen taped a month in advance. I know late night shows are usually the same day, or maybe earlier that week. Interesting that Ellen can do so early. I wonder what other talk shows tape that early!"
The Degenerates,Ellen Degenerate
The Degenerates,I don’t like her very much.
The Degenerates,"Great, now fade in to obscurity please"
The Degenerates,Too bad she didn’t consider it a privilege to treat people with respect and kindness.
The Degenerates,She never came off as a nice or warm person. You could tell it was an act
The Degenerates,Biatch
The Degenerates,Be kind (to the staff)
The Degenerates,Fake bitch finally gtfo
The Degenerates,Anyway…
The Degenerates,Hope she never comes back.
The Degenerates,I thought she was scummy when she started using her show to lobby Pixar to make another Finding Nemo movie.
The Degenerates,We did it reddit!! Ellen DeGenerate!!!
The Degenerates,Also a privilege for us that she will be in the public eye less
The Degenerates,good riddance
The Degenerates,"Wow Ellen ending her show and James Corden saying he'll hang it up in a year, what talk show host will Reddit hate jerk it to now??"
The Degenerates,Someone hit her with a shovel.
The Degenerates,"Eat shit, Ellen."
The Degenerates,"If it looks like a rat, and smells like a rat...."
The Degenerates,Disgusting creature
The Degenerates,Can she just fuck off already
The Degenerates,"I would say right now she’s just as popular as Vladimir Putin. ,!"
The Degenerates,"The greatest privilege of my life was being able to treat ppl like garbage for the past 18 years, it would have never been possible without you the fans."
The Degenerates,"Eat shit, cunt"
The Degenerates,"can you say that a woman has a fuckface? Because that's what it sprang to mind first time I've seen her, ""this woman has a fuckface"""
The Degenerates,Good riddance. Trash human being
The Degenerates,Good riddance!
The Degenerates,Fuck ellen
The Degenerates,Fucking finally
The Degenerates,I still like her. 🤷
The Degenerates,Someone should make a documentary about her and call it Finding Money using the Pixar font. 😅
The Degenerates,"…End her career? Merely the ending of her talk show host run. This is someone that’s literally been *told* her career was over so many times, despite what we may think of her now. I see her taking some time — as it heals all wounds — and making a return in some form or fashion."
The Degenerates,Newsflash: fame changes people for better or worse. She really might have been as nice as you originally thought. People shift.
The Degenerates,"Best to assume a celebrity's private persona is different to their public one. They sometimes differ only slightly, sometimes a lot. Of course you get some who are virtually the same publicly and privately but these will imo be quite rare."
The Degenerates,"Didn’t we always know that? 

I read about how she would speed in her car all the time like she was an entitled brat. 

Also her forgiving people for their blatant homophobia on behalf of gays? 

B\*tch please dont go speaking for a whole community. 

She’s done a good amount for the gays but once she got famous she comes Off as an entitled ”cis white man.“ Probably how she identifies now."
The Degenerates,She’s an actor. Obviously a good one.
The Degenerates,It’s like learning there’s a human inside of big bird
The Degenerates,"No, no, stepping on the little people with impunity ***was*** the privilege."
The Degenerates,"Probably had in her contract that she'd get a big payout if they canceled it before the contract was up, cheaper to just let it run out."
The Degenerates,"Contracts are a bugger sometimes. Is bullshit, but ironically they never had a smoking gun for her to pull the bad behavior clause out everything would have stopped with that. 

With the time remaining on hers vs the cost of exit clauses, someone made the calculation that it was probably cheaper to let the clock run out on her show."
The Degenerates,"They wanted her more than she wanted the show.  She's been tired of the show for years, but they just keep throwing more money at her."
The Degenerates,"hahaha, yep. friend of mine also interned there and has similar stories. i wasn't an intern when this happened, but i had instructions not to look a different celebrity in the eye when i was working on his bullshit project and it blew my mind that they were serious. i'd always thought it was hyperbole but no, there really are S-tier assholes out there who expect that garbage. 

i dared them to fire me for it and they didn't, and magically it wasn't a condition anymore. fuck out of here, i have a job to do. can't stand these egomaniacs who don't treat crew/post with respect. we're the only reason your shit ever makes it to air."
The Degenerates,Did you ever see Conan around?
The Degenerates,Isn’t the instruction about not making eye contact a way to make sure complete morons (aka interns) don’t bother VIPs with bullshit?
The Degenerates,Yeah I definitely respect Ellen for her 90s even if I find her to be a bully now
The Degenerates,"There was a study by some organization - I think the Lear Center? That said that people who watch shows that tackle ""tough"" topics like LGBTQ rights, gay marriage, etc. make the people more likely to support it"
The Degenerates,"Its heart-warming that in our enlightened time, gay women also have the freedom to be awful people in showbiz."
The Degenerates,people who don't read / care about entertainment news most likely
The Degenerates,Soccer moms seem to love her. (I did too before all the news came out.)
The Degenerates,No one cares if she’s a difficult boss or a jerk on set. Reddit isn’t the real world.
The Degenerates,"It is because she is still popular with folks, despite the wrongdoing."
The Degenerates,Do you support actors like Christian Bale? Because he’s way worse than Ellen and there’s video proof of it. What about Ellen makes her so terrible in your eyes? Hmm what could it be?
The Degenerates,Come on.  Give us some stories.
The Degenerates,Wow your friend had a bad boss. Maybe she was just bad at her job?
The Degenerates,Christmas in ~~July~~ *May*!
The Degenerates,Rosie seems to have mellowed out and not take herself so seriously now.  Last I saw her was in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm where she got in a knock-down fist fight with Larry.  I can't see Ellen sloughing off her narcissism that easily.
The Degenerates,What did Rosie do? She was before my time
The Degenerates,"The late night shows are usually more current events than daytime, so they have to tape closer to the air date. I never really watched much of Ellen, but I vaguely remember her just featuring random celebrities and games with the audience, so probably nothing topical enough where they couldn't just film in advance."
The Degenerates,Yeah you people said that about her in the 90s after she came out. Nice to see your bald hatred is still on display.
The Degenerates,This comment made me crack up for some reason 🤣
The Degenerates,fallon desk slapping jokes are here to stay
The Degenerates,Wendy Williams is still on air I think. She's a right cunt
The Degenerates,Wendy Williams is the clear answer here
The Degenerates,This is being downvoted by comment regurgitators
The Degenerates,"I really cant stand any talk show host. I use to watch John oliver but hes kind of annoying now too. Conan is cool, he still have a show?"
The Degenerates,Then you’re probably looking into a mirror
The Degenerates,"now, now ... you're insulting putin

LOL"
The Degenerates,"from this, we can probably assome that either you treat waiters in restaurants like shit, or you don't care when your friends do."
The Degenerates,😂
The Degenerates,Or going back to standup as she was very good at one point.
The Degenerates,"Yeah redditors who aren't her target demographic think it's si over for her. Nah she'll get bigger and bigger. 50 yo moms love Ellen to death and would follow her to the end of the world, and I would bet those aren't the kind of people that are super up to date with what she did, which in terms of celebrity controversies, was pretty much nothing."
The Degenerates,Considering at this point she's worth nearly half a billion..I really don't think she gives a shit.
The Degenerates,Newsflash: Not just fame. There are always externalities that changes people. Plus it takes a lot of effort to be always nice
The Degenerates,Good talk.
The Degenerates,"> I read about how she would speed in her car all the time like she was an entitled brat. 

I don't know if you've driven lately, but that's like 50% of drivers."
The Degenerates,I remember a couple of years ago she did want to end the show after her brother urged her because she was burned out. But she continued anyways
The Degenerates,We were told never to initiate a conversation with Conan or he would have us beaten.
The Degenerates,"""Who is Conan and why is she so sad?"""
Jeopardy!,"He's one of, if not the best player of all time, and he is a friendly host fun to watch.  Its always been a no brainer to have him as full time host if he wants it."
Jeopardy!,I can’t believe they are still doing this awful experiment. Just make him the permanent  host already
Jeopardy!,“…………it’s a Daily Double!”
Jeopardy!,(uncomfortable pause) That is correct.
Jeopardy!,then I shall resume watching on March 10th
Jeopardy!,I watched last night and… I like mayim but she is not the one. Her pauses are insane. Her pauses stress me out and I’m not onstage.
Jeopardy!,Mar10 better be a category
Jeopardy!,"I'll take ""Unnecessary Ongoing TV Fiascos"" for $200."
Jeopardy!,How are ratings in the post-Trebek era of Jeopardy?
Jeopardy!,Please just fire Mayim and allow the undisputed king and best host of jeopardy Ken Jennings return
Jeopardy!,"It's interesting that the show appears to be trying to subtly distance itself from Mayim in its online press, or at least her association with the everyday edition, probably as a result of the massive swell of support behind Ken. There was actually no official PR about this tournament being hosted by Mayim and [its landing page](https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/2023/high-school-reunion) seems to go out of its way to hide her likeness from the promotional material (see the homepage as well). Seems that Ken will be hosting a primetime series this year as well, which he was not originally announced to do."
Jeopardy!,JFC just give this guy the job permanently so no one ever has to read about this stupidity agin
Jeopardy!,I really hope Jennings wants to host this much
Jeopardy!,I'm convinced that the people surpised and outraged by these articles don't even watch the show. The established roles seem to be that she does the tournaments and specials and he does the day to day. They are doing a high school tournament alum run right now so she is hosting. If you are a serious jeopardy watcher you probably don't really like watching the high school tournaments any way.
Jeopardy!,"casual fan here, started watching almost daily about 6 months ago (gf is a huge jeopardy fan)

it's absurd that the idea of someone else doing it could even be entertained. i heard Jennings kinda got off to a rough start but from i have seen this guy is just killing it right now. he is 100% dialed in and the perfect permanent replacement with the woman whose name i can't spell is absolutely perfect for doing the celebrity ones and other one-offs.

they have it made if they just keep it like it is. props for that one guy for trying to screw everyone including the viewers over and put himself up as the host lmao, that fucking guy"
Jeopardy!,I feel like there must be one high up person at Jeopardy who wanted Bialik who refuses to admit they were wrong. Give it up. Ken is the guy.
Jeopardy!,I thought he was already the permanent host and Miam hosts the specials?
Jeopardy!,KEN IS THE ONLY HOST PERIOD!
Jeopardy!,These producers man... how have they not heard the rallying cry from literally everyone to just have one host? Or are they just that braindead that they don't care?
Jeopardy!,Awesome now I know when I can go back to watching Jeopardy.
Jeopardy!,"I love Jeopardy, but I have a simple motto when it comes to  how I choose to view these days.

If it gots Blossom, 
I don't watch 'em."
Jeopardy!,"Fairly sure this was announced long, long ago, before Mayim's latest stint even begun."
Jeopardy!,"I’ve contended for years he might be the most likable personality in the public sphere. I hope he hosts for the next 30 years. 

Side note - his podcast is pretty good and has a good library by this point. They can get off topic pretty regularly which turns people off it but I love it."
Jeopardy!,"Glad to hear this! Ken is perfect for this show! 

I personally can’t stand Mayim Bialik. She just annoys the hell out of me."
Jeopardy!,The only acceptable time for him to not host the show is when he is a constestant.
Jeopardy!,"Two things: 

1. Just make him the permanent host already. 

2. I would literally watch Jeopardy every day if it was on a streaming service in Canada. I don’t have cable anymore but want to watch it."
Jeopardy!,"Dear Jeopardy, we already decided who we like and who we don't like. Stop trying to make what's her face a host."
Jeopardy!,"I thought initially the ""two host"" experiment was so that a full-time permanent host could be chosen. There is a very clear winner and this experiment should conclude. Alex Trebek hosted all facets of Jeopardy!, the special tournaments and the regular competitions, and the mantle has been passed to Ken Jennings . . . . so it's time to end the experiment and declare the winner.  Are you listening, producers? The will of the viewers is pretty clear."
Jeopardy!,"Just fire girl Alex Jones and get on with the show. 

She's still got the brain boner-pill racket going on. She'll be fine."
Jeopardy!,This is the way.
Jeopardy!,"Dude has a great personality and is an awesome host. They really are trying to force alternatives, but let's face it, Ken Jennings is just the best."
Jeopardy!,I have no interest in watching if there is a different host all the time. Just make him permanent already.
Jeopardy!,"Oh thank God, Ken is a much better fit"
Jeopardy!,Yes please.
Jeopardy!,he’s a perfect host. just give him the job permanently already!!!
Jeopardy!,"You just can’t compete with Ken Jennings. My hottest take of all is that he’s a better host than Trebek! Come at me, internet, it’s true.

Ken’s transitions in and out of the awkward “getting to know the contestant” segments are so silky smooth, it’s incredible. That alone puts him in a different category of host than anyone else I’ve seen. And on top of that he’s a super champ? Can’t be beat.

People keep focusing on Mayim’s flaws, but it would’ve happened to anyone—nobody can top Ken."
Jeopardy!,"Top ridiculous moment of this fiasco:

Guy chosen to pick the new Jeopardy host decides that *he* is the best person to host Jeopardy."
Jeopardy!,He needs to be the permanent host. He is too perfect for the role.
Jeopardy!,But...but...Ken Jennings said something mean 15 years ago!  /s
Jeopardy!,Yay! I can watch Jeopardy again
Jeopardy!,Give him the job full time.  Lifetime contract.  They will literally never find anyone better at this point
Jeopardy!,As it should be
Jeopardy!,I thought Myriam is hosting all the special events. So right now is the high school reunion thing that is going to last for three weeks.
Jeopardy!,The question is Who would Alex have chosen?
Jeopardy!,Let’s go
Jeopardy!,Just make him the host already
Jeopardy!,Oh finally
Jeopardy!,needs to be the full time host
Jeopardy!,The fact that they have to accounce this is disappointing and means producers are desperate for headlines. Its all a scam for attention and until they give him the reigns permanently I wont tune in.
Jeopardy!,"Great. 

Chain him to the podium."
Jeopardy!,"At this point I literally could not care less about this show. Coming from someone who use to DVR the shows and go back and watch the year old shows. The whole clusterfuck just took all the joy away from watching it. Trebeck was awesome, but he was only one factor, they didnt need the best host ever for his replacement. They just needed a constant."
Jeopardy!,Thank GOD
Jeopardy!,Why can’t they just sign him?
Jeopardy!,"I really love Ken, I’m always shocked that someone that smart is a Mormon, meaning he believes in The Book of Mormon. BOM says there was actually an ancient way early civilization in the Americas, zero evidence has ever been found to prove this. The only ‘proof’ is Joseph Smith, magically finding these ‘ancient’ tablets. Come on. Their treatment of women, the way the church has gotten away with investing (tax free) and squirreling away billions of dollars. The fundamentalists, with their child brides. It’s a cult."
Jeopardy!,"Call me Lizo, cause it’s about damn time."
Jeopardy!,I for one welcome our new Ken Jennings overlord
Jeopardy!,Amazing how they've been able to turn something that should have been easy and seamless into a series of drama-laden goofs. Just make him the host.
Jeopardy!,Stop putting washed up idiot actors in the host spot. Ken is the guy. Just stop already.
Jeopardy!,Ken over blossom every day
Jeopardy!,"Mayim is hard to watch in these special tournaments.  Tonight, she even was wobbling on her high heels out to greet the players."
Jeopardy!,That will be nice. I turned off the teen tournament the moment I saw Bialyk was hosting.
Jeopardy!,Send Blossom packing!
Jeopardy!,Can we please take out the trash that is Mayim Bialik?
Jeopardy!,They just need to make him the permanent host.
Jeopardy!,It was always you Ken.
Jeopardy!,Thank goodness. She’s the Doctor Pulaski of Gameshow hosts..
Jeopardy!,"Ken is the host of Jeopardy.  Mayim hosts special Jeopardy episodes on a temporary basis.  They even introduce them differently.

Ken is introduced as THE host of Jeopardy.

Mayim is introduced as HOSTING Jeopardy, with the implication that her role is temporary."
Jeopardy!,_NO. MORE. BLOSSOM._
Jeopardy!,This is a prime example of people being not being responsible.  They cannot admit they were wrong and we all want Jennings.
Jeopardy!,Tom Scott would be best host.
Jeopardy!,Need somebody smoother… it’s voice over work more than anything
Jeopardy!,Thank God
Jeopardy!,"They tried to call Aaron Rogers but he was on his ""dark phase"" and didn't answer the phone."
Jeopardy!,I’m cool with this
Jeopardy!,Woooo!!
Jeopardy!,Amen!🙏
Jeopardy!,"Jeopardy! seems to be such an institution in the US, such a long-standing success - I find it strange that it's not been exported to the UK. We've had many quiz shows and 'talent' shows go in the opposite direction (Who wants to be a millionaire for example), it seems odd that the producers wouldn't have chosen to cash in on other markets."
Jeopardy!,"Is she that bad? I've read countless times how awful her hosting ability is, but never actually watched myself"
Jeopardy!,Thank god. I swear I don’t think she reads the questions and answers ahead of time. Even on the easy high school level stuff she pauses to check the answer is correct. Drives me nuts.
Jeopardy!,"I wish they'd just give him the full time gig at this point. Much more enjoyable to watch than ""Single Jeopardy"" Blossom."
Jeopardy!,And that is when I will start watching again.
Jeopardy!,This is the way
Jeopardy!,They should just create a Trebek hologram and AI his voice at this point.
Jeopardy!,I really like Ken. Met him at an event once and he seems like a genuinely good dude. Hope they make it permanent
Jeopardy!,I don’t even watch the show and want him to be the permanent host
Jeopardy!,Thank fucking god
Jeopardy!,"Miyam Bialik is the absolute worst host. I love her in everything she's done, but as a Jeopardy host, she's atrocious. Her habit of recapping and extending everyone's answers all the time makes the show borderline unwatchable, and infuriating. 

Jennings isn't as good as Alex was, but at least he's watchable."
Jeopardy!,"Watching Mayim trying to interact with the celebrities during the Celebrity Jeopardy run was pure cringe. 

""So I've known you for a while..."" (Just met backstage)  

""Can you tell me about your new project?"" (Didn't want to IMDB them)"
Jeopardy!,What a shitshow
Jeopardy!,"I guess Jeopardy has such a loyal fan base that producers can keep pulling this shit and not worry about ratings. Maybe it’s time y’all gave them something to worry about, like don’t tune in when Miam is hosting? Make Jennings the permanent host already."
Jeopardy!,Ken does the regular episodes and mayim does the tournaments and prime time ones. It’s currently a tournament. It’s not the complicated..
Jeopardy!,let desus nice host one. mans needs work.
Jeopardy!,Then I'll be back watching it then.
Jeopardy!,"Ken was a bit shaky at first, but he has really settled into being a brilliant host. His little jokes and asides are super clever and don’t distract from the speed or seriousness of the game."
Jeopardy!,"It's amazing they didn't officially make him the host. If you ever feel bad at your job, just think about the producers of Jeopardy."
Jeopardy!,"Good, it looks like Mia Bialyak (or whatever her name was) did not prevail in her public relations campaign."
Jeopardy!,"Clearly an unpopular opinion.  While I prefer Ken and think 2 hosts is dumb, I really don't have an issue with Mayim. Seems like people just want to complain"
Jeopardy!,"I love Ken but I find the show unwatchable with out Alex hosting, maybe it’s just having him there for the entirety of my life I just can’t see it any other way."
Jeopardy!,I show my respect for Alex by not watching anymore.
Jeopardy!,Nice!
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I wonder at what point Netflix gives up on making weekly late night comedy series like this.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Man, that sucks. 

I’ve always been pretty amazed by how free to criticize Netflix he was, like recently putting them (twice!) in his taxes-dodging-compagnies hall of fame"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"He puts an unbelievable amount of work into that show, and does a lot of cool prep work. In NYC he does these ""5$ comedy shows"" during the week. It's like 100 or so people only. He plays a rough draft of his episode on a screen, and then comes out and asks the audience what they think! He takes criticism, advice, asks questions and works stuff out in real time. It was really cool to be a part of and exciting to he around him. He has an energy and a passion that is like a lightbulb."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This is surprising.  Show seems really successful, and it's particularly good at creating Netflix content for YouTube.  But the good news is Hasan is going to get a huge bidding war now."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Canceling this right in the middle of election cycle seems like such a bad move. Sad we won't get to see Hasan pick apart the election. Really surprising news, seemed like the show was doing well."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"The show was doing well, won awards, filled an undersaturated niche on Netflix, and I'd guess that it has a low production cost. Why would they cancel it?

&#x200B;

RIP. This show was entertaining and a breath of fresh air. I learned so much from it. I can't wait to see the next project that Hasan goes on to do!"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,He never got the chance to wear the outfit Tan picked out for him smh
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Man, he was one of the few Indian-American people who had a large platform in American media. I felt truly represented and I laughed and learned a lot at the same time. I feel like his format was pretty future proof, since new issues always come up. Pretty sad, but I hope another place picks up his show."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This is really disappointing, this has recently become my favorite political talk show. Something about Hasan's presentation just really vibed with me. I will miss this show, I hope it can continue in some other venue."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This move makes no sense to me. It cost very little to produce, created lots of engagement on Youtube, and was great for PR. This cancellation smells really fishy to me."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Cancelled after he calls out Netflix in a pretty big way for being tax dodging asshats. Coincidence?
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,2020 is ruthless damn. But if anyone should pick this back up its Comedy Central it would be ideal next to the daily show.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This sucks. He always had a good take on an issue from an angle that John Oliver didn’t do (Connecting MeToo movement to Chinese censorship, Video Games, Supreme)"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Noooo, *c'mon*. So many politic shows are boring and unfunny, but he's entertaining and (more importantly) informing in a very fun way.

Netflix is the worst."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Fuck this sucks, among my favorites on Netflix"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This makes no sense and comes out of nowhere.  I'm sure if Hasan wants he'll land the show somewhere else soon, and big middle finger to Netflix."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,So is “season” just a totally arbitrary term now? The show premiered two years ago but somehow did six “seasons”?
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Baffling. Patriot Act was a great show and a bit of a diamond in the rough of their current original content.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This cancellation adds more to my disappointment with Netflix. When they have a good show, it will only run for two or three seasons (*Santa Clarita Diet*, *One Day at a Time*, the Marvel shows, *The OA*, *The Kominsky Method*, etc.). Most of these shows don't even get a proper finale which sucks even more. I get that not every show can run as long as *Grace & Frankie* or *House of Cards* but it still sucks.

Then there's also the case that most new Netflix shows are cancelled after one season like *Tuca & Bertie*, *Gypsy* and *Seven Seconds*."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I am pissed about this. I really enjoyed his segment about Some issues in Video Games like sexism and labour problems. He brought that issues to more wider audience nicely.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,No!! I loved that show. :(
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I admit, I only watched his stuff on YouTube. Never once put it on Netflix. It was good stuff, but maybe that's why it ultimately didn't work out?"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,[removed]
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Literally the only show I was watching on Netflix. Why would you do this right before election season?!
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I'll be honest. I watched it on YouTube instead of on Netflix. Perhaps that was one of the driving forces behind the decision.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Can we cancel the original Patriot Act?
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"""seasons""

First episode Oct 2018

Last episode Jun 2020.

Like they make it sound like it ran for ages"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Goddamn it, Netflix."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I just started watching the show and am three seasons in.  Haven’t seen a episode yet that wasn’t entertaining.   This seems similar to what happened to Jordan Klepper.  The network pulled the plug while the show was still producing gold.  Both were cancelled during an election cycle.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Netflix cancels everything after 3-4 seasons. 6 is a miracle. Only other Netflix original I can name that got there is BoJack

Edit: and house of cards, basically the first big Netflix original. We all know how that went."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I watched every episode and while his style isn’t my favourite (guess I’m not the target demographic) I appreciate the research and presentation of the facts gathered. Pretty sure that’s not the last we’re seeing of him.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I couldn't get into it. I appreciate Hasan's perspective, but his hand flapping and bouncing around as he speaks just drove me crazy."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Just remember next tax season... Turbotaxsucksass.com
Thanks Hasan!"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Zero offense intended toward Hasan, but for whatever reason, he just hits me the wrong way. I agree with all his stuff substantively, but can’t stand his vibe. I think it’s cuz he reminds me of this douchey dude I know and my dumb brain can not separate them. I realize that’s on me though and not him. I hope he keeps doing the good work he’s doing."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Awww I like this show.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"too bad that ""Dark side of the gaming industry"" really put me on that show. Also we cannot stay silent about george floyd was beautiful."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Netflix green lights a series, lets it get popular, then cancels once they realize it costs them less money to green light something new but similar instead of renewing."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Well, shit...  I really liked that show. Not many people have the balls to stand up against Saudi Arabia. 
So what now on Netflix? Yet, another show with angsty the teenagers?… How original."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,that sucks. i loved the show. it was a refreshing format .
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Wow this fucking sucks. I was just telling my gf how much I miss this show and how now would be a good time for him to be covering stuff. Im disappointed in you Netflix. First over what happened to Dare Devil and now this.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,why did the mods remove the other post?
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Too bad they cancelled one of their best shows, it obviously wasn’t perfect, but was often a good source for basic politics and media news."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I think his content was good but his political Def Poetry Jam mannerisms and delivery made it unwatchable for me.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Awe, this show was great that's too bad. I am looking forward to what Hasan decides to do next because I'm sure this isn't the end for him!"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"....leaving John Oliver to carry the flag of comedy-deep-dive-journalism (love Sam B. but....). Disappointed but hope Minhaj lands elsewhere. Actually, I know he will...too much talent."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This is a bunch of garbage.  Hasan was hitting excellent topics and really stripping it all down in a way very few can do well.  I thought he was of John Oliver's caliber, and actually figured it would only be a matter of time before his show was sweeping award categories.

Such a bummer.  Gotta be a conspiracy right?"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Was it really that successful though? Netflix is very secretive about their metrics. It might not have been doing all that great. Production value vs. viewership, etc."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I don’t think they did a good job advertising it. I watch a lot of stand-up specials on Netflix but I only heard of this show this year and the demo clip didn’t grasp me at all. I had no idea there were six seasons.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Didn’t this just come out last year?🤨
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,They got six seasons out of this? It was on for like two years.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,6 seasons in 2 years?!?
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,How does a show that's been on the air for less than 2 years have 6 seasons? It looks like there was literally a month between some seasons. Most shows takes mid-season breaks that last longer than that.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I like him, and I liked the show, but the episode about the Canadian election left a really bad taste in my mouth and didn’t give heart equal time to our Conservative or NDP parties in terms of critique. It could have been much better."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I know this is hardly the most important thing, but goddamn is Netflix weird about seasons.

There are six seasons of this show that premiered less than two years ago."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Some moderators didn’t like what they saw.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Damn that sucks. I really enjoyed the show and Hasan has gotten his character and the hosting really down pat. I hope someone picks him up because this show was just getting good.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This was one of my favorite shows, I'm gutted."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Whaaat? I really liked his show, this is a bummer."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Lame.. cancelling one of the few good shows left on the platform.......
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"That’s to bad, his show was actually pretty enjoyable and pretty informative. The episode he did about police was surprisingly good."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,He pointed out how Netflix was skimping on taxes and the show got canceled immediately after. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Why do they cancel their best stuff?
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Please tell me there is a go fund me to bring this program to a broader base. Netflix you done GOOFED
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,That sucks... i‘ve found the show really good
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"The show was good, Netflix just isnt the place for this kind of show."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Looks like I'm in the minority but I won't miss him. It seems to me his show was more about taking cheap shots than using actual facts on many occasions.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,People acting like there’s gonna be a bidding war for the dude cancelled by Netflix... yeah just ask Joel Mchale how that goes.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"This is unfortunate. This show managed to distill information in a way that was palatable for the everyman, providing an education without sacrificing entertainment. I found it to be one of the best of its kind, and I’ll miss it. Netflix still hasn’t figured out how to properly execute the talk show, in terms of promoting them and giving them a fighting chance."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"The show was very hit or miss for me. When he did sort of niche topics Cricket corruption and the cruise industry, it was great. But the more broader topics it was kind of dull."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Hasan Minhaj for future White House press secretary!
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,What? This show was amazing. Easily one of the best political weeknight comedies
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"They put all the episodes on Netflix in their entirety where they have millions of views, so maybe people weren't watching the show on Netflix? But those YouTube videos must be monetized, so I don't understand what went wrong here."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I tried to watch it several times but I could never get past the ""Dane Cook reading Daily Show script"" vibes."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Didn't he expose Netflix's negative tax paid on the show itself? At the end of the day, Netflix is a corporation and will do anything to protect its bottom line."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Was not funny.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Hasan wasn’t really funny. Political, interesting, a bit annoying, but not funny."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,It had SIX SEASONS???? I've heard of it once before this post
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I’m quite upset about this. Hasan has some real insight.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I’m really sad to hear about this, his show was informative, funny, and honest"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,This is upsetting. I really hope he gets picked up by someone else. This would have been a perfect resource especially for the upcoming election.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,That’s a damn shame. It was a very good and informative show
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I loved this show! And he spoke the truth about every topic. Which honestly i think those big wigs got scared and probably payed big money to get hassan off the stage! Too many young people were getting woke. 😆
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I’ll be the dissenting voice and say perhaps there isn’t the audience for one long topic on a glib comedian-based talk show that the production companies think there is.

I love John Oliver’s humour, but his switch to mostly one topic for the entire show has soured me on it. I watch these shows largely to get a sense of relief that my perspectives aren’t insane, and a lot of it is already familiar. A half-hour discussing the same problem when there are better ways to do in-depth research sucks a lot of the humour out of it for me. 

I liked the first two seasons, then it felt tiresome. Great spots of individual information but also a lot that people should already know. They used to appeal more to informed people, less to audiences that no literally nothing about the subject or the myriad other social examples of identical anti-social behaviour."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,holy shit im so glad this virtue signaling fuck is finally going to be forgotten about im so sick of him
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Was this one of those political ""think like me or you're stupid"" shows?"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I'm going to assume they canceled it because of ratings, but like, what were those ratings? If Netflix would just tell us what the stats are, or at least compare it to another show's viewership, this would make more sense. *Patriot Act* was one of those shows where it's difficult to tell how many people actually watched it, as opposed to just talked about it on social media. Maybe it just had an outsized reach a small audience. It seemed to me like it was doing well."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"it was one of the best informative political shows. 
the words just gets worse when you take away the things that call out the bs."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,wow. that's a shame.  He was one of the most vibrant voices out there.  He's not done. just at netflix
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"What constitutes a season? This show hasn't been out incredibly long, has it?"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,It hasn't been six seasons? Wtf
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"https://youtu.be/7xQQkzWhMOc at 22:31

Might have feathered a few ruffles"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I have never heard about it, or watched it."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"I liked Patriot Act even thou it was very US centered/focussed and lot of the things he adressed are kinda ""alien"" to me as european, but it was interesting.

I also liked Hasan, who made it interesting and had an interesting approach to the matter he was talking about.

But what I disliked was that the show was designed as ""stand up in front of a live audience"". While John Oliver also sat in front of a live audience, the difference is/was: John SAT and he didn't speak to the audience. That was something that was disturbing with patriot act.

In fact, the episodes WITHOUT the audience during corona were the best episodes in my eyes."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,Man I thought this shoe was as close as we could get to a new daily show
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,I feel like they create too much content and don’t give it enough room to breathe. A lot of Netflix subs have probably never even heard of this show.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"terrible show, Joel McHale’s had its moments and that only went 1 season"
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Tbh, I never really liked that show. Timely topics the few times I tuned in, but Hassan seemed to always the facial expressions of someone saying, "" I'm really funny, right? Right?"" Seems like a great guy and would love to see him in another format, perhaps a movie or TV career like Ed Helms or Jason Jones."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,"Damn. The Patriot Act was a great show. John Oliver is great, but I liked Patriot Act a little bit more."
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,That’s so unfortunate. I really considered picking up a Netflix subscription only for his show. He’s like the John Oliver but for my skin color. I’ll be keeping an eye out for where his next move will be.
Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,this was a great show. Ill be watching his career with great interest...
I Hear Your Voice,Definitely give it a shot.
I Hear Your Voice,You should definitely watch at least the first season. In a way it’s a complete story that really pays off and isn’t that much of a time commitment and you can decide from there if you want more.
I Hear Your Voice,"As everyone said, fantastic show. But, in particular, 407 Proxy Authentication Required in season four is one of the greatest television episodes of all-time, IMO, with a huge payoff. The writing, the performances, everything was perfect."
I Hear Your Voice,"Ugh, I want to watch this to the end but I’ve already tried twice (once as it aired and again right around when it was finishing) and life just got in the way. 

I feel like if I watch season 1 again it will be too familiar."
I Hear Your Voice,"These questions are so stupid. ""Hey guys this show is widely regarded as one of the best tv shows of all time. Is it good?"""
I Hear Your Voice,Mr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery and satisfyingly so. Watch it.
I Hear Your Voice,Not until you've finished your chores!
I Hear Your Voice,"""I keep hearing it's one of the best shows ever yet here I am still stupidly asking this question.""

FTFY"
I Hear Your Voice,Yes.
I Hear Your Voice,"You prefer shows with good writing, good acting and  character development.....?

&#x200B;

FUCKIN WERIDO."
I Hear Your Voice,"Severance and Mr. Robot are both among my favorite shows ever made, I would recommend anyone who's a fan of one of those to watch the other.

The thing about nobody in this thread elaborating on what makes this show great is that it's like dissecting a frog: you understand it better but it kills it in the process. Comparing the show to its influences absolutely ruins the plot. I'll lift the veil a teeny tiny bit, but only in spoiler tags.

>!To me, the story unfolding itself in highly unexpected ways, something something unreliable narrator, and the exquisite cinematography really pull you in!<"
I Hear Your Voice,"My all time favorite show, I made the mistake of dropping it at the beginning of season 2 after thinking it wasn't nearly exciting as season 1.  Only came back to it years later when I heard people saying that season 4 was even better than season 1, which I had a hard time believing.  Seasons 2 and 3 can be slow at time but they are all necessary to build up to season 4, if you can make it there you won't regret it. Every episode of season 4 is a banger, I consider the best single season of any TV show.  

The Leftovers is probably my second favorite show and while I wouldn't consider the two show similar, they definitely explore some common themes regarding human connection/loneliness."
I Hear Your Voice,"Yes 100%. It is a zeitgeist show. In 20 years, someone will ask what was 2017 like. Just watch Mr Robot. It’s not the plot points or anything like that. It is the style and the tone. Some of the best television ever made."
I Hear Your Voice,yes. it is one of the few shows that rewards you handsomely because the whole thing was planned out from start to finish. season 4 has payoff after payoff that was set up YEARS in advance. tbh it's everything TV should be
I Hear Your Voice,"If you like Kubrick, then for sure. Esmail loves artistic long shots (in a good way) with heavy and well written dialogue. 

I honestly regard it as one of my top three shows of all time. The other two being Dark and The Wire."
I Hear Your Voice,"Based on your favorite shows and your preferences I would say yes. My only caveat would be if someone might be triggered by raw elements like the depiction of mental illness, violence, trauma or if they’re looking for something that has lighthearted elements to reconsider it.

Edit for clarification: this was the case for me, love the show but when I binged it I found myself to be more anxious because I got an insight on the things I mentioned above even though I can typically handle darker elements."
I Hear Your Voice,"Yes, you should watch it."
I Hear Your Voice,"It's one of my favorite shows of all time. If you love Severence, there's no way you won't like it."
I Hear Your Voice,"I've tried three times to get into it,   I watch the first few episodes and tap out.      The main character is just so unrelatable,  unlikable,  and uninteresting to me....  and I like Rami Malek.      FTR  I loved Severance too."
I Hear Your Voice,"I think it was an amazing show.

However, while the show grabs your attention with its initial vigilante hacker plot, the story is fundamentally about the MC making peace with his mental trauma (which is incidentally why people tend to find season 2-3 weaker, since the vigilante hacker stuff takes a bit of a backseat), so if you enjoy great character development, an unreliable narrator (due to mental trauma) that makes you question what's real and what isn't, shrouded with a gripping vigilante hacker story line, then I do recommend this show.

Also, I'm a big fan of all the shows you mentioned (happy to see Le Bureau des Légendes get some love), and also a big fan of this one, so take that as you will.

I think the struggle with a lot of people is that while the show starts off as a vigilante hacker story, it starts to focus more on the psychology of the main character, which some people enjoyed less.

The final season is fantastic and the show has probably one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen."
I Hear Your Voice,">I really like shows with great writing, good acting, and character development

You'll get those.

>What I don’t like is a ton of Flashbacks and OTT visuals, etc.

It has some flashbacks, but they're not a large focus from what I recall.

As for over the top visuals, any examples of what you would consider as such?"
I Hear Your Voice,Great show; the cinematography is second to none. I am debating a rewatch.
I Hear Your Voice,"It's not the fastest show, but it's one of my favorites. The mystery, the intensity, the characters. I personally never got bored with it. It's such a weird show but not in a bad way. I was curious to see what Elliott did next. I will say season 2 is way weaker though. Wouldn't say bad, just a bit annoying at times."
I Hear Your Voice,Just watch it. Everything leads up to an amazing finale.
I Hear Your Voice,"I personally loved it. Best shot show in all of television (particularly seasons 3 and 4), takes a lot of risks that have huge payoffs, emotionally satisfying, tense, and the literal best last 5 seconds of any show I've watched. If you like severance there's a very good chance you'll get into Mr robot. It sucks it didn't get the recognition I think it deserves outside of reddit."
I Hear Your Voice,"One of the best/satisfying finales in my opinion, whole series is a trip."
I Hear Your Voice,"Something real quick I'll add to this conversation. I love Mr. Robot for many reasons, most already listed in this thread. But a certain character that suffers from panic attacks is the only character I've come across the represents them in a way that feels accurate to my own experiences and I freaking love this show for that."
I Hear Your Voice,"yes, it is"
I Hear Your Voice,It's fine if you like tedious monologues about how people are sheep for drinking Coca Cola
I Hear Your Voice,"It’s a great show.

It’s not one of my best shows ever but it is definitely one of the best looking shows."
I Hear Your Voice,Great show. Hated the ending personally. Some people loved the ending. Worth a watch.
I Hear Your Voice,"IMO, it was alright. Way overhyped & pretty meh. Some parts of Season 2 are just cringey, such as the money burning in public and some other parts. Other parts are really great though."
I Hear Your Voice,"I normally like shows that Reddit likes and Reddit loves the show, but I hated it. It was so edgelord cringe that I had to stop watching."
I Hear Your Voice,"It's remarkable and totally underrated.  The ending is good, too."
I Hear Your Voice,Season one was good. But it went off the rails after that.
I Hear Your Voice,I thought it was pretty bad. I tried to sit through it because I was bored and sick at home or during lockdown or something. I finally gave up halfway through S2.
I Hear Your Voice,"Would definitely recommend. The first season can be a bit cringey in a few parts, specifically the first and last episode. It's a great show overall, season 3 is my favorite season of television. It's also one of the best directed shows I've seen"
I Hear Your Voice,I fucking love Mr robot. Go in completely blind. It's better than sopranos breaking bad and the wire imo.
I Hear Your Voice,It's good but it gets a little too up its own ass at some point. You can definitely tell when the awards started pouring in and the writers got a little too ambitious for their own good.
I Hear Your Voice,"I LOVE Severance. Cannot stand Mr. Robot. 

Personally i hate shows that go all-in on the unreliable narrator. Ret-conning events because the narrator lied does not mean you are being clever, it just means i shouldn’t trust anything i see, in that case why tf should i care.

I like using a puzzle analogy. A good mystery gives you puzzle pieces but doesn’t tell you what the picture looks like. You can tell which obvious pieces go together but not exactly what it means, as the story goes on the picture becomes more clear and you get an earned “ah-ha”. A bad mystery gives you pieces and the picture but when you start putting it together it flips the board and says “hah got you! You’re so confused right now!” Then you just sit there staring at a giant mess until they just explain what the puzzle was all along."
I Hear Your Voice,"A counterpoint to the popular opinion. I liked the first scene, after that I lost interest pretty rapidly. I forced myself to finish the first season and even started season 2 but it's not a show you can watch while on your phone but because I wasn't engaged I was never giving it my full attention. Its simultaneously confusing with whats actually happening while the season 1 twist is very obvious."
I Hear Your Voice,"I mean it’s good.  I kinda get the feeling it’s what the boondocks saints was to my generation.

I think everyone would enjoy it more if they didn’t try to contextualize it with their personal plights.  But 🤷‍♂️"
I Hear Your Voice,It’s the best show I’ve ever watched. Season 2 can be a bit of a slog but thats because it’s putting the pieces in place for season 3/4 which absolutely nail it out of the park. If you decide you just can’t make it through then that’s fine but you should still check out season 4 episode 7. Perfect filmmaking.
I Hear Your Voice,"season 1 is fantastic 

the rest completely miss the mark tho"
I Hear Your Voice,"I couldn't stand it. It's initially interesting, but got boring fast."
I Hear Your Voice,"Was one of my favorite shows when it was on the air, but I don't think it quite stuck the landing with it's final season. Most people complain about the 2nd season not really having a straightforward plot which didn't bother me at all. But regardless of whether it was that or the death of tv it had really bad ratings for the rest of the series and there were two actors that were probably not included in the last season for issues that happened off set that I haven't seen any coverage of even a comment from Sam Esmail or Rami Malek about."
I Hear Your Voice,Season 1 was probably the best series I ever saw- season 2 lost me
I Hear Your Voice,Started watching it. Guessed a big reveal about 2 episodes in. Checked to confirm if I was right and I was so I called it there.
I Hear Your Voice,"Familiarize yourself with Linux, and give it a season 

Once you see White Rose storylines, , give up."
I Hear Your Voice,"I enjoyed the ride and it was certainly pretty unique. It gets a little too convoluted which hinders the storytelling and not all the twists land as hard as they could.
I don't know if it ever is as purely fun as that first episode but it gets pretty close.
But worth the watch for sure."
I Hear Your Voice,"Mr. Robot is great, just be warned it's not happy in the slightest, as in ""we'll give you a puppy dog, shoot it in front of you, and then immediately move on like it never happened to rob you of the grieving process,"" type not happy. Not to mention all characters are fundamentally lonely and/or desperate to their core which doesn't make things any better. As a work of art and as a story the show is amazing, but just make sure you're in a good space before watching it.

I made the mistake of watching it right when the pandemic started. I was like ""Wow, the school I work is closed down, now I have time to catch up on all the shows I've been wanting to watch,"" and it really didn't do much good for my emotional state during that time."
I Hear Your Voice,If you can stand the main character (which I personally have a really hard time doing) it's worth a watch
I Hear Your Voice,"It's not bad, but not even close to being one of the 'best shows ever'."
I Hear Your Voice,"If you take your time with the show, there's so many rabbit holes and easter eggs in subreddit discussions. Just search by season and episode like S1E01 or S01E01.  


**There are no spoilers**, but the one I think about all the time is that the creator rendered an image as a sound at the beginning of a really intense episode. The image was the ""Hang in There Baby"" cat image. A fan's boyfriend was an audio engineer and immediately recognized what the sound was, and processed the audio back into an image.  


""There was a strange squiggly noise at the beginning of this episode. My boyfriend is an audio engineer and knew right away that it was the sound of an image being rendered as audio. He grabbed the audio and processed it and found the ""Hang in there baby"" cat. But what does it mean?"""
I Hear Your Voice,"Definitely. The story can get really confusing sometimes with all the subplots, but the atmosphere, acting, twists and the big reveal at the end are absolutely phenomenal."
I Hear Your Voice,I tried but it was so slow and boring as shit.
I Hear Your Voice,"Why are you seeking Reddit's opinion? If you're interested,  give it another chance!"
I Hear Your Voice,"yes, but the depressing outlook is contagious."
I Hear Your Voice,Absolutely. It’s one of the greatest shows ever done. S2 is generally regarded as the weakest but press on.
I Hear Your Voice,I binged a season or two of it. But it just got too weird for me so I dropped it.
I Hear Your Voice,"Sam Esmail knows what he's doing. This show has it all: killer cinematography, a superb soundtrack and score, delicious acting from amazing actors, a plot that hooks you from the start, memorable characters, innovative visual storytelling, a satisfying ending and incredible social commentary. Mr. Robot knew what it wanted to do and ran away with it. There is some growing pains on season 2 because season 1 was the buzziest show of the season, but the show is very good. One of my favorites."
I Hear Your Voice,"Yes dude! I had a completely similar experience. I watched the first few episodes back when the show was fresh and it kinda didn’t grab me. Also a lack of attention probably.

Then last year I gave it another try and wow. It is one of my TOP series of all time. It’s amazing."
I Hear Your Voice,"Mr Robot overall was a good show with moments of absolute brilliance and a slow start.  It was worth watching, though personally I think its a little overrated.  Particularly on this sub."
I Hear Your Voice,If you want to watch the performance that made a virtual unknown one of the most lauded actors in the world then yeh
I Hear Your Voice,Second season is a bit weaker but overall it is a great ride with some episodes being the best stuff made on TV.
I Hear Your Voice,It's a great show in my opinion due to the complexity of the characters and strong overall writing. As long as you don't long up the plot you'll definitely won't see some of the plot twist. Also by and large pretty accurate depiction of hacking and hacking methods. I would also mention that it's not a feel good show ie you'll feel the stress the characters go through.
I Hear Your Voice,Does it have less mistakes than Breaking Bad? No. Is it better? I think so. Cinematography and music are better than anywhere I can remember. It has a perfect one shot episode in season 3. It has a perfect silent episode in season 4. There's 407 which is probably the best episode on TV ever. Season 4 overall was amazing.
I Hear Your Voice,Why do you think it’s so good?
I Hear Your Voice,What makes it so good for you
I Hear Your Voice,"I recommend starting from the beginning. First season lets you familiarise with the world,  the characters and ends in an optimistic place. Season 2 is when I feel the show stops holding your hand and trusts you enough to go darker and weirder."
I Hear Your Voice,"And guy really wants to be convinced in the comments, lmao. Just use this time to watch the first episode, which is a very good pilot."
I Hear Your Voice,"tbf, reddit gigapraises the leftovers and to me it is not that good at all.

at a lot of times it made me go ""really? this is so stupid"" like when i was watching season 7-8 of TWD

im fully prepared for the downvotes."
I Hear Your Voice,LOL Ok. Didn’t ask if it was good. Asked if I should watch it based on my preferences. Completely different question
I Hear Your Voice,"That’s my first thought, like, just start the show, watch a few episodes and then you’ll decide if the show is for you, I could understand this question regarding video games cause you have to buy them, but movies or TV show, it’s just silly"
I Hear Your Voice,*Tyrell Wellick has entered the chat*
I Hear Your Voice,agreed. Sam Esmail planned the whole thing out meticulously from the start
I Hear Your Voice,"I really don't know how people were satisfied with how White Rose and The Dark Army plot resolved. After spending so much time on White Rose outmaneuvering every other major player in the show, it was insanely disappointing to have her arc and the mysteries surrounding her plan to be answered with essentially that she's just crazy.

Elliot's personal trauma and how his mental health felt like it had been planned from the start, and was a very satisfying wrap up. E-Corp, White Rose and a lot of the mysteries felt like they never had a plan behind them."
I Hear Your Voice,">level 1Mnemosense · 1 hr. agoMr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery 

I don't think it's necessarily a good thing for all questions to be answered. It's best that some questions be left unanswered. See The Leftovers."
I Hear Your Voice,I’ve heard ppl say The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever & I hate it. So what’s your point? Lol
I Hear Your Voice,"That's it. It laid out mysteries through its run and it manages to answer many of them, while leaving others unanswered but that don't feel frustrating."
I Hear Your Voice,Counterpoint: It *is* one of the best shows ever.
I Hear Your Voice,I thought it was one of the worst endings I've seen. It felt like a cheesy cop-out to me. But I seem to be the minority on that opinion.
I Hear Your Voice,"Yeah I said in another comment seasons 2 & 3 really detracted from the series overall. If I could I'd condense the series into 2 seasons. There's a good story tucked away, it just gets dragged out way too long."
I Hear Your Voice,"I tried to watch it twice, once alone and once with my gf (she was also trying a rewatch). We both enjoyed season 1 and couldn't remember why we stopped watching independently of each other. The season 2 happened...  We had to keep pausing because it was killing our spirits..  Eventually we quit. I'm sorry, but if I need to slog though hours of boredom just to enjoy the later parts of your show, it's not a good show. I won't be attempting a third rewatch to finish"
I Hear Your Voice,"Maybe I'm misremembering here, but I'm pretty sure it only seriously retcons one thing and that one thing is possibly the greatest twist in the history of television. Mainly because it's something we all should have seen coming and was right in front of our noses the entire time, but nobody actually figured it out. That's the mark of an excellent twist."
I Hear Your Voice,"Great writing with a lot of different plot twists, they're actually correct with their tech, and it's just a good show overall. 

I was hooked from the first scene and spent a week binge watching the entire series during the first lockdown."
I Hear Your Voice,"Some of the best cinematography I've come across in a TV show. Even ignoring the great characters, acting, music, and story, it brings me joy just seeing the amount of creativity and passion put into the camera framing and movements."
I Hear Your Voice,"It's a show that seems to be about a very narrow topic at the beginning, but progresses to be about almost EVERYTHING. Even characters that are introduced as flat stereotypes are rounded out into complex humans trying to do the best they can, and the show explores big questions about the various crises of the modern age and what we as individuals can really do about them, if anything.

It's one of the rare shows where each episode builds on all the ones before to become even more thought-provoking."
I Hear Your Voice,Don't ask or read more about it. It fits with your favorites but knowing less is better for the full ride.
I Hear Your Voice,Very suspenseful and it felt like each episode had a distinct climax which kept my attention
I Hear Your Voice,"Not OP but I'll give you a break down of my thoughts on what makes it good:

1) Narrative format. Elliot ""breaks the fourth wall"" by speaking to the audience in voice overs, which results in some interesting dynamics and plays an important part in both the plot and his character development. It's probably one of the most effective uses in voice over narrative in TV since Wonder Years.

2) Direction. The direction of the show is just unique and also very effective. The camera shots, framing, angles, are all used to help influence our views, feelings towards characters, and understanding of what's happening. After season 1 there are some very well done scenes that make use of long shots and revealing of scenes as things unfold on and off camera.

3) Characters. Like Sopranos, these characters are treated very much like real people. They get into crazy situations and it *effects them*. We see how it effects them over time. They change, their relationships and dynamics to one another change, and all of this effects their choices and the larger plot. It's a psychological show, with a psychologist as an occasional character (like Sopranos), so it takes into consideration how the psyches of people work. And there are some *fascinating* characters, some who aren't even main characters, and they all have complicated depth.

4) Plot and story. Mr. Robot is a show that moves forward while still returning to past effects. The plot develops with each season, though season 2 is a little more character focused, and it kind of just keeps unfolding. But, essentially, the plot and story is all really about Elliot and Mr. Robot, which is why 1, 2, and 3 of my list here are handled so carefully. It needs those elements to work well for its story to be good. And so there's an attention to all of it that helps it become a well crafted story.

Overall, it's good TV because it's aware of its medium and craft and how to use those effectively. This also makes it a bit too ""pretentious"" for some, because it very much is trying to make an art out of it, it's aware of what it's doing. That's not for everyone. But I think if you enjoy character driven stories it's still good even if it feels a little too meta or pretentious at times.

It does use similar fantasy scenarios as Sopranos, where it delves into the mind of the protagonist like we do with Tony, but it really pushes on that farther and takes it up several notches. That can be too much for people when it happens, but it's not every episode either.

Anyway, that's what I think makes it good. It's firing on all cylinders and fits the genres I like. But your own tastes may differ."
I Hear Your Voice,"It pulls you in harder than just about any show I've watched. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire series, kind of like breaking bad but much more engaging and fast paced. And it doesn't even have a massive buildup, it hooks you from the first scene and will keep you guessing the whole time."
I Hear Your Voice,Control is just an illusion!
I Hear Your Voice,"I agree with the OP. Season 1 was a thrill to watch. Personally seasons 2 and 3 get progressively worse, I'd call them boring and rudderless. Season 4, the final season has a lot of payoffs but I honestly don't know if it's worth it getting to that point slogging through the rest of the story. 

That being said all the characters feel very human. They're not simply plot elements, even the side characters. Everyone reacts according to their own beliefs and characteristics. There are consequences, intrigue and hidden agendas behind every action. At times the intrigue goes a little too deep as you can tell the writers got a little over their heads at times. 

It's really hard to say much about the series as it's kind of chock full of spoilers, though. Even making comparisons to other media feels a bit too leading. You really need to go into this show with blinders on. Just watching the first 15 minutes should give you a good feel for the vibe of the rest of the season though."
I Hear Your Voice,This is what I'm saying. How is spending all this time thinking about consuming media or shitting on media you haven't watched productive? Is your life just not meaningful on its own? Watch the thing and move on. Or don't watch the thing and move on.
I Hear Your Voice,You’re putting more effort into a Reddit post about watching it than it would be to just watch it.
I Hear Your Voice,People like different things though. I absolutely love some of your preference and don’t like others.  Only way to know whether you’ll like the show is to check it out. There’s a chance you will like it but only you would know for sure.
I Hear Your Voice,Based on your preferences I'd say it's a MORE THAN definite yes.
I Hear Your Voice,"If you like hacking, unreliable narrators, thrillers, twists with payoff and breathtaking cinematography then yes you should watch it. The show doesn’t hold your hand though you do have to pay attention to it."

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"This show has plenty of fan service, but THIS is the fan service that I live for."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Beth Broderick has the most amazing voice. So powerful, but soothing somehow. Not super familiar with her career, but if she hasn't done voice acting it would be a damn shame."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Please tell me Salem returns as well
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I had such a crush on Beth Broderick...it seems I still do.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"I met them at the restaurant I work at when they were filming this! They were super sweet and I made some stupid joke like ""All we need is Melissa Joan Hart and the reunion is complete!""

I felt so dumb after."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Omgggg !! I dropped this show but this makes me want to watch this
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"I literally got through the whole clip, was like, ""What do they mean new aunties?"" Then I realized they were the original Sabrina the Teenage Witch women! My brain just put them in there no problem."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Nina Hartley is in this?!
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Remember when this show was good for a season?! Then the 2nd season happened. Did it get better again for the 3rd?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Into the Spellmanverse?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"meh, does Melissa joan hart ever pop up?"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"They done did it. That was meant to be the batty bat episode in season one, but they thought it was too soon"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"I met Caroline Rhea in 2000 and she is the absolute best. I am glad she is getting the opportunity to get back in the public eye and hope it leads to more things for her. One of the nicest people in Hollywood, if not the nicest."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Might actually make me watch the next season. This Sabrina is so annoying, only really watching for Prudence's hair/makeup/clothes"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Had such a big crush on Rhea growing up, glad not much changed."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,WHY would they spoil this before the season is even available??
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Man, that felt nice to see. I loved them back in the day."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Did this show get better after part 1?  I loved the visuals, satanism and look of the first season but couldn't handle Sabrina's wooden acting and some of the modern elements."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,There's actually a striking resemblance between each of these actresses and the ones playing their respective counterparts on this show.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,[deleted]
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Bringing these two in will be a total waste if they don’t bring Salem as well. Melissa Joan Hart gets a pass because this Sabrina is in her place but including the aunts but not Salem would be a huge mistake, the banter between the three of them was the best part of the original show."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Give me a Salem cameo or give me death (I'm a part behind so ignore this if they already did)
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"The first season was OK but it got too preachy and ""on the nose"" for me. My wife and I stopped watching a couple episodes into season 2."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Really enjoyed this series.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This show would’ve done better if these two were still in it.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Can Salem please be added?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Aunt zelda has still got it going on.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Nice seeing them again. Hello old friends.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Oh my god, my 90’s kid heart is so full"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,all we need is Melissa Joan Hart
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I watched a hallmark Christmas movie on Youtube. Had original Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart) and her Aunt playing her mom. That was literally the only part of the movie I liked. Melissa had zero chemistry with Mario Lopez.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This is great. Gives me Restless from Buffy sort of vibes.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I did not think I gave a shit about the original TV run of Sabrina but this made me really happy
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,FUCK YES.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,N O S T A L G I A
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"I’m so fucking angry they cancelled this show and then what do they do? They green light a bunch of other witch shows on Netflix. It’s quantity for them, not quality"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Do they play her aunts or?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"""Ben, hey, who are those ladies?""

GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW!!!!"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This makes me so fucking happy!!!!!
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Yes...Just YES!
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I feel like you'd want this cameo to be a surprise?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Didn’t this show recently get cancelled?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Ok. Now I’ll watch
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Is this a just bit they filmed to promote the show? Or will they actually appear in part 4 of CAOS?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This is the best thing this show has ever done
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,That is really cool
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"As someone who hasnt watched past the first season, are they playing her aunties from a different dimension or something? Just gimme the need to know info"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Ummm,.. they haven’t aged at all wtf!?!???"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I blame Beth for my taste in women as an adult
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,My favourite WILFs :)
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Now this is the show I actually want to see. Love those ladies.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I'm confused. Are they French Mistaking it al la Supernatural?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"S1 was okay, but honestly after S2E2 i didn't even want to continue.

ST:Discovery has started similar bollocks this season too."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,So no Salem the cat. Hard pass from me. Fuck this show.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Wait, is new season out?"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Cringe. Caroline Rhea is starting to look like Louie Anderson.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I thought that was Louie Anderson!
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,who?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Oooh love
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Just by this clip I can already tell how the entire episode is going to go
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"The last season wasn’t very good, but hopefully they end it well."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Why is this show so damn dark looking!? Like, lighting-wise!"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Thanks for sharing. Almost watched before I realized I should savor this season. I went with an Instant click with disregard for spoiling the watch.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"I have not been watching this show, I just want to watch it or this cameo now!"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I stepped away from netflix last fall ... this show is prob what will bring me back
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Everything seems like a multiverse nowadays
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Guess I'll check it out
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I stopped after season 2. Should I watch it again?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,That font had me thinking this was cyberpunk
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Did anyone catch the Rick Roll in the background???
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,YESSS
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Is there a new season out that I just haven’t heard about?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I thought this show was cancelled?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Same font as Cobra Kai
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,when does the new season come out?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"I should really try and rewatch this from the start, it's just so hard to get past the cringey teen drama momenys"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,i thought this show was cancelled
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Didn't they cancel this? The show had promise, but season 2 was such a mess with all the non sense and hormonal stuff that was just unbearable to watch even as background.

But man, this was great... Multiverse of Sabrina, one of them has Salem conquering the world."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Very supernatural.  I love it.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,So happy to finally hear from this. Just sad it is the end but this is a very fun twist.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Watching this put such a huge smile on my face enough to rival the Cheshire cat! 

Seriously hope they get the full episode not just a few minutes, definitely HAVE to have Salem too!!"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Oh, I didn't even know there was a part 3! Guess I got something new to watch now lol"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,What is this show? Where is Salem the cat?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This makes me so happy
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Well now I’m annoyed I have to rewatch it Bc I couldn’t stand this new Sabrina. I love the dark aspect of it I loved the comics but the show was so boring to me :/
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"They really should have leaned way into the Witch School angle, and not abruptly alter their entire religion by having Satan be weak af. Why did they ever worship that dude? How was a huge evil tradition and school built around him? He turned out to be lame, stupid and useless. Barely any power or cunning."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I thought this show got cancelled
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I need Salem talking
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This is definitely the type of fan service that I love. It might be enough to even get me to start watching again.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"That's one thing I like about the show. They aren't afraid to kind of give the viewers something they'd meta-enjoy. Even so, they still make the show take itself seriously."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,This made my day!
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,If they didn't tap Nick Bakay for this episode I will be sorely disappointed.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Caroline Rhea does a fair bit of voice acting. She’s Phineas’ mum in Phineas and Ferb.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Man, young me liked Sabrina.  But now that I’m older I realize what a babe Aunt Zelda was."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"She chooses who gets the Oscars every year, she's on the Academy panel."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I saw her in a Chekov play in Austin a few years ago. She killed.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Salem was the best.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,It better be the damn puppet itself and not some cowardly CGI.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,wait i heard this show was canceled...is it not ?
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Eff that.  I want a Sabrina/Lucifer crossover
Terrorism Close Calls,"This entire article is unusually good.

Also, the fact that he went from Office PA to Exec Producer and writer is just spectacular. 

Congrats and well done.  Can't wait to see how it all wraps up."
Terrorism Close Calls,That episode was so good and this article makes it even better. I am haunted by that scene of Lalo and Howard in the grave.  What an awful place to end up.
Terrorism Close Calls,"It all started with, ""it wasn't me it was Ignacio!""."
Terrorism Close Calls,I need that Lyle musical ASAP.
Terrorism Close Calls,I wonder where the show is going to go with two major plotlines completed?
Terrorism Close Calls,So does Saul know Lalo’s dead? If so why does he say “did Lalo send you” in BB if he knows Lalo would’ve been dead for some time?
Terrorism Close Calls,"I love the fact BCS turned what is basically a throwaway line from Breaking Bad into two of the best characters in that universe, Nacho and Lalo, gonna miss Tony Dalton as Lalo the guy was electric every time he was on screen 

I got to say though as much as I liked the moments in this episode and the great acting I wasn’t a fan of the plot. Lalo’s plan is to have Jimmy go to Gus’ house and shoot him knowing he’s going to fail but using that to buy time to sneak into the laundry to record his video proving to Don Eladio Gus was building a lab, he was counting on Jimmy/Kim failing so he and the Don could torture Gus “by the pool” for fun later, but Gus just having a giant underground room wouldn’t prove anything, it wasn’t a lab yet, he could have said it was for anything, and when Jimmy/Kim failed he had to know they’d go back to the apartment and free Jimmy, so his whole goal was to film the empty dirt filled underground room which doesn’t feel like it would’ve been enough to doom Gus in the eyes of Bolsa and Eladio, not even mentioning having Gus just randomly decide to plant the gun there before in case Lalo somehow finds out about the underground room and takes him down there? I mean alright 

I’ve seen other articles that say similar things, I know they had to wrap up Lalo’s story but it just felt like it was sloppier than the usual airtight scripts from BCS"
Terrorism Close Calls,I think the way they ended Lalo's story was rushed and largely unsatisfying. It's the 'dumb action' trope where suddenly the power level of the character is brought down considerably because their story needs to end.
Terrorism Close Calls,"So overrated. Lalo ridiculously evading & defeating all of Gus's army, until he had him on gunpoint, but in a predictable, cliched manner, Lalo stalls to give Gus enough time to turn the tables. Felt like a scene from some low-grade action movie. It was stupid to present that scene as if it's supposed to be intense when we all know Gus wasn't going to die. In fact, so many people correctly called how Lalo was going to die episodes ago. That's how predictable this was. 

I'm amazed people seriously think that was good.

Please no more unnecessary, repetitive cartel stuff for the last 5 episodes."
Terrorism Close Calls,Is BCS good? I got three episodes into the first season and was *so bored*. I like slow burns but this made Mad Men look like it was on speed.
Terrorism Close Calls,"Listening to the Better Call Saul podcast (and the Breaking Bad one before it) it's clear Vince, Peter and the theme love to promote from within and it leads to some really strong results.

For example Ariel Levine was a post-production assistant in season 1 and then a writers assistant for seasons 2-5. She wrote a few digital shorts and then has written 2 episodes so far of season 6.

It sounds like they really nurture an environment for people to contribute and grow"
Terrorism Close Calls,Hollywood Reporter is the best publication
Terrorism Close Calls,"Yeah it was such an undeserved end for Howard. Very awful way to go. Like, he was kinda a dick to Kim especially, but the punishment he got didn't fit the crime."
Terrorism Close Calls,And then years later Jesse is dancing over their graves in an inflated suit.
Terrorism Close Calls,Kim’s fate and the Gene timeline I’m pretty sure
Terrorism Close Calls,"He could think Lalo told his associates “If I disappear, kill Saul Goodman.” or Saul is thinking “I was assured he was dead once and he wasn’t, so if I get dragged to the desert it might trigger that same concern.”"
Terrorism Close Calls,He thought the first time already Lalo is dead until he showed up in his apartment so no surprise he'll always wonder if Lalo is still around
Terrorism Close Calls,It’s in the article if you’re curious
Terrorism Close Calls,Didn’t Mike say it or he was “taken care of”? That could mean a lot of things.
Terrorism Close Calls,"He was never told he was dead, just that he wasn't coming back. Considering he already though Lalo was dead, i'd say its fair to assume he would always worry he wasn't."
Terrorism Close Calls,"You're forgetting Lalo got the German construction worker to tell him everything. And Bolsa knew about these workers from Gus' 'refrigeration facility'. So Bolsa would know Gus lied to him about that, which would make him inclined to believe Lalo. I don't think it's a stretch to wrap it up like this."
Terrorism Close Calls,Don’t forget about Lalo’s trip to Germany.
Terrorism Close Calls,TV doesn't have to subvert expectations to be good
Terrorism Close Calls,There was a whole scene in a previous episode showing Gus meticulously preparing for something to happen in the lab. So you correctly predicting that a major plot point will happen in the lab doesn't really deserve a pat on the back.
Terrorism Close Calls,"People predicted Gus hid a gun in the lab and literally took a lucky shot in the dark that killed Lalo? They predicted Mike and his guys would be distracted because Lalo threatened Kim into going to kill Gus?

We knew Gus wasn't going to die but when didn't know what would happen with Lalo and when we'd see him last. Some people thought Ignacio would be the one to kill Lalo and that didn't happen. 

Just because we knew Gus would win didn't make it predictable."
Terrorism Close Calls,"I loved the episode but I do think Lalo being able to shoot four of Gus' bodyguards, but then falling to Gus' (very convenient) gambit with the lighting, was beneath what we usually expect of this show's writing."
Terrorism Close Calls,I love the show and all but this person’s right.  It wasn’t a good episode.  Downvote me all you want but when you have a showdown between two people and you KNOW one of them doesn’t die; it completely sucks the tension out of the scene.  It was a lame end to a wonderfully thought out character.
Terrorism Close Calls,"It’s insanely good.  You’re missing out if you don’t watch it all but nobody’s going to hold your hand.  It’s not all action all the time, it’s a show about characters and you need to actually get to know them in their universe."
Terrorism Close Calls,First season is pretty slow but it picks up steam from season 2 onwards.
Terrorism Close Calls,It’s way better than BB so yeah
Terrorism Close Calls,"I think having someone who knows the environment is really important to the continuity of the show, so many long running sitcoms after they get bigger and the originals don't have the time to write the scripts just seem to hire writers that come in fresh and without that long term experience they end up writing something that feels close but off to the original product."
Terrorism Close Calls,"He was DEFINITELY a prick to Kim, but was actually a pretty good dude to Saul.  Saul’s hatred towards him is almost bizarre, but I guess Howard is a figurehead for the legal establishment and general societal constraints that he’s rebelling against…."
Terrorism Close Calls,"I'm predicting that something will happen that forces Kim to request the services of the vacuum guy. Kim probably gets blamed for Howard ""disappearance"".

Jump to post BB time. Jimmy and Kim reunite."
Terrorism Close Calls,"Yeah, Mike tells Saul that it has been taken care of. But Saul was literally told that before and Lalo came back to kill his last good friend in front of him. 

Saul has no reason to believe Lalo is dead in BB timeline. He just doesn't know."
Terrorism Close Calls,And Lalo was confirmed dead before yet came walking right into Jimmy's living room
Terrorism Close Calls,"I can't imagine how people like that watch TV in the long run. BCS is great not because of twists but because of the way characters are fleshed out, the way actors knock it out of the park (Rhea Sheehorn is *phenomenal*!)"
Terrorism Close Calls,"I mean it was predictable, but that's literally because they left the breadcrumbs in the show to point you to that upcoming conclusion. This was satisfying because it made logical sense in how they were presenting the show and it rewarded a keen eye on the part of the viewer. If there was ever a good form of predictability, this was it.

Honestly with how they laid out the first half of the season, if you'd been paying attention then almost everything that happened in the episode was predictable. I think the biggest surprise was that they actually went hard with this episode to wrap up the Lalo storyline faster instead of dragging it out another episode or so. But once again nothing about that is bad. You don't always need some 11th hour twist, you just need to be consistent with the story you are telling."
Terrorism Close Calls,"> People predicted Gus hid a gun in the lab and literally took a lucky shot in the dark that killed Lalo?

Yes.  Didn't we literally see him stash the gun?"
Terrorism Close Calls,"Not every scene needs to have tension though. There was a ton of tension in this episodes stemming from Jimmy and Kim's side of the storyline, the Gus stuff was just the logical conclusion to a story they've been setting up for 2 seasons now."
Terrorism Close Calls,"I think his hatred of Howard is not bizarre at all. For the longest time he thought it was Howard that denied him joining HHM despite the effort he had put in. In a way he sees Howard as an extension of Chuck. Saul is also a really petty and jealous guy, he sees Howard as this ""perfect guy"" who has everything he once aspired to and he hates that. Despite the fact that Howard had his own share of problems that Saul wasn't aware of."
Terrorism Close Calls,"It's misplaced but it's also understandable. Howard took the fall for Chuck in regards to icing Jimmy's career. So to Jimmy, Howard was the rich son of the company that got handed his life telling him that he wasn't good enough. Then when it came out those lingering feelings were still there. But more importantly, when Chuck died, Jimmy found it incredibly conveniant to let Howard take all the blame for it (even though it's really Jimmy's fault) so that he didn't need to feel guilt. 

But yeah from a totally rational perspective, Howard was the one pulling for Jimmy against Chuck, set him at Davis and Main, took care of his brothers funeral, and offered Jimmy the gig he always wanted once the big obstacle was out of the way. His biggest sin was being loyal to fathers law partner that showed him the ropes. 

Jimmy is still a piece of shit and Howard was still ultimately more honorable than either Jimmy or Kim. They know it."
Terrorism Close Calls,">  Saul’s hatred towards him is almost bizarre

Y'all are missing the most important aspect of Jimmy's hatred of Howard in later seasons....

Jimmy was almost catatonic with unprocessed guilt after his brother died. When Howard (unaware of what Jimmy had done) tearfully confesses he feels responsible for his death, Jimmy bizarrely snaps out of his funk and piles on  Howard, 'yes you are to blame'.

In other words, Jimmy subconsciously transfers his own guilt onto Howard instead of working through it in terms of his own culpability.

Reasons people are mentioning are more like why Kim hated Howard."
Terrorism Close Calls,"> Jump to post BB time. Jimmy and Kim reunite.

Has any character in this universe received a happy ending in Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul?"
Terrorism Close Calls,"I don’t feel like there’s enough story left in the current timeline for that to happen. Lalo was the big threat, Howard was her nemesis, nothing either of them did got her anywhere to close to needing to disappear, I can’t really think what would. I feel like we’re going to time jump to Breaking bad time and she’s still going to be around."
Terrorism Close Calls,"And even if he does know for sure, he’s definitely got some form of PTSD from all this. Having a back thrown over your head and a gun pointed at you will 100% trigger that and he’ll snap right back to thinking it’s Lalo."
Terrorism Close Calls,I don't know if these people didn't pay attention in high school or if access to so much content has rotted their brains but it's as if they've completely forgotten that tragedy has been an accepted form of storytelling for literally thousands of years.
Terrorism Close Calls,"Yea we totally saw the gun being placed so I didn’t get that comment either. Also it wasn’t one lucky shot with one bullet, Gus unloaded the entire chamber from about 10 feet away so it’s not hard to think he would hit Lalo fatally while also getting shot - tho protected by his vest."
Terrorism Close Calls,"I don't think it's really that personally. I think Jimmy largely reconciled with Howard from S2-S4. He even gives Howard a kick in the pants in S4 to get HHM back on good footing again. I just don't think he could handle the weight of Howard's offer to make him a part of HHM, to take his brother's place knowing that his brother died partially because of his actions and still believing that Jimmy was no good. And he lashed out at Howard as a result.

Remember that Jimmy isn't the one who pushes to go after Howard, it's Kim."
Terrorism Close Calls,"This is such a good point!

The Chuck stuff feels like it was so long ago, because for us it really was, but for Jimmy its because its almost like his brother never even existed.

After he dumps everything on Howard with, ""your cross to bear,"" Jimmy hardly mentions Chuck again... if ever.

And I sympathize with Howard the most as he begins to realize that Jimmy is constantly screwing with him. The only rational reaction to have is complete befuddlement as to why Jimmy is seemingly completely obsessed with Howard."
Terrorism Close Calls,"Ya know, thats a really good point that I didnt really internalize….hes slippin jimmying his own culpability and piling it on lioe a house of cards.

Perhaps thats a hint of where we’re going next….sauls gonna keep moving in that same direction ‘fuck him, he had it coming’, whereas Kims finally gonna flip back in the opposite direction ‘omg, this is our fault….im not a bad person but what we did was shitty’"
Terrorism Close Calls,"I feel like there's more to it, too - there's an almost.. patronizing aspect of Howard toward Jimmy, and I feel like that feeds into it quite a bit, too"
Terrorism Close Calls,"In the BB/BCS universe, being alive at the end is the best ending. Jesse and Jimmy are the only known survivors.

Kim will survive. The writers wouldn't have included post BB flash forwards in the show if they didn't intend to close the story with a good ending.

Jimmy saw the vacuum guy business card but he doesn't know yet what he really does. There will be a scene where the vet guy informs Jimmy of vacuum guy's services.

I think Kim dying would break Jimmy and he wouldn't be the same person he is in BB. She'll live."
Terrorism Close Calls,"C'mon, reconciled? He destroyed Howards car with bowling balls and set up that restaurant scene with the hookers. That was just last season.

Saul hated Howard. He hated him for years. The only reason why he was reluctant to destroy Howard was because he was scared of being a bad influence on Kim, and maybe even surprised Kim wanted to go through with it."
Terrorism Close Calls,"I think you’re right. I don’t think he liked seeing how Howard managed to process Chuck’s death either, everything about him just reminded Jimmy of Chuck and what he did."
Terrorism Close Calls,That's a good point
Terrorism Close Calls,"Did you read my full post?

I literally said the stuff you're talking about was Jimmy lashing out at Howard because of the offer to go to HHM making Jimmy deal with his unresolved issues with Chuck.

And I gave a counter to Jimmy hating Howard too - he gives him a pep talk in S4 when Howard is down. I think Jimmy knows Howard doesn't deserve what they do to him, he goes along with it because he doesn't want to disappoint Kim."

Terrorism Close Calls,"“De Barra’s past credits include working on Netflix and Marvel’s Iron Fist, which sets expectations relatively low, and Blood Origin still manages to limbo under them.”  Damn get them some aloe for that burn…"
Terrorism Close Calls,Lonesome Dove demonstrates how awesome a 6 hour TV movie can be. Maybe execution and writing have a lot to do with it.
Terrorism Close Calls,"That wasn’t really the main problem here. If it was a competently written 6 hour movie, people would have enjoyed it a crap ton more. There is an audience for long form cinematic experiences, but there isn’t much of an audience for shit writing. And what really sucks is that the people the show attracts (fans of the franchise) are exactly the people who will be the least happy with the writing, since the writers have made clear their disdain for the original writing and intent to do the stories completely differently."
Terrorism Close Calls,"I’ve been saying this for a while. People kept asking for fewer episodes with tighter storylines, but I insisted that reducing the episode number would make no difference because you simply turn a dragged out 13 hour movie into a dragged out 9 hour movie. Fewer episodes certainly didn’t help The Defenders. Sandman avoided this usual Netflix mistake because Gaiman insisted that his stories be translated faithfully, so every story was as long as it needed to be, whether it be 5 episodes or 15 minutes."
Terrorism Close Calls,"We also need to start questioning where these writers and showrunners come from.

It seems, the barriers to entering the industry are insanely hard, but somehow equally the industry is flooded with absolutely incompetent writers and showrunners. What exec signed off of on the iron fist showrunner being given a show like this?

Edit, sorry it wasn’t Scott bruck who worked on this but Declan de Barra, who helped write iron fist, a few episodes of the Witcher and was a producer on Iron Fist s2"
Terrorism Close Calls,"If this doesn't ruin the chances of the writing team then there is no fixing Hollywood fantasy series 

These people shouldn't get anymore work anywhere reputable"
Terrorism Close Calls,"This is an interesting observation. While the show clearly was missing fundamentals, the breakneck pacing of all but the first episode was a major problem. And damn, that line about De Barra’s prior credits was savage… Lauren Hissrich and her coterie will certainly have some ‘splaining to do when this franchise is done and dusted."
Terrorism Close Calls,Witcher blood origin teaches us absolutely nothing other than that completely disrespecting source material should get you fired.
Terrorism Close Calls,More like the dangers of letting incompetents ruin a good IP.
Terrorism Close Calls,Well at least they subverted the trope that fantasy was supposed to be fun and entertaining.
Terrorism Close Calls,"it also demonstrates that garbage showrunners shouldn't be given any work to begin with, especially big IPs that will not get a proper treatment for years because of their incompetence"
Terrorism Close Calls,"The solution here is simple, Hollywood needs to stop hiring anyone who doesn't want to adapt the original source material faithfully to do adaptations of existing beloved IP.

If these writers were good enough to write their own Witcher -- they'd have already done it and they'd be busy working on that series instead of the Witcher. So don't let them fuck up a sure bet with their own low IQ 'fan' fiction.

If they don't want to adapt the source materially faithfully, don't hire them to work on an existing IP."
Terrorism Close Calls,">De Barra’s past credits include working on Netflix and Marvel’s Iron Fist, which sets expectations relatively low, and Blood Origin still manages to limbo under them.

Savage!"
Terrorism Close Calls,"This explains the disjointed story.
Episode 1-2 started a decent flow.  In ep 3 they try to explain character development as an off screen after thought. They're in love? She's escaped or overpowered a cabal to lead?  The sorcerer's left the dark side and reunited with adopted family?
Black's Books spontaneously comes to rescue? After like days? They ask way too much for the audience to accept.

The only portrayal with no flaws- Meldof. 10/10. Second place Brother Death. 3, scian"
Terrorism Close Calls,The reason these kinds of shows keep failing is obvious. The writers hate the source material and write shit that directly contradicts established Lore. How hard is it to write within boundaries? If anything it's easier.
Terrorism Close Calls,The Witcher demonstrates the danger of completely straying from source material and making Witcher’s not human and most importantly NOT HENRY CAVILL
Terrorism Close Calls,"BWAHAHAHAH

More like it demonstrates the danger of having a show run by idiots.  I swear to god The Witcher was just such dogshit from start to finish. The had a great lead and heaps of cash and just blew it.

>  The Witcher: Blood Origin Demonstrates the Danger of Thinking of TV as a Six-Hour Movie

But there are so many shows that demonstrate how awesome that can be!

-  Stranger Things
-  Season 1 of Daredevil
-  Mare of Easttown
-  Season 1 of True Detective
-  The Wire
-  Band of Brothers
-  Chernobyl 

and on and on."
Terrorism Close Calls,"Depends on the writing or the team behind it. I think the benchmark is Twin Peaks: The Return for looking at tv this way, and I only know it was achieved because David Lynch is a madman."
Terrorism Close Calls,"Show writers have the biggest egos, they feel the need to insert their identity into an already well made story. This comment isn’t even geared towards The Witcher. RIP Quentin Coldwater"

Terrorism Close Calls,Are we sure it isn't the casual lore butchering in fantasy shows that is ruining them?
Terrorism Close Calls,Netflix's old Marvel shows were the original poster children of this problem. Taking what should have been a 3-5 episode miniseries or a 2.5 hour film and turning it into a 8-12 episode slog.
Terrorism Close Calls,I was looking forward to this show / story and now……. They fucking  rushed everything the CGI the story the writing everything they could of done so much better with more time instead they slapped this garbage out and messed it all up. No wonder why Henry left
Terrorism Close Calls,"Blood Origin shows how horrible ""Made for a modern audience"" has become."
Terrorism Close Calls,This is one of the worst shows I’ve ever seen
Terrorism Close Calls,"We like tv, that’s why we watch it. We don’t like this because of how Netflix handled the Henry Cavil Witcher conflict. 


We don’t want showrunners “making something their own”. You literally have all the market research you could ever want in the bestselling game and book series. Make that, be gentle and subtle in the things you touch. Don’t wrestle creative control from the written work to tell your own shitty take because you don’t like the source material."
Terrorism Close Calls,"So it’s no good then? I saw it pop up in my Netflix feed, and it started auto-playing…I immediately got the vibe that it looked very cheap and hokey."
Terrorism Close Calls,"It demonstrates what happens when companies don't listen to what the fans actually want and they force their idea of making it a ""show for the modern audience"" (aka insertion of modern day identity politics where it doesn't belong) instead of following the source material or its most popular game version."
Terrorism Close Calls,"The real issue here is the lack of respect for the source material leading to a complete collapse of the story, which will ultimately result in the death of the series (hardcore fans had already dropped out after season two, followed by most everyone else on the news of Henry Cavill's departure).

The Witcher series had amazing potential. Netflix chose to not only ignore the source material, they actively ridiculed it, and the fans. This dumpster fire is the sad but predictable result"
Terrorism Close Calls,"fucking hollywood..... You made a new history (that makes no sense) for a well established universe, had terrible writing, bad story, mediocre acting, got rid of the star and then sit around and wonder why it failed.  

and your conclusion is that it failed because of the format."
Terrorism Close Calls,"Nah, this poo-pile shows whats wrong with media these days.

&#x200B;

Through nepotism or just negligence, the people in charge hire shitty writers that don't want to adapt the source material. The writers see the title as just a ""Guaranteed fan-base"" for w/e story THEY want to make, so they use it to push w/e narratives they wish and feel like they're safe because they can slap ""The Award Winning GAME is now a SHOW"" on it.

&#x200B;

Sometimes changing the story can turn out good when you have respect for the source, like Da Boys. I read that comic, the show stays true to it in a number of ways but is completely different in most others ... I never thought they would be able to go for a 1:1 with a comic where one of the main protags hires a homeless guy to jack off each morning to leave a puddle of cum and blood at the door of another protag.   


Most of the time? Changing the story is just the writers trying to piggyback on the success of a different media's IP to get people to watch their pet project. Takes a lot of balls and convincing to make something completely new that stands on its own, much safer to change a few names and tell your story using established characters and worlds so that fans of that may watch YOUR story."

Not because of horrible writing that tossed the source material in the garbage and piss-poor dialogue that made the characters obnoxious.

Gotcha."
Terrorism Close Calls,That isn't even in the top 50 issues that this show has.
Terrorism Close Calls,"Incorrect. Making it into 4 episodes of actual episodes wouldn't fix the god awful writing.

Also, remember

They made a witcher who barely controlled himself, then stopped controlling himself, then they had to kill him, and then decided to make many more of those"
Terrorism Close Calls,At least it has a diverse cast of people who have been selected because of their talent.
Terrorism Close Calls,"I'm really tired of genre tv being treated like this. It means that each episode has almost no arc to it at all, you don't feel satisfied or happy after watching an episode - you have to see the whole season to know what the fuck is going on....

I was so happy when Strange New Worlds was very much episodic and light-hearted. It felt like a breath of fresh air with only the minor stink of Akiva Goldsman"

Pinocchio,I'm just anti weeb
Pinocchio,"I am in my mid 50s and enjoy good animation both adult and family.   I don't think I have seen animation that I would reward an Oscar or Emmy to but I have seen animation that was significantly better than the crap that are being nominated for awards.   Clearly it takes a lot of talent to create a good show from the artists to the voice actors to the directors/editors.  

I still enjoy the original Scooby=Doo Where are You despite the poor quality Hanna-Barbara productions.    I greatly appreciate the Dr. Who animation where only the audio existed of the original show.  I must add that my grammar, history and math is as good as it is because of School House Rock."
Pinocchio,"I really don't see this. Shows like Avatar, Invincible and Arcane are just a few Western animated shows that are constantly praised and talked about on here. 

Animated shows are less talked about on here generally but that's mostly because there aren't as many adult animated shows as there are live action."
Pinocchio,"The woe is you. Let people think what they want about art. Why must we view it the same way as you? How are you so enlightened? Who is saying Pinocchio isn’t a great animated movie? I am a big fan of animation but if I love The Godfather over Pinocchio I am somehow arrogant or condescending? Different mediums have different advantages in story telling. More people relate to live action because it isn’t as fabricated as animation. When someone cries in live action it feels more real than when someone cries in animation. These are my opinions but am I wrong for thinking them? No, because art is subjective like you said. Why do you care so much about other peoples opinions on animation? Can’t you just enjoy the medium and find people that enjoy the medium and move on. You take a stand with your straw man argument and bemoan when you don’t like what you hear. What weird world you live in full of conflict you create."

Pinocchio,"It's not just that live action is favored over animation (in the West), but the actors themselves receive an inordinate amount of attention in comparison to writers or directors. I don't really have any answers, but it's my best guess that it involves many ""star"" actors being marketed as sexual ideals."
Pinocchio,"Same thread, different week.  This conversation has been had too many times here... which is odd as I don't even see people putting down animation or kids shows in any substantial way."
Pinocchio,Because actors are better at portraying nuance and interiority than animators are at illustrating it. There's so much more you can do when your instrument is a face than you can when it's a marker pen.
Pinocchio,invincible too.
Pinocchio,"And people are (rightly, IMO) raving about Arcane. Which is a video game adaptation, no less."
Pinocchio,Also bob's burgers is constantly praised on this reddit
Pinocchio,"All those you mentioned are ""adult"" comedy shows. Outside of them or some anime, animated shows don't get proper recognition to the level of live-action. People will always say ""their script aren't as mature and complex as The Wire"", which is a really narrow way to rate art, specially in art in which raw emotion, styles and visuals are so important as animation. Great art is not only deep scripts and realistic drama. Disney's Pinocchio (1940) is one of the greatest masterpieces in the animated medium, the artistry, hard work and heart behind it were insane and unbelievable. So much emotion and pleasure. But it doesn't get the same general acclaim as the top live-action movies."

Live-action may be more ""real"" obviously, but art isn't simply about reality. Art transcends it, and we shouldn't have just realistic art.

Pinocchio,"There a lot of things animation can do that live-action can't ever match. They are both different mediums and artforms, and neither is objectively superior to the other.

I also believe in art plurality. No art is inferior, and it always should be judged based on what it is trying to accomplish. One would be insane to compare, for example, The Wire, a show about morally grey and deep realistic drama, to japanese Super Sentai, which are mainly about cheesy escapist silly fun and joy. The latter isn't an inferior type of art, just different, and it is amazing at what does. I want all art to be made, including art that is not for me."

Pinocchio,">  DCAU, Avatar, She-Ra, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls

These are teens shows. 

Animation tends to have progressive levels, you get like baby shows (like Baby TV and more), pre-school and young kids shows (like Nick Jr/ Disney Jr), which eventually graduate into the next level of grammar school content, which then graduate into teen content.  TV Networks often even have people ""graduate"" to their next network as they get older, such as Nick Jr -> Nick -> MTV.  Its all a plan

Adult animation, stuff like Rick and Morty or South Park are comedies aimed at Adults. There really isn't that much adult animation out there in scale in the west, as in very few, its really hard to be successful with it.  Adult Swim shows tend to toe the line but tend to generally be more teen-focused content than adult content.

Animation makers are VERY aware of exactly the demo they aim for with their shows"

Pinocchio,"Teen shows are often lumped together with kids shows for convenience purposes, to distinguish them as ""not adult"" shows, Kids tends to be used in multiple meanings, sometimes meaning ""not adult"" other times, young kids.

Children's shows are often used too to distinguish specific age groups, but in common saying, things are all over the place"

Pinocchio,"It feels like it's the same five movies played over and over again. Also, let's be real here, Snow Day is not a Christmas movie."
Pinocchio,Jack Frost is my favorite Rankin/Bass production!  AMC has been a letdown with their Fearfest for over a decade now so it stands to reason their Christmas fest would suck now too.
Pinocchio,"Both AMC and Freeform have been slightly disappointing. Home Alone is one of my favorite movies ever, not just Christmas but the Hocus Pocus-fication of it has been a little much. Home Alone 1 and 2 have been 90% of the lineup"
Pinocchio,AMC has been a bit of a let-down this year. They used to have a much rounder Christmas month of programming in the past. They need to ramp up and show every Christmas movie they have in their vault; I really do not want to watch Snow Day and Zookeeper (among others in their current programming lineup). At least they got Scrooged right.
Pinocchio,This is probably not allowed but there is a site called Santa’s Streams that has over 100+ Christmas specials to stream for free. It can be found at https://freechristmastv.video.blog/ or bit ly / santasstreams for short. Happy Holidays!
Pinocchio,"I'll say it. The Rankin Bass it whatever they are specials are so fucking terrible and boring and uninteresting.  They were that way in the 70s. They were that way in the 80s when I was tortured with them. They are still that way 50 years later. They aren't on because we'd rather eat wallpaper and choke ourselves with gift wrap and ribbon than watch one more Claymated joke that wasn't amusing when all your poor saps had in the world was brown paint and rectangles for cars.

I'm sorry it's me that has to be the one to tell you this."
Pinocchio,no die hard? no thanks
Pinocchio,"Same here, I thought I was the only person who noticed half of AMC's Christmas lineup is 90% movies that aren't actually set on Christmas. Just because a movie is set during winter doesn't make it a Holiday movie. And why is Ghostbusters part of that lineup?"
Pinocchio,"Even if Fearfest was a letdown, their ""Best Christmas Ever"" block managed to have a decent amount of Christmas classics. But this year is the first time I've felt letdown by their Christmas block. It ain't Christmas without seeing Rudolph, Frosty, and Santa Claus Is Comin To Town. But there is a lot of charm to Rankin/Bass lesser-known specials that aren't discussed that often by the public. Which is why I'm glad AMC is still airing them but disappointed it ain't as frequent as previous years."
Pinocchio,"I prefer the original Home Alone since it felt more special compared to the sequels. 

Heck, I miss the days when FreeForm used to be known as ""ABC Family"" since their Christmas lineup was so decent. Before the other Rankin/Bass specials moved to AMC, ABC Family would frequently air them during the weekdays instead for a single day in the weekends. Nowadays, I only check out FreeForm to catch a reairing of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer since that channel keeps the special's original length and unedited (such as keeping the original format of ""We're A Couple of Misfits"", ""We Are Santa's Elves"", and keeping the Peppermint Mine scene), Frosty the Snowman, and Santa Claus Is Comin To Town (which restores two songs that were missing from ABC's airing).

I'll never forget being pleasantly surprised on discovering ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" for the first time during the evening sometime in the mid to late 2000s as I randomly caught it airing on ABC Family. Same with Nestor, the Long-Eared Donkey and Frosty's Winter Wonderland."
Pinocchio,"Yeah, I'm disappointed with AMC not having that much Christmas content compared to previous years. It's mostly non-Christmas Movies that airs on weekends (Ghostbusters is perfect to watch during the Halloween season but is very out of place) over Rankin/Bass classics. Especially since FreeForm and AMC are the go-to networks for decent Christmas content of the past. Really hope AMC goes back to their previous approach where it was actually related to Christmas."
Pinocchio,"That's blasphemy! Also most of Rankin/Bass stop-motion specials weren't made by clay, but models and puppets."
Pinocchio,I thought i saw it on there the oterd day?
Pinocchio,"> Just because a movie is set during winter doesn't make it a Holiday movie.

Something, something, Die Hard."
Pinocchio,Abc family and even fox family and family channel were soooo much better than freeform
Pinocchio,The past few years they had The Santa Clause but I think they belong to Disney now so you better have Disney+ for that. I am disappointed that AMC doesn’t have the George C. Scott version of A Christmas Carol from 1984.
Pinocchio,"FreeForm currently airs The Santa Claus (and it's two sequels) while The Polar Express moved to AMC last year. But yeah, I really hope next year AMC might put the Rankin/Bass specials back on the air and having a more consistent airing schedule. The only thing decent is their Christmas promos this year (which they update each year) compared to FreeForm's ""25 Days of Christmas"" where they reuse the same promos from a few years ago."

Pinocchio,"TL;DR

My thoughts on the “nostalgia argument” as you call it, is it’s a genetic fallacy. You try to explain how and why someone has a position instead of addressing the position on its own merits. Instead of saying “you like x because you watched it when you were little” you should just say why you think it’s bad when viewed with a critical lens."

>It started going negatively when she introduced me to Ellen, and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and **didn’t even say, ‘Hello,’** or ‘Thank you for protecting my mother, my wife, and me.’”


She didn't say **HELLO**. That's it. This dude held a grudge for 6 years because she didn't say hello."
Bodyguard,"Wait, is this article just about a security guard being upset that Ellen didn't say hi to him during the few minutes he spent walking her into the building right before showtime?  Really?

I definitely don't support poor treatment of workers and fully support her employees standing up to her. But this is pretty gossipy and feels like people are just enjoying watching Ellen's image get damaged. This particular story is kind of nothing and just tacked on for the sake of drama."

Bodyguard,"What the fuck did I just read? Is there some sort of hit job on Ellen DeGeneres right now? The content of this Buzzfeed...article is that she had an assigned bodyguard for an awards show, and that this bodyguard is stating here that Ellen was sort of icy and/or aloof through their few interactions. Does this meet everyone's standards of thinking, ""wow, this person is incredibly shitty""? Are we just dumping on her now for the fun of it? Or does everyone truly beleive that celebrity talk show hosts must be an absolute delight to be around in all aspects of their life, and can never act crabby?"
Bodyguard,[deleted]
Bodyguard,Don’t we all know that Ellen is an absolutely awful human being by now?
Bodyguard,[deleted]
Bodyguard,"She didn’t say thank you. 

To quote Mad Men: “that’s what the money’s for.”"
Bodyguard,"So basically this guys complaint is that Ellen didn’t say ‘Hi’ or ‘thank you’ while he was working for her?

Are we being serious here? Thats it? That’s your big complaint?

Kinda seems like an attention grab."
Bodyguard,"Ellen farted in LA and I swear I smelled it here and it ruined my life. 

Reporters plz slide in the DMs!!"
Bodyguard,who cares
Bodyguard,"So some dude worked for her for one night and we're supposed to think oh she must be like that all the time?  Meanwhile this article stems from a fox news interview and they hate Ellen and the left, and gay people, so I'm sure they aren't trying to smear her in any way."
Bodyguard,So she acts differently in private than in public?  Wow!  Next you'll tell me that the cashier at Macy's is only offering me a credit card because it's her job and not because she cares that I save money on pants.
Bodyguard,"Read the article.. This isn't even portraying her as a shit person, this is typical buzzfeed hearsay fodder. Dude is saying he's butthurt because the person he's assigned to walk near at the Oscars six years ago didn't give him the time of day. He was assigned to her for the one evening,  this wasn't a long term gig where she's supposed to know his kid's birthday or some shit.  The Oscars are fucking busy, who cares if she's standoffish, you're not there to make friends.  
 
This doesn't excuse the way she's treating her staff recently, but buzzfeed is a waste of space."
Bodyguard,We’re going to need something more vicious than this people. She may be a bitch or bad boss but that’s not good enough to warrant this level of outcry.
Bodyguard,So a security guard does not get a hi from a celebrity and all of a sudden they are a terrible person and a fraud...
Bodyguard,"This has got to be the worst clickbait I’ve ever seen.
(Or best cuz it’s on Reddit news feed)"
Bodyguard,This kind of article just affirm me in my belief that Buzzfeed is utter garbage and a poor excuse for journalism.
Bodyguard,">... gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say, ‘Hello,’ or ‘Thank you for protecting my mother, my wife, and me.’

Seriously? The dude was being paid to do his fuckin job! Why would she go and say thank you for protecting me (plus the mother and the wife)? 

I don’t like Ellen, never did. But this? This is just a fuckin moron trying to cash-in on the current Ellen-hate bandwagon. This type of shit pisses me off."
Bodyguard,I sure am glad I have Reddit to tell me what to think!
Bodyguard,"Just because someone isn’t emotionally available all of the time it doesn’t make them bad person. Being friendly 100% of the time is a type of labor and can be exhausting for some people. People aren’t happy and ready to be friendly all the time I can imagine when your actions are constantly under a microscope in the entertainment business it can be exhausting.

However, the guardian article posted above about how her stage crew was treated seems pretty awful."
Bodyguard,"Why has Ellen been all over entertainment media lately? I’ve been seeing these headlines a lot over the past maybe two weeks, and all negative.. did something happen or come out that I missed?"
Bodyguard,"You mean to tell me, you didn't like your boss OMG!?!?!?!?!?!"
Bodyguard,Then I'm demeaning to most of the people I cross paths with.
Bodyguard,None of the guys fucked me during one night stands said hi and I am still alive and happy
Bodyguard,"All I see is people whose expectations of what Ellen should be like, met the reality of who she really is, and are crying like little whinny babies ""they didn't roll the red carpet for me, therefore she is evil"" 
Seriously? She isn't mother Theresa, but compared to the Whinesteins roaming around in Hollywood, she is a delight"
Bodyguard,Not a single person here knows her personally. Why does anyone care whether it’s true or not? So damn weird.
Bodyguard,Sincerely doubt a professional bodyguard is going to go gossip to the press because his client didn't say hello
Bodyguard,How the fuck has this man lived all these years after such thoughtless and tyrannical behavior?
Bodyguard,She. Ad. Didn’t. Ad. Photo. Like. Photo. Ad. Photo. Me.
Bodyguard,"I don't agree with how Ellen is treating her show staff during this pandemic if the claims are true.

But this accusation? It's literally just ""Ellen didn't say hi to me six years ago."" Like... I get you expected Ellen to be the TV Ellen, but come on. Maybe she just had a bad day.  Even if she didn't, just do your job for a few hours. Sorry there wasn't any Disney confetti. It's not something you need to hold onto for six fucking years.

Undercutting your union staff and essentially giving away their jobs while spouting feel good garbage is bullshit though."
Bodyguard,"I cannot fucking believe y’all upvoted an article of LITERALLY NOTHING. Just open the fucking article and read the 5 scorching quotes from a body guard who Ellen didn’t say Hi to. Reddit claims to be so much holier than thou when it comes to news, but y’all just pushed an article of 5 quotes on a buzzfeed article to the front page because you like the narrative."
Bodyguard,Don’t y’all think it’s weird all of a sudden this is news? She’s been in show business forever and she was protected for so long... and last few weeks was first time I’ve seen so many articles about how horribly she treats people. It’s like she crossed the devil after making a deal of some sort.
Bodyguard,Man Ellen really became the quarantine punching bag
Bodyguard,"The Ellen hate is getting annoying, honestly. She’s a charitable person who apparently, on occasion, isn’t always that nice. So what?! Who cares?! Let her keep giving money to people in need and maybe realize that humans (especially celebrities) are flawed and not the hero’s we make them out to be."
Bodyguard,"There's been some nasty things that have come out about Ellen.  From the picking on one employee every day or being an antisocial bitch.

But this article just states that she didn't really talk to the bodyguard... I understand how that's rude in a social setting but I don't know if this is worth the pitchforks.

She had done other things on live television that might be worth being mad about, not too sure about this one."
Bodyguard,"So is this just a *bash-Ellen-every-other-day* and *aren't-you-convinced-she's-terrible-now* sub? Seems like ""television"" is a broad enough topic to not be EW or Us gossip all the time. Or is that asking too much?"
Bodyguard,I see its once again that time to rip the pedestal from under a celebrity while we ignore our failings in judgement which putting them up there to begin with.
Bodyguard,Why should I believe them over Ellen? I don’t know any of these people.
Bodyguard,"I will never take a Buzzfeed article seriously. They call this journalism? TMZ has better journalism than they do, and I fucking hate TMZ!"
Bodyguard,"Look, I have my pitchfork ready, but this article is just about Ellen having a bad day."
Bodyguard,"""We worked a job together, and Ellen didn't say hi to me :(""

That is the article."
Bodyguard,"I watched the Infographics Shpw about bodyguards.

The bodyguard industry frowns upon people trying to befriend or be personable with the clients. The reason being you can go from being a bodyguard to a servant or their friend, which isnt your job.

This bodyguard obviously didnt listen."
Bodyguard,So I guess that Reddit's current trending hate boner is against Ellen?
Bodyguard,"Speaks volumes that 
1 the bodyguard happily took their money for so long and
2 this shit hasn't come out before about her sociopathic tendencies. Either he's blowing it up or people are scared of her current Oprah like status."
Bodyguard,"She didn’t say hello to him.. she couldn’t have had a lot on her mind, right? I mean hosting the oscars isn’t at all nerve-racking. I do open mic comedy and I can’t even do that without a drink or two in me."
Bodyguard,"Lying for money smh, classic. The Ellen haters propaganda team is out in full force. 

Yawn, who is the next celebrity Reddit brigade?"
Bodyguard,It's gonna take a lot for me to hate Ellen. This ain't it chief
Bodyguard,"I mean, maybe, seems like a hit piece to me. So she didn't say hi to her bodyguard. Sometimes you are tired. Sometimes you just want to get through the shit you are doing. Famous people can be assholes just like anyone else, that doesn't mean they are always assholes all the time."
Bodyguard,"OMG!!   she didn't say hi???   How demeaning!   If we didn't have enough evidence before,  this is the nail in the coffin!


I believe she is awful, but cmon, this article is ridiculous."
Bodyguard,Why the fuck do people give so many shits about whether a famousish American is mean or not?
Bodyguard,So her crime was she didn’t say hello?
Bodyguard,"Apparently Reddit hates celebrity worship but I've never seen a website obsess over celebrities more.

>It started going negatively when she introduced me to Ellen, and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and **didn’t even say, ‘Hello,**

Who gives a fuck? I don't even like Ellen, if I had to bet she's probably not a great person. But this is a total non-article and people getting worked up about it clearly just read the headline and are going after her so hard because they hate her work."
Bodyguard,Rich and famous. Fuck fame. Living under a magnifying glass has to suck. I've known a few in my past line of work and I got the impression that they just wanted to get really small and be invisible. But that doesn't keep the money coming in.
Bodyguard,Out of everything she is accused of doing to her staff this is extremely minor in comparison.
Bodyguard,"Out of all the stories, this one is just silly, dude seems like he just wants his 5 desperately any way he can get it."
Bodyguard,"I think Ellen was super wrong to hire scabs to film her show while leaving her real crew in the lurch, but this interview is stretching things to make her look bad.  Really, she is an awful person because she did not say hi to a bodyguard?  If she spit on that guy or insulted him or did not pay him, yeah that would be awful.  But being quiet and withdrawn around people you do not know does not make one an asshole."
Bodyguard,"In her stand-up she mentions how she's now the ""be kind to everyone"" lady, so if someone cuts her off in traffic or odd a dick to her, she basically has to be kind all the time."
Bodyguard,She’s probably a bitch. The problem is people who put her on a pedestal in the first place. One should know by now that public personas are meaningless.
Bodyguard,Jeez - all of those assumptions because she was cold toward security at a particular event? What if she was just having a bad day??
Bodyguard,"So if guess it's official, Ellen is reddit's new favorite woman to hate. In unrelated news, did y'all hear that Amy Schumer has a new cooking show on food network?"
Bodyguard,This is the second shit post about Ellen that I’ve seen in the last couple of weeks. I’m wondering why her asshollery is being shoved in our faces right now... A family friend who does accounting for the studios told me she was one of the worst humans in Hollywood back in the early 2000’s; it’s not like this is new info.
Bodyguard,bodyguard confirms inside sources that Ellen is indeed not funny at all
Bodyguard,"As an introvert, I wonder if people would think I was an asshole if I were a celebrity. I also would probably avoid eye contact and not talk to people. I can totally fake being gregarious and extroverted when I need to, but it gets exhausting. My normal, natural behaviour would be to turn inward and avoid interacting. It’s not because I don’t like other people or think I’m better than them, I just need a break. I don’t know if this applies to Ellen or not, but I wouldn’t be surprised if her natural personality is very different to her public persona."
Bodyguard,Look I'm not a fan of Ellen but all she did was not say hi to this dude😂
Bodyguard,Everyone is bored at home.  Time to try and cancel someone.  Fucking pathetic.
Bodyguard,"People have known that she's less than kind off of camera for years. 

Is the issue that her persona onscreen is fake? 

Are you not entertained?"
Bodyguard,"I don't really care for Ellen in any way, shape or form but I am interested in how she's going to manage damage control after this shitstorm."
Bodyguard,how do schlubs still watch or believe buzzfeed?
Bodyguard,She didn't say hi to him?
Bodyguard,"Damn, her chickens are really starting to come home to roost."
Bodyguard,Covid19 is the worst thing to happen to her and she never even got it.
Bodyguard,"So are we, The Internet, going to try and shame Ellen into being a good person?"
Bodyguard,Is Ellen really a bad person or did she piss off the wrong person in Hollywood?
Bodyguard,All these attacks just because she sat with Bush at a game?
Bodyguard,Good to see Buzzfeed has returned to its quality of old since firing its news staff a couple of years ago.
Bodyguard,We still in high school are we?!! Reddit gonna peer pressure me
Bodyguard,So he thinks it's demeaning for her not to say hi to him?
Bodyguard,"Seems like this is the 3rd thing I’ve seen or heard about her this week, and nothing before. She must have said or done something that somebody higher up didn’t like so now they are trying to get her canceled or make her look bad. This is such a petty story that has to be what’s going on."
Bodyguard,"Oh no Ellen is mean, this is going to make for a rough week hanging out with her, thanks for the heads up!"
Bodyguard,I get it though. I am a very outgoing person but some times I really don’t want to look another human in the eye. Especially if I’m feeling overwhelmed at a party.
Bodyguard,"Shit like this pisses me off, because I know this is only happening because she pissed the wrong person off, or stopped being valuable to an important enough person. Absolutely every single thing in Hollywood is political and this is no different. It's not like she suddenly started acting like this over night."
Bodyguard,Why is Reddit obsessed with Ellen?
Bodyguard,Seems like a campaign to ruin her
Bodyguard,The Elite trying to do her in... I wonder why?
Bodyguard,"Ellen being mean to people has been a story for years. Funny, most every story also mentions how nice Portia is."
Bodyguard,How come these stories only come out when its popular?
Bodyguard,We sure hate Ellen now
Bodyguard,"She's definitely got a mean streak in her,  you can pick up the hint of it in her interaction with guests. But this article is not a good example."
Bodyguard,Because she did not say hi to him. Lmfao. Ridiculous hit piece. I expected her actually treating him bad or saying something rude. She just didn't acknowledge him which is not really a big deal
Bodyguard,"**ahem**

WHO THE FUCK CARES?"
Bodyguard,"ok, so there's people saying Ellen is a terrible person to work with, and then there's this guy who says ""she didn't say Hi to me"".

seriously?"
Here to Heart,I want a Hacks/ Veep crossover with the meanest dialogue ever concocted.
Here to Heart,"Love this show, glad she is doing ok."
Here to Heart,She’s one of my favorite actors. Glad to see she’s recovered well. Can’t wait for season 3.
Here to Heart,I had no idea they were doing a season 3. Season 2 finale was written like they did not know if they were getting another round. They wrote off into the sunset from my perspective but excited for it to come back.
Here to Heart,Jean Smart is amazing! Glad to read this
Here to Heart,I’m kind of surprised that they are doing a season three because season two’s ending was absolutely perfect. I’m in though. I love the show.
Here to Heart,"Just looking at this picture, I gotta say, Jean Smart has aged well."
Here to Heart,"I first remember seeing and falling in love with Jean in Designing Women. Then I started seeing her in other shows like Frazier, 24 & Fargo. Then one of the first movies I remember was Audrey’s Rain that her real life husband Richard Gilliland co-starred with her. She was in Sweet Home Alabama and other TV Shows & Movies too! ♥️"
Here to Heart,Love Jean! Glad she’s doing better
Here to Heart,Oh fuck!!!! I assumed we wouldn’t get a season 3. I love this show so much
Here to Heart,"Shows got heart 

fr tho , pun aside"
Here to Heart,She was great in that show. I didn’t like the writer girl though. She was so not funny that I’m surprised she didnt get a Netflix show. Seems like every not funny woman comic has one.
Here to Heart,"loved season 1, season 2 was a lot less funny imo."
Here to Heart,"I would watch a show about Jean Smart brushing her teeth for an hour every week, but I really don't like Hacks much.  It feels like they just took a bunch of fun actors and were like ""We've got a bland story here, please don't add anything to it."""
Here to Heart,Who?
Here to Heart,Jean Smart has to be one of the greatest character actors of her time.  Her range is impressive and what she brings to life is something palpable.  Love to see how she can hold her own in a scene and make her mark.
Here to Heart,"Jean Smart in everything please

I wanna see a Jean Smart/Jennifer Coolidge show"
Here to Heart,"I like Hacks quite a lot but it is totally different to Veep. Sure, Hacks has some vicious insults, but Veep’s heartlessness was on a whole different level. Hacks is ultimately a far kinder show than Veep. It’s not exactly Ted Lasso level schmaltz or anything but it definitely ain’t Veep."
Here to Heart,"Yeah, she's amazing. She also lost her husband while shooting the first season so she's had a rough few years."
Here to Heart,"Man, ""wrote off into the sunset"" almost works here..."
Here to Heart,"I would have been content if it ended with S2, but I’m glad we will (hopefully) see the two women come back to each other. The breakup between the two was tough love that they both needed at those different points in their career which will make the reuniting that much better."
Here to Heart,IIRC they did not know if they were getting a season 3. It was not renewed until months after S2 was released.
Here to Heart,Have you watched the show?  She's a goddamn babe.
Here to Heart,"season 2 felt much more sinister with the like abusive relationships taking a much more center stage

Maybe it's just that season1 was a funnier take on abusive relationships. It makes me wonder what season 3 will feel like cause I think it will be a difficult balance

One of the best shows currently running though so exicted to see what's next"
Here to Heart,One thing Hacks and Mrs Maisel taught me is that it’s incredibly hard to write standup comedy. The jokes are just so freaking terrible and it really ruins the illusion.
Here to Heart,"I watched a few episodes and it was funny enough, but I refuse to get into any more shows about being a stand up comedian, it's a played out plot at this point."
Here to Heart,How dare you
Here to Heart,Featuring Christopher McDonald
Here to Heart,"Cool. Didn’t really investigate the idea too deeply, but I’m glad someone did their due diligence."
Here to Heart,That’s too bad to hear. She’s such a champion.
Here to Heart,I realized it was wrong but i left it because it kinda works.
Here to Heart,"I feel the same. 

The finale was so satisfying that I would be ok without a third but I still *want* a third season."
Here to Heart,"I seem to remember the three producers said in one of the extras featurettes during S2 mention they have a four season arch. Alas, I canceled HBO for the time being and can’t check to confirm."
Here to Heart,Her sex scene with Devon Sawa is super hot lol
Here to Heart,i hope they get back to Vegas.
Here to Heart,"it wasn't that, i kinda expected a dropoff, it was the story lines in season 2, i couldn't get into it, it was all about gay relationships, and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

season 1 was just funny, season 2 i feel they were trying drama, and it didn't work for me.

i still like the premise though."
Here to Heart,I have a similar rule about novels about academics.  E-fucking-nough.
Here to Heart,With the theme by Michael McDonald.
Here to Heart,"She actually filmed the scene where she shows up at the funeral of Ava's dad about a week after Richard Gilliand passed. She absolutely deserved that Emmy, you could feel Jean's whole heart in that monologue in front of the mourners."
Here to Heart,holy fuck that was Devon Sawa?!
Here to Heart,">and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

You're not okay with that."
Here to Heart,Why aren’t you going to watch something with a gay relationship?
Here to Heart,"> it was all about gay relationships, and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

grow up dude"
Here to Heart,Right??!?!??
Here to Heart,"Yea, homophobic much??!?!?!"
Here to Heart,sure.
Here to Heart,Because hes obviously a hateful homophobic trumper! Duh what else could it be?
Here to Heart,why do you care?
Here to Heart,"Yea fr fr, no cap. Only the most grown up, mature people find every show relatable and watchable, regardless of the characters and their stories. They like anything and everything, and everyone. Its lame and immature if you dont."
Here to Heart,no
Here to Heart,I dunno. That’s why I asked.
Here to Heart,Just wondering since you decided to share on a public forum. Curious.
Here to Heart,"We assume the worst in everyone here, where have you been?"
Here to Heart,"a forum about tv shows, and i critizied a story line."
Here to Heart,You’re doing a lot. It’s starting to feel like projection.
Here to Heart,"Whoaa, is it?? Are you a mind Doctor or something?"
Here to Heart,iTs ReDdIt. Im AsSuMiNg ThE wOrSt 🤪🤪
Here to Heart,"What you are doing is fighting the good fight fellow redditor, keep homophones out of our subs"
Here to Heart,Wish her well! Love the show and everything I've seen Jean in.
Here to Heart,Jean Smart can do no wrong. I've been rewatching old episodes of Designing Women. Even in the trappings of a dated (and occasionally cringe) sitcom she's still a joy to watch.
Here to Heart,"""Put your doctor on the phone, put your doctor on the phone...PUT YOUR DOCTOR ON THE PHONE""

Wishing Jean Smart a speedy recovery. Her recent run has been inspired. Hacks is great."
Here to Heart,This is surprising. The way season two ended I thought that was it. They wrapped it all up nicely I thought.
Here to Heart,I had no idea Season 3 was in production!
Here to Heart,"I’m so glad that she’s recovering well.  We need to keep her around another 30 years or so.

Jean Smart is a national treasure."
Here to Heart,Jean Smart is a national treasure. Mend well.
Here to Heart,Get well soon Jean.  Hacks is great!
Here to Heart,Get well soon Ms. Smart. She’s awesome.
Here to Heart,"I like Smart, she's quite a charismatic screen presence. But I find Hacks to be quite bizarrely very overrated. Although, that might have something more to do with her insufferable partner in the series."
Here to Heart,"Gotta get that ticker in tip top shape to play Andy Samberg's love interest in their new movie together, makes sense to me. Here's to a speedy and healthy recovery!"
Here to Heart,"Man, season 2 was even better than the first. She was fantastic in it."
Here to Heart,"Enjoy the show, but the young writer character still doesn't make sense to me."
Here to Heart,">Jean Smart can do no wrong.

Jean Dumb, OTOH, is constantly fucking up."
Here to Heart,"She was so freaking good on Frasier, well anything she does really.  That scene alone is what earned her that Emmy. So funny. Shame there's no decent clip of it on youtube."
Here to Heart,Definitely heard this in her voice.
Here to Heart,I still laugh at that last line from the season. “Of course you will see me again… You’ll see me in court!”
Here to Heart,"I figured this would be the one show to survive the HBO Max purge, since it’s so highly acclaimed."
Here to Heart,It would have been a good ending story-wise but I would have been personally gutted as a fan lol
Here to Heart,I even thought i saw it was cancelled
Here to Heart,I feel like it was written as a potential series finale.
Here to Heart,This is so stupid why did I laugh
Here to Heart,"Except that wasn’t the last line, it ended with Ava finding out Deborah had dropped the lawsuit."
Here to Heart,And much cheaper than something like raised by wolves
Here to Heart,"HBO apparently asked Jesse Armstrong for more Succession, but he decided to end it at season 4."
Here to Heart,That's the sign of a great ending. Wraps a story and leaves us wanting more
Here to Heart,Because you’re Jean Easily-Amused.
Here to Heart,"I think Succession is a true HBO show, not an HBO Max title."
Here to Heart,"It's become a cliche on the BCS subreddit, but had this happened, swapping him for Kevin Costner in the last episodes would've been a hilarious joke that Bob himself would likely appreciate.

That said, he's irreplaceable, a rare shining gem of a human being. Recently also delivered one of the great comic performances of all time on I Think You Should Leave."
Here to Heart,"Odenkirk:

>“It was a scary day for everybody there. I really went down, I really turned gray. It really seemed over.”  
  

>“They would have just stopped the show if I wasn’t capable of doing it. They wouldn’t have tried to go on, which makes me feel bad! If that’d happened, I would have liked it if they got some actor to play him. Just to tell the story that they had written.”  

  
>“It wouldn’t have been great but it would have been better than nothing.”"
Here to Heart,I am very thrilled that Bob made a speedy recovery and was able to wrap up the show. I believe that Better Call Saul is the best show I’ve seen and I don’t know when there will be another show to have the same impact on me.
Here to Heart,"Suffers a major heart attack and is likely to be doing Nobody 2 next year, dude is a legend"
Here to Heart,"First things first...so glad he pulled through and is ok now. Secondly, that would have been way too jarring as some roles just cannot be recast. Bob IS Saul/Jimmy just like Cranston is Walter White. Too iconic to recast. Legendary performance nonetheless and can't wait for a full Breaking Bad universe rewatch down the line."
Here to Heart,[deleted]
Here to Heart,"I can't imagine having to recast an iconic, decade+ long character right at the climax of his narrative arc

I don't know how you could possibly avoid a disaster. I understand why you'd try, but that sounds fucking impossible."
Here to Heart,Could have replaced him with Kevin Costner
Here to Heart,You can’t replace the main character of a hit tv show and expect it to work out. That would be like replacing Henry Cavill in The Witcher. Who in their right mind would make that decision. Unthinkable!
Here to Heart,Steve Carrell.
Here to Heart,Like he said himself “It wouldn’t have been great but it would have been better than nothing.” and I'm surprised how many people in this thread would have rather had nothing. Everyone against the idea would rather have the story unfinished than to have a recast for the sole purpose of finishing the season? It's not like they would have kept the show running for years and seasons onwards.
Here to Heart,"Look I know it’s mostly just a puff piece and all, but a lot of actors are far too petty to say something like this. Bob’s a decent guy"
Here to Heart,"As good hearted as this is, I don’t think I would’ve watched if Bob passed away. He literally is Saul Goodman. No one else could play the role as well as he did."
Here to Heart,"What a nice guy, he'd feel bad for dying because he'd ruin the Show!"
Wild District,"I like the lead actor, so I'll check this out. He was badass in Narcos and Six."
Wild District,this was the greatest thing i've ever read and i legit finished infinite jest and am not pretentious and am a very reliable narrator.
Wild District,r/mentalhealth
Wild District,I enjoyed this rollercoaster very much!
Wild District,"Yeah, and Elon Musk fails to capitalize on my idea of making me a billionaire, but we can’t all have what we want."
Wild District,Wow. That is definitely something.
Wild District,">Corky watches a news report eviscerating him (and of course calling him the R Word). 

Republican.."
Wild District,That escalated quickly!
Wanderlust,Toni Collette’s stirring emotional journey makes 'Hereditary' a must-watch
Wanderlust,"Really interesting, thought-provoking show. The acting is amazing. Toni Collette blew me away and the rest of the characters were very sympathetic. I can recommend it"
Wanderlust,"The show's description reminds me a bit of Swingtown. ;)

I wish it was still running. Sadly, they canceled it.
"
Wanderlust,She having such a great year. Hereditary is definitely her tour de force performance. I’ll be really piss id she is snubbed of an Oscar nomination even though it will probably happen
Wanderlust,Also true
Wanderlust,I couldn't deal with a dark house for days after watching that. It was awesome. 
Wanderlust,Hereditary was just an even shittier version of the witch. 
Wanderlust,The fifth episode is definitely her Emmy tape. Such a good bottle episode
Wanderlust,"I'm really liking it. It's not perfect — no show is; it's a big reason why I love TV — but it's different, it tries shit, all while having a real sense of fun and some great writing.

I feel like the landscape of new and current TV over the past several months hasn't been good, and *Wanderlust* feels refreshing."
Wanderlust,"the tone is quite different, but i'm with you - man, i really dug **swingtown** and wish it had been given more seasons!"
Wanderlust,It’s such a stacked year so I’m sadly bracing myself for it.
Wanderlust,"You think.. it deserves an oscar? An average film ? Like I get she is a great actress, but come on. Also Tour de Force? Have you not seen any other Toni films?"
Wanderlust,I don't see the similarity between the two.
Wanderlust,reminded me of in treatment
Wanderlust,That episode didn't totally work for me tbh. I love that they did it though.
Wanderlust,"Between this and The Detectorists, I'm really impressed with the quality programming on BBC"
Wanderlust,Yeah I’m not gonna brace for it even though I know it will happen. I’m probably gonna be “she was robbed” when her name isn’t announced in the nominations lmao
Wanderlust,It has quite a lot of praise for its technique. A little awareness goes a long way. 
Wanderlust,"I think hereditary was great movie. Yeah the movie has flaws but it was a directorial debut so I’ll give that a pass. I’ve seen her other performances too she great in all of them, but I truly think this is her careers best. I’m not the only one who think this btw every critics has praised her performance. I’m not the only one that has this kind of opinion "
Wanderlust,People are only comparing the two because they both were produced by A24. Both movies are great in their own unique way but they are not similar at all so people should really stop comparing these two 
Wanderlust,What technique? Having a terrible ending and being mediocrely reviewed with mediocre ticket sales?
Wanderlust,lool
Wanderlust,It made 79 million dollars from a budget of 10 million dollars it’s one of A24 most financially successful movies. How about you stop bashing the movie. You might not like th story but it was a huge financial success for an indie horror movie
Wanderlust,"Indie? Dude.. it was released in  2,964 theatres. You're delusional."
Wanderlust,"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. immediately comes to mind:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Brisco_County%2C_Jr."
Wanderlust,"I can rewatch Happy Endings and Cougar Town all the time and they never get old. Even though they both have their own sub set of cult followings, neither one really have the popularity that comedies like The Office or Friends do. They absolutely deserve to, though. They are two of the funniest shows ever to me!"
Wanderlust,"i could watch psych forever and ever because i watched it so much growing up and have such strong memories of watching it with my family. it definitely has a following but i wouldn’t say it’s as strong as the office or GOT. 

also love starstruck and love life on hbo! i cannot believe those aren’t more popular"
Wanderlust,Joe Pera Talks with You. Adult Swim live action show that is incredibly meaningful and wholesome.
Wanderlust,"Bee and Puppycat, Gravity Falls, Flight of the Concords, Peep Show, The Dark Crystal, Series of Unfortunate Events, Who’s line is it anyway, Norsemen, Mr. Show. There are more, I am sure."
Wanderlust,Party Down
Wanderlust,"Nirvanna the band the show.

Seriously funny canadian comedy."
Wanderlust,"Daredevil s1, it has a following for sure but ever since Disney+ became a thing people don't talk about the Netflix Marvel shows as much"
Wanderlust,"*Burns & Allen*, *Blake's 7* & *Duchess of Duke Street*"
Wanderlust,"Joe Pera talks with you, How to with John Wilson, Review with Forrest MacNeil. 

Surrealist humour the former two which are both wholesome and each ep works standalone."
Wanderlust,Mythic Quest is great and season 3 starts this week.
Wanderlust,Slings and Arrows
Wanderlust,Man Seeking Woman
Wanderlust,"Xena Warrior Princess

Z Nation (the first 3 seasons at least)

Ash vs The Evil Dead"
Wanderlust,Justified
Wanderlust,I've probably rewatched Derry girls like seven or eight times
Wanderlust,Patriot. It’s so good.
Wanderlust,"I don't know how popular this show is in the UK, but as a US citizen with a Netflix account I can re-watch ""Flowers"" season 1 (especially) over and over again. I've yet to get sick of it.

Oh and despite its lack of a fourth and final season, of which I am still butt-hurt about, I have watched Seasons 1-3 of ""Glow"" a whole bunch and am not at all sick of it. Love that show."
Wanderlust,"Dead Still

Ripper Street

Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"
Wanderlust,"Deadwood (undisputed best show ever). 
GoT   
Office. 
  
The first 2, I see something or understand something new each time."
Wanderlust,Peep Show & IT Crowd! And Inbetweeners! Wish they were more popular in the US. I've been trying for years to get my friends to watch them
Wanderlust,"Honestly I love female-led comedies like Miranda, Keeping Up Appearances, Broad City, The Comeback, Kath & Kim (for any Aussies out there!). 

Also it’s still very popular but The Golden Girls is one of the best sitcoms of all time and deserves more love from audiences today. So witty and brilliantly acted."
Wanderlust,House MD.
Wanderlust,"I've rewatched Andor at least 3 times so far, if that counts."
Wanderlust,"The Walking Dead (esp the later seasons)

Two and a Half Men

Friends"
Wanderlust,"1980s Britcom ""Colin's Sandwich,"" with the late Mel Smith. Colin is an over-thinking, over-stressed British Rail employee who wants to be a horror writer. 

Actually no idea how popular it was in the UK, but it only had 12 episodes in two series and got only a tiny airing in the US."
Wanderlust,Broadchurch and Pushing Daisies
Wanderlust,ive watched Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous at least three or four times now.
Wanderlust,Bored to Death
Wanderlust,"The Deuce, just an absolutely amazing show about prostitution and the start of porn in New York 

City on a Hill, a show that kinda tried to be The Wire but mostly failed.  However, Kevin Bacon's performance as Jackie Rohr is some of the best acting I've seen on TV"
Wanderlust,"The late, lamented (by me, anyway) Reprisal. The universe it creates is so weird and unique and rich, and I'm so sad we'll never get to see any more of it beyond that one season (particularly given that, toward the end, it seemed to be hinting at some vaguely Lovecraftian goings-on in the wider world of the show)."
Wanderlust,I'm Sorry with Andrea Savage is one of those shows I can watch over and over again. Unfortunately the third season got cancelled due to COVID.
Wanderlust,Mission Hill and Undergrads
Wanderlust,"Blood Drive 

Z Nation

Ash vs Evil Dead"
Wanderlust,"Some older shows like news radio,  Pretender and star gate."
Wanderlust,"Venture Bros easy winner!


Garth Merengie’s Darkplace is second."
Wanderlust,Wanderlust. Great show.
Wanderlust,That’s crazy Masters of none and love are my two favorite shows haha
Wanderlust,"I haven't had cable in forever so I missed out on stuff like Psych and Suits, both of which seem to have a big following. I did watch most of Animal Kingdom on TBS but haven't done a rewatch yet. Thanks!"
Wanderlust,How many more jokes and references do you catch now that you didn’t as a kid?
Wanderlust,Psych is great.  So glad they do movies still from time to time.
Wanderlust,I'll have to check it out. Thanks! Is it with Olivia Coleman?  She's great.
Wanderlust,"> I can re-watch ""Flowers"" season 1 (especially) over and over again. I've yet to get sick of it.

you ok there fam?"
Wanderlust,"I love Deadwood, and I should watch it again. GOT and the Office are two of my favorites also but I'd put them in the hugely popular category."
Wanderlust,Love Kath & Kim! Sharon is my spirit animal
Wanderlust,"Kath & Kim is so good, one of my favorites!"
Wanderlust,"I forgot to list Broad City! Love that show. Admittedly, I haven't seen too many female-led comedies, but Broad City and The Mindy Project are a few that we've really enjoyed. Thanks, I'll have to check the others out."
Wanderlust,I enjoy hitting random and guessing the illness.
Wanderlust,All three hugely popular shows during their runs and in syndication.
Wanderlust,I watched Psych on Netflix growing up
Wanderlust,great point! i guess that’s part of why i liked watching it as i grew up—the references made more sense and added so much more to the show
Wanderlust,"Hope you enjoy it! It's a dark comedy and as I said to someone else just now, it's sad at times and funny at times. But I like that kind of realism in my shows or movies more and more. It feels more like life."
Wanderlust,"Yes, thanks. It's a beautiful show which is funny at times and sad at times and I think dark comedies, when done real well like that, are the perfect kind of realism in art.

So, I don't understand the concern there."
Wanderlust,I miss the requirement for cult following. I still think Deadwood is probably cultish
Wanderlust,"Yeah exactly, isn’t that what you wanted? Why are you being a jerk and downvoting me?"
Wanderlust,"I actually upvoted you. The question was about shows that are not hugely popular, to which you answered three of the most popular shows of all time. Thanks for commenting."
Wanderlust,"I disagree. All 3 of those shows are very unpopular on this site, as evidenced by the multiple downvotes I’ve received"
Wanderlust,"Ok, maybe I should have phrased the question differently. But I bet you were down voted because the question was asking about shows that are not popular and you answered TWD, Two and a Half Men and Friends. 

Doesn't matter if r/television doesn't like those shows, they are still very popular.

Edit don't be angry with me, I like meatballs too (I'm assuming you do)"
Wanderlust,Your comments getting down voted and shows being popular/unpopular are not correlated.
Wanderlust,This show is awesome.  Toni Collette deserves a major award.   Episode 5 is a doozy.  Absolutely love this show.
Wanderlust,"It's actually fantastic, but it's also not for everyone. For people who have been in a really long term live-in together relationships or married, they can relate to this more. 

>


Funny thing is, if the main characters were Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake.. experiencing all the sexual stuffs and everything.. then this show would have gotten more recognition and views, especially the casuals would have loved it. I mean, it is what it is.. 

>

Overall, this is a great show, and not that serious. Just chill, fun, and relatable for countless people. "
Wanderlust,"Have one issue with the show: I'm not sure how many times people were able to produce full sentences, but I think it's countable on two hands."
Wanderlust,oh i just watched this recently for toni collette and zawe ashton. episode 5 is quite interesting and different from the rest of the series
Wanderlust,"Just watched the first episode, pretty great imo. Great acting, more Toni Collette is always good"
Wanderlust,"(SPOILERS)
So from this series I take it that the dwindling sex lives in couples can be a result of mental issues in the partner(s)?
I was curious to see if the series actually was proposing the daring implementation of third person sex lives as a solution vs the implementation as just something to do to later be monogamous again. 
But then there's the issue that Joy was having which dealt with grief/remorse and wanting to feel thanks to her dad, so I'm not sure if the series is about having other people to have sex with in relationships that have lasted so long or just having to deal with mental issues.
I liked it tbh"
Wanderlust,Couldn’t really get into it
Wanderlust,It was great! It felt very relatable. I love how the show makes viewers think about themselves and their own roots to their current issues and habits.
Wanderlust,"I think the lack of finished sentences spoke VOLUMES about how scared people are of speaking the truth, confessing their emotions, and it comes out in nervous habits like foot tapping or nail biting, or hand rubbing. "
Wanderlust,I second this. I think the lack of clarity was on purpose.
Wanderlust,But I am watching it!
Wanderlust,"My husband and I finished it last night. I have been with my husband since 1999, married for 16 of those years. I found it relatable in many ways. "
Wanderlust,"Lots of ups and downs from episode to episode and keeps you hooked.  It was pretty decent, wouldn’t say it was my fav but good.  "
Wanderlust,"I adore Collette, but it seems like an emotional ride, and I don't know if I'm ready to put myself through that. "
Wanderlust,What does everyone make of the season 1 finale? The last scene?
Wanderlust,What's the best Netflix drama I *am* watching? That Joel McHale show that got cancelled? 
Wanderlust,Is it ? I started it for a bit but didn’t have time to fully pay attention to it 
Accidentally in Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Accidentally in Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Accidentally in Love,People are so stupid.
Accidentally in Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Accidentally in Love,Good. What a POS.
Accidentally in Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Accidentally in Love,What a gross thing to do.
Accidentally in Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Accidentally in Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Accidentally in Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Accidentally in Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Accidentally in Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
Accidentally in Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Accidentally in Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Accidentally in Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Accidentally in Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Accidentally in Love,Good. Fucking loser
Accidentally in Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Accidentally in Love,Who and who?
Accidentally in Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Accidentally in Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
Accidentally in Love,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Accidentally in Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Accidentally in Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Accidentally in Love,Never heard of him.
Accidentally in Love,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Accidentally in Love,As he should. If not more…
Accidentally in Love,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
Accidentally in Love,[removed]
Accidentally in Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
Accidentally in Love,Nasty bastard
Accidentally in Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Accidentally in Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Accidentally in Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Accidentally in Love,Link?
Accidentally in Love,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Accidentally in Love,Lame.
Accidentally in Love,Remindme! 2 hours
Accidentally in Love,20000 channels here
Accidentally in Love,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Accidentally in Love,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Accidentally in Love,*Sigh*
Accidentally in Love,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Accidentally in Love,See ya
Accidentally in Love,Loozah!
Accidentally in Love,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can’t help themselves.
Accidentally in Love,Good
Accidentally in Love,"Surely that should be ‘celebrity’ Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Accidentally in Love,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Accidentally in Love,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Accidentally in Love,What a douche.
Accidentally in Love,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Accidentally in Love,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Accidentally in Love,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
Accidentally in Love,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Accidentally in Love,Picture checks out
Accidentally in Love,Disgusteng
Accidentally in Love,Neck tattoos…
Accidentally in Love,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Accidentally in Love,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a “celebrity?”
Accidentally in Love,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Accidentally in Love,Both of them are a waste of space
Accidentally in Love,And he published non-consensual photos and videos with his ex. So well deserved!
Accidentally in Love,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Accidentally in Love,"“I’m terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me”"
Accidentally in Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Accidentally in Love,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Accidentally in Love,He’s probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Accidentally in Love,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn’t already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Accidentally in Love,How do you know it was rented
Accidentally in Love,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I’m sure you’ll find your answer
Accidentally in Love,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Accidentally in Love,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Accidentally in Love,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Accidentally in Love,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so…"
Accidentally in Love,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Accidentally in Love,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Accidentally in Love,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Accidentally in Love,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Accidentally in Love,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Accidentally in Love,Which beckons the question why we’re giving them more publicity
Accidentally in Love,He’ll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Accidentally in Love,Holy shit that guy is huge
Accidentally in Love,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Accidentally in Love,The narcissistic wound in public format
Accidentally in Love,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Accidentally in Love,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt’s Creek.

“Eeew, David.”"
Accidentally in Love,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Accidentally in Love,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Accidentally in Love,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Accidentally in Love,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Accidentally in Love,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‘social media’ that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‘all in a house’ only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‘a career in being famous’ and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‘just in a house’ and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‘washed up’, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‘famous’.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They’re already ‘scene’ if they’re hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something’s who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That’s the point that it became clear ‘the kids’ make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Accidentally in Love,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Accidentally in Love,"Hilariously, I’m pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren’t becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there’s no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Accidentally in Love,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Accidentally in Love,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Accidentally in Love,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Accidentally in Love,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can’t be more masculine than that!"
Accidentally in Love,I can't find it
Accidentally in Love,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
Haunted,"You can say it's extremely outdated and cheesy because well, it is,

but something about those disembodied heads floating around in the background as Carly Beth tries to unlock the door fast enough always gets me to this day."
Haunted,"Love goosebumps the best memories reading them and watching the show, I still throw them on in the background now for noise while tinkering.
 
I didn't realize this as a kid but there's a ton of times that the actors' Canadian accents drop because the show was filmed in Canada. Also Ryan gosling was in the say cheese and die episode"
Haunted,"They used to play this every year around Halloween at school, and it scared the shit out of me. The idea of a mask stuck on your face and increasingly bonding itself to your skin is scary even now"
Haunted,This and werewolf of fever swap. Watched those vhs on a loop.
Haunted,"Nothing will ever be as ICONIC as...

Carly Beth's duck walk."
Haunted,Disney is making a new series. I have low hopes of it being as good as the original. Especially with the details given.
Haunted,This is the exact one that has always stuck with me. Just absolutely terrifying as a kid.
Haunted,ERMAGHERD GERSBERMS!
Haunted,"I host a weekly podcast about growing up in the 90s, and we had a TON of fun talking about goosebumps, and this episode in particular:

https://generations.buzzsprout.com/2024899/11432565-goosebumps"
Haunted,"During the intro as a kid I would close my eyes and plug my ears when the dogs eyes would turn yellow and woof to the tune of the song.  

The show was no problem for me but that part of the intro fucked me all the way up"
Haunted,"I’m so glad you said that lol, I feel the same way. They scared the shit out of me as a kid, and they scare the shit out of me as a grown man."
Haunted,Werewolf of fever swamp was terrifying
Haunted,"Loved Goosebumps as a kid the books and the show, none of them really scared me but that episode had me scared for months lol"
Haunted,As a kid I noticed that they freeze framed the dog during that shot. You can see someone in the background walking who just freezes in place.
Haunted,"When I was a kid I would rent the vhs taped from blockbuster, they'd have 2 episodes on one VHS but the credits would still after the first but before the 2nd episode started.

It would scare me hearing the music come on and seeing the green ooze slide down the screen because my older siblings told me if you wait till the ooze reaches the bottom of the screen, slappy jump scares you so I always closed my eyes at the end credits.


Also I thought the model on the billboard that morphs was Michael Jackson for some reason"
Haunted,"I have a picture of the dog’s head photoshopped on a rapper’s body of him recording his verse in the studio.

It is my favorite pic and I would love to share it, but I have no link!!!"
Haunted,I love weird childhood memories.
Haunted,"Love both of these so much. Their chemistry was off the charts in Bly Manor, funny to think about how it was gonna be a straight couple originally with Oliver Jackson Cohen playing the gardener. The show doesn’t get enough love. 

Genuine romance stories in genre settings in general need to be done more."
Haunted,Who really finds being gay or lesbian strange anymore?
Haunted,The Last of Us really managed to pack an emotional gut punch into that episode.
Haunted,I just wish it had a graphic docking scene
Haunted,Finally a tv show with a gay couple
Haunted,There’s a The Last of Us tv show?
Haunted,Outside the western world? Billions of people unfortunately....
Haunted,Literally billions of people across the planet.
Haunted,_gestures broadly_
Haunted,"Sadly, the majority of people on earth. In the west it’s still more divisive than it should be. In many other places it’s not even up for debate; gay equals bad."
Haunted,"my mum, she pulled a very grossed out face when i told her what this episode was about"
Haunted,Out of the western bubble which around 7 Billion people
Haunted,"Lots and lots of people, sadly."
Haunted,"Come on, man. This can’t be a real question."
Haunted,"Idk, ask the 25% of people who rated the last episode a 1 on IMDb."
Haunted,"Like 40% of American voters for one.

Haunted,"I tried to watch ep 3 with my neighbor and he refused to watch ""zombie brokeback mountain"" and made me skip most of the episode because it bothered him that much. I had already seen it so I just sat there and just made fun of him for it.

 Lol"
Haunted,"Do you see the news in the U.S?

Many people unfortunately. Same in the rest of the world.."
Haunted,Unfortunately a massive % of the population of the US.
Haunted,About 35% of Americans and billions elsewhere.
Haunted,"Sadly, about 98% of the Neanderthals I work with in the warehouse.

Absolutely disgusting, the shit I gotta hear said sometimes. I got one coworker who still believes there are litter boxes for Furries in High Schools and believes being gay is just some disgusting choice sexual deviants choose to engage in.  Oh yes, every gradeschool teacher that's not a straight white person is ""Doing CRT to groom the kids to become gays!""--I wish this were a made up quote......

2 of them were stunlocked by the revelation that I am 1/2 Jewish.  Like, they're fused to believe it.

The Midwest is still a dumpsterfire outside of major population centers.....and even some of those are not great."
Haunted,"I'm a 53 yr old cis male, and I've never cried that much during a tv show. It was beautiful."
Haunted,We had that in Episode 2
Haunted,"Yes, 'Muppet's The Last of Us', starring Kermit as Joel, Miss Piggy as Tess and Mandy Patinkin as Ellie."
Haunted,"Yes, on HBO. Three episodes in so far"
Haunted,Have you been trapped under a rock or in a coma?
Haunted,Unfortunately I think you're giving the western world a little too much credit too.
Haunted,"My mom is the same, but she watched the episode and cried and said it was her favorite so far. I didn’t really push her on anything and I hope maybe in her mind she’s slowly becoming more accepting."
Haunted,"Your mum is gross :(





I meant her views make her gross, in case that isn't clear lol"
Haunted,IMDb has been review bombed so much user ratings are meaningless

Haunted,It’s why these stories are important.
Haunted,Sad sad people
Haunted,"100%, absolutely. Unfortunately, it's also important to do them *well*, and that's not easy. Because they have important work to do, and because they have that squick factor to overcome, it's both more difficult to get right and more important that they get it right.

Makes episodes like this one really special though!"
Haunted,"Some Examples of the Complaints from Disney:

>Disney’s S&P department asked Hirsch to revise phrases like “chub pup” and “poopface” in the kids show. “Please revise ‘poopface’ as it comes across as a replacement for ‘shitface,'” one email read.


>Another added “chub” has a “sexual connotation,” while another edit said: “It has come to our attention that ‘hoo-ha’ is a slang term for vagina. Please revise.”


>Hirsch replied that a t-shirt with the phrase “chub pup” on it has no sexual connotation whatsoever to male genitalia. “This is silly, It’s an image of a fat dog.”

>Things got even more tangled with dialogue that could be inferred to have religious ties, including a character using “jeez” out of exasperation. Disney S&P argued it was an “abbreviation for Jesus.” Executives even debated if a quote had ties to a “furry fetish” when adults dress up like animals and animated characters for sexual purposes.

Hirsch says Disney sent over 3,000 email complaints over the course of 39 episodes:

>”If I had a nickel for every S&P E-mail I’ve saved I would have 3,000 nickels. It’s a lot of nickels.”"
Haunted,"“Not S&P Approved” Approved by S&P. 

That one got me."
Haunted,"I remember we have these statewide championships in Texas for everything academic (UIL) and the team from our high school for drama competition was disqualified because one of the performers ad libbed ""Jeez"" during their one act play and the judge said it was taking God's name in vain. This happened in 1984."
Haunted,"There's a gag early in season 2 where dipper finds one of Gruncle Stan's magazines - Fully Clothed Women Weekly. I could practically hear Hirsh ranting as he wrote that. ""TELL ME there's a problem with this, go on, TELL ME fully clothed women are too sexual!"""
Haunted,"Disney pressuring Hirsch to cut gay content, then patting itself on the back about inclusion."
Haunted,"The weird part is that S&P successfully get him to remove a “spin the bottle” reference in season 1 - even though it was just a written reference on a party flier; yet in season 2, he literally had inter dimensional demons playing “spin the bottle” with petrified humans … and that was okay? 😄"
Haunted,"Why do they refer to Hirsch as the creator of *Inside Job*? He was involved with the production, but Shion Takeuchi is the brain behind it."
Haunted,The rule of thumb with S&P is: Make it 3 times worse and re-submit it. South Park went from Cartman’s mom giving a blowjob for 15 seconds to 3 minutes of Cartman’s mom fucking a horse. But they got away with it because they didn’t show it
Haunted,"I was reading a book about Batman: The Animated Series that had a section about the things Warner Bros (I think) made them take out. One was:

""It'll break Bruce's* heart, but Penguin's joke about 'picking up all the soap' in prison has to be cut.""

Haunted,"Still wish Alex and the VAs would do some kind of continuation through a podcast format which I think would work well, something more mature in content. But I also figure Disney is probably the obstacle of that personal wish of mine."
Haunted,Honestly after seeing how the company got away with murdering owl house for two girls kissing (among other themes that didn’t “fit the brand” like non normative characters) Im surprised Disney didn’t shred gravity falls to the bone to like 3 episodes about the correct way to brush one’s teeth or some boring “on brand” plot to appease the demographic from like 1950s that Disney holds onto
Haunted,I wonder how much convincing it took to get Bill to be able to say “I’ve got some kids i need to turn into corpses!”
Haunted,">Hirsch joked in another [tweet](https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/1537338403859050496), “Disney: Please enjoy our classics Robin Hood, The Lion King, and Zootopia! Furries: Okay. Disney: NO NOT LIKE THAT.”

Yea seriously, Robin Hood basically spawned that whole fetish lol"
Haunted,"Absolutely not surprised. Disney is under scrutiny by every parent group in existence, but also being held up as a standard-bearer for inclusion. They have to thread the needle with every bit of content they release and still get shit on for half of it by one side or the other. Not feeling sorry for them, but I find it pretty logical they would get this picky about writing, all the way down to individual words."
Haunted,"My favorite one was

 ' ""Not approved by S&P"" approved by S&P'

That just cracked me up."

It's the only way to stay ahead of the bible belt. Or animators if we're honest.

I still remember being home sick and pissed as hell that I couldn't listen to anything on my grandmother's radio other that religious or classical music."

Haunted,My Christian mother has told me off for saying Jeez multiple times because it is apparently blasphemous :') the others seem kinda bananas to me tho
Haunted,Be thankful you aren’t the creator of Owl House and get to keep making your show.
Haunted,"To play devils advocate here, while these are all ridiculous, Disney has form with this stuff. There are entire websites and blogs dedicated to hidden sex references in Disney movies and shows. It may be they have just been caught with their pants down one too many times, already get a lot of attention for it and are over compensating now. Still silly requests though.

Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,I've never heard of this and I'm guessing for a reason

i honestly thought sid's fiance was going to reveal she was cheating on him given how weird she was acting 

i'm glad it was only 10 episodes long. too many sitcoms make a bloated 20 + season and maybe half are decent/good. 

the biggest changes i would make are : get rid of the Kim Cattrall future segments except 2 episodes per season - the beginning and final episode of the season

Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"Haven’t watched SNL in years I watched it last weekend when dave Chappell was hosting , come to think of it, the last time I watched it prior to this weekend was the last time he hosted four years ago. Good monologue, Jim Carey and maya were also good that’s about it."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"I agree with most of your thoughts, with the exception of your view of Kenan. I just can't stand how he's ALWAYS smiling or laughing."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"It’s unbearable now. The last 3-4 years were bad, with the exception to the Alec Baldwin openings as Trump, which were decent. This season is absolutely awful. Keenan Thompson has never been funny. He plays a similar typecasted character in most sketches; a goofy or surprised man, with a hint of silly Bill Cosby. Regardless, the sketches themselves have gone downhill and are not laughable. Kate McKinnon holds all the weight on that show. Kyle Mooney to me is funny, but underutilized. Pete Davidson is not a good comedian, especially for a sketch/improv environment. 

I do however enjoy and look forward to Weekend Update with Colin Jost and Micheal Che. They are good together and the jokes are creative, dark and edgy - even by today’s standards. 

I watch every Saturday night because nothing else is on and Live PD was canceled."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,SNL was always best when you were a teenager.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"The mid 80s was the real Dark Ages of SNL, but this era is bad too. It’s tame, it’s partisan to the extreme, it has weak writers and a weak cast. The show used to be a factory of breakout talent, especially in the mid 70s and pretty much the entire 90s. I honestly can’t remember the names or even care about most cast members. Pete Davidson is really the only newish member I really like, and of course he’s widely hated and I’m not sure why. I guess he’s just the closest one to resembling a cast member of a bygone era when the show wasn’t scared to be truly provocative and ruffle feathers. And the show relies entirely too much on actually funny hosts to carry the show now when, for a very long time, they used to be the spice on top of a strong cast and high quality musical guests (who were also unpredictable and provocative). The show is certainly watchable now and sometimes pretty funny, but it’s a shell of what it’s been in other eras."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"i know what the best was...

&#x200B;

Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Laraine Newman."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,DONT YOO KNOW THAT TELEVISION WIL RUIN YOUR MIND?????
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,Can anyone think of a breakout character or sketch in the past 10 years? Jost is not funny. They need to clean house top to bottom and that means Lorne too. He must be almost 80. Not exactly tapped into the zeitgeist.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"I think there have been other eras that were equally bad but fans didn't know or were easy to please.  Or the shows were bad but you knew there were funny people up there who could pull out a memorable reoccurring character. This cast seems to have no clue how bad they are.

Trump is already hilarious, and it's not all unintentional, so Alec Baldwin puckering and reading back quotes just isn't that witty. Nobody on the SNL staff can be half as brilliant as Four Seasons Landscaping, and they're stuck, because re-enacting it will fall flat, they can't beat the humor of what really happened, and yet you know they're going to try. People are cracking jokes all day long on social media, and SNL can't compete with the immediacy and cleverness."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"I only watch SNL sporadically depending on the guest. I'm not a fan of their cast overall but when I do watch I don't think the quality is the worst. It definitely has its moments and great sketches.

>My one positive is Che and Jost might be the best Weekend Update hosts since Norm (is that a hot take?)...

I think that's definitely a hot take. I love Che and Jost but the Tina, Amy and Seth eras were both great. The chemistry between Tina and Amy was great. Seth was really good during his time as the host of Weekend Update.

>Reliance on Trump's antics the last 4 years rather than writing their own jokes/sketches.

That's just with comedy in general. Late night shows are usually topical. So what's the biggest topic with low hanging fruit that can't ignore? Trump. With Biden coming in there will be some segments but the constant Presidential sketches will die down. That goes for every topical comedy show.

>Reliance on so few cast members too much.

I forget his name but don't they use the guy in the Aunt Jemima sketch a lot?

When it comes to the show only getting attention when it's ""controversial"" I'm sort of with you. The only time I see SNL discussed (and admittedly when I watch) is when there is a stand out sketch discussed on social media. Not because it's controversial but because it gets a lot of hype. As far as full episodes though like I said besides the Chappelle and Burr episodes I'm not sure the last full episode I watched."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,the season right after the original cast all left is probably hands down the worst.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,it's gotten sooo bad!!
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,Yea. God damn their sketches are awful
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,This is the answer.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,When they had Chevy back in the early 80s he brought in Al Franken during weekend update in to discuss the disaster that was that season. His second most brutal takedown. The one before that killed his chances to take over the show when Lorne left.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,These are the only two recent ones I've seen.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"I was a teenager in the early 2010s. 

It's definitely better now."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"That's another good point actually, no big stars are coming out of SNL from this era. Kate McKinnon is probably the biggest star and even she can't find a breakout movie role that everyone is going to know her from and make her a real must see actress. I liked Pete's movie earlier this year, but quirky indy movies are definitely more his speed rather than a box office success."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,The Not Ready For Prime Time Players.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"David Pumpkins was surprisingly funny in a weird way and went viral for about two weeks, and then everybody forgot about it (and of course it was carried by Tom Hanks and not cast members). Pete Davidson and Kate McKinnon have gotten pretty popular from SNL, and they're talented, but nobody has really emerged from the show a serious star for quite some time, especially not anyone good. They definitely need some changes."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,[deleted]
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"Go to SNL on YouTube and sort their videos by view count. 

Most of the top videos are from the 2010s, for obvious reasons. 

The top 2 are le funny sex thumbnail. 

But other than that, they are mostly good sketches."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"> I forget his name but don't they use the guy in the Aunt Jemima sketch a lot?

If you mean Keenan Thompson, yes. He's been one of the most utilized cast members for a long time now. If you mean Mikey Day or Pete Davidson, not really."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"> but quirky indy movies are definitely more his speed rather than a box office success.

he is in the next Suicide Squad movie btw"
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"I'm not sure that's the best metric to measure the quality of a cast by though.  In the nearly 50 years the show has been on the air, there have been comparatively very few cast members that have had breakout movies, and, of many that did make it in the movies, a lot of them didn't do it until after they stopped being on *SNL*, like Bill Murray, Chris Rock, Will Farrell, and Eddie Murphy.  There are plenty of noteworthy cast members from strong casts that never made it in movies, including John Lovitz, Phil Hartman, Gilda Radner, Kevin Nealon, Molly Shannon, Darrell Hammond, etc."
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,Leslie Jones is also a pretty big name to come from the recent era of the show
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,One sketch per show is a pretty low bar. There used to be two or three an episode. Show has been up or down for years. This season is almost as bad as the 1980 season.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,I meant Mikey. I know Pete isn't used much since I'm a fan of his other stuff outside of SNL. I didn't know Mikey's name.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,Yeah but I said anyone *good*.
Best.Worst.Weekend.Ever.,"Mikey's used a decent amount, definitely more than Pete. But I think Keenan Thompson, Kate McKinnon, Cecily Strong, Beck Bennett, and Alex Moffat all get used more than him. Maybe Heidi Gardner too."
Ask the Doctor,It's kind of amazing it's taken 54 years for a UNIT spin-off to be made.
Ask the Doctor,"I'm guessing they were looking how to make a spin off most similar to Torchwood (fuck yes) with established characters, but well there's a few reasons John Barrowman couldn't be brought back so this is the next best option

Consider me intrigued, Torchwood season 2 and 3 is amazing"
Ask the Doctor,"It was fairly obvious we’d be getting a few spin offs the second RTD was back and had serious money behind him. He loves these sort of shared universe things, lol"
Ask the Doctor,"It's about time they make a UNIT spinoff. They should have done one back in the 70's when Tom Baker's 4th doctor left Earth and UNIT behind. Oh well, 50 years late is better than never.

It really is the perfect spinoff for Doctor Who."
Ask the Doctor,I feel like this announcement is 6 or 7 years too late
Ask the Doctor,"Really hoping Freema Agyeman and Mandip Gill are involved in some capacity. Wouldn’t be surprised by Sophie Aldred and Janet Fielding either after Power of the Doctor. 

Might surprise some but it looks RTD is actually leaning into ideas Chibnall left hanging in his era. I have very mixed feelings on his era but I’d much prefer he’d attempt to mine the gold than just ignore 4 years of the show."
Ask the Doctor,I hope it's better than Class.
Ask the Doctor,"The Stewart UNIT characters have been featuring in Big Finish audio dramas for a while now - the company has rights to nearly everything bar the incumbent Doctor:

[https://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/unit---the-new-series](https://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/v/unit---the-new-series)"
Ask the Doctor,"Unless there's a good supporting cast, she's not that interesting enough of a character to carry a spin off IMO."
Ask the Doctor,"I get why everyone here is assuming this goes *Torchwood*\-wards, but **it's Disney+**, folks. It just might go *Sarah Jane Adventures*\-wards."
Ask the Doctor,"As long as it's not Edge Lord adult junk like torchwood, I'd be up for it. I trust RTD to do doctor who, but the spin-offs he did weren't great, with Torchwood especially just being what a 14-year-old thinks an adult TV show would be. Hopefully he won't be allowed to make any shows like that and will be restrained more, although I mostly just wish he focused on One show."
Ask the Doctor,"Well I like her, and I'm pretty confident fans have been wanting a UNIT based spin off since the 70's. So I hope it overall works.

But I have to admit my main issue with all the spin off's they've tried to do so far, is they basically boil down to trying to do the same premise only in a set location.

And to me that's a mistake on a show where a large part of the appeal is not being fixed to any location or time. If they want to do that, they have to give us a completely different show. Say let us watch the Space Core battling the Daleks whilst dealing with the squabbling galactic alliance in the 42nd century or something."
Ask the Doctor,"Do whatever but please please please give us a Jo Martin as the Doctor series. So much energy and potential. She'd be like throwing gasoline on the universe.

Doctor Who, Days of Division"
Ask the Doctor,"I was really hoping for a spin off that follows the master, bring back john simm, he absolutely nailed the part."
Ask the Doctor,Just why? Bring back Torchwood if you're desperate
Ask the Doctor,Theatre? Are you theatre?
Ask the Doctor,"Surprised this didn't happen sooner really, Big Finish even beat them to the punch. It's the most obvious spin-off premise for Doctor Who, basically Torchwood but with a higher budget, more staff, more institutional support and not needing to act in secret."
Ask the Doctor,Yay another marvel series/movie…..
Ask the Doctor,Does this mean a cameo from the re-incarnated Cyber-brigadier?
Ask the Doctor,They probably only did it because they couldn’t do Torchwood tho lmao
Ask the Doctor,Children of Earth is legitimately one of the best things of the post-2005 Who era. The scene where the cabinet are around the table discussing a practical way of surrendering the children was absolutely horrifying.
Ask the Doctor,Just get James Marsters back. That man deserves to lead his own show or be a regular again in an ensemble.
Ask the Doctor,">  similar to Torchwood (fuck yes)

Yeesh! That show did not age well. Tried re-watching during the lockdown, and it is so cringe and badly written. Children of Earth is great, though."
Ask the Doctor,They could (and should) still revive Torchwood with Gwen as the lead character imo.
Ask the Doctor,[deleted]
Ask the Doctor,"> He loves these sort of shared universe things, lol

The year the MCU started in 2008, Doctor Who had just finished a crossover storyline that seamlessly combined a family show, kids show and adult show together into one epic finale to the RTD era. Four years, three shows and all with very decent production qualities and writing for the time. 

Doctor Who walked so the MCU could run. RTD in a post-MCU world with a bigger budget to work with is going to be the best thing for this franchise."
Ask the Doctor,Who is RTD?
Ask the Doctor,Yeah that would have been great. Its a shame they didn't.
Ask the Doctor,In fairness to the BBC they tried doing a K9 spinoff in that era and it was a disaster.
Ask the Doctor,"It is surprising to me that it didn’t happen not long after Day of The Doctor. 

Class was undoubtedly a much more cost effective option but even that was practically D.O.A. before it even aired."
Ask the Doctor,"The problem with Freema is they'd have to deal with another character, who sure as hell is not coming back. But I'd certainly like her to be involved. I agree on Mandip too, but if she wants to set away from the Who for a while I wouldn't blame her."
Ask the Doctor,">	Wouldn’t be surprised by Sophie Aldred and Janet Fielding either after Power of the Doctor.

I thought Sophie Alfred was pretty good but Janet Fielding’s lack of acting work since the 1980s really showed - particularly compared to how incredible Liz Sladen was as Sarah-Jane when she came back to the role.

The episode is a bit meh but Sladen’s performance in School Reunion is still absolutely amazing."
Ask the Doctor,There’s no indication that RTD is “leaning into” the Chibnall era here tbh. Kate first appeared during the Moffat era didn’t she?
Ask the Doctor,"Holy shit I forgot Class was even a thing. Saw one episode, then the whole thing just evaporated from all conversation."
Ask the Doctor,I think we can confidently say that the new TV series will ignore the BF audio series and just do its own thing.
Ask the Doctor,"Mind, UNIT Nemesis is... *okay*. If you want to go at NuUNIT do something like UNIT 3 or UNIT 7, or otherwise have a stab at the (much more fun) Bambera UNIT."
Ask the Doctor,I'd love to see Dan back.
Ask the Doctor,"To be fair, Torchwood had Chris Chibnall as head writer until RTD took over for Children of Earth."
Ask the Doctor,Spinoffs need mainstream appeal. The hardcore fans are never -- and quite frankly should never -- be the target audience. A show about Space Core battling the Daleks in the 42nd century would not get the ratings needed to maintain a TV Budget.
Ask the Doctor,Big finish is doing that
Ask the Doctor,"I love John Simm' s portrayal of the Master as well. But even though his screentime is rather limited, Derek Jacobi's change from kindly old scientist to an awakened Master is chilling."
Ask the Doctor,"if you would make a show about the Master (I really don't think that would be a good idea, like following the Doctor, but evil?) it would surely be Michelle Gomez whose Master is much more conflicted than Simm's (that doesn't mean Simm didn't absolutely nail the part though)"
Ask the Doctor,"It would cool to see a one-off episode of Doctor Who starring The Master, but an entire series? I can't see it."
Ask the Doctor,I imagine they're trying to avoid the John Barrowman connection.
Ask the Doctor,"Why couldn't they do Torchwood, surely there could've been different branches of it?"
Ask the Doctor,"SPOILERS

space junkies willing to destroy the planet if humanity doesn't give them their fix, and that fix is human children, what a story honestly"
Ask the Doctor,"I firmly believe Children of Earth is one of the best things ever done in the Whoverse. And yet I'll never watch it again because I cried more at one point than I have ever at a tv show.   


Seasons 1 and 2 are very hit or miss, especially 1. It's either brilliant or terrible; it's downright bizarre how widely it varies in quality.   


And, as far as I'm concerned, Miracle Day doesn't exist. There's only three series of Torchwood."
Ask the Doctor,Very clearly a big inspiration for Arrival
Ask the Doctor,And then Miracle Day came along and fully embodied the 🙃
Ask the Doctor,"I only watched the first season and it seemed to me that calling Torchwood a ""more mature"" Doctor Who is like calling a horny 15 year old ""more mature"" than an 8 year old kid."
Ask the Doctor,"first 5 episodes (and especially the alien entity that wants to have sex one) are cringe, seems like they were being purposely edgy because they could get away with it, they found their niche later"
Ask the Doctor,"It was cringe when it was new,  especially the first season."
Ask the Doctor,"I haven't watched Torchwood. Never had any interest. But I keep hearing praise for Children of Earth/Series 3. And I am somewhat more interested. How important is Series 1 and 2 to understand Children of Earth? Could I say watch the best episodes of Series 1 and 2 that focus on character development, then watch Children of Earth?"
Ask the Doctor,There are some cringy moments. Like why is the Cyberwoman all sexy for no reason.
Ask the Doctor,The weirdest one for me was the (unlicensed?) Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake(/homage???).  Still not sure how they got away with that one.
Ask the Doctor,"[Mainly this](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/bbc-drops-john-barrowman-from-doctor-who-time-fracture-exhibit)

or if you want an in-universe explanation, he looks 15 years older and is not supposed to age or is supposed to do so very very slowly (I guess you could say he's millions of years old and returned to the 21st century again)"
Ask the Doctor,"He's always had a reputation for inappropriate jokes on set, but [some of these stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58FO_SMW7II) aged pretty bad after a few years.

Nothing quite Lewis CK levels, but still a few lines being crossed."
Ask the Doctor,"This is my big difference between RTD and Moffat. RTD built a universe and mythos for the Doctor to play in, Moffat built a doctor centric mythos. I feel like under RTD, the Doctor only became the ""main character"" of a plot when he had to and those plots would spin and tell themselves without him, while under Moffat, The Doctor is the main character of the universe. The plot is happening to him. I much preferred RTDs run over Moffats due that focus shift."
Ask the Doctor,"RTD is on record as saying that the whoniverse should be as big as marvel, but that he set it in motion a bit too early to capitalise."
Ask the Doctor,"This is what got me excited. I would love to see all of the new doctors back again, but over various different timelines. They all have to solve the same problem, and come together at the end of the series."
Ask the Doctor,"Russel T Davies, the man behind the revival of Doctor Who and the writer and producer betwewn 2005-2010."
Ask the Doctor,"Russell T Davies, the returning showrunner."
Ask the Doctor,Previous showrunner.
Ask the Doctor,"Russell ""The Davies"" as he likes to be called."
Ask the Doctor,"It actually had ratings higher than Doctor Who, but a new head of the BBC (or something like that) decided to not commission it past the pilot."
Ask the Doctor,"If Moffat hadn't been also running Sherlock we might have have gotten a spin off during his era. He also talked that before he took over as Showrunner, and before Sherlock was greenlit, he had a third project in the works, but quickly realised there was no feasible way for him to work on all three. Doing a spin off himself was just never an option."
Ask the Doctor,"I don't know how true this is but it's a pretty widely understood ""fact"" in fandom that Class wasn't meant to be a Who spin-off, but the BBC didn't have enough faith in it on its own and shoehorned the Doctors cameo >!and the weeping angels!< in."
Ask the Doctor,"They could just retcon that detail. I mean, it was a stupid decision for them to make in the first place and for absolutely zero reason."
Ask the Doctor,They could just say he died.
Ask the Doctor,I can see that but the part of me that's still an 8 yr old 80s kid loved seeing them together.
Ask the Doctor,"She did, in a Chibnall written episode tbf, but there’s also been leaks (from the same source that got a lot of stuff right for Power of the Doctor and called Moffat’s return for Series 14) that >!RTD will be handling the fall out of the Flux.!<

>!RTD himself has said the word flux features in one of his episodes, so it seems very likely.!< My point being is that it looks like RTD is picking up where Chibnall left off and fans shouldn’t expect him to just ignore the previous era."
Ask the Doctor,It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. The fact that Capaldi showing up at the end of episode one was the only scene i remember pretty much sums up how i feel about Class.
Ask the Doctor,"You think their is no mainstream appeal to a massive space opera that deals with big battles and complex regional politics?

Also I doubt their are many Who fan's calling for that (if anything their be calling for this particularly premise), considering it takes its setting from a mostly lost episode that aired back in 1965 that since then has only gotten a few expanded universe novels as its only impact on the franchise.

It was just my example of how it would be better to attract more fans if it was a show that didn't try to replicate the parent series style, and instead offered something different the previous show couldn't give. That way it will be easier for it to stand out on its own merits."
Ask the Doctor,"> and quite frankly should never -- be the target audience.

thats the hard thing as a fan because each new thing that comes out in a given universe is designed to appeal to more and more people. Star Trek went from sci-fi stories to space pew pew because that's what they needed to attract more people to watch it"
Ask the Doctor,"Big Finish did an audio series of Jacobi playing the Time War-era Master, and he's very chilling throughout."
Ask the Doctor,"Oh yeah that whole sequence was, and do excuse the pun, masterfully done."
Ask the Doctor,"I mean, Big Finish have spinoffs for Roberts (TV Movie), Jacobi (War) and Gomez (Missy) so the flavours are all there for potential. The most interesting is probably Jacobi since you can *really* punch for his brutality, but I doubt they would make it into a show."
Ask the Doctor,"I Just reeaallly liked john simm. But a really early iteration of the master would work, like an origin story akin to anakin/vader."
Ask the Doctor,"You could have the master going against bigger evils

but then again it would just be like watching the doctor only this time he is a bit of a dickhead"
Ask the Doctor,"I wouldn't want an entire series of it, but Michelle Gomez chewing the scenery and just being a full chaotic evil version of the doctor would be really fun for a two-parter or a special, I basically want more of the very beginning of ""World Enough and Time"" from series 10"
Ask the Doctor,"The reason they’re not doing Torchwood is because John Barrowman toed the line of sexual misconduct on multiple occasions on set and despite apologizing for it, continued to casually take his dick out on productions. Continuing Torchwood as a show without him would bring in negativity, which can be avoided by merely giving a show to a character that people have also loved for years and would more or less deliver the same tone as Torchwood"
Ask the Doctor,"It's just so good because it does a great job showing how far humanity will go for survival. If it wasn't tied to Doctor Who/an established IP I could easily see the general premise of Children of Earth getting critical acclaim, just like if the episode Blink was a standalone horror movie it'd be one of the most memorable in decades."
Ask the Doctor,What if everyone was immortal but could also die?
Ask the Doctor,"Mature pretty much always means ""swearier, more grim, bloodier, and very horny"" in some mixture. Very rarely does 'more mature' equate to ""tackles complex themes of reaching middle age and the difficulties of maintaining a marriage""."
Ask the Doctor,Season 1 was made for bbc 3 and that Chanel’s target audience was about 15-20 year olds imo. They did tone  it down after the first season when it moved to bbc 2
Ask the Doctor,"> especially the alien entity that wants to have sex one

My face as a kid telling my mum to let me watch the ""Doctor Who spin off"" then within minutes of the second episode someone has a shag in a Cardiff club toilet and evaporates."
Ask the Doctor,"season 2 (and especially from episode 5 and onwards) is at a very high level, but even season 1 except a few episodes is good

you can skip episode 2 (the sex alien one), 4 (Cyberwoman - a very bad episode) and 5 (just mid), but there's a lot of character development in others, Out of Time, Countrycide and They keep killing Suzie in s01 are great."
Ask the Doctor,"You could watch it totally standalone. There's a bit of ongoing relationship stuff, but if you're familiar with Jack through Dr Who you'll pick it up, and there's nothing that interferes with the story in any way. 

There are some great earlier episodes (someone already pointed those out), but if you only wanted to watch Children of Earth, you absolutely could."
Ask the Doctor,"Miracle Day had a decent premise, also had a gay love scene that would make even the most ardent TLoU / GoT fans blush."
Ask the Doctor,"They did confirm though that living for 5 billion years turns him into a giant head. So if he lived for a couple thousand and then somehow found his way back to the present day, him looking older is easily explained."
Ask the Doctor,Thanks
Ask the Doctor,Was is RTD that introduced us to River Song?
Ask the Doctor,Thanks
Ask the Doctor,Current showrunner
Ask the Doctor,"If he brings back Doctor Who magic and charm, I'll call him whatever the fuck he wants."
Ask the Doctor,"Was the third project TinTin, I know he was involved in it before he got the showrunner role?"
Ask the Doctor,i know he liked the idea of a Paternoster gang spin-off but he said the extensive makeup work involved would've been too much for the cast for a whole series. Of course at first he probably thought he didn't have to as SJA/Torchwood were still active.
Ask the Doctor,"well it worked on me, put Peter Capaldi in anything and I'll be watching that shit"
Ask the Doctor,"makes sense, it felt nothing like DW or felt connected to it, The Doctors cameo made no difference"
Ask the Doctor,Why retcon? They can just say they got divorced.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"BBC gets flak but they do so much more than just programming. I grew up on CBBC, CBeebies and Bitesize revision. These go some way in providing a basic platform for kids to learn from. I hope they can find a way to continue these services in the future."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I know the Beeb always attracts flak, but IMHO it’s got a pretty solid streaming service. Lots of good shows, often with the full back catalogue. Rotating selection of good films. Decent UI and usually good subtitles."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I love the fact that iconic episode of the apprentice got nearly as many iPlayer streams as the queen's funeral ( granted far more had the chance to see that live as it was on pretty much EVERY channel)
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"And Doctor Who continues its inverse ratio between audience size and budget.

Maybe it'll finally get a decent budget after the Disney deal - the BBC have always treated it like shit."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I feel like there are a lot of good BBC shows that i just never hear about. I just started watching one that i only noticed because it was released on amazon prime (couple years after release)
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"bUt NoBoDy WaTcHeS tHe BbC!?!!!!!!.!:""!"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"It gets flack because for the most part it deserves it. They provide good too - through for example children’s programming as you say - but that doesn’t undo the bad. Such as covering for the pedophile Jimmy Saville, being biased in its news reporting and making it a criminal offence (where one can go to jail) for not paying the tv licence fee. 

If it were never critiqued, it would never improve and nonsense like the above would just continue to go on."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,[deleted]
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I am also not sure if they include streams of the live feed on the BBC News website as iPlayer either. I don't think they do as it doesn't direct you to it. On the day the front page of BBC News was a live blog of the funeral with an accompanying video of the BBC live coverage of it and I think a lot of people would have gone to that rather than iPlayer.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"To be fair, Thursday nights are great TV right now. Dragons Den followed by The Apprentice. Good way to spend an entertaining few hours."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,[deleted]
The Girl Who Sees Scents,BBC probably has the most widely seen advertising powerhouse (mostly itself) so I am not sure how you miss stuff tbh plus on any epg  BBC is the top two channels plus iPlayer is a destination in itself
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I wasn’t excusing those things, but it’s programming for children for the most part is very beneficial. There are corrupt people in the wrong places unfortunately."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I’d beg to disagree. I find Netflix, HBO Max and even Hulu all better in user experience and speed. 

Particularly on the TV app, where iPlayer has made it more annoying to find shows. Now if I want to see shows aired on a particular day, I have to first go to the Channels section, then select the individual channel (one of a dozen or so), scroll the EPG to the right date/time and then select watch. It was fine before this change."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Wtf? The iPlayer TV app is one of the *worst* UX of all steaming services. It hasn't changed in 10 years. It's horrific. Search is clunky af, the discovery algorithm is a joke, there's no way to go to a series without playing an episode, there's no way of clearing the 'continue watching' list, responsiveness is painfully laggy, and it's prone to constant crashes or just doesn't open.

Only ITVX and All4 are worse."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Sport live streams are also on sports home pages so who knows
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"[The Capture]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Capture_(TV_series\))

Season 1 is on prime, 1 & 2 are on iPlayer"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I dont think i've ever really clocked the BBC advertising its own shows on bbc news, and generally i run adblock most places. But i still see for example, posts for new amazon shows on reddit, twitter, etc. 

I dont use TV in the traditional sense so never see any EPGs, or go out of my way to visit iplayer"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Agreed mate.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Capaldi's run is going to age well as more people go back and binge it.  His character arc is, imo, the best character arc any Doctor has ever had, but most people didn't really pick up on it, either because of the weekly format, or because they felt they already knew who the Doctor was and didn't like him having a character arc.

Capaldi's run dismantles the Doctor, examines every piece, allows him to make mistakes in his pursuit of figuring out who the Doctor is, and what a good man is, and then slowly builds him up even greater than before."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"""The writing failed Capaldi."" How many times have I heard that from viewers who dropped off after a couple Capaldi episodes? It is one of the worst misconceptions the modern series has ever had. No not even close. If anyone was failed by the writing, it was Smith with the convoluted plot lines and turned the Doctor into an all-knowing superhero. 

Capaldi's era took a look at who the Doctor is and deconstructs what they should be after Tennant and Smith's characterization. It's the best character arc the Doctor has gone through. From angry, old man questioning his existence to Rockstar co-dependent on his companions to the final, evolved version of the modern portrayal. You couldn't imagine other Doctor's going through Listen, Heaven Sent, World and Time Enough, or The Doctor Falls. 

After multiple series of universe ending threats, Moffat does something unthinkable. He scales it all down. Series 8 deals with afterlife culminating in the Doctor deciding who he is - an idiot with a box. Series 9 shows the Doctor at his most wounded and deconstructs Moffat's own universe ending plot lines. Series 10's finale is the ultimate statement of the character. The Doctor is just a time traveling alien who walks right into unexpected trouble. 

And each series has its own range of great episodes to all-timers. 

Series 8 - Deep Breath, Listen (all-timer), Mummy on the Orient Express, Flatline, Dark Water

Series 9 - The Magician's Apprentice/Witches Familiar, Under the Lake/Before the Flood, Zygon Invasion/Zygon Inversion, Face the Raven, Heaven Sent (arguably the GOAT), Hell Bent 

Series 10 - The Pilot, Oxygen, Extremis, World and Time Enough (all-timer), The Doctor Falls (all-timer)

His Christmas Specials are also pretty good. Last Christmas is underrated.  Husbands of River Song is arguably the best Christmas special competing with A Christmas Carol. Return of Doctor Mysterio is a goofy love letter to Superman. And Twice Upon A Time is a quiet, introspective send off to not just Capaldi, but Moffat as well. 

Sorry if I've ranted. I've always been annoyed by the common belief Capaldi's era was somehow significantly worse than the others. I'd argue he had the 2nd golden era of the modern series after Tennant."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Capaldi and Tenant both had such great runs as The Doctor. Definitely my 2 favorites.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Capaldi and Smith are the best runs, writing is top, story is top.  No one was failed."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,One of my favourite scenes in NuWho. Always love seeing callbacks to earlier seasons like this.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Still not a ginger :(
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"It definitely felt like it was almost a retrospective reset of sorts for both the character and Moffat as a showrunner.

I know some people didn’t like it but I loved that after years of Tennant and Smith being all manic and cheekily charming, it was tempered down to a measured and more mature Doctor who has to reevaluate everything he’s done and is after what should’ve been his true end.

He’s still the Doctor with all the expected pathological quirks, but he definitely didn’t announce it as loudly as Tennant asking for a banana or Smith speaking baby.

Casually taps a kid’s head to reset his memory with no fancy speeches or assurances. “Dad Skills”."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"The Capaldi run could have been shit (it's not!) and I'd still stan it, if only for Capaldi insisting the Doctor wear a hoody and have sunglasses for a season so that any kid could easily dress up like their hero. That alone? Huge respect."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Capaldi himself was incredible. But a lot of his run is ruined by Clara imo.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"If I recall correctly, I liked a lot more of the episodes with Bill, because I was always in the camp that Clara overstayed her welcome. Also that episode with the fucking trees. yeah, *more Oxygen* that will stop us from burning."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I'm not interested in character development for the Doctor. I see Doctor Who as more of an anthology show and the supporting cast should be the main focus of the episodes. Just like how the Mad Max movies aren't actually about Mad Max.

Too much focus on the Doctor is what I don't want to see. I doubt I'll come around to loving the Capaldi era."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Not just character development for the doctor but also a certain other important one.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Heaven Sent is quite possibly my favorite episode of any TV show ever. It’s at least in the top 5
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I think the themes of Capaldi's run kinda begin at the 50th anniversary special.  

Obviously, they didn't destroy Galifrey, so as the audience we think ""Doctor saved Galifrey.  Doctor good,"" but it's not so simple.  3 different versions of the Doctor were willing to destroy the planet, willing to burn all those people, and were only stopped from doing so by Clara reminding him to ""Be a Doctor.""  The willingness to destroy Galifrey wasn't something that afterwards could be simply blamed on a rogue regeneration of the Doctor.  It was something within The Doctor's core character that transcended regeneration.  

So, Capaldi's self-reflection and self-doubt on the question of deep-down, ""Am I a good man"" is a natural and reasonable one for the character to have at this time.  The rest of his arc is trying out several different answers to that question, usually ending in some sort of failure.  For example, one of the ideas he tries is good works, thinking a good man is simply doing good works.  It fails.  Finally, the Doctor comes to the conclusion of his arc and what makes a good man in his [standoff with the two Masters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnouj9Yz-Gs).  ""Above all, it's kind.  It's just that.  Just kind.""

Then, in his last speech, he sums up everything he's learned and what it means to be The Doctor.  ""[Never be cruel.  Never be cowardly](https://youtu.be/yJqsPBWbtjk?t=61).  Notice how that's a direct callback to the 50th and the ""Be a Doctor"" scene when Clara asks ""[You told me the name you chose was a promise.  What was the promise?](https://youtu.be/gPu9XtfEicM?t=141)""

That's what makes a good man, and that's who the Doctor is.  Just being kind is what a good man is, and never being cruel, never being cowardly, never eating pears, always trying to be nice, but never failing to be kind, is who the Doctor is."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"What the hell, I watched his whole run and never once noticed he wore a hoodie for one of the series. Blowing my mind rn"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Clara probably should have died off a little earlier than she did.  

However, I think a lot of the negative perception of Clara is colored by assuming that the Doctor is always right.  The Doctor isn't always right though.  The Doctor builds her up as ""The Impossible Girl"" as though she's super-special and kind of a Mary Sue.  Except she's not, we find out that she's just a regular, simple girl.  She's an everyman.  The show goes to great lengths to show us that Clara is just a regular, simple girl, and yet, we somehow still have this perception of her as a Mary Sue because the Doctor's incorrect assumptions of her."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,YES. The #1 reason why I jumped ship.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I definitely would've liked it if we said goodbye to Clara for good after one season of Capaldi.

I also really wanted at least ONE episode of Capaldi-Doctor meeting Donna Noble. They'd have an amazing snark-off and she could get mildly distressed because he seems familiar to her and she feels like she can remember his face but not from *where*. Not saying she should've been the companion, but him just bumping into her for one episode would've been nice."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I think Clara leaving to return that kid Danny killed to his parents was a great stepping off point. Clara's story could have ended there. And I'd have been happy. Then she was in the Christmas Special. And the following season. And it just felt like she overstayed her welcome.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,It's basically a Capaldi One Man Show too. Just pure acting.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Funnily enough that's the last episode of Doctor Who I've ever watched.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I like that take, but it is an odd join with the very beginning of the 50th where Clara starts off with a Marcus Aurelius quote on “Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be. Be one.”

On one hand, it could be a clash with Aurelius’ stoicism since the very fact that the Doctor questions it is part of what makes him a good man, setting himself from the tip of narcissism and being the Time Lord Victorious.

On the other, it could also be seen as a quote to remind that the Doctor never truly forgot his promise, but rather he only needs to remember to move forward with the core values of it. It’s tonally subtle"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I feel like you're forgetting one more vital message from Capaldi's final speech as the Doctor.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Its more that a hoodie is added to his revolving choice of outfits after a certain point in his tenure
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"> The show goes to great lengths to show us that Clara is just a regular, simple girl

I vehemently disagree. 

The show goes out it's way to make Clara the most important human being who ever lived. She literally saved every incarnation of the doctor at multiple times during the course of his timeline. She's the reason he picked the TARDIS. By the end of the show she's immortal and has her own TARDIS/companion. 

She is very, very much not a regular simple girl."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I think the truly odd join is Time of the Doctor, the episode after the 50th where Smith regenerates. The Doctor defends a planet against overwhelming odds for 900 years! He doubles his age defending innocent people to his literal last breath, and then starts wondering if he's a good man. I still find it baffling."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"And I think the show was disagreeing with Aurelius a bit.  Aurelius's quote is a call to action.  It's a call to do something.  Well, what does a good man do?  

What Moffett is saying through the Doctor is that what a good man is isn't entirely in your actions, it's in your being.  Be kind.  If you're kind, even if you fail, like Capaldi's Doctor believed he would taking on the Cybermen in his scene with the two masters, every action you take will be what a good man would do."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"She's a regular person who is the most important person in the universe, for a single brief moment.  
Pretty much like Donna.  Not that different from Bad Wolf Rose even.

Clara's brief moment is the moment she jumps into the Doctor's timestream.  

Clara didn't save every incarnation of The Doctor.  An echo of Clara, a Clara who had been ripped into a million pieces, none of those echoes being the real Clara, saved each incarnation of the Doctor.  [Rewatch River Song's warning to Clara before Clara jumps](https://youtu.be/8cZFDtOMYtQ?t=112)."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"That one actually makes sense to me. He thinks he’s going to die. Really die. And so he does the one thing, especially that incarnation, he never does—he stays. 

And fights and takes care of one planet for centuries. He’s forced to watch generations pass while he ages, where it must be such a cycle that he loses track of which generation was that little boy Barnabas.

After that much time and a period of not being able to distract himself with a new adventure or planet (especially in the case of 11th Doctor), he has to go over what he’s done in not just the Time War but like Donna or Amy or Adric (poor Adric). That has to have him stop and contemplate"

The Girl Who Sees Scents,Nathan Fielder as resort boss that is getting screwed by someone.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Tim Heidecker
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Steve Coogan. Rachel Brosnahan. Randall Park. Timothy Oliphant. Laura Prepon. Tim Roth
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Jeff Goldblum would be fun or Bryan Cranston.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Paul Dano
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Jennifer Coolidge, with a crossover with The Walking Dead."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,You want to see her in a steamy sex scene
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Maura Tierney. She killed it in The Affair and I’d like to see her do something similar to what Michael Imperioli did in S2.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Laura Dern has already been established as Dominic’s wife over the phone, bring her character into the show with their daughter!"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Ummm the high class gays....
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Honestly more focus on the location and actors in that location.  My favorites BY FAR were the Italian actors this season and I really hope we get more of that next season.  I feel like the first season had a tiny bit of a focus on Hawaii but it felt like it could have been anywhere.  Season 2 really focused on the regions and love of the locations and it felt so much better.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Laura Linney would make a great guest, or invert the trope and make her the resort manager."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I’d like to see Mike White tbh
The Girl Who Sees Scents,macaulay culkin
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Kathy Bates

The Girl Who Sees Scents,They’ve been spot on with casting so I’m cool with whoever. HBO casting has historically been crazy good !!

The Girl Who Sees Scents,"- Constance Wu as a burnt out resort manager 

- Paul Mescal and Lana Condor as newlyweds with secrets 

- Brie Larson and Alison Brie as feuding sisters, Brie’s character could be wealthy and constantly reminding Alison’s of her wealth for petty reasons 

- Kiki Layne as a holiday maker who somehow gets caught up in everyone’s drama"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I need a season with Thandie Newton, Emily Blunt and Kristen Bell"
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Halsey and Paul Mescal 
Or Steve Coogan."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Spoiler: in the extras the show writer said he's working on it being themed on death, taking place in south Asia, and possibly following Portia as she unravels Tanya'a death."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"I want a different type of hotel manager, who is completely two-faced. Like exquisite with the guests but horrendously abusive to employees and they turn on him/her. And I want an actor we haven't seen in a role like that.

Anna Gunn

Tom Hiddleston

Eva Green

Rhea Seehorn

Ruth Negga

Samantha Morton

Karl Urban

Ken Watanabe

Stephanie Hsu

Ncuti Gatwa

James Spader

Ian McShane

Viola Davis 

Michaela Coel

Maya Erskine

Any of them as the two faced hotel manager. Idk what kind of location, Iceland, New Zealand, New Orleans, IDC. 

But give me Josh Groban in the role of the terrible womanizer guest or an incompetent bellhop who frequently gets shit hammered on duty and keeps likes to sing at the lobby piano when he's blackout drunk."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Parker Posey.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Bring back Steve Zahn
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Donald Glover.  Or any of the main cast from Atlanta. How great would that be?

Maybe add a little color to the usual class warfare theme."

The Girl Who Sees Scents,Keke Palmer
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Tilda Swinton, as the hotel manager."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Not sure who I’d pick but hopefully an entirely new cast. I could see Kristen Bell nailing the comedic timing playing one of the rich asshole guests. Season 2 was so goofy by the end with the murder plotline my biggest hope is that it’s not revisited at all.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Casey Wilson
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Jack Black.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Emile Hirsche
The Girl Who Sees Scents,More dong
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Evan Peters would be interesting
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I’d love to see Jim Carrey as the guy in charge of the resort
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"If it has to be a returning character, then Greg obviously. We need to know what happened to the poor widower."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Tom Green as the front desk.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,I was really hoping Jennifer Coolidge would somehow bethe character that survives each season
The Girl Who Sees Scents,"Glen Howerton to play a psychopathic douchebag, basically I want Dennis Reynolds in White Lotus. I feel he's the natural progression of that character. Shane to Cam to Dennis."
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Ski lodge?
The Girl Who Sees Scents,John Stamos 😂
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Matt bomber as the hotel manager. He's played some suave characters in the past and it would be cool to have him back in action trying to pull over some type of con on every guest.
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Paul Fuckin Giamatti
The Girl Who Sees Scents,Greg- did he get Tanya’s inheritance then? I want to know what his scheming ass is up to!

Project S The Series,"My concern is what happens to the library content as it ages. I think a lot people, including myself, were operating under a naive assumption that everything they ever made would be accessible forever on their platforms, but I don't think we can count on that."
Project S The Series,"In 2009, Amreeka debuted at Sundance to praise and ended up with an 87% Rotten Tomatos score. It's a rare look into the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and in the United States that's not a gut wrenching documentary or thriller. It's a comedy, and a good one.

Nat Geo bought the rights to it after Sundance, and just shelved it. Not available to watch on any platform. If you want to see it, and it's good, you have no choice but to find a DVD copy somewhere."
Project S The Series,"There are tons and tons of shows that were on networks that you can't find anywhere. This is nothing new.

I just tried to look up ""Cavemen"" with Nick Kroll and it's nowhere to be found. That aired on ABC.

There was a show that Lee Aronsohn did before Two and Half Men called ""Life... and Stuff"", starring a stand-up comedian named Rick Reynolds and Pam Dawber. It's nowhere to be found. That aired on CBS.

There was a show called ""Nurses"" that had TV writer Brent Forrester (The Simpsons, King of the Hill, The Office) on staff (although he never was assigned a script and doesn't have a credit). Nowhere to be found.

Margaret Cho's ""All-American Girl."" You can find DVDs and grainy episodes on YouTube... not on any streaming platform.

Jon Stewart's MTV talk show. Nowhere to be found.

Late Night with David Letterman... outside of clips and a handful of full episodes on a superfan's YouTube account... nowhere to be found.

Countless others."
Project S The Series,"aint nothing disapearing from my plex server

once again the black flag is better"
Project S The Series,"The tax break thing is deeply concerning, it feels like a sequel to The Producers. ""Did you know you can make more money by making a movie and canning it forever than actually releasing it?"" 

I know asking corporations to do anything fair with taxes is like screaming into the void but it feels like this loophole needs to be closed."
Project S The Series,Cue a group of filmmakers creating their own streaming platform.
Project S The Series,"I know everyone's just talking about stuff being pulled, but... what a weird article.

It reads as if it's about to go in-depth on the trend, like maybe how certain creatives don't want to work with certain companies anymore, or how something not being publicly released makes it harder for people breaking in / with few credits to point to their previous work when trying to get the next job (I have first-hand experience here).

And then it's just a couple quotes from Johnson and Bruckheimer before abruptly ending."
Project S The Series,No offense but this happened all the time in the age before DVDs.
Project S The Series,Like it wasn't normal on linear TV and still is.
Project S The Series,I'm still waiting on *Counterparts* to land somewhere.
Project S The Series,"Can I just say that I love my dvd collection? Everybody thought I was crazy to hang on to them. But I just love the physical nature of them. Yes, they take up a lot of room. But if I suddenly decide I have a burning desire to see the all time classic masterpiece 'The Librarian. Quest for the spear.' 
I can. And that makes me happy."
Project S The Series,The golden age was when Netflix had everything.
Project S The Series,"Every time I see “streamers”, I think of streamers on Twitch, not streaming websites. I got worried that streamers were deleting the old saved videos when I first read the headline."
Project S The Series,I’m *horrified* that I can’t watch all the old WKRP episodes with the original music. That is truly a loss.
Project S The Series,"This isn't really surprising.  For a couple years, every piece of garbage got greenlit because of ""we need content!""  Some of that garbage is literally unwatchable.  The industry is getting more discerning."
Project S The Series,"That’s fair to say but losing money is also terrible for the streamers and the studios who own most of them. It’s a two-way street. 

The days, heck years, of streamers being financially irresponsible by ordering tons of content, most of which are mediocre anyway, seem to be over. At the end of the day, it’s always best to focus on quality over quantity."
Project S The Series,"As opposed to traditional linear TV or movie theater model where content disappeared forever by design due to being limited by time slots? Or the old movie rental model where your selection was limited to what could fit shelves at your local Blockbuster?

I don't understand their argument against streaming. Streaming is just a more convenient rental business but still has the same inherit problems that rentals always had. 

If anything can be considered terrible is that we can't purchase digital ""hard copies"" of much of this content any more like when everything came out on VHS/DVD/Blu-Ray and are left to piracy as the only option to acquire removed content."
Project S The Series,"How long before its just 45 episodes of an ass farting, replaced every 3 months so noone knows who's ass it is and why it is farting!?"
Project S The Series,"But it's always been like that see Babylon 2022

Project S The Series,Get a dvd player and start collecting DVDs and box sets of particularly good shows and movies. It’ll be worth it in the long run
Project S The Series,"> Creatives are burning with rage over Hollywood’s hottest new trend: **streaming platforms’ habit of canceling finished films and TV series before they’ve aired or pulling projects from platforms and shelving them indefinitely.**

> The Hollywood Reporter has been asking around about the effects of consolidation, budget cuts and tax write-offs kneecapping projects like Batgirl, Snowpiercer, Scoob!: Holiday Haunt and Westworld, among others. **It’s happening all over town as entertainment companies have been forced to contend with consolidation, inflation, a possible recession and a constant chase for subscribers.**

> “It’s been horrifying,” prolific creator Rian Johnson (Glass Onion) tells THR. “The fact that it’s becoming common practice is terrible and adds to the awfulness. In the history of the business, there has been a constant evolution of horrible things.”"
Project S The Series,"""Horrifying""? Guys relax"
Project S The Series,"I don’t understand the backlash honestly. Studios are not art galleries.  They’re making products.  All these creators can go make whatever they want and distribute it on their own if they want.  There’s never been a time as good as this for creators.

If a studio decides to pull a product because it’s unprofitable or they just decide it doesn’t work, well… isn’t that the business they’re in?"
Project S The Series,It's hard to get excited for anything on streaming if half of the announced projects never launch and the ones that do get cancelled as soon as there's trouble.
Project S The Series,The fact Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars is more terrible....
Project S The Series,"I guess I'm confused. Do they think companies are going to keep willingly losing money for shit? Even Disney will change their tune when they lose enough. Eventually, people are going to have to start making their own stuff. Tiktok allows 8 minute videos. When people get passed silly dance trends and start making their own short films and stuff, the industry changes,"
Project S The Series,"Responds smugly with my disc collection. 

Realise I have no television just movies. :("
Project S The Series,HORRIFYING
Project S The Series,People were always worried about this happening with Steam.
Project S The Series,"Fucking agreed. Have been saying this for so long, it's nice and convenient but we can't actually own anything on streaming sites, not having dvd or bluray releases really hurts the people creating the movoes or tv shows, the fans as well, in the long run vecause their work gets erased and for the fans, we lose all of thise badass stories we've seen and loved."
Project S The Series,"I love physical media for the exact reasons about what's happening, but it's worse now more than ever to protect things you love in a tangible manner: With streamers so intent on getting you to subscribe it has become exclusive media and now that we've seen nothing lasts forever, something we might've loved could be gone in the blink of an eye from history. A prime example for me is one day not being able to watch Love Death + Robots. *“It’s always about the work, and if the work’s good, it’ll be on the air. That’s how it works.""* This quote from Jerry Bruckheimer in the article scares me the most, it's a faith in that ideology that is incredibly misguided at this point: There are plenty of things we love that would be considered obscure and are more than good, sometimes works of art, but these companies don't care about *good work* anymore - just eyeballs on any given project. Everything can inform or inspire a generation that it didn't before, but we'll never know what could've happened if it's gone."
Project S The Series,Just do how we did back in the days! Screw these entertainment conglomerates
Project S The Series,Micheal cera with dad body?
Project S The Series,"I'm not sure many people read the article. Almost all the comments are talking about removing things from an existing catalogue, which is ofc a big problem with streaming services, but the article's about cancelling things before release.

I don't think canceling projects midway is a new problem but it definitely seems like a bigger issue now and, unlike removing existing films/TV from a library, it's not something piracy can fix."
Project S The Series,"Crave HBO. Boardwalk Empire? C’mon? U raised $ 3x since 2020 (well 2x,actually after promotion ended, but still. Wtf?  Hopped on the Snyder cut train. )"
Project S The Series,Physical media will always be king.
Project S The Series,"Man, the anime crowd has been on this tip for the last 30 years."
Project S The Series,"I’m not hugely concerned because streaming is still relatively new as a business model. We’re going through a contraction of the industry, but they’ll be available in some capacity as long as there’s demand for it."
Project S The Series,There are too many platforms and too many shows. We really need a big culling to make it more manageable.
Project S The Series,Corporate profits above all else applies to everything from the shrinkage of food charging the same for less to the entertainment industry catalogues so they don't have to pay residuals. It's all absolute greed more is never enough.
Project S The Series,"I think this snuck up on people,  and going forward filmmakers and actors will have a clause in the contract that says if it does not air within a certain timeframe, or with a certain frequency, the rights will revert to the filmmaker. That doesn’t necessarily mean it will be seen somewhere but people with the clout are going to want clauses that will keep their work from being lost or hidden"
Project S The Series,Star Wars Episode 8 was horrifying.
Project S The Series,"According to some people on here, it’s not a big deal because it’s always happened"
Project S The Series,"It’s weird. Shows like Stargate SG-1 is just not available for streaming (at least in my country). I thought after Amazon bought it, but now it’s been a year and still nothing. 

It should be legal to pirate if they don’t even want to make it accessible for purchase."
Project S The Series," Arr Arr, Pirates we! Treasure on the web arr fer free!"
Project S The Series,That's why at this rate I actually prefer streaming sites just to do a limited miniseries.
Project S The Series,"Loosing media is nothing new, how many TV shows and movies from the 50s-80s are lost media due to things like master tapes being destroyed, lost, etc.  Not to mention books going out of print. It’s OK guys - it was never made to be forever. Enjoy these things while you can, but they don’t really matter in the long run. You can always find something new to discover- I promise."

Project S The Series,Everything is for sale. Tough luck. Capitalism is as inevitable as Thanos. What’s the solution?
Project S The Series,"This is how they’ll milk that old cow, my 10 y/o kids will be paying someone to stream their favorite childhood content 30 years from now.."
Project S The Series,"This is why I won't invest my time in watching ongoing series on Netflix. Because they cancel them without warning and without resolution.

If Netflix guaranteed series finales... for shows with 3 or more seasons for example... I would be happy to watch."
Project S The Series,This is one of many reasons streaming is bad. Pirating and physical media is the only way to guarantee the ability to watch content.
Project S The Series,"This is the result of Hollywood unions forcing residuals on the studios. 

Streamers would rather not deal with all that and just remove the content from the platform if the shows don't generate enough money."
Project S The Series,So Westworld is just gone. I watched Seasons 1-3 but never season 4 and now I can never watch it. Who made this call.
Project S The Series,Rian: “Its really bad. BTW catch my new show on Peacock and my upcoming movie on Netflix!”
Project S The Series,Anything with Michael Cera that disappears forever is okay with me.
Project S The Series,Someone tell Rian Johnson the streaming providers are just subverting expectations.
Project S The Series,Rian Johnson would know since he made Star Wars disappear from Pop Culture.
Project S The Series,This is about $$$ - Rian and Jerry are just pissed their royalties cheques are getting smaller.
Project S The Series,"Are you a bank or a studio? Yeah, I get you want to make money, but if that’s all, just become a bank. If you want to be a studio, put out some films."
Project S The Series,I stopped buying physical media because I couldn’t stand the clutter anymore and donated it all. But my itunes library has about 1800 movies and some of my favorite Tv shows. I don’t watch tv shows much
Project S The Series,"If you are able to gatekeep some content than you will be able to do it for any content. 
This is gradually happening since acta couldn’t been passed. 
  Lucky us that “they” want and need what they try to refuse to every other clear-net user : privacy and security. So while they have it we will have it ( privacy and security) , albeit it’s an individual task to accomplish nowadays in regards with “them”"
Project S The Series,"I find it really hard to care about that. It's extremely easy to find content you want, download it, and keep it in a hard drive. It's almost impossible for modern content to be lost."
Project S The Series,The fact that Rian Johnson is still allowed to make movies is perplexing
Project S The Series,"The same happens with music. I had an artist’s album on Apple Music one time and the other day when I wanted to give it a “spin”, it was no longer there.

It took me a 1/2 hour to dig up the CD from storage too. 👎🏻"
Project S The Series,"So they’re just like regular Hollywood. There are lots of examples of older properties that have more content that after airing once are never seen again or were never released for sale in the physical or digital. If it’s not guaranteed to make enough to buy a yacht in these modern times, being available or released is not always going to be a reality."
Project S The Series,I have been looking for HBO “Dream On” forever.
Project S The Series,"The part I hate the most is that it's totally possible and fine to tell an entire story, beginning-middle-*end* in a single season, but nooooo. Gotta leave hanging threads or just have a straight cliffhanger in case it takes off and they want to extend it into multiple seasons. I wish more TV would just show a small, self-contained story and forgo all the serial stuff that has become so ubiquitous.  
  
Edit: Ahh. We're talking stuff removed from streaming services, not canceled shows. OOps.."
Project S The Series,Can you imagine Scrubs just.....going away? I need to look to a bay with pirates soon.
Project S The Series,Arrrrgh ye scallywags must raise the black flag
Project S The Series,This is one of the reasons why physical media still needs to be around.
Project S The Series,"Thing is, we're paying for these shows and movies twice now.  Once with our cable/streaming bills, and now Hollywood is double dipping by getting tax breaks for their expensive failures.

Hollywood is full of multi millionaires that take credit for other people's work and blame others for their own failures. It's amazing how the boomers are so thrilled with such an ass backwards system of worth and value."
Project S The Series,"I don't know why people look at me like I'm from Mars when I talk about this. Fine, use ""the cloud"" for backup and you exchange information, but keep your movies. Keep your music. Keep your family photos. To be dependent exclusively on some corporation keeping things running, holding up their end of the deal, not wrong writing the fine print to solely benefit them and not protect you, is preposterous. Is YOUR data. Keep it."
Project S The Series,"So the actors and anyone who receives residual payments from TV and Film are being snubbed because streaming services: 

A. Are beholden to shareholders and constant quarterly growth. 

B. Overspent on productions and need to reel in spending.

C. Are adding commercials but commercial profits are not offsetting anything cause shareholders need money. 

D. Are canceling shows after 2-3 seasons to keep cultivating super watched, (culturally talked about) shows to draw new viewers (accounts) to satiate shareholders. 


The best thing consumers can do is watch the shows they want then abruptly cancel until there shows season is back on."
Project S The Series,"The general public is dumping services they don’t use… it’s very easy to do. This is the nightmare scenario that they’ve been dreading sing everyone dumped cable services that could lock you in for years … 

I see big changes and more acquisitions on The horizon … look out for apple to buy a major player… thinking Sony … maybe Universal.  And of course Warner Bros is perpetually for sale . It’s all funny math."
Project S The Series,"There's lots of old HBO stuff that isn't on their streaming service. That was going to be one of the big draws for me, getting access to some of the stuff they made back in the 70s and 80s when it was still kind of an underground thing and they were getting weird with it.

Barring that, how about a full set of the One Night Stands they made back then? So many comedians who later made it big, those old standup sets are fun to see.

That stuff must just be sitting in their vaults, probably never to be seen again. I have to assume a lot of what they're making now, the same thing will happen."
Project S The Series,"I've come to that realization as well, there's already films and TV shows from the 90s/00s that can't be found anywhere online, stuff I assumed would be around forever in some form. Arrested Development is the latest casualty, Netflix is losing the rights, hopefully another service picks it up, but what about shows that can't find a new home online? They're just gone. Makes me wish I had hung onto more of my DVDs."
Project S The Series,"Before streaming thousands of shows got cancelled and they disapperead into the ether.  Series having proper endings and being able to watch is largely something fairly  new actually new to this century.  There's probably more shows now that survive a second life on streaming that would have just been plum forgotten by all but a handful of people had they existed 15-20 years earlier.  For example the Series  Big Wave Dave's was created  by  2 people who were showrunners for the Series Mash and also wrote a bunch of episodes of Cheers. It was cancelled after 6 episodes in the early 90's and dissapeared into the ether despite fairly noteworthy showrunners and 2 notable tv actor(adam arkin,kurtwood smith). Had it existed 2 decades later it would have been streamed somewhere and been allowed to existed beyond the initial few weeks it airred  on tv."
Project S The Series,"Yeah, it seems like they see more profit in selling their shows to other platforms after a while... hopefully this could also mean they might consider blu-ray releases... the only way to truly own something..."
Project S The Series,Over the last few years I've gone back to buying Blu rays just because I've lost trust in everything being available to me. The problem is fewer and fewer shows end up on Blu ray
Project S The Series,or what heppenes when one of the services goes bankrupt
Project S The Series,"That's kind of how it was sold to us tbh. ""The whole Paramount catalog on Paramount+!"" For example. They don't mention ""Until we stop paying for the licensing.""

What they should do is, when a series etc. Is due to go off the platform, add a ""Buy Blu-ray"" button. Then they just charge your card and ship it out to you. The caveat there is that it does take away some ability to lure people back to their platform if it returns, but I imagine not everyone would bother to buy the disc media anyway."
Project S The Series,"Imagine that you are in some place in the time, 10 or 15 years ago. That is the same problem with a lot of movies and shows but is not for streaming, is because there are no stock or phisical version.

So... what is the diference?"
Project S The Series,"Yes, that was very naive."
Project S The Series,you know where stuff doesn't disappear and it's actually well kept? Piracy sites.
Project S The Series,🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
Project S The Series,*Cough* pirating *cough*
Project S The Series,"As long as platforms have to pay to keep something on their catalog, they have no reason to do so eternally if it's profitable. The shows that are removed aren't (not watched enough compared to their licensing costs). That's the logical assumption, the other was just some misplaced hope not understanding how business works."
Project S The Series,Piracy
Project S The Series,"Just like projects being pulled, this has always happened and the only difference is visibility. We're more aware of it happening because things that were accessible to us are removed when in the past they just quietly disappeared from shelves and future projects get more publicity because it's a way to get people to subscribe for the upcoming stuff.

Calling it the ""hottest trend"", ""horrifying"" and a ""terrible practice"" as if it hasn't been part of the business forever is just ridiculous"
Project S The Series,"That’s remains my expectation. FOMO/vault strategies will get me to cancel. I was planning to resub to HBO for Last of Us, and the last 2 seasons of Westworld were part of my plan. Can’t watch that, and the service doesn’t have enough value for one active episode I care about a week. Didn’t resubscribe, and probably won’t until at least two seasons of TLOU are up. Needs to be worth the $15-30, and that’s not even close."
Project S The Series,"I went looking for some older war movies (battle of Britain, bridge too far, etc.) and I came to the conclusion I’m gonna have to get a DVD player and buy the DVDs if I want to watch them without ads or rent them every time."
Project S The Series,"I've never believed in the notion that you don't need to buy anything in physical form or download it to your own storage since there are so many streaming platforms and ""you could access anything at any time"". And now it's becoming more ans more evident that it's not true at all and you don't actually own the content even if you pay a mounthly fee."
Project S The Series,I remember my first day on the internet...
Project S The Series,Is there something like a Svalbard Seed Vault for films and series? I wonder...
Project S The Series,Ugh this is such a good movie
Project S The Series,"Any chance rights were bought with the full intention to ""make it disappear?""  or is that conspiracy theory BS?"
Project S The Series,[deleted]
Project S The Series,I’m sure I can find it in about 5 minutes sailing the high seas
Project S The Series,I'm still trying to track down The John Larroquette Show. It runs Sundays on RewindTV but I can't seem to find complete seasons streaming anywhere or on DVD.
Dont Dare to Dream,"> I honestly don't think it could survive the current model that streaming services have for sitcoms.

i mean, it barely survived the traditional model. the show was infamously almost cancelled after the first episode."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Networks have time slots to fill. So while a show might not have the best ratings, there is a chance it might get renewed because the network has so many slots to fill. It has to have something and it cost more money and time to develop a new show that might not turn out as good. They can also pair shows together  or move it to another night to help get it seen by another audience. 

With streaming they don’t have to worry about filling a time slot. If their formula shows the show is not making them money then they don’t have to worry about replacing that show. And since you watch it whenever, you can’t improve its viewership by moving the time slot or pairing it with a different show. They don’t have to say we need another comedy to fill on Thursday night. They will just go to the formula and say this show did not make us money and cancel it."
Dont Dare to Dream,"People used to say this about tv networks. Ten years ago, USA networks launched fifty-seven new shows in a season, and forty-three of them didn't make it past 22 episodes."
Dont Dare to Dream,"""it's quite disheartening to see a promising cast of actors, and veteran crews get so easily dumped and then shuffled around to the next project after only one season.""  


You basically described the entire network TV landscape up until streaming.  Go look at how many failed shows someone like Jay Harrington had before SWAT, and the sad thing is his comedies were much more fun in my mind.  Streaming services are littered with 1 or 2 season network comedies full of ""Oh hey I know that person"" faces.  


Even networks like HBO canceled shows with huge potential like Carnivale.  And they were the first network to really work out for profit TV, realizing that Arli$$ was reviled by most people, but had a hardcore group of fans that would cancel HBO over it.  They continued to air it because that segment of the business was too valuable to lose.  


The simple truth is some people probably do end a Netflix sub over canceling ""I Am Not Okay With This"" or whatever but not enough to make it worth bringing it back.  And several that do probably don't communicate as to why, except on message boards where they complain about a show they liked getting cut down early.  It's a lot easier to say ""Netflix cancels shows early"" and get people to agree than it is to say ""Netflix shouldn't have cancelled show X that I really liked, who wants to cancel their sub with me?"" and start a movement."
Dont Dare to Dream,"The streaming model doesn't work for sitcoms, sitcoms aren't supposed to be 10 episodes, they're supposed to fill some of the quiet spaces of life, and they certaintly aren't supposed to be ""the final season"" after just a couple years. People complain a lot about *filler* in streaming shows, the issue is sitcoms are mostly filler, they make their magic in the filler (Hell, we're talking about *the show about nothing*) 

Look at a show like Reboot which I thought was one of, if not the, best true sitcom that streaming had produced, but it was canceled after 8 episodes, that nothing for a sitcom. As much as I liked the show the payoffs that we got at the end of the season are nowhere close to earned. We're seeing the resolution of relationships when we should only just be fleshing out these relationships. Space Force was like this too, some people say less is more but Space Force proved that in a lot of cases, less is just less. When the show got canceled it still hadn't reached the number of episodes of an (old) regular network season, they were just starting to figure out the characters relationships and which ones worked well together. One of the best episodes was an odd couple pairing but we'd spent so little time seeing the characters with other people that we didn't realize it was an odd couple pairing. 

The other issue is sitcoms are punchline machines, they won't always have huge laughs but the punchline-per-minute rate is high. Streaming wants comedy-dramas, they want shows that can be nominated for Best Comedy regardless if it's that funny, as long as it gains some Tik Tok traction. 

Streaming has been a wasteland for sitcoms and has done the entire medium a diservice. Broadcast TV/network TV needs to be kept alive for that reason only. 


>On the reverse, I appreciate that streaming services are giving new life to shows that had a tough time on network television, (Community on Netflix springs to mind).

I mean sure but Netflix had nothing to do with Community being a great show. It was a great show on NBC."
Dont Dare to Dream,"They’re looking for *gold*, Jerry!"
Dont Dare to Dream,"Seinfeld, The Office, and Parks & Rec all benefited from time. All had a rocky first season, but started to come into their own by s2."
Dont Dare to Dream,"According to wikipedia, Cheers first season was ranked 74th out of 77 shows. No way would that survive streaming today."
Dont Dare to Dream,"As people have noted, networks historically have often canceled shows after just a few episodes, so it’s really nothing that new. I think the bigger issue with streaming, and now the broadcast networks, is that they have generally been waiting for the full season to be finished before releasing it (obviously Netflix has to because they release the full season at once.) This means they can’t adjust the show based on what people are responding to. Whereas the traditional 22 episode network model would start airing episodes when they had only taped maybe 7 or 8 of them, so if something stood out, they could start adjusting a show around it. 

In the drama world, there’s actually a great example of this on The Good Wife. The character Kalinda, the private investigator with a mysterious background, was one of the more extreme characters in that everyone else was very believable in the real word whereas she had a sort of ridiculous spy background to her… but she was grounded enough that you could go with it. But then in one season they introduce her ex husband and it just got so out there and people just didn’t buy it and hated the storyline and character. You can tell the episode they were writing when the showrunners realized the fan feedback was too much because that episode he unceremoniously disappears and is never mentioned again. If they had done the whole season in advance, fans would have dropped off because they couldn’t stand the storyline. And the creators/showrunners are on the record saying they misjudged the character and listened to the fan response by ending the storyline earlier than they had originally planned."
Dont Dare to Dream,Thank producer Rick Ludwin for saving Seinfeld. The show was going to get canceled but he convinced the NBC brass that the show was different and should give it more time.
Dont Dare to Dream,Sitcom was notoriously easy to kill. Back in the days lots of sitcoms were cancelled after bombing the first few episodes. There is always a Mid season replacement waiting in line.
Dont Dare to Dream,Ah so maybe I shouldn’t have given up a few episodes in.
Dont Dare to Dream,Weren't a bunch of shows cancelled after one season before streaming?
Dont Dare to Dream,"Always sunny wouldnt survive today either, only survived because they had someone at FX go to bat for them. They had to put a big name in season 2 and Danny DeVito was a godsend, not only as Frank Reynolds but for publicity aswell"
Dont Dare to Dream,"During its original broadcast run, I watched an episode of the first season of Seinfeld and gave up. It was only when there was an amazing run of water-cooler talk about The Contest that I tuned back in and loved it. I remember that there was an impressive variety of people telling me I needed to start watching the show - - young and old, black and white, male and female, conservative and liberal. But this was pre-internet; people with diverse viewpoints lining up around a common opinion doesn’t exist any more."
Dont Dare to Dream,"You also had a situation where the main character was a terrible actor. Dreyfus, Richards and Alexander had to do the heavy lifting there."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Not enough viewers will do a show in, but I would argue poor quality is less of a problem in streaming. Streaming isn’t great for comedy because it gives fewer episodes and less time to figure out the rhythms and dynamics that work. A good run for a streaming comedy can be like 5 seasons and 60 episodes, which is where a lot of network comedies really find their groove.

Streamers let plenty of mediocre comedies get a second season because that is really mostly all they produce with comedy."
Dont Dare to Dream,"almost nothing made 20, 30 years ago would survive today's fast paced, schizophrenic way of making tv"
Dont Dare to Dream,"This is why I’m so shocked that HIMYF was renewed for a second season. The first season was only 8 episodes and you barely got to know the cast of characters and allowed them to mesh together before the season was over. 

S2 just aired its 8th episode last week and they still have 8 to go for the season. I think they are finally finding their groove, last weeks episode was the funniest episode yet. 

I’m glad Hulu gave it a chance because I’ve missed these kind of sitcoms!"
Dont Dare to Dream,"People love to throw around the idea that a show will take half a decade to figure out what it’s doing and I’ve always found that bizarre. It’s weird to continue spending money on something that didn’t work the first time, and it’s weird to expect someone to watch a show for five years before it even gets good."
Dont Dare to Dream,I disagree.  The things that don't survive today have huge budgets.  Something like Seinfeld could stick around because of how cheap the early seasons were
Dont Dare to Dream,"I feel like the television landscape was way more ruthless before streaming. Back in those days, you’d have tons of new shows premiering every season and only a small percentage of them would make it past the pilot. If a show’s pilot didn’t attract viewers, it was most likely dead.

Now a lot of shows have their entire first season released at once. Sure, lots of them get canceled, but at the very least they have a full season’s worth of episodes, which is more than most shows got back in the pre-streaming days."
Dont Dare to Dream,By today's standards Seinfeld would have been canceled after the first season.
Dont Dare to Dream,"The pilot episode of MacGyver involved him tracking down a potent weapon system that had been stolen. He then had to disable them by removing a certain component. 

He did so using a specialized tool that he'd brought along designed just for maintenance of these weapons, because it required the specially made tool and figuring out an alternative wasn't feasible. In other words, the pilot episode of MacGyver featured an element that specifically could not be MacGyvered. 

In other words, not every show starts out featuring its eventually successful formula; many shows find that successful formula along the way."
Dont Dare to Dream,Seinfeld and David were smart enough to know that their reruns would be in HD someday in the future so they used the very expensive 35mm technicolor film instead of videotape. Now their reruns can be shown in full HD 16:9 aspect ratio….that’s why the show looks so good today. Brilliant forward looking men.
Dont Dare to Dream,Seasons 1 and 2 were the worst. Season 3 was hit or miss. Season 4 was when the show got better. How this show never was cancelled though in the first 2 seasons remains a mystery...but it turned out to be a blessing.
Dont Dare to Dream,"I feel like your initial statement about Seinfeld isn't widely held. *I* found Seinfeld funny from the beginning. It's one of the *few* purely comedic shows that i can watch these days. 

There are *many* shows out there that have a first season that's compelling enough to want more.

If you have to say 'if you can get through the first season, it's a great show' *it's not a great show*. 

Every new show that catches my eye gets 2 episodes from me. I'm quite forgiving. I can *tell* when a cast is going to gel together. I can *tell* when a show is well written or *can* be well written."
Dont Dare to Dream,"> Seinfeld's first season was rocky...

This is such bs. What current sitcom/comedy show in the last 10 years even comes close to Seinfeld s1?"
Dont Dare to Dream,I didn’t like it anyway
Dont Dare to Dream,I often don’t watch stuff that I only kind of want to see as they cancel so much and leave them on cliffhangers and I find it annoying. I wait a bit to see what they are going to do
Dont Dare to Dream,"Okay, but which sitcoms now are being experimental? I don't think experimental even gets to screen."
Dont Dare to Dream,"..same thing happened with Cheers, it had fairly low ratings its first season, but went on to become a top rated comedy in later seasons...

Time is money, and with the high costs of producing shows today, I doubt the ""sink or swim"" corporate mentality is going away. A lot of potentially good shows will see the chopping block before getting a chance to really shine."
Dont Dare to Dream,About to finish watching Seinfeld and it really change around 6 or 7 again and had an interesting transition season but still held up enough and makes for a great show even decades later
Dont Dare to Dream,The Office is another example of many. First season just doesn't compare to what came after.
Dont Dare to Dream,"Yeah, there are some gems but it doesn't really get consistently good until halfway through Season 3 in my opinion. No way would it have lasted this long today."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Well the Office was the same thing, it has always been said that the first season was one of the weakest ones and that it massively improved to the classic that many people love."
Dont Dare to Dream,"I started watching Seinfeld over as it'd been many many years and after a few episodes in season 1 i thought ""was i wrong in loving this show?"" ... i randomly found one i liked from a later season and it clicked again. Season 1 is almost listless..."
Dont Dare to Dream,But how do we get networks to realize this without sounding like we'd need to be supposedly-precognitive-or-time-travelers telling them a show they would otherwise cancel after one season would be guaranteed to be the Seinfeld of its genre if left to go
Dont Dare to Dream,Streaming seems less brutal to me than late 90s/early 2000s network days. Sometimes only 2 episodes would see the light of day. Plus they relied on Neilsen families instead of the analytics used today.
Dont Dare to Dream,"I only found myself enjoying Seinfeld starting with season 3. The first season is painful, whilst the second is a marked improvement, but not quite there yet. Season 3 is when the show really hits its stride, and season 4 is the highpoint for me, though what comes after is still pretty great."
Dont Dare to Dream,"100% dead on Netflix and Hulu. I mean it’s Netflix and they stuck. Plus Hulu canceled a really good comedy recently so I don’t trust them. 

I think hbo and apple both would have given it a second season."
Dont Dare to Dream,"I think the bigger change is the loss of ""seasons"". It used to be that shows would do badly in September and get pulled off the schedule, and then get a second chance as a midseason replacement or getting burned off in the summer. Also media companies nowadays are much more ""vertical"". There used to be rules in place that a network couldn't produce more than a certain percentage of their broadcast content in-house, so you'd have WB or Paramount shopping around different shows to different networks to see what stuck."
Dont Dare to Dream,Larry David quit most of the seasons.  I read once the entire cast had to drive to his house one year just to convince him to come back.
Dont Dare to Dream,"It has the shortest first season episode order in network history at 6 episodes, and that alone should be clue enough."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Seinfeld is just one of many examples of shows that took a season to find its feet though. The Office, Parks and Rec, heck even Breaking Bad."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Yeah, OP basically just discovered the history of television. 999/1000 times, the Seinfeld pilot is just the end of things because it wasn't very good and it got burned off in the summer to no fanfare. There just happened to be one guy who believed in it and said take the money I have in my budget and make four more episodes. Second chances like that for failed pilots were extraordinarily rare."
Dont Dare to Dream,"M\*A\*S\*H was almost cancelled after one season. It got poor ratings, and the only reason they renewed it was because the wife of one of the network executives was a fan of the show, and convinced him to renew it. In its second season it was moved to a different time slot and given a big marketing push, and became one of the top rated shows on tv."
Dont Dare to Dream,Yea it’s not like television has a long storied history of cranking out Seinfelds.  It was a miracle they squeaked out the one.     And thinking about this makes me wonder if there were 100 other Seinfeld caliber shows that never got made because they didnt meet the crazy executive who would dare take a chance on them.    Tldr: tv sucks
Dont Dare to Dream,"You know what else killed off the sitcom? Reality and competition shows. Sitcoms are cheaper to produce than dramas, so a lot of sitcoms were produced to fill crappy timeslots. 

&#x200B;

Consider the legendary NBC brotherhood of man advertisement: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJuAvwtmXuw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJuAvwtmXuw)

&#x200B;

At the time, NBC had 8 sitcoms: 

* 30 Rock
* The Office 
* Parks and Recreation
* Community
* Parenthood
* Are You There, Chelsea
* Whitney
* Up All Night

&#x200B;

Now compare that to the current NBC lineup: 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_programs\_broadcast\_by\_NBC](https://www.nbc.com/schedule)

&#x200B;

Their comedy lineup is down to 5. While they have 13 reality and competition shows. 

&#x200B;

Sitcoms were generally cheaper to produce - You had to pay for the actors, writers, and crew, but they were much cheaper than dramas. You didn't need as many sets, special effects, etc, etc. 

&#x200B;

But then, reality and competition shows are even cheaper than the sitcom. So garbage timeslots got filled by those instead."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Jason Alexander said this after his follow up to Seinfeld, *Bob Patterson*, was cancelled after a few episodes 20 years ago"
Dont Dare to Dream,22 episodes is like 3 Netflix seasons
Dont Dare to Dream,"Yeah the whole streaming is cancelling shows discourse we've had has to be done by people which just discovered TV in the last few years lol (so like 13-years old at most, that's the level of that analysis). It has always been this way. Unsuccessful shows getting cancelled happened all the time since like the 90s at least (I didn't really follow TV before but I'm sure it was the same). 

Hell sometimes, they were cancelled after like one episode or two lol. 

Same for shows disappearing into the ether (legally), that was also the case. Try to find legal ways to watch episodes of all those shows cancelled in the middle of their first seasons.

I do agree with the post that the streaming model is weirdly inappropriate for new sitcomes to emerge which ironic considering they're often some of the most popular programs on those services (perfect for background comfort watches which help shows with nostalgia built in like all the older sitcoms)"
Dont Dare to Dream,"Being from Europe, I was surprised to learn just how many shows the US puts out that never make it past the first season or pilot! We only know about the successes!"
Dont Dare to Dream,What percentage of Netflix originals make it past 22 episodes? Gotta be a tiny number
Dont Dare to Dream,">You basically described the entire network TV landscape up until streaming.

I mean, it was basically a running joke for years that if your show was on Fox, you were on the bubble before the pilot even aired."
Dont Dare to Dream,">Go look at how many failed shows someone like Jay Harrington had before SWAT, and the sad thing is his comedies were much more fun in my mind

TIL he has a successful show now. Good for him, better off Ted was way way way too good of a show"
Dont Dare to Dream," Most British Sitcoms seem to be incredibly short in comparison. Both in season length and number of seasons. The IT crowd was 6 episodes a season for 4 seasons for example. 

My guess is that the American sitcom writers aren't used to having such little time."
Dont Dare to Dream,">Look at a show like Reboot which I thought was one of, if not the, best true sitcom that streaming had produced, but it was canceled after 8 episodes, that nothing for a sitcom. As much as I liked the show the payoffs that we got at the end of the season are nowhere close to earned. We're seeing the resolution of relationships when we should only just be fleshing out these relationships. Space Force was like this too, some people say less is more but Space Force proved that in a lot of cases, less is just less. When the show got canceled it still hadn't reached the number of episodes of an (old) regular network season, they were just starting to figure out the characters relationships and which ones worked well together. One of the best episodes was an odd couple pairing but we'd spent so little time seeing the characters with other people that we didn't realize it was an odd couple pairing.

Also YouTube and short-form content have taken over the mindless environment that sitcoms used to fill."
Dont Dare to Dream,"> The streaming model doesn't work for sitcoms, sitcoms aren't supposed to be 10 episodes, they're supposed to fill some of the quiet spaces of life, and they certaintly aren't supposed to be ""the final season"" after just a couple years. People complain a lot about filler in streaming shows, the issue is sitcoms are mostly filler, they make their magic in the filler (Hell, we're talking about the show about nothing) 

Rights for The Office had an utterly massive bidding war and it was consistently one of the most watched shows while it was on Netflix.

I'm frankly surprised more of the streamers haven't tried to crank out a reasonable cost episodic sitcom."
Dont Dare to Dream,"The filler thing is a big one, modern TV doesn't do filler anymore (and that's valid for dramas too there's no more X-Files, Star Trek or Stargate episodic stuff (Strange New Worlds is that much more at least)."
Dont Dare to Dream,[deleted]
Dont Dare to Dream,"I really enjoyed Reboot, and it's also like a perfect example of why sitcoms need more time. Like we start with the conflict between the millenial/zoomer writers and the old school guys from the original and there's so much potential for stuff happening there. But we don't see any of it, they're just magically all BFFs at the end"
Dont Dare to Dream,"> (Hell, we're talking about the show about nothing) 

It's not really that though. That was closer to Larry David's original conception, but Seinfeld really is just a commentary on the minutia of life, little things that make you go 'huh, what's up with that?'. 

Plenty of things happen in Seinfeld, it's pretty active"
Dont Dare to Dream,How do we change this without bankrupting all those services?
Dont Dare to Dream,"> Space Force was like this too, some people say less is more but Space Force proved that in a lot of cases, less is just less.

One of the best episodes was an odd couple pairing but we'd spent so little time seeing the characters with other people that we didn't realize it was an odd couple pairing.

Space Force was given 2 years and 10 episodes to figure this all out after Season 1 came out. If the writers still haven't figured out this all out by the start of Season 2, that's all on the writers."
Dont Dare to Dream,"The Simpsons, too—and even shows like Star Trek: The Next Generation."
Dont Dare to Dream,"M\*A\*S\*H was similar, at #46 in its first season."
Dont Dare to Dream,That wouldn't survive in any format today.
Dont Dare to Dream,It almost didn't survive 1983
Dont Dare to Dream,"Unfortunately he passed a couple years ago, and IMO never really got his due for saving Seinfeld and Conan. Both Seinfeld and Conan are very generous with their praise for him, but lots of other people have been able to successfully claim credit for the success of Seinfeld. Ludwin remained in his role as head of late night until the Jay Leno debacle ended with Jay returning to the Tonight Show and he had Ludwin pushed out of his job."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Always Sunny in Philadelphia also had a rough first season, one of the producers gave it another season and convinced the heads to spend some money to hire Danny Devito to give it star power.

Really, a good producer is what can make or break a show. It's true for network TV, it's probably true for streaming as well."
Dont Dare to Dream,Try again but maybe start at s2. After that it just keep getting better and better.
Dont Dare to Dream,Like the other people said it’s not a show with a ton of continuity. You can very easily jump into like season 5 watch a highly rated episode and see if you like it. Pretty much any episode that has George’s parents is gold. And they only show up after season 4 I think.
Dont Dare to Dream,"I remember hearing that Devito was getting shoe horned into the show and thought "" man only one season in and they already jumped the shark""

How wrong I was. 

Easily one of the best cast additions in the history of TV."
Dont Dare to Dream,"That show has so many different things that happened that made it happen.  Its crazy.  They reshot that pilot in Charlie's apartment 40 times before they tried to shop it.  They saved a lot of money by not listening to people and doing things the correct way.  They got their talented friends to play characters on the show.  Oh and obviously, Charlie is just crazy talented.  I don't think Sunny would even exist without Charlie."
Dont Dare to Dream,"I think you’ll see universal praise for a sitcom as soon as we get a new sitcom that’s as good as Seinfeld.

So probably never then."
Dont Dare to Dream,"I mean, in my opinion, that sometimes made the show funnier"
Dont Dare to Dream,Was he really that bad? I thought he was at least passable for a sitcom.
Dont Dare to Dream,"A lot of shows built around comedians have that problem, especially at the beginning."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Let's be clear, Jerry Seinfeld has never acted a day in his life."
Dont Dare to Dream,"I only realized this on rewatch of Seinfeld recently. Not only is Jerry bad, half the time it doesn't even look like he's trying."
Dont Dare to Dream,S2 still has 12 episodes left to go after episode 8
Dont Dare to Dream,"The pilot episode of MacGyver also had him shooting a gun, an element dropped from later episodes of the series as the character's no gun rule became canon."
Dont Dare to Dream,They are zoomed in 16x9. They were not filmed with this aspect ratio. Lots of stuff actually gets cut off because of it.
Dont Dare to Dream,"Wasn’t film what most network sitcoms at the time used, no? The VHS market didn’t even exist for tv shows really. DVD was no where close, let alone box sets of tv shows. I doubt the almost cancelled sitcom was thinking ahead about tech and a market that didn’t even exist."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Seinfeld didn't shoot on Technicolor. I don't think *any* show ever shot Technicolor; it started dying off in the 50s, the last US facility capable of processing it shut down in the 70s, and the last Technicolor facility in the world (a tiny building in China) shut down right before Seinfeld started. The last movie to shoot Technicolor in the United States was The Godfather Part II (1974) and they had to pay through the nose to get it processed, to keep a visual match with the first movie, which itself was deliberately using an antiquated technique to give it a period look. Seinfeld shot using Agfa until that was depleted (having been discontinued before they began) and then C41, IIRC."
Dont Dare to Dream,"No, that view is actually more common than you'd think. In fact, the first season had absolutely terrible ratings. I think the OP is right that it would have been cancelled quickly these days."
Dont Dare to Dream,">If you have to say 'if you can get through the first season, it's a great show' it's not a great show.

Completely disagree on this. Seinfeld season one is not great but the show is great. Star Trek: TNG is great but the first season sucks balls. There are plenty of other examples of long running classic TV shows that change enormously for the better after rocky first seasons showed them what wasn't working."
Dont Dare to Dream,"""I found Seinfeld funny from the beginning.""

I agree with this. I don't recall anyone who didn't like Seinfeld from the start, it was just hard to find people who had seen it. Sitcoms were divided between the saccharine stuff from the 80s and the iconoclastic stuff that was coming in, and Seinfeld had its own little niche."
Dont Dare to Dream,It was funny in season 1 but it did really bad ratings wise. It was on the verge of cancellation back then. So I think it’s a safe assumption it would not have survived in this era of streaming.
Dont Dare to Dream,"Off the top of my head recent sitcoms that totally obliterate it include What We Do in the Shadows, Kevin Can Fuck Himself, The Righteous Gemstones, Atlanta."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Jerry once said that the show was a failure for more than half of its run.

The issue is that this sort of thing is really difficult to predict, and expensive to miss on over and over. And no show can be as profitable as Seinfeld anymore. Syndication and ratings aren't the same."
Dont Dare to Dream,5 episodes: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld_(season_1)
Dont Dare to Dream,"Seinfeld had enough naysayers at NBC who said that it could never be popular as the humor was ""too New York"" and ""too Jewish"". but there also were people who believed in the show and the reaction to the pilot was good (there was that thing when they could call you to ask if you watched a pilot and your reaction to it, turned out those who watched Seinfeld liked it) so they decided to continue."
Dont Dare to Dream,"Breaking Bad certainly evolved from season 1, but it was by no means a bad or even mediocre season."
Dont Dare to Dream,"> heck even Breaking Bad.

I don't agree with this, there was nothing bad about the first season."
Dont Dare to Dream,oof yeah parks season 1 is rough. The office season 1 is great though IMO. Diversity day and basketball are A+
Dont Dare to Dream,Sunny’s first season is a little off because no Frank.
Dont Dare to Dream,"Parks and Rec only became good starting with season 3 imo, incredible it lasted 2 seasons with the original love interest"
Dont Dare to Dream,I’d take season one of BB over season 5.

My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Mandela Effect. Swear this man was gone.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"This is awful, but I seriously had no idea he was even still alive. I remember him retiring, for some reason I thought he also died 😬"
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I apologize for this and hope nothing happens. BUT Bob dying at 99 would be a fun little coincidence
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Shares a birthday with Frank Sinatra and is only 8 years older than him.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I thought he died a while ago tbh.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I thought he was dead.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,He's still alive?
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"“The price is wrong bitch”

My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"Shit, I’d have bet good money he died during Covid. Funny, I somehow didn’t hear about Sean Connery dying until months later, and now I’m surprised Bobs still kicking."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Probably still sexually harassing women

My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"One dollar, Bob."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Literally watching Happy Gilmore as I come across this
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I wonder if he is like my vehicle and won’t let himself go over 100.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Does DraftKings of any other of those mobile betting sites have dead pools? Asking for a friend
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,He is still alive?????!!!!!!
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"Wait.. WHAT?!

I honestly thought he died like 5-10 years ago.. I’m extremely happy he’s alive and kicking, but holy fuck.. I swear I saw numerous articles stating that he died. 

I watched him with my great-grandpa every single day as a kid, and he’s always been a legend to me, I’m talking like.. Steve Irwin, Bob Ross, & Mr. Rogers level of magnitude."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Similar age as Betty White.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Bob Barker is 2023’s Betty White.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Christine McVie is dead but Bob Barker lives. Life is not fair.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Give it up. He’s dead.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Is this the Bob Barker that makes shitty jail products?
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,here's proof that staying active extends life. he could have retired a long time ago but kept at it
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"My first words were ""Bob Barker.""

I watched a lot of television as a kid."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"I attended the same high school as Bob Barker, much later, of course.  He came back for a visit while I was there, though.  Cool guy."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I still remember watching the price is right every now and then with my Mom and Grandma. Fun memories! :)
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"That man is a legend. I was watching some of his previous work over the last few weeks including the old intros with Rod Roddy and his predecessor what's his name. AND NOW, THE STAR OF OUR SHOW...BOBBBBBB BARKER!"

Happy birthday Bob!"
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,That vegan diet baby
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"I thought he died years ago. 

But the show should definitely do something for him for his 100th."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"Bob’s girlfriend is 20 years younger than him.  Maybe at their current ages of 99 and 79 that isn’t a huge gap. However, they’ve been together for 40 years. That means when they first got together Bob was 59 and she was 39.  

Bob likes younger women- *clutches pearls*"
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,When he hits 100 will someone give him $1000 and a bonus spin?
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,ONE DOLLAR!
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,100 is the closest you can get to 100 without going over
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"C'mon, Bob! We were denied Betty White... do this for you, for her, for us! Make it!"
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,$1 Bob!
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I bid... ONE DOLLAR.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Betty white will hold that title for a while I think. 17 days from 100 years old.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Last year he can play with Legos.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Hmm…what about 99 and a half?
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Big if true
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,99 is as close as you can get to 100 without getting your eyes wet
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,I bid $1.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"1$, Bob"
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,r/angryupvote
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Nah 99 years 11 months 3 weeks 38 hours 56 seconds is the closest you can get before going over.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,And he takes 1 prescription pill.  That's insane.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Happy Gilmore less so.
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"I was watching this in awe at how the price of some things has changed dramatically, while others have stayed the same.

Like a microwave used to be $5,000 but Geritol has been holding steady at $2.99 since 1942."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"Not a bad idea for a channel, since that range gives them 280 days straight of no repeats (6,726 episodes 24 hours a day)."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,Pluto TV
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,"Early Bob Barker is a little weird to watch in this day and age. 

He definitely smooches every young, attractive white woman who walks up but will avoid showing any familiarity with women of colour or less attractive ones.

70s game show TV is weird in a bad way."
My Girlfriend Is a Gumiho,You also get to see him mack on every woman that makes it on stage.

Suspicious Partner,"I thought the point of the show was really more about the dilemmas and themes in it, the discussions that the investigators and lawyers are having, and not really about the mystery. Kind of like noir. ""Whodunnit?"" isn't really important. 

**Edit**: 

If I could compare it to another show, it's a lot like House. House had a simple episode structure as well.

* Opens with someone being struck down by a mystery illness

* No one can figure it out

* House does something whacky and/or ethically questionable

* They go through a couple incorrect diagnoses, and things get worse before they get better

* House figures it out during some ""Eureka!"" moment in an unrelated conversation.

But of course the interesting thing about House was not the audience trying to somehow guess the mystery illness (unless you're really into medicine or something). The mystery illness is just a setting to explore other themes (in the early days of House it was usually some moral question).

Suspicious Partner,"I always felt that the script was boilerplate with fill in the blanks ... much more interesting and significant cop shows were Homicide Life on the Street, The Wire (both from the same mind), a new one from BBC, Luther (main actor was a significant actor in The Wire, didn't realize he was a brit at the time). Also am enjoying Person of Interest, the second season is getting interesting, but I do not put it on the same plane with the others mentioned.

These are far better than most other popular crimes shows, NCIS xx, CSI xx, Criminal Minds, etc. They are fun for mindless, time killing entertainment, but do not have the depth of plot and writing that the aforementioned have."

Beautiful Gong Shim,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Beautiful Gong Shim,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Beautiful Gong Shim,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Beautiful Gong Shim,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Beautiful Gong Shim,Yellowjackets?
Beautiful Gong Shim,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Beautiful Gong Shim,Why?
Beautiful Gong Shim,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Beautiful Gong Shim,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Beautiful Gong Shim,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Beautiful Gong Shim,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Beautiful Gong Shim,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Beautiful Gong Shim,Ted Lasso anybody?
Beautiful Gong Shim,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Beautiful Gong Shim,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Beautiful Gong Shim,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Beautiful Gong Shim,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Beautiful Gong Shim,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Beautiful Gong Shim,Nordic shows are great
Beautiful Gong Shim,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Beautiful Gong Shim,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Beautiful Gong Shim,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Beautiful Gong Shim,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Beautiful Gong Shim,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.

Doctors,"Despite a chaotic life w/ severe issues, & wandering through substance abuse a few times, he is & was a creative talent & strong screen presence. Today my intent is to recall where I’ve seen him in the screen.

He was always a great supporting character. 

Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991), Passenger 57 (1992), True Romance (1993), Natural Born Killers (1994), Strange Days (1995), Heat (1995), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Red Planet (2000), Black Hawk Down (2001), Pearl Harbor (2001) and the revival television series Twin Peaks (2017), and for voicing Sonny Forelli in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

Very sad to hear doctors saying there is no hope for Sizemore to rebound from the aneurysm & stroke. God bless, hope he is feeling comfortable, safe & loved."
Doctors,"Brain aneurysms are terrifying. A kid in high school started complaining of a headache one morning. Bad enough to go to the nurse by lunch. You could hear him crying out in pain by the end of lunch (it was a small school). He was dead by that evening. 

Any time I’ve gotten a serious headache since I hear his cries echoing down the school hallway (it was a small school, we had one hallway)."
Doctors,"""For me, the action is the juice."""
Doctors,"There was this moment on Celebrity Rehab Season 3 where Tom was bawling while watching a video showing everyone in rehab when they were young. While he's being comforted he cries ""did you see how young we used to be? did you see how young we used to be?""

The way he was clearly mourning both youth, innocence, and everything he had lost during his life shook me as a kid. A haunting mix of crushing regret and amazement at remembering who he once was."
Doctors,My sister met him at a half way house visiting her friend going through something similar around like 2003/2004.She said  he was very kind and gave her a very  dated headshot with him on a Harley and signed it for her. Dudes a tortured artist addiction sucks and when you think your in the clear health complications come at you.
Doctors,"Well, that's certainly sad news. :("
Doctors,Most recently saw him in a rep screening of Strange Days. Fucking presence and a half. This sucks.
Doctors,I still remember him acting alongside Johnny Knoxville in *Big Trouble*. It was always such a fun movie and he really owned his scenes.
Doctors,"The interview he did on Howard Stern around...2007? Maybe ? Where he is obviously on or comming off something was a shame to see . ( they used to show some interviews of the Stern show on a video subscription service ) . He had sweated through his dress shirt so badly they gave him a new one mid interview.

He was such a great actor . Great in Private Ryan."
Doctors,He is so god damn funny in True Romance for few minutes of screen time he has
Doctors,"Such a huge screen presence and immensely talented dude, all struggles aside. So bummed for him and his family but grateful for all his great work he shared with us."
Doctors,Sad news :(
Doctors,RIP
Doctors,"Damn. I thought he’d at least outlive Gary Busey. Great actor, wish he had beaten his demons"
Doctors,"I know he had his personal demons but damn what an ugly way to go, especially at age 61. RIP Tom."

When I look back at his body of work, I am astounded at all the amazing films he was a part of. RIP a true badass. 


What an amazing career."
Doctors,The dude had some severe abise problems. On Celebrity rehab he was down pretty bad
Doctors,"""Captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset..... """
Doctors,RIP to Nick mullens dear friend
Doctors,Tom Sizemore made acting look easy. Such an amazing talent like he wasn’t even trying as he played great supporting character after character in so many movies. His onscreen chemistry with Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan is a masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great supporting actor. I’m going to miss seeing this guy onscreen. After his lowest low he worked hard to keep it clean for many years. That should be an inspiration in it of itself for many struggling today.
Doctors,Rest In Peace Sarge.
Doctors,"Yesterday I was watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" and today this news."
Doctors,"For as troubled of a life as he lived, he still managed to make it to 61. I know that’s still pretty young, but I doubt that he ever expected to make it to this age. I hope that the stigma of his substance abuse and addiction will fade and that the true brilliance of his ability will forever shine as his legacy. I hope and wish that his passing is as pain free and peaceful as possible. ❤️"
Doctors,"Lana: What's your third biggest fear? 
 
Archer: Brain aneurysm. 
 
Lana: What's a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp? 
 
Archer: Nothing, it can happen anywhere at anytime, that's what makes it so terrifying"
Doctors,"Whats more tragic, the news or OP karma whoring every big story on this subreddit. Like it’s seriously all the top page news is by one user"
Doctors,RIP.. Some people just have IT. Whatever IT is you notice it immediately and never forget it. He probably could have been as big as any actor of his time if it weren't for his demons. But maybe that's what makes them great... Not unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Doctors,"Thats sad to hear :(

I spent many hours editing his dialogue for an indie film “Durants Never Closes” (last check was on prime video). The set was in an echo chamber and writing was low low budget, but Tom’s performance was great.

I forced my friends to watch it and suffer some of my pain"
Doctors,Black hawk down and saving private Ryan are 2 of my favourite films.. neither would be the same without him!
Doctors,"Ah damn, fucking shame. I know the dude had crazy problems, I hope he had some peace in the past few years"
Doctors,"That sucks but, if it is the right decision them they should be able to make it without any backlash."
Doctors,Any day you can go. It’s just the reality of life. We aren’t going to make it.
Doctors,"Well talk about highs and lows, from being a great supporting actor, to drugs and being a porn star, he lived it all."
Doctors,"This is how my dad died, it's such a traumatic experience for the family so my thoughts are with them. I'll always love him for his roles, especially as Milo in Heart and Soul is where I first saw him as a kid.

Especially this iconic scene: https://youtu.be/65eOaOTeyng"
Doctors,"61 years old, crap. That's pretty much my age..."
Doctors,He was one of the most underrated actors of his generation. NBK would be nothing without him.
Doctors,"First noticed him in Devil In A Blue Dress. After that I looked for Tom Sizemore credits in movies. If he was in it, I was watching it. I’m amazed how many really good movies he’s in.

He’s already missed."
Doctors,True romance. Stand out performance. Surprised more people haven't seen that movie.
Doctors,Man had a rough life. Very sad.
Doctors,"“Well ya know, for me, the action is the juice. I’m in.”

https://youtu.be/t2ojmr1gDrY"
Doctors,Nothing takes 5 minutes.
Doctors,"“ I like this Clarence kid, this f*cking guy is crazy!”"
Doctors,I saw him way back on the celebrity rehab show. Heartbreaking
Doctors,"“I gotta a pocket full of cash and a heart full of desire.. it’s like a mailbox, you open it up and put whatever you want inside.” His always sunny appearance is something I’ll never forget"
Doctors,Damn. That’s awful. He’s probably my favorite character in Saving Private Ryan.
Doctors,"He's a really great actor, even though he wasn't a major star his screen presence was undeniable. Loved him in enemy of the state and saving private Ryan."
Doctors,Really liked him in black hawk down and saving private ryan
Doctors,Sizemore was so GOOD. I don't understand how he was so wasted most of the time but shooting a movie he was great. He worked a lot too.
Doctors,Damn I knew Major Toms brain would eventually explode from all the blow he did
Doctors,How come no one’s mentioned his XXX career? He brought a professionalism into porn like Felini  in 9mm
Doctors,Karma finally came to claim him. I have no sympathy for domestic abusers.
Doctors,A voice of my childhood. That was my money Tommy!
Doctors,"No matter his past issues,he is/was a talented actor.My 2 Favorite roles were in Heat and SPR.He always played the badass/No BS characters who had their bosses back,like the way Horvath went after Reiben.Top Honorable Mention goes to his part in Black Hawk Down as the Commander.Very sad news."
Doctors,His cameo in Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia was funny as hell.
Doctors,"Damn, didn’t even know he was hospitalized."
Doctors,This deeply saddens me. I just watched Strange Days for the first time Saturday. Had no idea he had such a large role. Killer flick
Doctors,"Loved him in The Relic as the superstitious detective in Chicago, or with Robert Downey Jr in Hearts and Souls."
Doctors,RIP Tommy
Doctors,"Oh man, Sgagnetti!"
Doctors,"Great actor, troubled man. I enjoyed his performances but wish he had found peace."
Doctors,"I remember the utter crucifixion this guy went through whenever he was going through the worst parts of his struggle with addiction. He was a great actor, had some personal demons, but his actions then seem to kinda pale in comparison to what some actors do these days and get away with with seemingly nothing more than a slap on the wrist from production teams."
Doctors,"This is sad. I know he had his issues but some of his body of work is fantastic. I loved him as The Gent in Hellride.

[EDIT] Omg, I'm an idiot. That was Michael Madson and not Tom. Regardless, Tom was great."
Doctors,darn 61 is too young for anyone
Doctors,A friend of mine died in the 5th grade from one of these. Still can hit home as we weren’t ready for that kind of thing at age 10-11.
Doctors,"True Romance, Natural Born Killers, Heat, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Enemy of the State....etc....no matter how big or small the role, he always was 100% and was always memorable.  It's so awful how addiction got a hold of him and just wouldn't let go. I have always rooted for him."
Doctors,I thought he was dead long ago. Lots of addiction issues
Doctors,"I will always remember his cameo in Point Break. The way he says ""3 months"" has been seared into my brain ever since I saw the film in the 90s. I also just watch The Relic where he plays one of the most believable cops to come out of the late 90s."
Doctors,"He was so good in Saving Private Ryan, it’s sad to lose his talent"
Doctors,Damn. He’s one of the best supporting actors in the business IMO. So many great films that his performances contributed to in a big way.
Doctors,"A friend of mine directed a movie he was in about 5 or 6 years ago and had nothing but wonderful things to say. Even though it was a low budget horror flick, he treated it like any other movie and gave it his all."
Doctors,Great actor.  I hope he found peace before the stroke.  I hope he knows how many fans he had of his work.
Doctors,I’m not one who thinks someone should have their sins follow them the rest of their life - but I never looked at the guy the same after [this story was published.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/tom-sizemore-was-removed-movie-set-allegedly-violating-11-year-old-girl-1057629/amp/)
Doctors,Really enjoyed his performance in The Relic.
Doctors,The family is asking for privacy at this time so we published an article detailing the private happenings and agonizing decision they’re being asked to make by doctors.
Doctors,I have empathy for his family but not much else. He was a despicable human. There are credible accusations of him being asked to leave a production he was in after he molested an 11 year old girl with multiple witnesses present. And inb4 people say he struggled with addiction and had his demons; there’s no excuse for doing something like that.
Doctors,"I can’t believe he has lived this long. Either way, thanks for entertaining us Tom."
Doctors,"Ive always been torn because he’s in one of my fav movies, Strange Days. But he also molested a child and or children. So yeah…"
Doctors,It’s sad that all his achievements are diminished by being an abuser.
Doctors,Fuck this dude. He was a child molester
Doctors,"Shame, great actor but also a real piece of shit."
Doctors,"Everyone so torn up by this should look up his interactions with a little girl sitting on his lap during a photo shoot for a film some years back: “This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside.”

Oh yeah such a shame though."
Doctors,"Spousal abuser and child molester. Honestly, pretty hard to have sympathy for the guy."
Doctors,He's beaten his last girlfriend
Doctors,"Sad news, but wanted to point out that Sizemore was also a spousal abuser. We can’t deify Sizemore on the one hand, while demonizing Chris Brown on the other. Sad news, loved the films he acted in, but this was also a man who beat women and I don’t fuck with people like that."
Doctors,I can never see Tom Sizemore and not think of [the fart hole.](https://youtu.be/jYkdFS8n_GA)
Doctors,Great actor. Shitty at being human. RIP
Doctors,I always get Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen mixed up.
Doctors,Godspeed you legend. May we meet again on the celestial shores.
Doctors,I’ll always remember him as the guy that banged Paris Hilton. Shine on you crazy diamond.
Doctors,[deleted]
Doctors,I thought he died years ago.  Sad either way.
Doctors,"In 2000, my boss and good friend had a brain aneurysm.  It was catastrophic. Somehow, she lived, and had been in recovery since. She just began to release must've online, and I couldn't be more proud.

I'm going to call her this week."
Doctors,I wanna be next
Doctors,"He is a vegetable right now, his brain looks like mashed potatoes in an MRI. There's no reason to use machines to keep the rest of his organs going when his corpse would die without them."
Doctors,Terrible news.  Love Tom’s various characters.  Truly a great actor.  My love and support ti his family during these difficult times
Doctors,What's he been in?
Doctors,Glad to know I still have 15 years to live
Doctors,"Canadas MAID laws help in this situation.* Some People hit a point where their life will be endless hell till they die. Assisted Suicide is a compassionate thing to do. This Canadian supports it. It has its uses, people going out on their own terms, instead of being a potato, pooping their pants all day. 
We can help people.

*Edited to be less of a flippant ass and actually open conversation about the topic of Assisted Dieing."
Doctors,The dude was a child molester. He’s lucky he didn’t die in prison.
Doctors,"i always kind of liked him, until he picked up that kid to use as a shield in ""heat"".

condolences to his family."
Stunt Science,What I like about the show is that the powers aren't excessively shown... *yet*. I'm still in episode 6.
Stunt Science,You will  love the ending. It was let's say.... shocking.  Am so excited for season 2. It can't come fast enough.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Episode 6 is godlike, wait and see."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I think the Bent Neck Lady twist will haunt me to my grave. That’s the most horrifying thing I could imagine. So tragic, which builds on the horror and makes it more effective. IMO the whole show is probably some of the best horror content of the century."
The Haunting of Hill House,I never jump at horror shows/films. There is one damn part that got me on this show. Binged it in one sitting on Christmas Eve last year. Worth
The Haunting of Hill House,"Hill house does it right- putting character and compelling story first before the scares makes you so much more invested in what happens. Pair that with incredible direction and acting, creative and scary ghosts and you’ve got one of the best pieces of horror media in a while. Also I friggin eat up the whole ‘scour the background for ghosts’ thing. Haven’t had to pay so much attention to every shot of a show since like Lost or the Leftovers"
The Haunting of Hill House,One of the best shows on Netflix. Severely underrated. I just finished Bly Manor and I like HHouse better.
The Haunting of Hill House,Really liked the show up until the ending. Too clean of an ending and just didn’t fit with the overwhelming dread that occurred through the main series which was great.
The Haunting of Hill House,I watched it for the first time this year too! I finished it in a week. What an absolute masterpiece!
The Haunting of Hill House,"Try Bly Manor next. It's awesome, though I do find that the little girl is the voice of Peppa Pig and every time she talks I keep thinking of Peppa... bit distracting lol"
The Haunting of Hill House,Waiting for your reaction to the ending.
The Haunting of Hill House,That show is fucking great.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Last week I watched Haunting of Bly Manor and really enjoyed it. I'm not usually much for horror, but I thought I'd give it a shot since it's October. Then I noticed Hill House was in the same anthology series and gave it a shot. I just finished the series last night!"
The Haunting of Hill House,"Fun story, I was watching that when it came out and as the big floaty boi made his first appearance, the power went out. I nearly pooped myself."
The Haunting of Hill House,Is it just good or scary too?
The Haunting of Hill House,"I loved how it used horror genre to tell a story about families and mental illnesses. While it was horror story through and through it was at the heart a family drama.
The funeral episode was a technical marvel. The one-shot editing never felt like a gimmick.
But my favorite was a The Bent-Neck Lady. I love me some good foreshadowing that surprises you, but also makes complete sense.

I still haven’t watched the second season, but I’m wondering if the lighting can strike twice. The same talent is behind it so I’m hopeful, but the first reaction are not hopeful."
The Haunting of Hill House,[deleted]
The Haunting of Hill House,Never really cared much for horror of any kind but this was amazing. Some of the best television I've ever seen. Because of this show I read and watch the genre now.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Is it really scary? We were thinking about watching it but I’m a bit of a baby. I can handle the classics like The Exorcist and The Shining, but Paranormal Activity freaked me tf out, for example."
The Haunting of Hill House,I just realized how much this show is a tragedy with Horror elements. It's like an Edgar Allen Poe story. It's just really freaking sad.
The Haunting of Hill House,It's so so
The Haunting of Hill House,I really didn't like it. Long form horror rarely hits the mark for me.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Check out the Exorcist tv series, season 2 was a separate story and better than season 1. Marianne on netflix is fun as well."
The Haunting of Hill House,I just rewatched a scene from episode 6 and cried all over again. This show is still so powerful.
The Haunting of Hill House,Keep your eyes on the background during the flashback scenes. You will spot things.
The Haunting of Hill House,The best thing about this show is the production quality. Found the show to be mostly boring overall.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Bly Manor was good, but not as good as HH."
The Haunting of Hill House,Really? I'm on episode 3 and finding it a real slog.
The Haunting of Hill House,Is it just a horror show? Cause I find mindless horror shows boring as fuck.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Dude, Hill House is one of the best tv shows ever made, period, but you are in for a serious disappointment with Bly Manor.

I'm only 2 episodes in and it's one of the most boring shows I've ever watched.  

I honestly don't think I can push myself to go beyond one more episode, which is so disappointing to me.  If episode three doesn't improve rapidly, I am out.

What a huge let down it's been so far."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Incredible show and I'm not even that big on the horror genre. It's masterfully filmed and directed, but what really makes it stand out is that it's more than just a vehicle for delivering scares. It's an emotionally powerful and tragic family drama with some fantastic acting."
The Haunting of Hill House,I’m on episode 5! I watched bly manor and had to see what Hill House was about.
The Haunting of Hill House,"I binged 8 episodes in one late night sitting and finished it the next day. Absolutely amazing show! I'd describe it as a family drama/horror show. 

I'm now watching reviews and analysis videos of it on YouTube before I start The Haunting of Bly Manor."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I thought episode 5 was great and the series went downhill from there a bit.  Not out and out bad, just never quite reaching that height again."
The Haunting of Hill House,Have you noticed the ghosts that are hidden in each episode? Some are easier to seen than others.
The Haunting of Hill House,[deleted]
The Haunting of Hill House,"I'm gonna be ""that"" guy. 

Hill house sucked. But did some things right. I'll try not to spoil anything because I don't wanna be a dick about something you enjoy. 

Some of the good things were the atmosphere. Everything felt real and visceral. The characters. They felt like real people, with more than a single personality trait. And of course, as has already been mentioned, the continuous shot in the middle episodes were expertly executed. I had to go back and rewatch it when I realized what was going on.

Now, here's why it sucked:

The pacing of this show is garbaaaaaaage! The first ""scare"" of the series comes at the end of the first almost 50 minute episode. And frequently the show had an incredible amount of build up to...... SOMETHING.... only for it to end with absolutely no pay off. 

I strongly agree with the ""rule"" that the horror genre is all about ""tension and release"". The build up to a tense moment, maintaining that tense moment for a given time, and then the release (the big scare or horrific moment) followed by a winding down. 

Hill house FREQUENTLY built up just to have nothing happen. I compared it to the sensation of having to sneeze, and juuuuuuust as you're about to sneeze, the sensation goes away. 

And when they DID have something happen, it was frequently for no reason or with no build up. I cite the scene in the car between the two older sisters as my example of this. 

That's what watching Hill house was like. I felt like I continued watching because of the sunk cost fallacy, or just in the hopes that the final pay off would be huge and epic, making the wait all that more satisfying, and not because I had any interest in the story being told.

That brings me to my next big point; the amount of dialog that ends up being COMPLETELY irrelevant to the story is painfully slow. I had actually started to hope that maybe the show would become an allegory for mental health, and that the scares, and ghosts would have been metaphors for the struggles of mental health issues. I was genuinely interested in the show again when I thought that was the direction the show would go in. 

But then that hope collapsed as the ending came around and everyone completely abandoned any rational thought and did the EXACT OPPOSITE of what any sane human being would do in that situation. 

I honestly think they should have called it ""The Boring Family Drama of Hill House"". It would've been a lot more appropriate of a title. 


All that being said, I'm planing to watch Bly Manor in the hopes that the pacing is better."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Just watched the first episode last night and found it so boring and uninteresting. Sounds like it gets better from these comments, so I’ll watch another episode."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I’ll give it a shot. I just stopped watching The Haunting of Bly Manor. OMG did it drag, I could not finish it, stopped on episode 5."
The Haunting of Hill House,Every episode scared me and I cried at the ending. Can't wait to watch season 2.
The Haunting of Hill House,"I feel like I'm the only one who thought episode 6 was so bad

The ending twist of episode 5 is a masterpiece in horror. Terrifying mindfuck. It's amazing. One of my favorite scenes in television

And then episode 6 is so theatrical, gimmicky and over the top. The choice to do it in one shot is pointless and makes it feel like a stage-play. Editing is key to horror, and this episode basically nullifies any tension. It totally took me out of the show, and I could feel the actors ""acting"". I also hated how added a lightning strike every 5 seconds. 

You know that scene from Birdman when Michael Keaton's on-stage? The entire episode felt like that"
The Haunting of Hill House,The second show in that house - haunting of bly is definitely not as good. The ending actually ruined the whole show for both of us. They kinda gave up at the end I feel. But worth a watch. It’s a lot of the same actors
The Haunting of Hill House,I heard it is more a love story than horror which held me back from continuing after ep2
The Haunting of Hill House,Beware the second season is not up to par. Season one set a very high bar.
The Haunting of Hill House,"I just suddenly realized that ""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" is a clever play on words."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I'm halfway through and it is freaking me the fuck out.

I still think its a bit drawn out. It could be tighter and have less episodes even with slow creeping dread. But by fuck am I afraid of all the dark corners!"
The Haunting of Hill House,"Watched the whole season, boring as hell."
The Haunting of Hill House,I wish they had fully explored the house a bit more.
The Haunting of Hill House,I wept after episode 5.  Some of the best writing I’ve ever encountered.
The Haunting of Hill House,"The whole season was great. You should check out Bly Manor next. Not as upfront and in your face as Hill House but now that we know what to expect, most of the creeps has been replaced with tension, story, and drama, imo, it was done in a good way. Def pulled me in after a few eps. Both shows have done an awesome job at reviving the genre/trope and are just perfectly splendid ;)"
The Haunting of Hill House,This show is one of my most favorite. I loved the character building and they did it so well. Sadly Haunting of Bly manor is not as good as I expected.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Unpopular opinion, I love them both deeply, but right now I feel like I’ve enjoyed Bly Manor more; every episode changes the context of the previous episodes and I felt like I needed to rewatch the entire series over again"
The Haunting of Hill House,The bent neck lady episode was fucking mind blowing
The Haunting of Hill House,Too bad the ending of Hill House sucks
The Haunting of Hill House,My favorite thing about this show is how the director cast his hot wife as the lesbian sister who hooks up with other hot girls. Heady move.
The Haunting of Hill House,"A brilliant show, no doubt about it. 

I'm halfway through Bly Manor now and equally blown away. Great writing, acting and directing. Episode 5 of Bly is also amazing, solid Emmy material."
The Haunting of Hill House,Hill house is great! Bly Manor sucks backetball-sized dickhole.
The Haunting of Hill House,Too bad Bly is one of the most boring shows I have ever finished. I would have quit after a few if my wife hadn't wanted to go through with it. Horrible show. Even all the twists and reveals are just a silly bore.
The Haunting of Hill House,r/bookscirclejerk and r/television crossover
The Haunting of Hill House,"I think a ok tag would be to say it's ""This Is Us"" combined with a horror show."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I finished Bly Manor last night and liked it a lot, but I immediately re-started HHH right after. It’s the best."
The Haunting of Hill House,I just finished episode 3.. Pretty scary
The Haunting of Hill House, I don’t like that they called it haunting of hill house. Remember in the book where a family of annoying characters bitched and moaned constantly? I don’t. It’s a well acted soap opera. Has some great genuine scares. Shirley is the worst.
The Haunting of Hill House,"OMG, I just finished it and wow! This show in incredible! I am soo hooked! 
5 and 6 back to back are amazingly done. And those long continuous shots are masterful. 
I went into this show completely blind. I had NO idea what is was. From the title I guessed it was a horror. I didn't even know if it was a movie or a show. I am really loving it!"
The Haunting of Hill House,Episode 5 and 6 are blindingly good. So good the actual finale almost feels anti-climatic.
The Haunting of Hill House,"How scary is it? I saw some gifs and wanna watch it because lesbians in lilac is like 80% of my interests, but I'm not very good with horror. Does it have creepy children or people being attacked by invisible things?"
The Haunting of Hill House,That scene is my favorite jump scare of all time.
The Haunting of Hill House,I just binged it all now. The tension building and character building and how they weaved the story was brilliant work.
The Haunting of Hill House,"OMG, I think I missed everything in the background because I wasn't paying attention to that. And I loved the Leftovers too but I missed that as well. >_<'

Out of curiosity, any examples of the Leftovers background hints? I thought it was just a normal house and a normal town so I missed it."
The Haunting of Hill House,It has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and won nine awards. How is that underrated? What would be the appropriate rating for it?
The Haunting of Hill House,"Me too, I was kind of disappointed by bly manor."
The Haunting of Hill House,Underrated? It was universally acclaimed and won several awards. Please.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Bly manor is just a bunch of love stories with tenseful moments except one scary moment near the end. 

Hill house is scary throughout."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Is it underrated though? It got a ton of critical acclaim, is super popular on reddit and I know a lot of people in my personal life as well who have watched and loved the show. It's easily one of the most well known and respected Netflix originals"
The Haunting of Hill House,If anything it's overrated.
The Haunting of Hill House,"It’s different and it’s a fine show itself, but Hill House is so much better."
The Haunting of Hill House,Hill house was definitely a better straight up horror. I ended up watching the entire thing in one night
The Haunting of Hill House,I totally agree. The ending was very underwhelming. It's still a great show though.
The Haunting of Hill House,I thought it was a beautiful way to close out the story.
The Haunting of Hill House,"Yep, ending was abysmal compared to the rest of the show"
The Haunting of Hill House,"Without spoiling it for others, I loved the different ending to your usual horror shows. And I LOVE that there are no loose ends. I hate it when shows end with an open ended sudden tease one second before credit role for seemingly no reason other that to fuck with the audience."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I just finished episode 6; wow, how good were episodes 5 and 6 back to back?! Even the camera work and one take shots are amazing. So many powerful things happening, too. 

I hesitate to make this thread in case of spoilers but I am just so damn impressed with the show. It's the best thing I;ve seen in a while!"
The Haunting of Hill House,I'll jump to Bly Manor next! I just finished Hill House. Amazing show!
The Haunting of Hill House,I would have had a heart attack! That's the worst possible time for a power outage!
The Haunting of Hill House,"It is fantastic with some horror elements. Calling it 'just a horror show' is doing it injustice. The camera work, the production values, the weaving of the story, everything came together to make this an amazing emotional ride. Really, really well made and I am very critical of shows."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Very creepy, had me scared at night and I’m a grown ass man."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Scary. The show does not rely on jump scares at all, but it does have probably the best jump scare I’ve ever seen. It’s also ve tu subtle, though. Lots of times you’ll pause and look in corners of shots for things you thought you saw."
The Haunting of Hill House,At its core it has the same excellent character stories but it's muddled it bit by horror that isn't as perfectly executed as the first time around
The Haunting of Hill House,"I couldn't help but be amazed by that one shot episode! It was perfect!
And I absolutely love the weaving of the story and how it ended perfectly with no loose ends and answering everything."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Er I’m going to go against the grain of these replies and say yes, it has many huge jump scares. I watched it two years ago and I still vividly remember specific jump scares from 3 different episodes that just about made me crap myself.

If you don’t want jump scares, watch Bly Manor instead. Same creator, but very light on jump scares (really only 1 near the end)."
The Haunting of Hill House,I thought the first two episodes had too many jump scares with sudden loud music cues or people screaming themselves awake.
The Haunting of Hill House,"There is one really shocking jump scare that is particularly notable, but apart from that there are very few if any other jump scares. The horror in the show mostly comes from the tense atmosphere, growing dread, and general unknown."
The Haunting of Hill House,This should be perfect for you then.
The Haunting of Hill House,"One jump scare that I remember. I was genuinely startled, and I usually see jump scares coming from a mile away. That being said, If you like horror, you'll like this show."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I lowered the volume a bit and put on subtitles for when they talk low or whisper because I, too, hate jump scares and sudden loud noises. :p 

It has it's creepy moments here and there but mostly it is fine. I just finished it and what I loved about it is both the camera work and also it was nothing like what I was expecting. It is wonderfully made and what a fantastic ending. It really is a cut above."
The Haunting of Hill House,"There are jump scares. But, not constantly. Definitely a slow build. And most of the jump scares are pretty low level scares."
The Haunting of Hill House,"Me too. So much horror comes of as cheap (just jump scares) and the movies that do have a nice story feel ruched because oh how short the length of movies are. Also, Hill House feels really fleshed out and it was brilliant how they told the story. I thought if Hill House was a movie it would surely be watered down so much."
The Haunting of Hill House,"If you were fine with the Exorcist or The Shining you'll be fine. It's not nearly as intrusive as Paranormal Activity. Like, no one gets dragged out of bed and dragged down a hall. Which is why everyone should close their bedroom doors at night. Ghosts can't get through doors. They aren't fire."
The Haunting of Hill House,"I lowered the volume a bit and put on subtitles because I hate jump scares and sudden loud noises. :p
It has it's creepy moments here and there but mostly it is fine. 
I just finished it and what I loved about it is both the camera work and also it was nothing like what I was expecting. It is wonderfully made and what a fantastic ending."
The Haunting of Hill House,It is scary but not in a jump scare way. Lots and lots of tension building and creepy atmosphere.

Apparently I don't read well. "

Knightfall,[deleted]
Knightfall,"As someone who just watched the first season of Project Blue Book, I'd like to know if the story comes to a somewhat satisfying ending or if I should just not watch the second season. The few sentences seem to indicate that it ended on a cliffhanger."
Knightfall,"ouch, PBB was a really good show in my opinion"
Knightfall,"Canceling both of these do History even have any scripted shows left other than Vikings?

Fuck I'm so disappointed Blue Book was on track to becoming this decades X-Files.. It was so good..."
Knightfall,"Damn, Project Blue Book was a pleasant surprise."
Knightfall,"Bummer I really liked blue book, had an xfiles vibe to it"
Knightfall,"That's too bad. I haven't seen any of S2 of PBB, but I enjoyed myself during season 1."
Knightfall,I liked both these shows a lot...  sucks to see them go without a proper finale season.
Knightfall,That's a shame. Project Blue Book was a lot of fun. It was one of the few shows I actually looked forward to every week.
Knightfall,That sucks. Project Blue Book was the best thing on History next to the Vikings.
Knightfall,"A bit disappointed Knightfall is over it really picked up during the second season. I was actually talking about it to some friends just a few days ago.

But I had my suspicions that it wasn't coming back when they suddenly had the hero reappear to kill the evil king, after having a scene involving him escaping immediately before."
Knightfall,This is how you ensure no one picks up your future TV shows. Why should I bother if you don't complete anything?
Knightfall,I wish the History Channel would show all of their old stuff (the days before it became all about their reality TV shows and aliens) .
Knightfall,Tried to watch Knightfall so many times but I found it just so fucking boring. Literally skipped through episodes just to see MH
Knightfall,[removed]
Knightfall,"This feels just like Manhattan I started to watch,  got distracted when I finally planned to get around finishing s1 to see next one . It gets cancelled."
Knightfall,"I'm glad I didn't bother with s2 of Blue Book but I'm really sad over Knightfall, it was quite enjoyable."
Knightfall,Sad because knightfall was so good! They really could have tapped into something there
Knightfall,"Damn, canceled by not even the History Channel but history itself??? Shit's rough shots fired, as my grandma used to always say laying an egg inside my mind which cracked with the break of day, bleeding burning sunshine through my eternity."
Knightfall,Any chance you could recommend some source material on the real story and any historic arcs? Would be interesting to read. Thanks!
Knightfall,It did end on a cliff hanger. But well worth watching if you enjoyed the first season.
Knightfall,"I'm not sure but they do research a lot of the more famous UFOlogy cases in season 2 (UK's getting episode nine tonight, though it airs on SyFy over here rather than History, so I can't say much about how the season ends yet).

There's one episode where Hynek's sitting on the set of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and recalling a PBB case to a journalist that I found kind of cool."
Knightfall,"it ended in a pretty big cliffhanger, but still, its only ten episodes and most of it is alright"
Knightfall,"It ends on a cliffhanger but I still recommend it. First season was alright but I really liked the second season, they upped their game. Hynek and Quinn had a great buddy-cop dynamic throughout the season. It is shame that they cancelled after it became a really good show."
Knightfall,[removed]
Knightfall,"They've got an anthology show called the Commanders coming out, about pivotal moments in the terms of different US Presidents"
Knightfall,2 is so good. Watch it!
Knightfall,Its so annoying
Knightfall,"Yeah, appeared in seaon two with a hefty beard."
Knightfall,"The inspiration for a Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) is actually a series of books called [the Accursed Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accursed_Kings) (Les Rois maudits) which is probably one of the best series of historical novels produced in the last 100 years outside the English-speaking world I'd dare say. It covers the general events depicted in Knightfall (mostly in the first book), and the subsequent ramifications and consequences of those events.

It's historical fiction, but like other great French historical fiction works (such as the Three Musketeers trilogy), it weaves a fictional narrative between factual events. There are a few aspects to the series that make it particularly compelling:

- Although it is historical fiction, especially the dialogues and the very first chapters of the first book, they are based on a common urban legend that circulated years after the events described in the books (and grew stronger and stronger over the years as events seem to confirm it). Despite wars, the French Revolution and various world changing events, the urban legend somehow survived through history.

- The author maniacally and meticulously researched that time period. It's VERY well researched for a series of books produced before the internet. At least in French, my understanding is that sentence structure, vocabulary, descriptions of people and locations are all sourced in painstaking research.

- Although it was thoroughly researched, that extensive research came at a cost and the writing was rushed somewhat as the author was running out of money. This however had an unexpected benefit: despite the underlying density, the writing is light, simple, almost pulpy, and very approachable.  

- ASOIAF's Martin rightfully credits Druon (the author) for the inspiration of his own writing style. It's gritty, it's uncompromising and it's surprisingly brutal (for a French author of that time period). It's as close as you can get to Martin's style without being derivative. 

So yeah, if you read french, you MUST read these books. If you can get your hands on translations, read those. I can't vouch for them, but if they were good enough for George R. R. Martin."
Knightfall,What was the cliffhanger?
Knightfall,This comment hurts my head
Knightfall,And he was really good as it.
Knightfall,"Awesome, thanks for responding. I will see if I can find an English translation, despite 5 years of it at school my French is awful."
Knightfall,"I'm thinking the situation with Quinn and the submarine was not resolved, unless I've forgotten something."
Knightfall,"Nope that's right, I'm actually kinda disappointed. Wanted to see where it went"
Knightfall,"I'm just sitting here, waiting for someone to say if it was good or not."
Knightfall,"I really wanted to like this, but it was not very good. I'll keep watching because I love this period of history, but I'm not very optimistic that I'll last more than 1-2 more episodes unless it improves markedly.

Fight scenes were terrible, acting was stilted, CGI was just... wow. Awful. And this last complaint might be a little nitpicky, but the king of France speaks with a goddamn English accent. "
Knightfall,"I don't remember what I thought of Vikings after the first episode back whenever that was, but the season opener of Knightfall was pretty forgettable. Acting was weak, poor CGI, pacing was horrendous - too much happens too fast. I really hope this gets better, because it is not looking good after this first showing. "
Knightfall,It was awful. Big let down. 
Knightfall,"Was alright.  Wierdly, I liked the main actor a lot, but not so much the main *character* he plays.  Like, we're supposed to like him because he cares about helping people and whatnot, but then he's also banging the queen (for some reason?), which makes him a massive hypocrite in like at least 3 different ways...

The subplot with the jews feels like something they should have introduced later, rather than in the pilot. Would have given some other characters/plotines more room to be established.

Also, Game of Thrones has totally ruined me at this point as far as medieval battles and CGI. The whole opening was just weak in comparison, but maybe I'm being to harsh there and just let it slide, since they obviously don't have that sweet HBO budget.

Some decent mysteries and questions about where things will go from here are set up, so there's material there for the rest of the season to pan out well.  We'll see though.

I'm probably not going to be running to the TV every week to check this out, but it could be worth a binge-watch once the first season is wrapped up."
Knightfall,"A little late to the party but figured I'd throw in my two-cents.

It's definitely a wonky show. Some moments are pretty damn bad, but some moments are also really cool. The opening scene was definitely the hardest to get through, the CGI was bad and the timing was weird. But after that it's pretty good minus a few moments. 

The costume design is also really good, I enjoy the look and feel of the show, even if it's a bit ahistorical.

The fall of the templars is certainly an under-explored part of history. I don't know whether this show will give it the tragic/fascinating look it deserves but it certainly has potential. 

Overall, not fantastic, but certainly not terrible. I'll wait and see what the next few episodes have in store. 
"
Knightfall,"Terrible. The pacing is super fast so there is no time for anything to sink in. The episode did a terrible job establishing what exactly the viewer is suppose to care about. The Jewish subplot seemed pointless. The battle scenes were a mess with the awful slo-mo and the constant jump cuts with the super zoomed in camera. The entire thing just felt like cheap day time television. Definitely not what I was expecting based on the trailer for this show.

I feel bad for Simon Merrells. He is a great actor and doesn't deserve this punishment. To go from Spartacus to this is depressing. "
Knightfall,"I am going to withhold judgement as it took Vikings a couple of eps to get good.  I did have issues with the premier though.  SPOILERS BELOW... 

First the combat... I'm not sure what to think about the slow motion initial combat scenes.   They just don't seem to make the combat have a proper flow.  Can't really put my finger on it but I didn't like it too much.  I did really like the helmet cam, thought that was pretty cool.  Second when they attacked the brigands on the road to defend the Jews...  WHERE WERE THEIR HELMETS?!?!  I mean okay, you want to show the star fighting I get it, but the rest?  I did like that they had shields but, I saw several strikes with the blade where the knights totally and completely exposed themselves.  Don't think men who have been fighting for years would have done that.  I did like that I saw no twirly bird crap like you see all the time in GoT.  Very much appreciated that.

On to the plot.  Again this was the first ep and I hope it gets better but meh...  A little too predictable for my tastes.  Who didn't see the ship carrying the grail getting wrecked coming?  Of course the main character is going to have a romantic interest that will eventually lead to a lot of trouble.  Shocker, the mentor died.  Of course the Jew who started the whole expulsion thing was not a Jew.  Oh, surprise Landry didn't know what to do with mentor's sword.  And finally the big shocker, the peasant boy's girl gets killed and now he's going to be a Templar!  

I am curious as to how they are going to develop the plot and will be watching to see if it gets better.  Overall I was not impressed but am hopeful.  We'll see!  "
Knightfall,"*spoilers alert*
I thought the action and the plot were intriguing, but the main character let me down. For someone who is supposed to be upholding a sense of duty and honor, he is one shameless piece of crap. First, he betrays his oath of abstinence (let's be honest though, no one follows that). But the main thing that put me off was his disloyalty to his friend King Philip by sleepin with the Queen, that was a show of weak moral on his behalf."
Knightfall,"Garbage, turned it off as soom as i saw that they were in paris and everyone was speaking with english accents, even the king of France!! 

Like come on, they got the accents so right with Vikings, and then they go and do this? Such a let down. 
"
Knightfall,fucking love this show
Knightfall,"It was full of cheese, and littered with overplayed tv tropes. The introduction to the love interest made me physically cringe. As a history nerd I was somewhat upset that they made it about the grail, but even more upset that they revealed it as just a cup in the first half of the first episode. I'll still probably give it a couple more episodes to come into it's own though, but GOT or Vikings it is not. "
Knightfall,Terrible. I could barely make it through the premiere. 
Knightfall,Was pretty awful. These History channel shows really don’t have much to do with actual history. 
Knightfall,"It was watchable not the worst thing I’ve seen recently but looked kinda cheap in the special  effects department and the fight were a bit hammy and cheap. 

I’d give it 6/10 "
Knightfall,Im not sold. I want to like it but it was a little cheap? But I still like it more then kingdom but it doesnt rival Vikings at all.
Knightfall,pretty good for a season 1 premiere. 
Knightfall,"I don't like it. The CGI is cheap and it seems overacted. I feel like I'm watching a daytime soap opera. 

Quality wise, comparing Knightfall to Vikings is like comparing Spartacus to Rome. 

EDIT: upon reflection, even Spartacus fulfilled a fairly specific niche. I can't think of too many kinds of people that would enjoy this show. "
Knightfall,I liked it.
Knightfall,"Having seen the second episode I can definitely say it's better, the pope is amazing. Never thought I'd say that."
Knightfall,I thought it was awesome. Enjoyed the first episode and I am DVRing the rest to come!
Knightfall,So Godfrey is he the same Crusader that is portrayed in Kingdom of Heaven?
Knightfall,imdb says Renner is an EP not in the cast
Knightfall,A bit late? Lol it premiered days ago
Knightfall,"Not the best start, being historically inaccurate.
1: The siege of Acre ended with the templars surrendering the city, and its people along with the templars were granted free passage to Cyprus, in exchange giving up the kingdom of Jerusalem.
2: According to several accounts from both sides of the siege, the saracen siege engines could not even reach the coastline, much less a ship who had already passed what looks like a hundred meters of water.
Lazy writing when there sure could be ground for some tense negotiation and character development in the shows pilot. 
"
Knightfall,yeah definately not the best start it almost a exact replica of the first season of the musketeers bbc show
Knightfall,"Apparently. according to HBO, the cause of Friday the 13th was that a Templar master was fucking the wife of a King"
Knightfall,Love this show cant wait for next week
Knightfall,"In season final, they shot two diff endings. The one NOT shown was the baby being named ""Joan of Arc""....yes, that one...... who grew up to be what we now know. The mother in this tv series- story was Joan the Queen of France to King Philip in this series. I wish they would have shown this ending, instead. Oh well......"
Knightfall,"It's already out?! I thought it's coming next year. 10 episodes season, right?"
Knightfall,I liked it i understand what people are saying could have been slower and maybe hour eps build into it more but i liked it certainly better than a certain other show
Knightfall,"I thought it was pretty good overall. Some cheesy lines, and it felt like the opening battle was a bit too low budget – but otherwise, it was solid. Some really awesome moments, too. "
Knightfall," Much of the Knights Templar ""official history"" we read about in schoolbooks is fiction anyway, so the authors didn't have much authenticity to work with in the first place. There are more interesting lost stories starting to come to light, such as a regiment that came to San Francisco around 700 years ago, see the book Coded History Haight Ashbury  at CodeHistorydotcom   This particular Knights Templar regiment's emblem was the bear and California's state emblem is the bear, and Knights Templar Commandery No 1 was originally in Haight Ashbury.  Also in movies and TV the gleaming artificially white teeth on a medieval person always makes me cringe.  They could at least yellow the teeth a bit.   "
Knightfall,"I also enjoyed the pilot episode.

""OH NO! SOMEONE ACTUALLY ENJOYED THIS SHOW! BETTER THUMB THEM DOWN TO MAKE MYSELF FEEL MORE SECURED!""

lol, reddit point means nothing to me, so suck it."
Knightfall,The story is a mess. I can't stand the constantly flipping sides as if people change in a flip of a coin.
Knightfall,"They had subject matter that has such rich history and actual entertaining drama, and they spat on it. They fictionalized a plot. They should have started at the founding of the order, and then run the course of their fall. A Grail quest, bah, they could have foot noted the Grail as one of the possible possessions they were believed to have concealed. Even that is a rather strong conjecture. I feel like they threw us into a half-assed attempt to create another GOT rival instead of a well thought out history of more factual events. What a waste. I don't think it will make it to season 2. "
Knightfall,"Desuuuuus vault. This show is like walking dead... I'm only watching because (zombies apocalypse niche) hur hur hur templar knights, and crusaders niche

Also those cheesy lines, set up, music, and bad cgi screen lol. It gives off a very C rated indie any jones feel. Dat production value/budget brings it up to like a C-"
Knightfall,"I thought it was a pretty solid premiere, I am looking forward to next week already. This show has some awesome potential. Consensus seems to agree:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Knightfalltv/comments/7i1vgw/knightfall_episode_discussion_s01e01_youd_know/?st=JAW3CI06&sh=8b50abb6"
Knightfall,"It was awful. I don't expect it to get any better. Historically inaccurate. It's nothing but low-grade fantasy fodder.

It's another false history written by Americans for a certain American demographic. It's no wonder the kids are growing up with zero factual knowledge of world history."
Knightfall,"Comes across as bgrade at best. Typical History channel show, poor cgi and acting to boot. Cant imagine what people find so good in it."
Knightfall,"Thoroughly average. Strongly dislike that kid. Most insensitive character award of the year. Far too cliche of a subplot storyline with the whole ""Peasant boy loses his homestead and beloved and joins the army for vengeance"". I hope that jewish lady gets a bigger role. Oh. And well done acting-grandmaster. I'm fairly sure you banged the queen. Good work. Now we are going to have a fucked up succession crisis.
"
Knightfall,Me too!
Knightfall,It sucked duded.
Knightfall,It was bad.
Knightfall,"its really fucking good, do urself a favour and watch it from the beginning."
Knightfall,Because no one likes the French that's why. Our accents are so much better
Knightfall,I hated the first episode of Vikings. I had to watch it like 5 times to finally get past the first episode. After like three episodes I thought Vikings was pretty good.
Knightfall,"I agree on the banging the queen part. It felt super forced  and honestly also a little unrealistic. I have a hard time understanding why they would even risk having an affair let alone that the main character should be very religious as a templar even with that lost battle.

I kinda liked the jew plot but maybe they shouldnt have solve the whole problem in one episode. It felt a little rushed like you said.

Overall there stuff I liked but everything I liked was also kinda flawed."
Knightfall,"Agree with you 100%. After the opening, I was a bit like WTF. But then it got better. It was at its best in the quieter moments, seeing our knights in the streets, etc. The smaller skirmishes. We have to remember, many shows open with a bad pilot. There’s potential here... I remember disliking Vikings at first, but now I love it."
Knightfall,:( not what i wanted to hear 
Knightfall,"You translated my thoughts into words. Super hushed, awful fight scenes, no suspense or world building. TV showrunners think that their audience has the focus of a mosquito apparently. 

However, the cavalry charge at the beginning was great. Finally, someone using lances for fuck sake."
Knightfall,Not to mention the show didn't leave itself much time to live.  1291 + 15 years puts the story in 1306... one year before the Templar's purge from France.  This has no where to go even if it did end up catching on.
Knightfall,"> The Jewish subplot seemed pointless.

Only reason I saw for it was reunite the father and daughter with Landry."
Knightfall,"I agreed with you - but then I remember HATING the first episode of Spartacus. First three or do actually. But god fuckin damn, what an incredible masterpiece that came out to be. Fingers crossed this follows, because the Templars are pretty badass. "
Knightfall,except Spartacus is also a steaming piece of shit.
Knightfall,Shit.
Knightfall,"You were expecting what, Kingdom of Heaven? I actually agree with your assessment but went in expecting this to be watery gruel. You know they won’t treat the subject matter with any gravitas, they’ll feel like they have to fluff up the story with superfluous dressing (“the holy grail goes back further than Christ”), throw in some ham-handed PC token characters, do the whole obligatory but entirely shallow love-making scene (God forbid they actually develop some sensuality and leave it at that). Hitting all the targets of boring TV they expect to drag out for eight seasons."
Knightfall,"This guy watches 'The Walking Dead', don't listen to him."
Knightfall,"See the two of us completely disagree with the pacing. Maybe I have just watched too much TV, but I am getting sick of shows that try and stretch things out and spread out the plot at too slow a pace. Too often I watch a 13 episode series and think that it would have been better as a 6 or 8 episode series. So watching this episode I found it refreshing that things were moving so quickly. 

Now I am not saying that this is amazing television or anything but I can easily respect the pacing decision."
Knightfall,"> The pacing is super fast so there is no time for anything to sink in. 

The fact that you have a TWD flair kind of makes me question this. Like is it ""super fast"" relative to TWD? Because then it would basically just be normal pace."
Knightfall,"Hahaha! Spartacus. I enjoyed it, because I’m a sucker for that kind of show, but you can’t say it’s actually a properly good show as if it’s a downgrade coming to this. This is just like Spartacus."
Knightfall,You thought the Jewish thing was a subplot? Dude! That was what the whole episode was circled around!
Knightfall,"Yeah bro. That's the vibe I got from the opening siege alone. Turned it off after. The action cuts were so terrible, felt like TWD. Can't do another TWD. "
Knightfall,[removed]
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"This is what I love about the Great British Bake Off and what so many other cooking competition shows, or cooking shows in general, are really lacking. They actually teach you about baking and cooking. I've learned so much from TGBBO about cookies and pies and tarts and weird British cakes that I would have never heard of in my life. It's really engaging to watch, but it's also very educational. There's no drama or lengthy backstory about a contestant's mom's second cousin who was born with a gluten allergy and how winning the show will save the family. It's all about the food and the technique and what works and what doesn't."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"The host is from Iran and does an amazing job diving head first into different cultures, informing the audience about things most people have forgotten I.e real Soy Sauce made and aged in wooden barrels is a lost art. 
There are a lot of things like her explaining the importance of letting meat warm up before you cook it, salting meat with kosher salt before you even intend to eat it, and explanation of different cuts. The show is very informative every second of the way. She also shows you how to make FRESH pasta with eggs, flour, and water. I never knew eggs was in pasta and I definitely didn’t know it was so easy. Brilliant show"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Watched 2 episodes already. It will inspire you to cook, that's for sure. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I binged it all the day it was released. I had just read the book a couple of weeks ago.  
Another similar recommended series is 'Cooked' by Michael Pollan (and the book too)."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Much like the also-very-charming Somebody Feed Phil, this delight takes express delight in showing people really really really enjoy food for what it is, which goes a long way towards making it an enjoyable watch.

Samin Nosrat is just an absolute bubble of charm and good vibes. I will definitely go out and buy her book after this."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,[deleted]
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Great show, engaging host, great food and scenery. Loved it!"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"The book is practically my cooking bible! It completely changed the way I thought about cooking and allowed me to go from following recipes to improvising and coming up with new things based on my knowledge of the basics. 

I can’t wait to watch the show!"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Samin Nosrat is just a delight. She really does seem to respect and value every culinary excusrion she takes part in. I loved when she was having a blast rolling the olives in the first episode. She's so unhesitant just biting into every food she comes across, like when she was chewing away at the seaweed. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,My girlfriend bought this book for me for my birthday and it’s the first cooking book I literally read cover to cover. Can’t wait to watch the show. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,The book is amazing too 10/10 recommend 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,One of the best cooking shows. This host is enjoyable to watch and listen to and her passion is contagious even through the camera. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Only watched half of the first episode so far, but it's amazing! I love watching passionate, knowledgeable craftspeople share their experiences and knowledge. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Just finished the last episode.  I have enjoyed cooking since I was in my early 20's, (now 48).  I go through phases where I dabble in other cultures cooking styles.  I LOVED this series!  I love it when I come across cooking information I didn't know before.  

&#x200B;

If you are an 'amateur chef', whether it be for yourself, your family or your friends, you need to watch this show.  It really is inspiring!"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Just binged it and bought the book
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Netflix has the best cooking shows. 

This
Ugly delicious 
Chefs table"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Show was awesome! Her and Michael Pollan are really helping out generations of people, upon which cooking was lost. Watch the Salt Fat Acid Heat then watch cooked. Both really awesome."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Loved this show!
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"The book was genius! Can't wait to watch this as a review.

Edit: meh"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"When Netflix recommends it to me, based on the title, I was expecting a Breaking Bad inspired show."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"> So many of them throw tidbits of fact at the viewer without connecting the fact to a broader explanation, or using an individual recipe as an entrance into deeper knowledge. So many of the experts, not coincidentally, are men. When Nosrat shakes her handful of salt over a pot of boiling water and shares the experience with other people, nearly all of them women, it’s not just a rehashing of every food series you’ve seen before. It is an alternate vision of what’s possible in food culture.

Be great if we could have television reviews without casual sexism."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,[deleted]
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Im interested in this show, but this article is trash. Central premise: men arent real people the way women are real people. It reduces all the chefs and shows it discusses to their gender. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,How the fuck did they make this about gender so damn fast?
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I turned it off after five minutes. It was a trip to Italy to talk about olives. I was hoping for a cooking show. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Yeah cuz Netflix needs ANOTHER food show.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I never realized but that’s exactly why I can’t watch US cooking contests. All the drama, none of the technique."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"The show is just so darn wholesome. I feel warm and fuzzy after watching it. There just seems to be so much love and support in the tent. 

I've always struggled with baking. I was always missing that one little bit of knowledge that could make or break a dish. I stopped bothering to try new things. I'd just mess it up anyways, so why bother? TGBBO made me feel like I could do it, and it made me feel better about not getting things quite right. Here were these bakers who seemed like regular folks, not trained professionals, who were pretty decent amateur bakers- and they didn't produce 100% perfect dishes each time. It was empowering.

It really helps me to know what went wrong, but I'd always been at a loss. I didn't know what to fix. Hearing them talk about different techniques, as well as talk through the process in a more detailed way, really helped me. I love hearing contestants talk about what they think each step of the technical challenge is, and why. It really helped me understand why seemingly small steps were actually quite important. That was the incite I had been missing.

As I try to get back on my feet after a rough year,
baking has been helping me cope with my mental health issues. I can still get really frustrated, and sometimes the little things can make me feel so overwhelmed. But I keep doing it. Even when I mess up, this show has helped me feel like I can master it. 

And damn it, I'm going to master you French macarons! "
Salt Fat Acid Heat," There's a show on Food Network called ""Worst Cooks in America"" and while its intended to be a comedy cooking show where you laugh at people's ineptitude (at least at first)...

Its become our favorite cooking show because they give real instruction and tips throughout the show that will help you be a better cook."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Can't wait for Good Eats to start back up.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Masterchef Australia pretty much started the ""nice"" reality (cooking) show trend ten years ago (actually it started in the middle of the first season and you can see the moment everyone went ""Ohh, a cooking contest where everyone is nice and supportive of each other might be the direction we go."").

And the winners go to apprentice at The Fat Duck, as an example."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I’ve found that Australia’s Master Chef is the same way. Very educational and the same vibe as tgbbo
Salt Fat Acid Heat,The show is British. In real life I’m not sure British people are allowed to have a back story (please see most British sitcoms and most of my British coworkers).
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Those are different purposes, though. Top Chef, for example, is not about teaching you how to cook--it's about watching extremely talented people who are already chefs go head to head.  I love learning about the different types of cuisines, food trends, ingredients, and chefs who are already quite renowned.  I'm not as into shows like the GGBO, because those to me are more instructional and about home chefs.  "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,And why the US counterpart of that show isn’t great...
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"That first episode had my mouth watering while they were making the foccacia and the pesto. I've hand-made basil pesto before and if it hadn't been 1:00 AM, I might've been out there harvesting our garden herbs."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,The book is absolutely brilliant.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Who then wrote the foreword to Samin’s book. His book, the Omnivore’s Dilemma, I can also recommend. But it’s not a cooking related book. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"You ""binged it""....no wonder you enjoyed Salt Fat Acid Heat. Cmon now, is there a particular reason you used ""binged it"" instead of searched? Ya know, except to try and tell everyone you used Bing specifically....maybe to try and signal its not still a total shit show? Having a hard time wrapping my head around that one. Seeing it more often lately from other posters too. ""Googled"" is a colloquial synonym to searched because it of how ubiquitous google search use is... Otherwise its all searching, unless you just gotta tell someone you just jerked it, in lieu of saying you are having a good day."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Except Samin is not just good vibes like Phil. She can actually back up her statements with culinary facts and tips. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I thought her she was the antithesis to somebody feed Phil! She has so much depth and understanding of food and phil is literally just eating on camera and making weird faces. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I have the book, and it's wonderful. Didn't know they made a show! Definitely gonna check it out."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,The book is fabulous.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Neat
Salt Fat Acid Heat,That's really awesome for you.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Same here. Book is massive. No photos. Disappointed about the lack of photos, but excited about the recipes. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,[deleted]
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Maybe you should watch it all?
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Interesting attempt at trolling.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,\>tfw people like things but you don't like those things
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Fuck it, it needs more cooking related shows. Especially every single food related Japanese show - anime or not. In subbed and dubbed version - yeah, shoot me for liking dubs on an anime."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,“So I’m whisking the eggs for my meringue and suddenly *screeching violins* I realise my cake is burning!” 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Nailed It and Sugar Rush are a great mix of drama and technique IMO.

Top Chef doesn't exactly teach technique but the quality of cooking is top tier. It's worth watching for that alone. As an aside, it was the show that really introduced me to sous vide cooking, and I still have no idea why that technique isn't featured on more cooking shows."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I’ve learned a few recipes that I still use watching Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares on BBC America. I’ve learned 0 recipes watching Kitchen Nightmares on Fox.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"It's amazing how being good at something is just the accumulation of 1000 little tricks. The only thing I'd consider myself \*really\* good at is painting houses because I spent 14 years doing it, and I'm so much faster and cleaner than most people it's surprising, but it's because I have a technique that I've practiced extensively for literally everything. Cutting against any line/surface. How to pour paint. How to move drop clothes around. How to patch every different type of crack/hole. Nothing could be simpler than painting a room, but I still know 1000 tricks to make it go faster and come out better.   


I've been baking with a friend of mine who's a professional recently and I love it. Literally everything I do, she give me this look like, ""okay, you can do that but you're doing it wrong"". Little things like flouring a surface or scraping a bowl. It's just little trick after little trick and eventually they all add up. It's so much fun"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I hear you so much on that French macaron thing!
I had my first real macaron at Disneyland  almost 2 years ago and was determined to learn to make them. It’s been half a dozen various recipes, one actual baking class, all the YouTube tutorials, and probably 30 batches later and I *finally* feel like I can reliably make a good batch. I think that in my case, the make-or-break element is the meringue. Keep at it, and take notes as you go - it’ll help you compare different recipes, how many cookies you can get from a batch, etc. Oh, and I love my silicone baking mats. I use “yzish” brand half-sheet macaron mats and they help me get nicely sized, consistent cookies. 
Best of luck!"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"They really don't do that much anymore. They'll show each one showing their group the protein, then all of a sudden they're on the sauce. Skipping what went into the sauce & how they cooked it. They pretty much edit out the cooking & now have those little segments using popups. Not sure why they added that."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"It doesn't hurt that Masterchef Australia has like 60-episode seasons, too!"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I watched that tonight, before I saw this thread. I also was salivating over the focaccia being made. I need to find an Italian bakery tomorrow."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I was also watching at 1 am.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Is this a copypasta?

Edit: I um... *searched* it and it seems it is in fact a copypasta."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I'm guessing they meant binged as in ""binge watched""."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Very true! Her cred is undeniable.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Oh man that o-mouth he always does like someone just stuck a pinkie up his butt 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"There’s a reason for why it’s illustrated and doesn’t use photos. She wants to dispel the idea that there is one particular way a dish should look. The idea of the book is to teach you how to make great food and how to identify what might be wrong with a dish you are making. It also hopes to give you confidence to just play with the ingredients you have, because you understand the basis of what makes a recipe good."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,...Do you... do you really not know that they mean they watched it in one long binge session?
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Anime porn>regular porn
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"""I really want to dedicate this pretzel stick I just made to my mother who just died of cancer and my little son Johnny as we're about to get kicked out of our home because of all the unpaid medical bills from his cancer and I could really use the $100 prize from this show to pay for my cancer treatment."""
Salt Fat Acid Heat,What madness are you sprouting? Nailed it has zero technique. Their disasters are what make it so utterly watchable.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Pssst... any tips for painting a patch on the wall? Every time I do the paint looks a little different from the rest, even though it's from the same can. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I did get a silicone mat, which is very handy. I've had to use parchment paper too, which luckily I've found effective. The only time I've had a hard time getting them off was this last attempt. It was a different recipe with a lower oven temperature and they just didn't bake. It's so frustrating. How much is me, how much is the recipe, and how much is the uneven oven? I do need to take better notes. I've had some batches that are almost total successes and others that seem so wildly inconsistent that I'm not sure what to make of it. It's hard to remember it all, and what adjustments you make each batch."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Whoa same
Salt Fat Acid Heat,bing bing we have a winner
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Thanks for explaining. 

I happen to be interested in food photography, which is why I would have liked to see photos. Having said that what you said makes perfect sense 😃"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Also the illustrations are just wonderful.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Thinks Netflix and Chill is watching TV outside in Anchorage.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Sad but true - shows what entertainment in America has been reduced to.  On the prime time network level at least.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Except Nailed It has portions that teach you actual technique? They frequently feature Jacques or the guest judge explaining how to actually execute the cakes.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"It's mostly impossible to only paint a small area and have it not be visible from *any* angle, if you want that you've got to just paint the whole wall, but there's things you can do to minimize it. 

Matching really starts with how you've stored your paint. Whenever you pour your paint, take a brush and wipe out the little groove that runs around the top of the can. If paint dries in there you won't be able to get a good seal and your paint will dry out and slightly change color. If it's oil paint put a few drops of paint thinner in there before you seal up the can, it'll spread out and form a layer over the paint and keep that skin from developing. 

The other sort of general thing is to keep in mind that you're trying to match texture as much as you are color. The color can be spot on but if the texture doesn't match you'll still notice it. If you do this a lot use a matte finish when you repaint a room and it'll make things easier on yourself in the future. The less gloss the less texture will show. 

If you're patching very small holes (nail holes etc) use window glazing. It won't suck in and does a great job. Let it dry for an hour or two, after that just dab a very small amount of paint on it. Just enough to cover really and you'll never notice it. 

For hole larger than a nail hole, but not big enough to need a taping you'll have to fill it with joint compound sand it down smooth and then go over it with some primer and a roller, best to use the same type of roller you used on the rest of the wall. Primer is thicker and will match the texture of the rest of the wall better than if you just go over a patch, even a very small patch with just paint. Once it's dry roll on one or two coats of paint and you should be fine. You can roll the paint on in whatever direction you want, but whenever it's covered take your dry roller (i.e. dry to the point that you'd put more paint on it when if you were just rolling out the wall) and roll from up to down over what you painted. You always want to have a consistent direction in your texture. 

For larger holes or cracks (really any crack) cover them with that nylon drywall tape (or a real patch for a larger hole) and you'll probably want minimum of two, probably three coats with drywall mud. First coat should cover the tape so you can't see the texture of it but try to put a decently thin layer on anyway. between 1/8"" - 1/4"" is usually good, although 1/4"" is definitely a bit much. Don't worry too much about it being smooth against the wall. You really just want to cover the tape. Wait for it to completely dry, sand it down just so the high parts are knocked down. If you start to see the tape you're in trouble. If you've done you first coat well, bring your second coat out 10-12"" from the middle of the crack/patch and get the out edge of your knife smooth against the wall. Let it dry completely again and give it a light sand. Third coat you should be able to go over everything again and it should be mostly smooth. Let dry, sand and it should be smooth. Run you hand over it and you might feel a sight rise, but at this point you're talking 1/8-1/4"" over 20-24"" so it should be pretty even. 

From there do it the same as a smaller hole that you've filled with drywall compound. Prime with a roller, same top to bottom texture, then at least two coats of paint, same roller technique. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Jacques explains what they are meant to do and then they proceed to completely ignore the advice. 

I do enjoy the little pieces about how it should work but we are all there for the disasters"
Salt Fat Acid Heat,/r/television folks
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Wow! Thank you for this awesome response! I feel super ready to fix this hole now. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"*Tidying Up* somehow got me to throw out crap I don't need. ""Spark joy"" is a great mind-hack to get you to throw stuff out. Before this, I'd look at some stuff I have lying around and think ""maybe I need that some day."" Now, I'd look at that and say, ""that's not doing anything to me at all, and why do I have two of them?"""
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I know Reddit typically doesn't care for ""reality shows"", but honestly, Netflix has been killing it with these. I normally hate reality tv or competition shows, but the ones I've watched on Netflix have all been great. Queer Eye is incredible and makes me cry at almost every episode. Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat is really interesting, and you can learn a lot about cooking from it. Chef's Table is phenomenal and just beautiful to watch if you appreciate culinary arts. Even the cooking competition show The Final Table is much better than almost any other cooking competition show on the air now."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I happened to just be in the right mood and decided to watch an episode of Salt Fat Acid Heat - not usually my thing. LOVED IT! Great host, beautiful scenery and food, so relaxing. Watched all 4 episodes and forced my friends to watch it and they loved it too. It would be great to see Samin Nosrat get a permanent show."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"*looks at my life*

I'll take all of them."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I don't know if Netflix cares whether or not any of us fixes our lives. After all, there's probably something more productive we could do toward that end than binging ten hours of Queer Eye or whatever, but Netflix would prefer we sit in front of the TV.

Netflix does, probably, realize there's a huge market for ""self-help"" type stuff, and that a large number of paying subscribers want to *feel* like they're fixing their lives by binging ten hours of Queer Eye."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Hahaha good luck 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Fuck ""reality"" shows and the morons who watch them."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Oh good, it wasn’t just me that’s been using those ideas from the show. Some of my family were like ‘hah, those are pretty cringy tips!’ and I was just all like ‘haha...yeah.’

Once they left I pretty much immediately got started cleaning."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Same here. I’m planning to do my closet this weekend. I’ve been looking at it for months and feeling frustrated, and now I have a method to try to get rid of all the stuff that somehow accumulates. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I'm sure Goodwill is loving this show.  Would be curious how much their donations have increased since this show came out lol
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Tidying Up has great tips for people who are new to Marie Kondo but the family-driven emotional narratives in each episode are incredibly boring.
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"I really like most of them but I'm honestly surprised at how much people like the Final Table. The show felt...empty in some way with the editing style. Like, it wasn't enough of them cooking. And the judges were just celebrities from their respective countries and that annoyed the hell out of me. These people are cooking top-tier food with subtle ingredients and techniques and the judges are oblivious to it because they're not chefs. The first episode had this famous boxer who barely had anything to say about the food because he doesn't *know* what to say but his decision had a major impact on who stays and who is out. The judges also had zero chemistry and overall were very awkward in their interactions with the contestants and the food.

I turned it off after the first episode."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,Honestly netflix has fantastic docuseries. Chefs table and medal of Honor are my favorites. It's primarily what I use it for. That and my parents use it for asian dramas. 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"If you enjoyed the show, the book is just great.  You can totally see it acted and spoken out in front of you."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,I love how you can tell she loves food because she just digs in with the tenacity only comparable to a one Guy Fieri 
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"> Salt Fat Acid Heat

Yeah, this show was great. Similar experience to me, I just put it on for no real reason and loved it. Who knew watching someone make focaccia could be so nice? The only difference is that I have told everyone to watch it and NONE of them have. To the point they even starting making fun of me for bringing the show up so often."
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"Get the cookbook it comes from. Wonderful read with some great recipes. I got it for Christmas last year, and my family has enjoyed the fruits of it. Nosrat is an engaging writer. "
Salt Fat Acid Heat,"If you liked Salt Fat Acid Heat, you  would probably enjoy [Cooked](https://www.netflix.com/title/80022456) which is another Netflix original about the science of cooking."

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,People will say Black Sails but I think it's only because middle of Season 2 to the series end Season 4 is so pedal to the metal awesomeness. Season 1 is actually decent (on rewatch especially) but definitely not as good as the other 3 seasons.

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,I started watching South Park when it first came out and I never would’ve thought it could become the multigenerational show that it is
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Preacher had a great first episode but the rest of the first season goes a little slow till the end where it picks up a lot and then in season 2 the show becomes worth watching purely for the Saint of Killers and Herr Starr scenes if not anything else.

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"I think Schitt's Creek fits this. The first season was a bit painful and unfunny, but then got funnier every season after that."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Venture Bros could fit this. In the first season or 2 the animation is really cheap but then if you make it through it just gets better and better. Whoever cancelled it can eat rocks. Thankfully we are getting a movie to wrap things up.

The first season had rough acting and much worse visuals. I think they were still getting the hang of the CG for TV.

I used to dislike the first and fifth seasons because Sheridan was my favourite, Sinclair was kind of bland and I simply disliked Lochley. Now I appreciate each of them for what they represent -- it's like seeing three different *Star Trek* captains in the same show."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Rewatching the first season or two I found it kind of rough, but the quality keeps going up from there."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Caroline In The City took a novel approach to storytelling by focusing on a different word of the show's title for each season. ""Caroline"" (Season 1) was, to be honest, sluggish: every episode was 22 minutes of a single locked camera slowly focusing on Caroline as she stood in an environment (typically nature) with no dialogue. Seasons 2 and 3 (""In"" and ""The"") were, again, not great: lots of shots of objects being placed within objects, and a whole season of specific objects being selected from arrays of identical objects. However! Season 4 was great: slow, swooping camerawork of Manhattan. And it wrapped things up nicely and finished all of the storylines when the final episode was 9/11"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Surprised no one has mentioned trailer park boys. The beginning is hilarious, but the film quality is god-awful. I never know where to start people when introducing them to the show."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Buffy the Vampire Slayer got infinitely better after the first season.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,The magicians. I’m on season 3 rn and it is big improvement over Season 1 as season 1 was a bit of a bumpy ride  with its writing and acting
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,The 100. The first few episodes were difficult. Seasons 2-4 were amazing.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"It’s pretty well-known in the fan community, but just about every Star Trek TV show started off a little shaky, but eventually found its stride.
  
Bear in mind, I’m mostly referring to the series from the 90’s or earlier, which most agree is peak Trek. A lot of the new stuff is trash, but Strange New Worlds gives me some hope. It’s imperfect, but with good characters, a strong group dynamic and some strong episodes. I’m hoping it’ll grow into another gem."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Might get some hate but Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Once Danny came on it got 50,000 times better"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"The Leftovers. Super uneven first season, but over its short 3 season run, it found a voice and I think now belongs in any conversation about the all time great shows."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Schitt’s Creek. 
I know many people that started it, gave up on it then came back to binge the whole thing."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Quite recently Quantum Leap reboot. Serious turnaround. Can't put exact reason to it.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Parks and Rec. The first season is the weakest one.

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Family Matters was basic until Steve Urkle came on
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"The Black Adder.  First season is unwatchable, 2, 3 and 4 are some of the best television comedy ever made."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,First season of The Leftovers is really naff. Second and third are excellent.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Recently watched The Orville and felt pretty “meh” about it during the first season but was extremely impressed by the later seasons, and I’m not even really a fan of Star Trek"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Babylon 5. But even that sketchy first season still pays off in the last season, so its all good."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"I remember thinking the first two seasons of Breaking Bad were a little slow, and then it turned into one of the greatest shows of all time."

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Stargate SG-1
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Stargate: Universe
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Star Trek TNG.

The first two seasons weren't just rough, they were downright awful at times. Data having sex with Tasha Yar, some black stereotypes involved in an attempted forced wedding with Tasha Yar, Troi becoming pregnant by a magic space alien, there's just so much stupid campy stuff going on that today makes your eyes roll to the back of your head.

It's a miracle it became so much better. All it took was for Roddenberry to die."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Season 1 parks and Rec is legit bad. Then it becomes the best show ever made
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Honestly, the pilot season of The Office was extra cringy. They actually had to change Michael’s character because in the ratings everyone said he was just a dick and not funny."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Schitt’s Creek.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Parks and Recreation.  The first season is so rough but they find their mojo in the second season
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Community and Its Always Sunny
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"So far, even though the first season won Best Series at the Emmy's, season 2 of the White Lotus has been a much more enjoyable watch than the first in my opinion."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Mythic Quest actually! S1 was really forgettable besides that 1 episode, really glad it find it's niche and wasn't afraid to have some fun with it! Now I look forward to each ep"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"I've got animation on my mind atm:

imo, ***She-Ra and the Princesses of Power*** is just average for most of the first season (with a couple of great episodes). In the second it starts to pick up, in the third onwards it's simply a *great* series. By the end of it you're left with a fascinating portrayal of the effects of child abuse and indoctrination and a bunch of other interesting themes.

*The Legend of Vox Machina*'s first 1.5 episodes is...bad. I think they used it as a filter of sorts, throwing a bunch of sex and gore and low humour to say 'this is as far as we'll go, you've been warned'. Unfortunately it meant a whole bunch of people gave up partway through the first episode, when the series properly starts in episode 3.

*One Piece* is a classic example: It comes off very kid-like, but the series' prologue goes for literally almost 50 episodes and the show doesn't show how deep it can get up until episode 30 or 40-ish

***Gungrave*** has one of the worst first episodes I've seen. So shit. then the next 15 episodes are some of the best anime drama out there. Then it goes up and down in quality.

Oh and Star Trek:Lower Decks is pretty rough for about half a season or more. Last few episodes are much better and by season 2 it's simply amazing."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"The West Wing. The first season is KIND of a trudge - and they seemingly knew it as they changed up the cast and formula somewhat after season one. I tell new watchers that if they get through season one, it gets GOOD"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,The Expanse.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Star trek TNG. Prebeard era is almost unwatchable.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"There are a whole bunch I can think of, many of which have been mentioned. But one that hasnt that springs to mind for me is:

Farscape.  The first season has some absolute shockers, especially early on.  I wouldnt blame anyone who had to sit through the second episode not knowing it got better for just giving up there and then. There's some bright spots in there like PK Tech Girl in which Rigel suddenly becomes a three dimensional character, but it's a bit of a slog till the last quarter of the season when Scorpius is finally introduced and it is just awesome from then until the end."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"I haven't seen this mentioned, and while it's probably my favorite series around, Farscape started out rough and became awesome. I would have to put it down to the episode where Scorpius is introduced, because he's an amazing baddie, and it got the wormhole plot running in full."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Breaking Bad was really slow at the beginning, but I also don't know how you could've set up the story before all the other stuff happened without it being that way.

The Office and Parks and Rec both had painful first seasons."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,The Office Season One isn’t funny at all. I struggle to get through it.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,Black Sails.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"The CGI and dialogue in the first 3-4 episodes of Spartacus can be a bit of a turn off for newcomers, but if you hang tight it’s one hell of a ride"
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,The office. Season one is so bad.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Spartacus:First few episodes are bad. The pit episode is where you can see the potential the show has. Then after episode 6 you see that the show has real depth and storytelling/planning. To me it's probably one of the best shows of all time. It's ridiculously good. Too bad people just think ""lul sex scenes."" and dismiss it. 

Stargate: First 2 seasons were pretty rough. Although season 2 had some classics like 1969. The first 2 seasons were full of generic sci fi tropes done in a mediocre fashion. Also lots of handwaving without enough explaining just because it wanted to hit the preachy ""humans are barbaric and aren't ready for such knowledge yet"" with races like the Tollan and the Nox. After that it gets pretty damn amazing and feels like an actual universe with how expansive it is and the lore stays relatively consistent."
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,The office. It took several attempts for me to get through the first season but not it is high on my list of faves.
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime,"Banshee, gotta admit wasn’t crazy about the first few eps.  But by the last season, HOLY SHIT! You understand why Anthony Star is Homelander now. Dude is a terrific actor. Along with several very well written characters that surround him, several enemies, and everyone is out for blood. Along with fleshing out his backstory a little more to truly understand what happened to him before eps one. 

I feel like no one knows about Banshee but please give it a shot, I really enjoyed it!"

But then as she sees other women’s privates, she says, “Okay, I’m normal! I’m normal, this is fine, it’s exactly normal! But I’m more than (laughs) more than okay!” She totally went out of her way to announce she has a nice vagina! Lol! Yet somehow just skipped over the blood drinking with Manson part!"

Blood Pact,"What do you say in response to the women who have come out to defend Manson?, or the fact that Manzin a former friend of Evan and Manson's recounts a very different story of their relationship and her drug use?

What's your opinion on the 28 page document Manson's lawyer released which they conveniently left out of episode 2, if there was no validity to his claims of her posing as an FBI agent it's highly unlikely that Illma Gore would have accidentally confirmed that that was her document before deleting the tweet on her twitter account ?, is it not at least worth addressing as Evan Rachel Wood thus far has provided no evidence what so ever and Manson has. also you have to remember these women are actresses i'm not saying she's 100 percent lying or that Manson is 100 percent innocent, but what evidence was provided by the documentary, so far, i'm not convinced."
Blood Pact,"Is there anything she takes accountability for? Obvously Manson is a f'ed up guy, but what a pitty party. This ""documentary"" was so bad."

I'm just glad he enjoyed himself as much as he was able during his fight with colon cancer. I think about him a lot and I miss him every day... 😔"
Blood Pact,"100 % 

You have to be truly deluded to think Marilyn Manson isn't a serial abuser."
Blood Pact,"Curious to know Dita Von Teese's take on the situation:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dita_Von_Teese#Marriage_to_Marilyn_Manson"
Blood Pact,"I have no doubt Manson abused her and deserves jail.  But I simultaneously think the docs opening of her life was way too self grandiose.  She had a good childhood career, sucks her parents fought as all of ours have…but the melodramatic emphasis on her justification for dating him was unnecessary and irrelevant.  

No matter what her background nobody deserves to get raped.  

I’m also not a fan of her Kobe Bryant rape tweet the day he died which in my option shows her character.  If he did it, he’s no longer alive to see you call him out, but his mourning wife and teenager daughter who also lost their other daughter and sister are.  Read the room.  You’ve had this issue with him?  You had years to prior.  And if you wanted to make a point, don’t do it the day he dies when zero ppl on the other perspective will listen.

I bring that up because the timing of this doc is odd, 2 years after to be exact.  And she was the only person to publicly make that tweet the day of his death.  So this doc feels more like a PR move than a genuine aid to survivors.

And I still believe she was abused by Marilyn and he should get locked up.  Just think if she cared about all his victims she would have made the doc as such and not use it as a platform for her career.  PhoenixS rising would have been a better take.

To follow her lead  - “She’s telling the truth about MM.  And she’s also a narcissist that wants attention.  Both of these truths can exist simultaneously.”"
Blood Pact,I don't believe her.
Blood Pact,He's suing for defamation and seems to be confident in the evidence he's collected in the year or so since she made the claims and he's been silent about it. Guess we'll see soon enough.

Blood Pact,"A little over a year ago, Evan Rachel Wood released a statement claiming Marilyn Manson “started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years.” Her words followed years of speculation in which she spoke of suffering sexual abuse at the hands of a significant other without naming him.

In Phoenix Rising, a two-part documentary by filmmaker Amy Berg (West of Memphis, Prophet’s Prey), Wood recounts how she met Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner, the allegations she’s made against him, and how her experience led her to form the Phoenix Act, a nonprofit organization that aids survivors of domestic abuse. Since then, more than a dozen other women have come forward with similar stories and four have filed civil lawsuits against Warner. (Warner has refuted all of Wood’s claims and sued her earlier this month for defamation, among other charges.) Here are 14 takeaways we learned from the film, which debuts on HBO today.

1. Wood claims Warner had threatened her if she were to speak out against him.
Early in the film, Wood claims she has received threatening messages from anonymous people online telling her not to come forward. She also says Warner personally told her not to name him. “He once told me that he would fuck up my whole family from the bottom up and he would start with my dad,” she said. “I have a child and it’s really scary. Naming Brian without support is too much of a risk.”

2. Warner initially knew Wood from her role in Thirteen — a film about an out-of-control teenager.
In 2003, Wood starred in Thirteen, a movie about a teenager discovering sex, drugs, and crime. She was 14 when she acted in it. A few years later, at age 18, she went to a party at L.A. hotspot Chateau Marmont, which is where Warner first approached her. Her first thought was, “Who is this Marilyn Manson wannabe?” but then he formed a connection with her. “He starts talking about the film I did called Thirteen, saying, ‘I’m a big fan. I love your work,'” Wood says in the film. “And he said I have a project that I’m working on that I would love to talk to you about, Phantasmagoria, a movie about Lewis Carroll and his subconscious.” In Rolling Stone‘s extensive investigation into Warner’s allegations last year, multiple women claimed he would engage in “love bombing” early in the relationship.

3. Warner told Wood she would be cowriting his Phantasmagoria film.
Warner allegedly used his Phantasmagoria project — a film he never ultimately made — as his enticement to spend time with Wood, according to the doc. (Multiple women have alleged Warner lured them in with a similar project.) Wood says Warner asked her to cowrite the screenplay. One night, at his home, he attempted to convert the collaboration into a relationship. “I’m, like, a teenager in a room with a 37-year-old man drinking absinthe,” Wood recalls in Phoenix Rising. “It was about time for me to go and after he put his arm around me, he said, ‘I’m going to miss you.’ And I said, ‘I’m going to miss you t—’ and before I could get ‘too’ out he just kissed me. He just stuck his tongue down my throat. And I was shocked honestly. I had a boyfriend. He knew I had a boyfriend. He was married. I’m 18. I just remember … like, everything went white. And I just didn’t know how to respond. I think I was scared and excited at the same time.”"
Blood Pact,"It really is a pity that their site is so bad. It's not just a design problem, either. 

The articles -- when you can get to them without the ads layering over everything -- can be quite good. They get a lot of access, more than most media."
Blood Pact,"I think you should separate the art from the artist. Horrible horrible people have created some incredible art and affected human culture/society over the centuries. grooming, slavery, rape, murder, genocides - these are crimes against humanity that great artists, philosophers, and leaders have committed through our history. In no way shape or form should you justify or condone them, but you aren't a bad person for appreciating their art. Avoiding buying anything or patronizing their work totally makes sense but I don't think the universe is black and white so it's possible to appreciate the good without blessing the bad."
Blood Pact,"Agreed! The documentary was excellent, though obviously disturbing and hard to watch."
Blood Pact,It was really hard to watch.
Blood Pact,"I was a little thrown off myself. It could be that she has to have self affirmations because of the insecurity the abuse left her with. Positive affirmations about one’s physical appearance can often make the most humble people seem full of themselves. It may be that she has to go the extra mile with a confidence boost, and if it makes her not feel like shit, then I hope she continues. Not to be the gender difference police, but if it were a man talking about his dick, the commentary around it would probably be something like , “I’m glad he’s able to get through with a sense of humor.” JS…"
Blood Pact,"She seemed mostly genuine to me, but she IS an actress...And she has been one since she was a kid as you know . Also she does clearly have mental health issues...because she was abused. This expectation that victims be a certain way makes it easier to not believe them."
Blood Pact,"2 years ago I had to run away from my abuser, with another woman whom I just had met, who was also his victim. I will never forget how much I laughed and how probably I looked disingenuous when telling people what happened, because I couldn't believe that:

1- I got away. Before it was too late.

2- I fell in that trap for years and I just couldn't see who he was until someone confirmed my suspicions. 

3- I suddenly had a veil lifted from my face and I could see and believe who he was and I felt so free and powerful that it made me laugh because of the sudden relief. 

So CPTSD/PTSD is not always expressed the same way for people, especially when dissociating, but the facts speak for themselves. And ERW apparently had a lot of facts to talk about. Btw, when she talked about being like an out of body experience when she was physically abused, it was like she was describing my abuse. It's exactly like that.

WHO brands their partner like that? it's insane."
Blood Pact,"Personally it felt legit to me, but I’ve thought that about other actors in similar situations. I think when you act for a living, it’s probably hard to turn that off just because now the cameras are asking about real life."
Blood Pact,"I felt this too. I completely believe her. But the support group...was she interrupting everyone else? Or was it just edited that way?   I thought about it, and I thought about what I was like during that time of life. Ages 19 to 23 I was in university, I completely transformed, was impressionable, and morphed from teen to adult. With her - she spent those formative years being severely abused mentally and physically, doing a lot of drugs. No matter how much therapy she has had, she is still a long way away from being able to be a functioning healthy person.  I don't know what is happening for her right now, I am just saying, any regular person would take years and years to be able to not feel terror, fear, pain. I just wouldn't be surprised if wearing a mask and being performative was a coping mechanism. Muncton (don't want to even utter his name) is a sick f\*ck. A SICK SICK piece of nothing, who deserves prison for years."
Blood Pact,"I also watched it last night— and I also don’t doubt for a second that she was horribly abused by Manson. I think she likes being the center of attention and does enjoy a bit of drama. She’s charismatic, articulate, and a wonderful storyteller. It did seem that she was enjoying regaling the other survivors with her stories, though again, I don’t doubt the veracity at all! She did come across as a bit of a narcissist—though nothing at all like the evil, sociopathic narcissism of Manson. I really liked her—but I know what you’re talking about— I think she was just fully conscious that she was being filmed for a documentary, of which she was the star."
Blood Pact,"Wow I thought I was the only one.. and felt bad I thought she was a bit performative as well. 

I believe her but sometimes I felt she was very off putting as well"
Blood Pact,I hate to agree but I wasn’t there. My wife and I both got a weird vibe off of her. Not saying she’s lying just a little suspicious vibe.
Blood Pact,"Ryan Reynolds and a few other actors have said that when doing certain interviews or tours they ""act"" as certain characters like Deadpool. So it seems to be something actors do when they are nervous and she has been acting since she was a child"
Blood Pact,"I felt the same. She seemed complicit in a few situations (it happens in abusive relationships) but still tried to pin a lot on him. I absolutely believe her, but by episode 2 I was expecting more evidence than a video where they both seemed high and 2 photos of bruises."
Blood Pact,"It’s interesting…the beginning of the show starts with Netflix portraying her as some incredible actress, as a child she is epically crying, so believable, then the show needs with her epically crying. I don’t doubt her claims but it begs one to question what she was truthful about and “acting” on."
Blood Pact,Have you seen it? It's not sleazy in the slightest.
Blood Pact,I'm sorry for your loss
Blood Pact,"In the past, I thought it was a shock act. Like Alice Cooper, who is a genuinely nice guy when he's not on stage. But it looks like Manson lost the plot and went fully genuine with the act. Waste of talent, disappointing, and disgusting. He deserves what's coming to him. He really was somebody I used to look up to, so I'm extra pissed."
Blood Pact,You should go read the comments in the discussion thread in r/marilynmanson. Hundreds of truly deluded people there. The comments are vile.
Blood Pact,"He has an album with two songs:

Abuse Part 1 - where he recorded audio of a fan describing how she molested her younger brother 

Abuse Part 2 - audio of him and his bus driver torturing a fan 

Let’s also not forget the hook to his biggest song “I want to abuse you”

Pretty undeniable."
Blood Pact,She made an Instagram post saying he didn’t abuse her and she would never allow herself to be put in that situation. She specifically used the word “incurred” to refer to abuse victims like they brought it on themselves. It did not go over well.
Blood Pact,"I think it’s a possibility she has NPD. Yes, it’s thrown around a lot, and I’m sure people get annoyed by that, but a person with true NPD who was in an abusive relationship that has an obsession with appearing confident, always in control, and this idea that people are submissive to them would never admit to being abused, especially if their “brand” or whatever would be affected by vulnerability and powerlessness."
Blood Pact,The point of showing her background is to show why she was chosen as a person to easily manipulate. She wants to raise awareness to all the small things you don’t think about until it’s too late. Those broken pieces are what abusers seek out and use.
Blood Pact,"Sometimes people are just deluded. Where I live a soldier who had previously been lauded in our media for years, received lots of honours etc, until some stories came out that painted him in a not-so-heroic light; he has sued a bunch of media outlets for defamation for portraying him as a war criminal (or rather, reporting on the fact that he is under investigation for war crimes). Now the defamation trial is ongoing, and every time a new article comes out with further witness statements, you have to remind yourself that he is the plaintiff and not the defendant, because the trial is making him look *so much worse* than already portrayed. Totally torpedoing his own reputation, it's kind of insane."
Blood Pact,So was Sarah Palin.
Blood Pact,Little bit I’ve read about  that seems to suggest  shit isn’t gonna go as most expect it to
Blood Pact,"4. Warner allegedly indoctrinated Wood and other women via scarification.
In a scene that resembles some of Warner’s other accusers’ stories, Wood recalls how he allegedly encouraged her to carve an “M” into her skin (she shows the scar in the second part of the doc). “Scarification and branding was a part of it,” she says in the first part. “He carved an ‘E,’ and I carved an ‘M’ as a way to show ownership and loyalty, and I carved it right next to my vagina to show him that I belong to him. So it’s January 2007. I really want to get that scar removed.” Wood also suggested a vampire-like connection, too, in the scene when her friend, Illma Gore, mentions a blood pact with Warner. “Yeah, drinking blood is definitely a thing,” Wood says.

5. Wood feels Warner tried to separate the actress from her family.
“He would fake empathy in the way of like, ‘I can’t believe the people around you that are trying to manipulate and use you and I have to save you,'” Wood says in the film, calling it, “Fake empathy in the form of manipulation, trying to isolate me from my friends and family.”

6. Wood claims Warner “essentially raped” her during the filming of his “Heart-Shaped Glasses” video.
Wood was 19 when she agreed to star in the “Heart-Shaped Glasses” video – a clip for a song inspired, in part, by pedophilia; Warner has said that he was taken by seeing Wood wearing the titular frames because they resembled those on the movie poster for Lolita, a film about a grown man seducing a prepubescent girl. “We had discussed a simulated sex scene, but once the cameras were rolling, he started penetrating me for real,” she says. “I had never agreed to that. I’m a professional actress. I’ve been doing this my whole life. I’ve never been on a set that unprofessional in my life, like, up until this day. It was complete chaos. No one was looking after me. It was a really traumatizing experience filming the video.”

She goes on to say that she felt she had been conditioned to soldier through the experience. “I felt disgusting and like I had done something shameful,” she says. “And I could tell that the crew was very uncomfortable, and nobody knew what to do. I was coerced into a commercial sex act under false pretenses. That’s when the first crime was committed against me, and I was essentially raped on camera.” Wood’s mother says that when the actress confided the incident to her, Wood was shaking. (Warner’s lawyer vehemently denied that the sex was real. “Brian did not have sex with Evan on that set, and she knows that is the truth,” attorney Howard King said.)

7. Wood started hearing from other survivors of Warner’s alleged abuse after she came forward with her own story anonymously.
In 2016, Wood felt emboldened to come forward with her story of domestic abuse, though she didn’t name Warner at the time. This led to an invitation for her to speak at the Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Hearing before Congress in 2018. “After I testified, I started hearing from numerous women who had been abused by my abuser because they heard my story and they knew exactly who it was because the same thing had happened to them,” she says in the film. “There were also numerous women on the internet sharing their stories, and I when I started to read them I knew they weren’t lying because they were almost word-for-word my story. It was like finding out that you had dated a serial killer.”

8. Warner believes “Hitler was the first rock star,” according to Wood.
“He always said that Hitler was the first rock star,” says Wood, who calls herself a “born Jew” in the doc because her mother is Jewish. “[Warner felt] Hitler was stylish, he was well-spoken, and he knew how to manipulate the masses to do what he wanted. And that’s why he had an obsession with him. Any sort of Nazi paraphernalia or imagery, I thought, was ironic. I thought his whole spiel was taking the image of Nazis and of Hitler and spinning it on its head. Now he’s got lipstick on and now he’s a rock star, and I thought it was a commentary on Nazism and a commentary on Hitler.”

Warner would “make fun” of Wood’s Jewish heritage, she says, adding that he would get multiple swastika tattoos and acquire Nazi paraphernalia while they were dating. “At one point, over the side of the bed where I slept, he wrote, ‘Kill all the Jews’ on our bedroom wall,” she says. “Things like that are not ironic anymore. At what point are you doing at a commentary and at what point are you just a Nazi?”

9. The first time Wood claims Warner was physically violent with her was on tour.
Toward the end of Part One, she explains that Warner allegedly started to physically abuse her when she accompanied him on the road. “He’d been having throat problems, so a doctor prescribed him liquid Vicodin for his throat, and he drank the whole bottle almost,” she says. “We were on the bus after the show, and he didn’t even know where he was. I started getting scared because he started becoming really violent and throwing things. And I thought, ‘Now is when the handlers step in and diffuse the situation,’ and no one did.

“We showed up at the hotel,” she continues, “the bus parked, and Manson just grabbed me by my arm and yanked me in front of everybody. He’s dragging me by my arm into the hotel and no one’s doing anything. And he goes in, and he immediately starts wrecking the room and smashing things and yelling and I look back at the crew member like, ‘You’re not just going to leave me here. You gotta help me.’ And I remember him starting to slowly close the door and me going, ‘No, no, no. You can’t leave me here.’ And this guy I thought was my friend. We’d been on tour for a few months at this point. He just shook his head and closed the door. And that’s when I knew I wasn’t safe.”

10. Warner’s former assistant claims that Warner would steal people’s personal info via his wi-fi.
“Anyone who hopped on his wi-fi, he had your information and was able to clone phones or laptops or something,” Dan Cleary says. Wood replied by saying, “I’ve seen him hack into people’s laptops and gather information on them as blackmail. He’s hacked into my computer and social media accounts; he was monitoring my every move.”

11. Warner would allegedly coerce people to say the n-word or other questionable things on camera to use as blackmail.
Last year, many of Warner’s accusers claimed to Rolling Stone that the musician attempted to collect dirt on them as potential blackmail, which Wood discusses in the second part of Phoenix Rising. “The three main things that I saw him get on people so they couldn’t say anything were naked photos, drugs, and ‘I’m going to get you to say the n-word on camera,'” she says. “It starts off as, ‘Well, it’s ironic. Oh, it’s a commentary on the Nazis. Oh yeah, we’re taking the piss out of the Nazis.’ And then it turns into I’m just being shocking using the n-word; you don’t get the joke. … I felt like I had to participate in that to show him that I was loyal.”

12. Wood alleges Warner would rape her after she fell asleep.
Wood says drugs were a constant throughout her relationship with Warner, claiming he would put meth in some of the drugs she ingested. She says he would also give her pills to sleep; it was then that she claims he started sexually assaulting her. “I’d wake up, and I just remember doing the mental math quickly and thinking, ‘Just stay asleep … just don’t move,'” she says. “So I would just lie limp until it was over. And then I swear to God he would just fling my leg and walk out of the room.”

13. Wood was once pregnant with Warner’s child.
When Wood was filming the 2011 miniseries Mildred Pierce, she found out she was pregnant. “From the beginning of our relationship, he had an issue with whatever birth control I was taking,” she says. “I went through every type to see which one he liked, and he didn’t like any of them. So essentially he didn’t want me using birth control. He refused to wear a condom ever and it was very much sex on demand, and it would cause more problems if I said no. You don’t have time to use birth control when somebody is penetrating you while you sleep. … I was still trying to prevent a pregnancy. I was using spermicides and all these things, and it didn’t work. He flew out for an abortion. I was just so scared and sad. I obviously believe in a woman’s right to choose, but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t devastating. The second it was over it was like, ‘Make me dinner.’ And I remember thinking, I’m supposed to be resting. … And he didn’t care.” Wood says that’s when she started feeling suicidal.

14. Wood says the first time she was able to cry about the alleged trauma she suffered because of Warner was after giving a statement to the FBI.
“That was intense but cathartic,” he says. “They always ask you, ‘And after this happened, did you seek medical attention or tell anyone?’ The answer was almost always no. … And that surprised me. I never really asked myself that question or why. … But you could tell it wasn’t accusatory. They just needed to corroborate my story.”"
Blood Pact,"Except his so called art is all about his fantasies being acted out. He hates beautiful women. His name is literally a beautiful woman and a serial killer combined. His music depicts his hate of beautiful women and people, and abuse and destruction. He’s no artist. He’s a sociopath acting like one. Some powerful record labels saw a way to exploit that to make money. They succeeded and he’s gotten away with many many crimes as result. This shitstain better be cancelled on a colossal scale."

Blood Pact,"This attitude enables abusive men. Cut off those who assault women, it’s not hard."
Blood Pact,"Yah, she is likely able to dissociate to recall those horrific years. This guy walking the streets is insane. I would not be surprised if does have a couple of bodies. The fuckn depravity."
Blood Pact,"I’m sorry to pull words here from this immediate thread from different authors— but disingenuous, “regaling” with enjoyment the stories of fellow survivors? This isn’t it. Basic facts: has acted since early childhood, in an abusive tumultuous home until stardom, immediately enters into a space where she wasn’t protected and didn’t know any better while being manipulated and abused by a man in a relationship. The very few coping mechanisms this person would have after growing in that environment and maintaining Hollywood presence would leave me to believe that her fervor and almost unbridled enthusiasm for getting justice would cause her to seem maybe the ways you’re describing. But that’s just an abused person who is still in recovery and needs her voice to be heard, and is scared people on the internet (and in person) would try to desecrate that. I thought Phoenix Rising was excellent and there’s no way EVER to explain the mannerisms or behavior of someone who is dealing with years of abuse, let alone being groomed by said abusers and Hollywood on how to “act it out” naturally. Your reaction, hers, and mine are all different. That doesn’t make it incorrect. 

Not trying to come at anyone for their opinion, just think being a SA/DA survivor doesn’t have rules in how you cope or act."

What a fucking trash thing to say. Like it's the victims fault."
Blood Pact,"See I kinda see that as uncool because anyone can be a victim.  Doesn’t matter if you were a good or bad person, well raised or raised poorly- there was no need to justify why she was a victim, anyone can be.  and it came off as a glorification to her Type of thing to me.

No other doc about abused women has been that grandiose.  Just seems like she’s more concerned with herself than abused women."
Blood Pact,Ben Roberts-Smith for those who want to look into it. The stuff that keeps coming out of the trial is almost comical.
Blood Pact,"Alls I'm saying is Amber Heard was a ""victim"" too for a long while. We've heard what Wood's side of the story is, I'd like to see Manson's rebuttal."

It was a really traumatizing experience filming the video.”


This was horrifying!"
Blood Pact,This is fucked
Blood Pact,"I can generally agree with this. Knowing the motivation of the artist was horrendous when they made something can and should change a persons interpretation of that work. If it turned out that one of the actors getting ""killed"" in a Saw movie was actually killed on set as depicted in the movie it changes it from a movie to a snuff film. But I feel like the cases where the art is so definitively tied to bad shit (like the rape ERW suffered) is generally not the norm."
Blood Pact,What works of his are promoting antisemitism?
Blood Pact,"Cutting them off doesn't eliminate that which has already been created. You can't deny that which already exists. 

By your logic we can't appreciate the movie American Beauty as a film classic because of Spacey. Or the Lord of the Rings movies due to Weinstein being involved. 

Outside of movies how about the fact that Hemingway was a womanizing abuser or Orson Scott Card is a facist piece of shit. 

Society in general? Jefferson and Washington owned slaves - with Jefferson raping plenty of them. FDR was a racist. Teddy Roosevelt was a racist. Abraham Lincoln turned a blind eye to mass execution and genocide of Native Americans.

Outside the US? Aristotle/Plato/all of the ancient Greek philosophers likely groomed and slept with teenage boys. Renaissance artists like Botticelli, Raphael, and Michaelangelo all had rumors swirling about their relationships (though to be fair saying they had a ""boy"" may simply have been rivals trying to paint them as homosexual). But regardless the Medicis and Popes who patronized and funded their work were certainly shitbags. That said, their work is some of the greatest creations of human history.  

At no point do I condone any of the terrible things these people did and if they were alive today I wouldn't work with them. But it doesn't change the fact that their work shaped human culture. I don't have to like Kevin Spacey, to appreciate the quality of a film like American Beauty."

Blood Pact,"Do your partners always threaten you to kill you if you ask them who was texting them? I dunno, but that's not normal. Maybe I'm weird and have high expectations from my partner."
Blood Pact,"I think they were both on something. I think it was to show he was threatening to kill her over a text message, which yes, is abusive, but she was inaudible and we only saw the floor. I was quite disappointed by this doc as a survivor of abuse just like her, but in some parts it was almost like she was grasping at straws. She was the one who joined in on drugs, cheated with him, carved a “M” in her body and drew a Hitler ‘stache on herself but tried to blame him for everything. It put her in a worse light, like come on. Some of that was on her."

Blood Pact,[removed]
Blood Pact,"She's been a really gross person for years. Sadly, her take on this abuse and her insistence that she's perhaps the only partner of Manson's that he didn't abuse doesn't surprise me at all."
Blood Pact,I guess I relate to her a lot so that was not my perspective. My upbringing was not volatile but I did have issues surrounding my father. It put me in a place where I was an easy target. So I was in a violent relationship and a lot of the things that she found like able about Manson in the beginning I found the same with my abuser.
Blood Pact,"Amber is one person for one.  Two there are MANY against Marilyn, not just one.  In addition, there are also witnesses, some of them from Marilyn's camp."
Blood Pact,"I think you're going to be disappointed if you think Amber Heard is the bad guy in that. Johnny Depp has had jealousy problems and drug problems for years. When someone got Amber Heard's texts it came out that he was going on cocaine and alcohol benders. Is it a coincidence Johnny Depp has been playing a lot of dark characters lately? He needs help. Right now, he's trying to frame her as the bad guy. Not only that, but there are stories of him having to have his lines fed to him making the Fantastic Beasts movies. Johnny Depp looks up to Hunter S. Thompson and Keith Richards. Johnny Depp was in a band with Marilyn Manson. If you watch him in Inside The Actor's Studio, he is clearly confrontational with the questions from the audience. It's almost like Michael Jackson in a way. In that, he has physically grown up, but not really changed for a long time probably since being a kid/teenager. At the very least, it seems like he's got nothing to focus on."
Blood Pact,"Where are the testimonies of people who were present during the filming of the video, there would have been an entire crew, why have none of them come forward, don't believe something just because it sounds horrific."
Blood Pact,"You are so justifiably allowed to be angry and never apologize. I however am so incredibly sorry that you had to endure that. I’m so happy that you aren’t there in that anymore and have a partner who now knows you, respects you and treats you the way you should deserve. Congratulations on your recovery. You really, really deserve it. Championing you over here. ❤️"
Blood Pact,[deleted]
Blood Pact,Go to 1:50 in the video smart guy.
Blood Pact,"Nothing you said disproves anything. You essentially started with ""Depp just says she's the bad guy"" then the rest of your paragraph is rumours, hearsay and your own speculation on the guy trying to relate him to as many ""problematic people"" as possible  to character assassinate the guy. Heads up, even if everything you said was true - It still doesn't rebuke the evidence that you conveniently left out in your strawman."
Blood Pact,"Congratulations, you just typed out a whole load of nonsense."
Blood Pact,"You sound like someone who doesn’t know how “the industry” works to keep powerful men happy and making the label $. Abuses on sets have been talked about in whispers for years, and going up against powerful “talent” is not the kind of thing people who work on those sets (who are often contractors and freelancers) are going to risk their jobs for. When this video came out there was a ton of concern that this was abuse. This was “hiding in plain sight.”"
Blood Pact,"Yeah, everyone’s gonna come out and embarrass themselves, risk losing opportunities and such to give a testimony to this. It’s to be expected that only a few people that witnessed these events would come forward, especially if they could have intervened. I’m surprised anyone has said anything."
Blood Pact,"Kind of funny that you immediately wrote the series off as “sleaze TV” and now you’re making the point that people won’t take it seriously because they only care about tabloid news. 

How is that any different from the people you’re describing"
Blood Pact,"Yeah, that line is most certainly in the original."
Blood Pact,"> rumours, hearsay and your own speculation

I've looked this up several times now with each party saying their part. You don't think their is a pattern of behavior with him? I disagree. His behavior, his reactions, his vindictive attitude is all on video for anyone to see."
Blood Pact,"No i know how the entertainment industry works, i just believe in evidence."
Blood Pact,"If you're going to make a claim like hers you need solid evidence, also , Manson has sued her for fraud as she allegedly claimed to be an FBI agent and he is going the legal route rather than making a documentary so i'm sure he has something on her."

SSSS.GRIDMAN,I was soooo looking forward to FranXX. But it really should have ended about half way through the season instead of... whatever that ending was going for.
Empire Games,"Every second of it is paced like a trailer to a much longer program. Voiceover was drowned out by sound effects and music that sounds like an old NFL Highlight Reel. 15 minutes in, and I gave it a Hard Pass."
Empire Games,"Yeah, there were many outdated ideas presented. I couldnt get past egypt."
Empire Games,"The voice over would talk over the expert interviews. Idk how this made it to catalogue. I kept thinking that it was an accidental release.

Edit: I also want to add that the narration is absolutely terrible. I just turned it off."
Empire Games,"I recommend the show ""Roman Empire"" Netflix exclusive, is way better with good acting and a decent budget 

Plus Sean Bean narrates the first season  :)
Instead of some cliche bro dude that makes the show feel cheesy "
Empire Games,"I really want to love it..  I'm halfway through the second episode now, but the first episode was really hard to watch.  They are rushing everything at a pace that makes it difficult to understand what actually happened.  For some reason they change to random graphics that last 2 seconds and are just vaguely relevant to what they are saying.  It creates this disconnect between what you would imagine is happening and what they are showing.  They're talking about Caesar getting stabbed to death, show a dagger, and cut to a person etching symbols into a tablet.  Ok we get it, someone wrote about this..  That's what it looked like back then.  

They keep throwing out random events and dates with little context to know how the story progresses ""Ok so did this happen a week later, or a month, or a year later?  Should I be taking notes?""  5 minutes ago they said 44 BC, I think..  Now it's 54 BC, Ok so it was 10 years later, but I just missed a huge part of the story trying to figure that out in my head, and I don't know who they're talking about now because the translator's putting some crazy emphasis on some college instructor's opinion that's very distracting.  And he just said that he really doesn't even think it actually happened like that at all...  Boom onto the next chapter, because we only have 50 minutes to cover the entire Roman empire, where others have spent 5-10 hours

&#x200B;"
Empire Games,They were talking about Mexica Aztecs and there were showing clips of Incas 
Empire Games,Agreed. It is awful. The narration sounds like a computer voice circa 1996
Empire Games,"Anyone else catch the ""2019"" date on the info page for it as well?  Think it was released with the hype from Assassins Creed coming out?  Lol... Since its gladiators and such...
Is it sad that PBS makes better infomentaries than what was placed on Netflix?

Empire Games,"the translator talked over the expert interviews, but the volume levels were much different from what they would normally be, so it was like two people talking at the same time, which made it very apparent that the translator/narrator was adding these ridiculous theatrics to the person's statement, when they were just talking normally..  which is a really bad idea all around"

Empire Games,The expectations for this are super high....i really hope they deliver though for some reason im worried they wont.
Empire Games,"I hope this shows a banger, I need my fantasy show fix after game of thrones ended."
Empire Games,"100million dollar budget per episode, writers get 1,500 quid"
Empire Games,I would consider getting amazon prime just for this show sadly
Empire Games,I cannot wait for this spin off series!
Empire Games,Look this up in the dictionary under NOT FUCKING AROUND
Empire Games,"I'm still skeptical. Every time I hear ""from the makers of [BLANK]"" the product wasn't that good. ""The *people from your favorite [BLANK]"" 
 
*not the good people they have other jerbs, just some of the people"
Empire Games,"idk if we even know yet, but what is going to be the plot of the series? like is it gonna be about the making of the simarils and the fall out or some other back story?"
Empire Games,"If they bring on D&D I will boycott everything they own. ""The end is near."" "" They might ride to war against me but not to victory."""
Empire Games,"""High profile business venture hires experienced staff."""
Empire Games,The only real question I have about this series is whether or not Weta Workshop is making the props again. The detail in the armor and everything in the movies was absolutely stunning
Empire Games,"D&D (GoT writers, not the game) need to stay tf away from this. The North still remembers..."
Empire Games,"""Company hires experienced workers"""
Empire Games,So.....did they get anyone that worked on tlotr films?
Empire Games,The picture is of the writing team’s credentials
Empire Games,Theres a lord of the rings series coming? neet
Empire Games,"I Love the Way you Write your
Titles. /s"
Empire Games,"Don’t fuck this up Amazon.

Side note: I really hope the online game that’s in the works is good too."
Empire Games,I wonder if they are going to bring anyone from Weta studios.
Empire Games,SICK!!!!! Gonna be LIT!!!!
Empire Games,I'm really glad John Howe is on board. Him and Alan Lee defined a lot of the visual language of the LotR movies.
Empire Games,Super group is always a recipe for failure
Empire Games,All that talent and we already know they'll make it terrible.
Empire Games,"Quick throw out names of movie that were good so people will be interested, show me proof first, names mean nothing."
Empire Games,Please don’t let the writers of GoT ruin this.
Elite,Looks horrible
Elite,This show was already grating by Season 2 and I somehow kept watching till 4 which might as well have been porn with some murder mystery sprinkled on.
Elite,"I wish this show took the Skins approach and introduced a completely brand new cast after season 3, instead of mixing the new cast with the old cast and ruining once beloved characters. I feel like I wouldn't have the issues i have with this show now."
Elite,"i watched season 1 and like half of 2, how is this still going bro😭 like who are these people why are parents enrolling their kids into this murder orgy school bruh"
Elite,It's still going?? I thought season 5 was going to be the last... Try should have ended it after season 3
Elite,It was fun until it wasn't.
Elite,Still need to watch 4+5 tbh. Didn’t they completely recast for 5?
Elite,"That was actually the original plan.  OG cast graduates, brand new cast the following season.  Read that years ago."
Elite,Carla was the only reason I really watched tbh 😗
Elite,"For five I think maybe 1 or two of the original cast is there, 6 I've been told none.

Season 4 is not bad it was ok, but I drop it at season 5 it became a drag and it was just purely sex. 

Not interested in finishing 5 or starting 6.

This should have ended at season 3 tbh as I said 4 was ok."
Elite,The perfect example of this is Riverdale. It's absolute madness
Elite,Weeds
Elite,"True Blood. By the time the witches show up, I was like, ""yeah I'm out.""

Star Trek: TNG's final season 7 was bonkers as well. There are some amazing episodes in there and an incredible series finale, but some of the stuff in between was truly off the rails where you can tell the writers had just run out of ideas."
Elite,"Nip/Tuck, and later seasons is from S2."
Elite,Search Party seemed to intentionally go off the rails in its final season.
Elite,The handmaid's tale should have ended after the first season.
Elite,wilfred (us) but in a good way
Elite,The walking dead.   ☹️
Elite,American Gods
Elite,"'Til Death.

It starts as a fairly generic sitcom. Newlywed couple buys a home in a new city with their neighbors being an older couple that is kind of over things. Eventually the show drops the newlywed couple, focuses on the older couple, and becomes a sitcom about the older couple dealing with their still at home kid and their loser boyfriend. By the end the loser boyfriend thinks he is in a sitcom, frequently comments on his wife being played by a different actress, which was played by multiple actresses by that point, and it just goes from there."
Elite,Seasons 1 and 2 of Atlanta are pretty straightforward slice of life. When they go to europe in s3 is kind of when it starts getting wacky and surreal.
Elite,"A good version of this is the last season of The OC. It’s full of non-linear storytelling, alternate realities, countless fantasy sequences and vision quests, french talk shows, groundhog heists and maybe aliens?? (Not really but almost.) After a messy S2 and awful S3, S4 just goes buckwild as fuck and it’s insanely entertaining imo. I know there’s a lot of fans who don’t like that season but they’re wrong."
Elite,"Orphan Black lost me near the end but I was sticking with it out of a sense of loyalty, not because I was still invested. I think a different pace or cutting it down by a season would have helped. 

Obligatory Game of Thrones.

I also wanna saw SVU. Honestly it's such a disaster right now. It doesn't feel like it used to, even 4 seasons ago. It's the Benson show and the writing/characters are soulless.

Survivor isn't what it is used to be either and them sticking to the shortened season/number of days really suuuuuucks. So yeah, I think it's going off the rails.

Part of me wants to say The Good Place because like Orphan Black, I think it got jumbled and too side-tracked along the way. Like the finale but it just didn't hold the charm it once did."
Elite,"Prison Break - went from a well orchestrated, albeit unbelievable escape from prison to these nut jobs working for the government or some shit. Not to mention all the “dead but not dead”."
Elite,Sherlock for the obvious reasons.
Elite,"SyFy's Battlestar Galactica.

There was no plan."
Elite,"Supernatural - The original creator planned for 5 seasons, but the show kept going up until season 15.

They went from fighting the Devil and stopping the apocalypse to having to fight God's sister, then God himself, who is also the writer of Supernatural (a series of books within the show). Some people loved the whole meta concept, I hated it."
Elite,Most shows that go on past eight seasons.
Elite,Unpopular opinion which will probably be downvoted into oblivion: Twin Peaks after the brilliant first season.
Elite,Gravity Falls in the last few episodes was utter pandemonium
Elite,Eureka
Elite,The Boys was cool season 1 then I got so bored of whatever they got going on
Elite,"What we do in the shadows. It went from the perfect continuation of the perfect movie in the first two seasons, to a below average standard sitcom in the last two."
Elite,"Drew Carey Show.  It started off as a down to earth sitcom about an unattractive middle management guy, almost like the live action Dilbert, but became very insane with just no real sense to it and just throwing everything at the kitchen sink.  Probably killed the show for syndication"
Elite,"If by off the rails you mean turns into a dribbling pile of crap that insults its audience.   
Dexter: New Blood, final episode.   
If you don't like the character, don't write for the show."
Elite,There's only one season out so far but I think the Last Of Us is like Game of Thrones in miniature. it started off really strong and then fell off a cliff by the last episode.
Elite,[deleted]
Elite,Elite
Elite,Is anybody still watching that? 😂 They lost me after season 4
Elite,"Forgot about that, watched it every week aswell, yeah that's another one."
Elite,Almost the whole season is full of episodes centered around the main characters family members.  It's just bizarre.  And then there's that troi/riker/worf love triangle..
Elite,"They were spread too thin. 

At the same time, essentially the same crew were producing TNG S7, DS9 S2, Creating Voyager and gearing up for its first season, and writing Generations. IIRC, it was so hectic, while they were concentrating on Generations, they forgot to write a finale for TNG, so All Good Things was knocked out as an afterthought.

They had also stopped taking outside submissions by that time, so that cut a source of ideas."
Elite,That ending omfg.
Elite,Season 1 is the end of the book's story. S2 and after they're just making shit up and it shows.
Elite,Second season was very good but agree it should have ended early.
Elite,Super underrated show!
Elite,It fell apart in Season 5 though unfortunately I watched for two more years.
Elite,the final season was a mess
Elite,Man that was complete utter crap that one
Elite,BSG gets so much love but that show was a mess.
Elite,"Vince Gilligian has mentioned many teams that Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul didn’t have a full plan as they were writing it. The best TV can be organic, live and grow with its characters

I love BSG, Lost and shows like that which take the risk."
Elite,I loved every season of supernatural but seasons 8 and 9
Elite,I feel like that was the point
Elite,It really is a shame it couldn't have been paced differently. I love the ending but it needed a few more episodes to breathe. We meet Ford and bam it's all over.
Elite,"I agree some plot points of the later seasons could have been better (e.g. why would >!it be necessary to, even if she'd eventually get them back/be able to recover them, erase all of Holly's memories of Eureka instead of just those of the Astraeus mission!<) but imho it's better than you think and not the worst decline of that kind of show (looking at you last two seasons of The Librarians, at least Eureka managed to (as much as it could with the Weird Time Shit) remain internally consistent)"
Elite,"I think The Boys is a wrong answer here, because it didn't go off the rails.

My complaint is actually the opposite- everything always just resets to the status quo.

It's a one gimmick show that is quickly being overused."
Elite,"I got bored of it in the third season. I wouldn't say it went off the rails, it just kept doing the same thing over and over again and it got boring."
Elite,its a sitcom
Elite,"You mean the spin-off show that doesn’t count? Yes, definitely"
Elite,"I stopped watching it during season5. But apparently   
 there are time travels, alternate universe and super powers in the show."
Elite,4!! Try 1
Elite,"I don't watch it but I do check in on the plots and man are they wild. >!Last year they all got superpowers apparently and this year they all traveled back in time to the 50s when the original Archie comics were set. There was also a multiverse story at one point that involved Sabrina and witches.!<

The sheer ridiculousness makes me consider watching it a lot but reading the Wiki recaps works just as well I've found."
Elite,"Oh yeah, all these rando family members that we had never heard of before suddenly came out of the woodwork. Even a fake long-lost son for Picard, which is kind of hilarious that we now have his real long-lost son on Star Trek: Picard."
Elite,"DS9 had the benefit of a separate showrunner and writers IIRC, but yes, the TNG crew were essentially trying to double-up handling both TNG and Generations at the same time. 

That said though, the writers have also talked about how after seven seasons they were basically running out of plotlines, finding it increasingly difficult to come up with something that they either hadn't already done, or it had been decided previously that they weren't going to do."
Elite,Ah that makes so much sense! The quality is indeed in such a decline after S2
Elite,"I love what the showrunners set out to do, but they admitted their critical mistake was not having a bible that mapped everything out coherently till the end of the series and it definitely shows as the series progressed."
Elite,"Completely agree with you, but when your show intro promises they have a plan, well... It's probably for the best if they actually have a plan."
Elite,"You have to establish a status quo before you break it; otherwise, change loses its impact. The show’s got a planned 5 season arc, so my guess is that Homelander fully snaps in season 4 and takes over most of the world, followed by the Boys finally killing him in season 5. Or maybe they take down Homelander at the end of season 4, and the fifth season is all about the Boys turning on each other from within.

I do agree that the season 3 finale was sloppy as hell though, but as long as they do permanently shake up the status quo in season 4 (which seems extremely likely to me), most of the flaws of season 3 will be very forgivable for me."
Elite,A sitcom that way overstayed its welcome thanks to a multiyear renewal that extended its shelf life long past the point it stopped being popular.
Elite,After reading all that I might consider finishing it 😂😂 sounds ridiculous
Elite,"I've heard showrunners say ""we have 5 seasons planned"" about various shows and half the time it isn't true

Not saying that's the case for The Boys but it's a weirdly common thing they say. Not sure why"

Elite,Misfits (UK) had none of the original cast members make it to the end of series 5.
Elite,"I feel like the obvious answer here is Doctor Who. That show is a machine, and every single cast member can be, and will be, replaced."
Elite,"I think Legends of Tomorrow had exactly one original cast member left by the last season, and it didn't run as long as a lot of the shows mentioned."
Elite,"Criminal Minds changed out almost all of their cast from the start. Only Garcia and Reid were there from the beginning to the end of the main show. Now, in Evolution, Reid's gone so only Garcia is the lone original cast member.

Also, while I haven't watched in a while, NCIS basically has no original cast members left. Ducky might still be around, but even if he is, he's the only one."
Elite,One of those long running medical shows like ER or Grey's Anatomy. I don't think ER had any original cast members left when it finished
Elite,"I stopped watching the Walking Dead a few years ago, but already by that time, they'd killed off most of the original cast.

The remaining core members of Beverly Hills 90210 was down to Donna, Kelly, David and Steve by the end."
Elite,Mom. I think Allison Janney and Mimi Kennedy were the only 2 cast members to appear on all 8 seasons.
Elite,Death in paradise.
Elite,"E.R. was the original show that rotated the fuck out of its cast. Possibly to a fault, but man, it sure did upgrade a ton of side characters to series regulars and lose a ton of faces. Some people would literally disappear between seasons as new cast was added lol"
Elite,Law and Order
Elite,Sliders
Elite,Degrassi lol it was on for like 16 years
Elite,"Saturday Night Live. None of the original cast is on the show anymore

But if that doesn’t count, the Law and Order series"
Elite,The Walking Dead
Elite,"House had a pretty interesting rotation over the 8 year run, though the OGs still stayed in background circulation. 

Another one in mind is 24, as apart from Chloe (and Jack) the rest were cycled in like there's no tomorrow."
Elite,"Maybe Angel? It started off with Angel, Cordy and Doyle and Angel was the only one left by the final season. Even Wesley wasn’t there at the very start."
Elite,Elite
Elite,Law and Order - 20 plus seasons with lots of rotating main cast and some overlap. Only one cast supporting member being there for more than ten seasons.
Elite,"Medici. The show had 3 seasons, and I forget if it’s between seasons 1 and 2 or between 2 and 3, but at some point there’s a generation jump and it’s just an entirely new cast for the rest of the show."
Elite,Would MASH count?
Elite,Greys Anatomy
Elite,[deleted]
Elite,"Misfits. By about season 4, they had pretty much completely replaced the original cast."
Elite,Sesame Street
Elite,ER. They really could've kept it going indefinitely if they wanted to.
Elite,[MI-5.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160904/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)
Elite,Power Rangers.

Little Things,C'mon son
Little Things,Performer of the week? You must be outta your damn mind!
Little Things," Ha! I love that an actor gets accolades for a currently running show and we all just run with jokes from a show that ended 9 years ago. Psych is still my favorite show.  


... Tsk... c'mon son."
Little Things,I’ve heard it both ways
Little Things,Oh cool I didn’t realize he was using his real name now! I love it
Little Things,I'm Shawn Spencer and this is my partner Lavender Gooms
Little Things,You know that's right
Little Things,I beg your pardon? My name is Black. His name is Tan. I can’t believe you just made that assumption. You should be ashamed of yourself and your family.
Little Things,Always enjoy his work
Little Things,I’m proud of you 👆🏻
Little Things,/r/psych
Little Things,🍍🍍🍍
Little Things,"Although most people probably will never remember him for any character other than Shawn Spencer, I'm really proud that James is getting praise for his drama skills. This isn't a super famous show and it's airing at the same time as big productions, so it's really cool that he's being recognized for it."
Little Things,"[I’m Shawn and this is my associate MC Clap Yo Handz](https://youtu.be/CefU27YmuAE)

[Gus’s many aliases](https://youtu.be/KLicgtao6f8) were a great running gag that built over time."
Little Things,"Honestly surprised this show is still on. The first season was pretty good, but I haven't seen it since."
Little Things,"Honorable Mentions:

* Ego Nwodim (""Saturday Night Live"")
* Kiele Sanchez (""Criminal Minds: Evolution"")
* Chyler Leigh (""The Way Home"")"
Little Things,I'm Shawn Spencer and this is my partner Lavender Gooms
Little Things,Have you heard about Pluto?….that’s messed up
Little Things,"Huh, I'm generally pretty aware of TV but I've never heard of this show despite it having five seasons and featuring a number of people I've heard of.  Is it any good?  I'm getting ""This Is Us"" melodrama vibes from the description."
Little Things,Say it again. Use a Jamaican accent.
Little Things,"If I wanted to watch depressing porn, I’d just set up a camera in my bedroom.

I bailed on that show after the first year.

But when is Psych 4 coming out?"
Little Things,"*dramatically points finger* ""I'm proud of you!"""
Little Things,"Gus, don’t be this crevice in my arm. We’re going to be fine!"
Little Things,Great actor!! The show Psych was brilliant. This man truly has talent.
Little Things,"In his heyday, he could've easily played a live action Nathan Drake. You know that's right."
Little Things,"I remember seeing him and  Michael Weston off-broadway in 2010 during his Psych run of a performance of  Gabe McKinley's Extinction. He got very dark in the play, and did some heavy things that made me literally watch Psych differently. Like, I didn't see Shawn, the loveable goofball but a alcoholic asshole who was doing bad things.  Great show but I've been waiting for his big break and I'm glad he's finally getting it. I still can't watch Psych though lol"
Little Things,I love James Roday Rodriguez and I’m not afraid to say it!
Little Things,Good for James getting some recognition after a down week for The Last of Us. Good luck to anyone who isn’t Henry and Sam from TLOU getting this recognition next week.
Little Things,"This episode had me BAWLING. I'll miss this show a lot when it's over, and will rewatch for sure."
Little Things,I am loving all the Psych comments.
Little Things,TIL “A Million Little Things” is still airing.
Little Things,"Judging by the comments, I really need to finish “Psyche.”"
Little Things,"Him and Martin Sheen, I never knew where of Hispanic descent. I knew Emelio took his mother’s maiden name, Estevez, but based on his roll as a white bread sports jock in the Breakfast Club you never would have guessed."
Little Things,Imagine you've been working as an actor for decades and finally get praise for your dramatic acting skills and all the internet can do is reference something from a comedy show that ended nearly a decade ago.
Little Things,"Is this show actually any good? The ads always looked a bit cringe so I’ve never watched it, but happy to have my mind changed"
Little Things,His Psych character always reminded me of Ace Ventura.
Little Things,Sean! My man. Where's gus at these days?
Little Things,So this week can the Super Bowl mvp be the tv performer of the week ?
Little Things,You know that’s right.
Little Things,"No dad, I'm not inclined to resign to maturity."
Little Things,You must be outta your damn mind
Little Things,"I’m Shawn SpenStar and this is Gus TT Showbiz, the extra T is for extra talent"
Little Things,Suck it
Little Things,"Gus, don't be an incorrigible Eskimo pie with a caramel ribbon."
Little Things,psych
Little Things,"Yeah, but they're getting ready to start the fourth movie."
Little Things,"Funny thing is, I had no idea about Psych until I saw the poster on a streaming service and recognized James from AMLT and decided to watch because of him. So maybe I've watched it both ways?"
Little Things,You hear about Pluto?
Little Things,Psych 3 came out recently
Little Things,No you have not!
Little Things,"Love the one time he's all ""No, no I haven't heard it both ways"""
Little Things,"The right way and then yours

I've heard it both ways

Let's not open any sores

I've heard it right and wrong

Don't ""cheech"" my ""chong"" anymore"
Little Things,"He's using his real name *and* his made-up name, so that you can hear it both ways"
Little Things,"I liked the little meta reference they made in the third movie. 
Shawn: ""This is my partner, Burton Guster-Rodriguez.""
Gus: ""Rodriguez?""
Shawn: ""It's always been there."""
Little Things,"yeah, he started doing it during COVID because he felt bad for betraying his heritage - and now he isn't an unknown so he can get offered roles instead of going to auditions like someone trying to break into acting"
Little Things,Gus T T Showbiz
Little Things,"Gus, don't be the American adaptation of the British Gus."
Little Things,"As your oldest, and blackest friend….."
Little Things,"I'm Shawn and this is my partner Shawn, no relation."
Little Things,I’m proud of you ☝🏽
Little Things,Are you a fan of delicious flavor?
Little Things,"Yes we all know that, but Gus isn't ON the show that this actor is getting praise for."
Little Things,"This is the last season, so not for much longer. I dropped off last season. It’s a perpetual depressing show that tries to one up each terrible things that happens with an emotional epiphany."
Little Things,"Same. I haven't watched since the pizza night episode.

Lady was essentially like ""I know my husband killed himself because I cheated on him with your husband, but it's pizza night so we have to be friends"""
Little Things,I only knew it as the same kind over emotional sad fest as This Is Us but also one time I tuned in accidentally and they were covering up a kidnapping and murder??
Little Things,Lisa from Temecula was one of the funniest sketches in a long time. She finally did a balls to the wall character and it was perfect.
Little Things,"Lamar Johnson (""The Last of Us"")"
Little Things,This is my partner **Burton Guster.** (To the head of a crime organization).
Little Things,Guy Buttersnaps
Little Things,"You're getting those vibes because it was made by ABC as counter-programming to NBC's *This is Us*, after the success of its first season."
Little Things,The first two seasons are really good. A little mystery hidden behind the drama. But it nosedives with bad writing after that.
Little Things,It feels like Brothers & Sisters and a little bit of This is Us
Little Things,IMO it's a great show. I like it better than This Is Us to be honest (maybe because of the cast).
Little Things,"In Psych 2, Henry is watching This Is Us, and Shawn says, “They have the same show on ABC, but newer!”

Cracked me up."
Little Things,"It's knockoff This Is Us, but instead of cathartic tears, it just wants to make everyone depressed"
Little Things,"I knew of this show but didn't realize it was still on. 

Tv is too busy telling me about this fucking dumb bitch hiding shrimp tails in a jar as a way to convince me to switch to State Farm to actually tell me about other tv shows that are airing."
Little Things,"Michael Weston was in ""two"" episodes of Psych. Cloudy with a Chance of Murder. Then they remade the ep in Cloudy with a Chance of Remake. He was great in both!"
Little Things,TIL there are Criminal Minds spinoffs; and a Hallmark show with time travel
Little Things,do it
Little Things,Estevez isn’t Emilio’s mothers maiden name. It’s Martins real name. He was born Ramon Estevez and took the name “Martin sheen” as a stage name. Same with Charlie sheen (born Carlos estevez). Emilio just opted to keep his real name instead of adopt his fathers stage surname.
Little Things,That’s just how beloved that show was. It’s a cultural phenomenon
Little Things,I've heard it both ways.
Little Things,Suuuuck ittt! 🎶
Little Things,Agree to disagree
Little Things,Pft
Little Things,🍍
Little Things,"You've seen it both ways!

If you liked Psych, you might want to check out the rest of USA's Blue Skies shows for a similar vibe:

Monk

White Collar

Burn Notice

Royal Pains"
Little Things,That's messed up.
Little Things,Psych 4 probably soon.
Little Things,How are the movies? I sadly haven't gotten around to watching them.
Little Things,Agree to disagree.
Little Things,I hear that!
Little Things,You know that’s right.
Little Things,There are three movies now?
Little Things,The extra T stands for extra talent.
Little Things,"'I'm Shawn Spencer and this is my partner, Sh'Dynasty. That's s-h-comma-to-the-top-dynasty.'

'That's God's comma'"
Little Things,Squirts MacIntosh?
Little Things,Jazz Hands 👋👋
Little Things,"Gus, don’t be exactly half of an eleven pound Black Forest ham."
Little Things,"Gus, don’t be the theme song from White Lotus season 2"
YG Future Strategy Office,The Zaslav Massacre
YG Future Strategy Office,[deleted]
YG Future Strategy Office,"In June, the final season of the lovely animated series *Summer Camp Island* was set to premiere on HBO Max. Like two days before the scheduled release, it was delayed to next year for no clear reason. Now I'm *really* worried that it's going to get permanently shelved as yet another tax write-off."
YG Future Strategy Office,Last week Zaslav was shitcanning the live action family and kids stuff at HBO Max and the Hollywood press were kissing ass by big upping the animated kids fare on Max. This week we are seeing the animated kids stuff on HBO Max is as dead as the live action stuff. I wonder what sort of puff piece we will be reading in a few days time to try and put a positive spin on the service?
YG Future Strategy Office,"Dear Lord, at least put them out there? What the heck is the point of fully producing something just to scrap it. At least get some sort of ROI."
YG Future Strategy Office,isn't this the show that got a lot of hate because it just has Ellen Degeneres or I'm missing something here.
YG Future Strategy Office,"Pulling completed shows before its premiere date, jeez. I thought they're just doing that for TNT and TBS shows but didn't think they'll do it for HBO Max shows too. 

Really hope they don't do that to shows like Peacemaker and Our Flag Means Death for their respective premieres next year."
YG Future Strategy Office,"I'm guessing little Ellen bossed around her little friends and insulted them, also making them bring her snacks. And if they brought the wrong snack... well you know what would happen."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Well it didn't age as badly as Lil Bill (Cosby), but it still aged badly."
YG Future Strategy Office,David Zaslav’s one good decision
YG Future Strategy Office,This one I'm ok with
YG Future Strategy Office,"I wonder if the HBO shows set to also premiere on CN (such as Tiny Toons Looniversity), are more safe then the animated shows that are strictly on HBO Max only."
YG Future Strategy Office,At the end of the day they want to cancel these projects. Not releasing let’s them at least recoup costs from money already spent. Releasing it anyways basically means they have to spend more money in possible imputed license fees or possible profit participants taking some cut instead of getting millions back by not not releasing it.
YG Future Strategy Office,I will be extremely pissed if that happens. That better not be a tax write-off casualty.
YG Future Strategy Office,People love sucking Zaslav's ass for some reason.
YG Future Strategy Office,Well rumor has it HBO Max won’t be around much longer as a separate service (the plan seems to be they’re going to combine HBO Max and Discovery+ into one service with a new name- probably Warner+ or something like that)
YG Future Strategy Office,Probably a great tax break they can have that beats what they could expect to return after shelling out even more for promotion and distribution. I'm sure the number crunchers have it all worked out. A shame but that's business
YG Future Strategy Office,It’s the shareholders. They are the most important people to please.
YG Future Strategy Office,Our Flag is for sure in the crosshairs.
YG Future Strategy Office,"Right now the Total Drama revival ( for HBO Max and Cartoon Network) might be the most safe of them all since I think a couple of others besides WB is funding it so even if something happens to it for the US it would be very likely still be shown in a couple of other countries

Edit: just checked and BBC was announced as a co-commissioner for the revival in June so it's definitely getting released one way or another even if WB backs out"
YG Future Strategy Office,[deleted]
YG Future Strategy Office,I’ve heard there are so much of them on the go that they are commonly referred to as Zas-lickers both in the industry and here on Reddit.
YG Future Strategy Office,"Why the fuck would they do that? As if the HBO Max merger with DC Universe wasn't a confusing mess, now they're ruining what is probably one of the best streaming services currently available to combine it with Discovery+, a streaming service I had no idea was even a thing."
YG Future Strategy Office,I don't know if they are going to love it when people start dropping the service in droves though.  I'll just get HBO and ignore all the shit on Discovery
YG Future Strategy Office,"Let's be real, any program not with straight white males as the lead is in the crosshairs, considering Zaslav's history."
YG Future Strategy Office,Sure they can be. I have no opinion on it being pathetic though I am curious why you think it’s dangerous?
YG Future Strategy Office,"It sets a horrible precedent with how projects and ultimately creatives are treated. If you want to attract talented filmmakers, you need to showcase that you’ll respect their work and effort."
YG Future Strategy Office,"So they should take a near certain multi-million dollar hit as a show of respect to creators? These are massive corporations were talking about. Executives at these companies will make decisions that are in the best financial interest of the company, plain and simple. 

Does that sometimes screw over creators who have put time and effort into a project? Yes. Does that set a “dangerous” precedent and deter future creatives from pursuing a film/television career? Definitely not. Its the the way it’s always been. Just part of the business."
YG Future Strategy Office,The creatives get paid at the end of the day. As creatives you should understand sometimes you make duds. As long as they give them more opportunities to try again or maybe even they aren’t worth getting another opportunity. As long as they are treated respectfully through the process creatives will at most only be disappointed. WB has more to lose than them. Also precedent wise part of benefit comes from that this is a recent merger they won’t be able to use that benefit in the future.
YG Future Strategy Office,">So they should take a near certain multi-million dollar hit as a show of respect to creators?

That is what the industry has done for decades, yes.

>Executives at these companies will make decisions that are in the best financial interest of the company, plain and simple.

You are making an assumption: that what goes into an accounting ledger one time, is by definition the best financial decision for a company. This is not necessarily true and it sounds like the kind of shortsighted 'proxit-maximizing' strategy that tanks companies all the time."
YG Future Strategy Office,"I mean, finances are also tied to creative decisions as well. It’s just a matter of if the effects are short or long term. Creators get screwed over in the business all the time but the current decisions they’re making with scrapping projects that are close to competition or at least in post-production is pretty uncommon, if not unprecedented."
YG Future Strategy Office,"I disagree. Yes, the creatives get paid, but refusing to publish an almost completed piece of work is disrespect. I’m not saying that there’s no financial reason around it, but I completely disagree with the sentiment that financial decisions are absolved from sometimes screwing people over in the process. Mind you, this didn’t just happen to Batgirl, this occurred with other content since yesterday and there may be more announced. This isn’t a regular business practice, or else the reaction from filmmakers across the industry wouldn’t be filled with so much shock. 

And I’m sorry, but I’ll almost never believe the notion that corporations and huge conglomerates have more to lose than individual creators. That doesn’t make any sense, especially for a studio with a 100 year catalog, extremely valuable IP, and so much space in the marketplace lol"
YG Future Strategy Office,"They are hardly screwed over if they are paid for the work. I don’t think bot publishing the work in and of itself is a disrespect it depends on the context. Like for example, I don’t remember if this was a rumour or report or PR but it was said that they want to work with those people again involved with the movie but they didn’t want to release this kind of movie because of budget/scale of it wasn’t what they wanted for a DC movie: I don’t see that as a disrespect I just see that ad a change in strategy that leads to disappointment.

I don’t know how shocked the industry actually is. The journalist seem a bit shocked but most of the articles note that normally what would happen is that they’d try to get as much money as they can back by releasing it anyways to theatres but this movie was never made for and paid already to come out in theatres and that they’d just be paying more money for a project they don’t want to release. Finished movies never getting released also happens before too. I don’t know any off the top of my head but I remember seeing it happen on entourage and googling it and there were lists.

They have more to lose because they literally put up from tens of millions of dollars and putting something out they aren’t happy with can hurt their DC brand. Every time a bad dc movie comes out? What do a lot of people start saying? that WB mismanaged dc or doesn’t know how to make good movies. Many of the creatives here will just move on to their next project, got paid for the work.Hollywood doesn’t seem to care too much when people have duds as they seem to always get work later especially people behind the scenes."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Yeah we’re gonna just have to agree to disagree because I’m not of the belief that respect is purely based in monetary payment, especially when it comes to art. I’ve seen lots of prominent filmmakers comment on the disaster of them pulling Batgirl after it being close to completion, and the strong sentiment across the board is that this simply does not happen for movies at its stage. Even in streaming. You mentioned an example from Entourage but I don’t see how that’s relevant since it’s a fictional show."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Lol Entourage wasn’t an example I was saying that I’ve looked up if movies would ever get made and never released because of it. I’m on my phone just typing away.

And sure agree to disagree."
YG Future Strategy Office,I think Office Space would be a better example
YG Future Strategy Office,"I feel like it's already a time capsule of a time before the ""Work hard. Play hard."" office culture."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Because the streaming services are rapidly becoming the primary vehicle for TV shows, and the later you get onboard the harder you're going to have to work to stand out. If they don't get a streaming channel going, they're at serious risk of becoming solely a production studio, and that has much more limited profit potential."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Streaming is the future, the longer they wait, the harder it is to survive a fierce competition.

So they believe the current losses will be worth it. Will they actually be tho? Time will tell.  One of these streamers is in for a rude awakening."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Because the way NBCUniversal, Disney, Paramount and Warner Bros Discovery (and the companies that these were formed from) have traditionally made a lot of money is affiliate fees and advertising from the paid TV bundle. 

Go back just 10 years ago and 100 million people had pay TV in the USA.  That's 100 million people paying at least $5+ dollars a month each to each of the cable channel owners before you add broadcast and regional sports channels.

With cable cutting even just 1 million people leaving is $60 million a year and we have seen paid TV subscribers drop by over 25 million and its accelerating.

That's a huge amount of revenue going away so the media companies started their own streaming services to replace that revenue but because they don't have the safety of the bundle and are instead competing they are spending vastly higher amounts on content for far less subscribers.

Disney+ is one of the most successful and it only has 46.6 million subscribers across the USA and Canada and Disney has to pay to deliver that content to each subscriber and has a much larger breadth of content on Disney+ than it ever did on any of its cable channels.

While with paid TV Disney would get $1.60 for the Disney Channel and $3-4 for ABC and another dollar for Freeform, Disney XD and Disney Junior from 100 million US customers plus advertising that's not including the goldmine of ESPN back in the day."
YG Future Strategy Office,"When Netflix was practically the only game in town, these studios made money by licensing content to Netflix. A lot of them thought this was a raw deal to them (eg. Netflix was making way more money than what it cost for licensing), so they had the ""bright"" idea to make their own streaming service. The thought was to kill Netflix because the size of their own original content was much smaller.

They didn't realize that streaming is actually hard and costs a lot of money to maintain. In fact, the proper business decision should have been to raise the licensing price on Netflix. Now you have multiple studios (eg. Paramount, Discovery, etc) looking at multiple billons in losses with no clear path to profitability. You had middle managers who had incentives to juice subscriber numbers but not actually make any money. For 3rd tier streamers like Paramount+ with a tiny streaming audience and no real growth plan, they could have actually MADE money through licensing instead of pouring $1.5B down the drain.

Within a few years, many of these services are going to merge, and some will revert back to licensing to Netflix."
YG Future Strategy Office,">It's incredibly clear these newer streaming services are not profitable, and won't be in the near future.

compared to the traditional ""over the air"" model.. what *should* they do?

&#x200B;

continue to depend on the majority of television viewers to stop what they're doing and turn on the TV at 8 and suffer through ads so they can ""catch the latest episode""?

&#x200B;

> Isn't it easy money for them to just license their content to the big ones like Netflix, Hulu etc?

The show: “Cheers”  
How much he makes: $5 million per year"
YG Future Strategy Office,"The way I see it is some of these companies are trying to play catch-up and adapt to streaming content. 
They initially offered their streaming platforms for free, and while it was a huge incentive for people to start using it, it's not sustainable in the long run, so they had to start a paid subscription service. How many people quit watching those platforms that had previously been free?
On top of that, they are also dumping tons of money into creating new content, but the new content actually sucks and/or no one is watching it due to the subscription cost."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Studios saw that Netflix started off small but were growing at a huge rate and they wanted to cut the middleman. But by the time they got their stuff up and running, netflix kinda hit a wall that suggests they might’ve peaked. 

Now they’re trying to figure out how to right the ship since they may never see the profitability they were promised. 

Netflix is raising prices, clamping down on account sharing, HBO is taking some of their old stuff and putting them on other platforms so they can get some short term money, canceling projects that will never be profitable, others are setting themselves up to sell to anyone interested and other such desperate measures. 

And in exchange for all of that, streaming also killed the DVD/blu ray market and hurt theatrical releases!"
YG Future Strategy Office,I wonder who will still be around after the shakeouts
YG Future Strategy Office,"1. Because the ones who want to be a streaming are already in the business of distributing content and they are adapting to the changing times of adapting the internet and the model that people prefer. For them to not have a streaming service means their multi billion dollar tv businesses would soon be multi million dollar businesses that they hope the streaming players choose to buy their stuff who also have an interest in being vertically integrated e.g. WBD or Netflix saves more money making content internally then paying UNIVERSAL TV or MTV Studios. Not that they won’t but they will prefer to. Why does Walmart want to compete with amazon when they could just sell their Great Value brand on Amazon? Because they don’t want to go from a big distributor who makes their own products to som one who just makes products.

2. Not being profitable at first is the expectation from these companies. Everybody who launched a streaming service told investors that they don’t expect to be profitable for N years until they get an expected XYZ. Most streamers are beating their streaming targets in subscribers the only thing that’s changed are macroeconomic factors. Factors such as inflation, lower spending, higher interest rates and so people are tightening the belt because it hurts more to build debt today than it did a year or two ago.

3. Most businesses in general do not make a profit in their first couple of years. These businesses were started during a time where losing money for hyper growth was normal and “encouraged”. There’s a bunch of multi billion dollar companies that exist today that never reported a profit. The industry/market is relatively new still and so people are just being competitive. These loses can likely be curbed if they grew slowly but growing too slowly is not competitive. Netflix been profitable for 20 years. But they were lucky to have 10 years of low competition to build up the crazy spending."
YG Future Strategy Office,That sounds like a question and the people running these studios don't like those.
YG Future Strategy Office,"Because it might work.

The danger of relying on say a Netflix deal without a back up plan, is that if Netflix opts out, the network/studio has nothing.

We will probably see consolidation in the future and only a few services will survive, but obviously every company hopes that they will be among the survivors.

NBC made a massive mistake by not entering the streaming market early, but that's another story.

It's easy to forget, but originally people assumed that people would only pay for movies and something like HBO."
YG Future Strategy Office,"You are supposed to lose money in the beginning when you invest in a new business, for at least a few years, before breaking even. That's why some people get rich and some don't, because some are willing to take risks and some don't."
YG Future Strategy Office,Because they dont need to be profitable. They just need to outlast the other streaming services. If they can do that then they can gobble up all the other services content and then eventually wind up profitable when they are the only streaming option
YG Future Strategy Office,"Studios are merely one division of massive multinational corporations now. Companies that large rarely care about short term profit/loss. This is about controlling their intellectual property, and realizing that over the air and cable are going to die off relatively soon. Streaming will become the go to, and controlling their back catalogue will be crucial."
YG Future Strategy Office,"That’s the cost of starting a new business.

It cost Netflix and Prime a ton of money too and despite the sink cost going into it, they are extremely popular and are a benefit to consumers over some monolithic service that, while paying the studios big money, would also charge consumers that difference.

It’ll all balance out although removing catalogue is not the way to do it."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Greedy self-involved assholes fearing they'll lose out on ""their share."" Capitalism ruins everything eventually."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Lose $2 billion a year, every year.

Yeah, but think of the profit potential!"
YG Future Strategy Office,"There is always going to be a huge risk with streaming services. Spend a hundred million on a new movie, see no significant growth in subscribers? well lets try again. Or, hey lets stop making new movies if they aren't making us any money. What's that we lost 5% of our subscribers. The model as it is cannot last, at least not if they continue putting so much into one project. Bring back mid budget cinema, less financial risk and more opportunity."
YG Future Strategy Office,"What they should do is unite against Netflix and the tech companies. Paramount, Warner, NBC, Disney should all get together

Oh wait that was Hulu."
YG Future Strategy Office,I think they will all just go to Hulu.
YG Future Strategy Office,"Is it even legal for them to merge? Given monopolisation laws, Studios were forced to divest from cinemas once they effectively merged together to control them back in the 50's i think it was. could go the same way for streaming services. You'll have one major service that licences 90% of it's content like old school netflix. This whole thing is a giant fire pit that will ultimately result in a fuck ton of lost money and no change."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Some combination of Disney+ and Hulu, and Amazon Prime. HBO is too busy being destroyed by the Discovery execs, Netflix is too busy speedrunning their own self destruction, Paramount doesn’t have anything other than Star Trek and reality reruns. Apple TV+ may stick around or just team up with someone."
YG Future Strategy Office,"It’s a streaming war and battle of attrition.  

winner takes all."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Rich people have literally nothing worth buying so they spend massive amounts of money on gambles hoping for a jackpot so they can ""win"" more bragging rights. 

I wish they'd get back into building pyramids or something."
YG Future Strategy Office,"Alright do you want to pay 70 dollars a month for that service now? That was Hulu in 2008 when streaming was an afterthought and linear television was still growing and revenues were enormous. 

So either get a time machine and go back or understand what you’re talking about."
YG Future Strategy Office,Paramount plus has 77 million subscribers now. I don't know man
YG Future Strategy Office,"Everywhere but America, Hulu is just part of D+ already. Some shows are stuck elsewhere due to legacy contracts but all their news stuff goes straight on there."
YG Future Strategy Office,"They're losing billions paying thousands of people to make art, and you want them to switch to building giant ugly useless tombs?"
YG Future Strategy Office,This is so stupid.
YG Future Strategy Office,"This is always what bothers me when people on here cheer for the collapse of various streamers and want everything on one service. 

The end result from that is either significantly less content or a much higher monthly fee. Most likely, it’s a combination of both.

This is what the A La carte services we were asking for looks like."
YG Future Strategy Office,They ran some completely insane lock in a 50% off price deal for life of the subscription in October to get that subscriber count boost. Even with that they’re still on track to lose like $2B
YG Future Strategy Office,People are anti-monopoly when they think about how Disney exerts control over movie theatres but completely forget about that and advocate for Netflix to have a monopoly when it comes to streaming.
YG Future Strategy Office,"It's always funny when I see ""the government must do something!"" when the topic of too many streaming services comes up. A pro monopoly commission? Mandatory mergers in a Pro-trust lawsuit?"

I will add Westworld between seasons 1 and 2."
YG Future Strategy Office,Surprised no one has said The Walking Dead.  That cliffhanger felt like it had the entire nation by the balls for the off season
YG Future Strategy Office,"I think all the Lost seasons ended with massive cliffhangers of the sort you described, though I think the season 1 finale was the most ""why you leave me hangin'?"" of them all.

YG Future Strategy Office,"Most recently the final season of Better Call Saul being split up. ""Okay, let's talk."""

>This probably doesn’t come anywhere close to Dallas

we'll never see that again because there are too many other things on TV now, and if you miss the premiere.. so what - everything is on demand. Dallas was ""one of three programs"" on television between 9 and 10 or whatever and if you missed it, you MISSED IT until they rebroadcast..  in those days, if you were a fan of a show, you stuck with it because there's no way to get caught up in the shows on other channels.

I was too young to even CARE about Dallas but i remember the hype.

The term possibly began as a reflection of certain programs' dominance of Friday night in the 1980s and 1990s, which resulted in decreased ratings for those scheduled opposite their competitors.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] By the 2000s, it was used in reference to the belief that young, single Americans rarely watch television on Friday or Saturday nights, thereby removing from the household what is considered the most lucrative demographic for advertisers.\[4\]\[5\] **With the collapse of the traditional network viewing model where viewers had to be in front of the TV to watch shows (and then the evolution from VCR or DVR capabilities to almost all shows being viewed increasingly through on-demand streaming media), the stigma of Friday night scheduling is much less evident or considered today than in the past.**"

After season three and another killer cliffhanger it was cancelled entirely in my country. So no more dubbed versions. Season four was my starting point of watching shows in English.

Edit: Okay, I just finished it, and it was just okay. It started out good, but it got way too chatty and slow and idiotic. Too much talking and not enough action. Plus, the lead actor was not convincing as a menacing hit man at all. It had some funny moments, but the majority of the time I was just thinking about everything that they were doing wrong and the stupid decisions they were making that were completely illogical. ""Oh let's try to escape this murderer by dragging this dead body down the elevator and through the parking garage instead of running away and calling the police immediately because the hit man who just killed my best friend is trapped in my panic room!"" I was just really expecting more from Blumhouse, but it's a partnership with Hulu, so I shouldn't be surprised."

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Dancing Queen,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Dancing Queen,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Dancing Queen,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Dancing Queen,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Dancing Queen,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Dancing Queen,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Dancing Queen,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Dancing Queen,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Dancing Queen,🙂💕
Dancing Queen,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Dancing Queen,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Dancing Queen,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Dancing Queen,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Dancing Queen,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Dancing Queen,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Dancing Queen,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Dancing Queen,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Dancing Queen,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Dancing Queen,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Dancing Queen,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Dancing Queen,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Dancing Queen,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Dancing Queen,"Wow!  If only somebody hard warned her that there would be a judging panel on this show, one with a judge that has been known for several seasons to be pretty critical of messy queens, she could have avoided this.  It's too bad Adore couldn't have spent some time on tour with that judge so she could get a preview of what that judge doesn't like about Adore's look. 

Let's see what appropriate clichés I can use.  Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Deja vu all over again.  "
Dancing Queen,I love everything about RuPaul. I've just started watching this show and I'm addicted
Dancing Queen,"Here is some of her best stuff! 


[I Adore U] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmV62-f-xnU)


[DTF] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4TB4UdDKBM)"
Dancing Queen,"Michelle only understands one style of drag, the old glamorous style.﻿"
Dancing Queen,Well gurl beware of season 4. It will rip your fucking heart out. Heed my words. Do other seasons before you go there.  
Dancing Queen,She was wrong. Adore is a star. Adore has more fans than Michelle. Adore makes more money than Michelle. She was simply being jealous.
Dancing Queen,Uh-oh. Now I'm both terrified and excited. Must arrange for a binge watch!
Dancing Queen,What the heck are you going on about?  The most memorable thing about this season was the introduction of a villain who reappears in AS2.  Otherwise it was no different than any other seasons and no more heart jerking than any other season.
Dancing Queen,"The abuse and ridicule one of the contestants goes through on the entire show will break your heart. It is unfair, and it was obviously done on purpose. 

EDIT: Avoid Season 4 unless you have tissues."
Dancing Queen,Well now you're making me want to skip ahead to season 4! Stop being a tease! :P
Dancing Queen,Go ahead and watch season 4. I was wrong. Watch it first. It is the best season. I was merely saying those things because of the trauma I felt after that season. I redact my previous statements. Please watch season 4. It is the season that launched the show into the big time with a winner nobody believed in.  
Dancing Queen,"Ooh okay. We're talking All Stars, not the original, yeah?

I kinda wanna binge it and tell you my reaction now LOL"
Dancing Queen,No. There are only 2 seasons of All Stars. I mean season 4 of RPDR.
Dancing Queen,"Good because that's the one I'm watching lol. I wanted to watch all stars after, so like in order. But now I am skipping to season 4! You better not be wrong!"
Dancing Queen,Honey get a pillow ready for when you curl up in to a pathetic fetus looking big cry baby. It is going to happen. You are seriously going to want to go out in public and slap people. But don't
Dancing Queen,"Okay, that's it. Tonight instead of watching Masters of Sex I'm watching this. "
Dancing Queen,"why are you even watching it if you're so tired of royal dramas? these are hardly innovative, unless you make something like Coppola's Marie Antoinette which was awful, but at least something new"
Dancing Queen,"“I’m tired of narratives about queens trying to make heirs.”

That’s what happens in all hereditary monarchies.In those systems,having an heir is a matter of national security. I don’t know how historically accurate The Serpent Queen is,but a lot of the events shown actually happened. For example,in real life,it took 10 years for Henry and Catherine to have an heir. Of course,Catherine trying to conceive is going to be an important plot point in any story about her.

“I’m tired of betrayals and treachery being plot points.”

They’re royals/politicians.That’s what they all do,even in the modern world.

“I’m tired of seeing everyone dressed up like they are in a circus.”
Do you want them to dress like they are in 2022?

“I’m tired of the way they typically speak”. 

Do you want them to speak like they are in 2022? Honestly,I found some of the Serpent Queen’s dialogue to be anachronistic. Other than the fact that the show is about an Italian woman who lived in France and all the actors sound British for some reason,some of the words used sound too modern.

I really don’t know what you want. All I can recommend is trying some costume dramas that aren’t set in Europe. However,even in non-European settings,depending on where and when it’s set,there may still be scheming royals and all of the other  things you describe."
Dancing Queen,"I loved this show and many others as well. Fans of this genre love everything you hate, including Charles Dance.

Personally, I find the left field stuff you propose quite annoying generally"
Dancing Queen,"Try Kingdom, you'll at least get zombies with your royal political drama."
Dancing Queen,"I dont really agree with most of these choices, but that’s what opinions are for.

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It’s been overlooked and it’s an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
Dancing Queen,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."
Dancing Queen,"Do you ever get bored about watching shows featuring race, gender, privilege, or journeys of self-discovery? Seems to be every show on this list just about.
 
Surprised reddit didn't love it actually."
Dancing Queen,ITT: People criticising OP’s taste because it’s not mainstream enough
Dancing Queen,Cool list! Nice to something different recommended.
Dancing Queen,"Holy shit, people are downvoting you! Thank you for the list and review man, so many unseen ones!

To me, this year was saved by Raised by Wolves"
Dancing Queen,"I love your style of writing dude, I barely know any name on that list but your description made me want to at least check two of these! Great diverse taste that is not the same mainstream stuff as we can see everywhere, great post!"
Dancing Queen,"I'm in the US, anyone know how to watch The Minister (Raoherran)? It sounds interesting and I'd like to check it out."
Dancing Queen,"
Ráðherrann and Kalifat seem so interesting. I love learning about shows outside the US and Britain. I gotta find a place to watch these shows.

Thanks!"
Dancing Queen,I May Destroy You?
Dancing Queen,Sounds like someone needs to see Ted Lasso.
Dancing Queen,People mad OP didn't put more mainstream and US shows. It's so stupid. Anyway I watched very few shows on your list ZeroZeroZero was so good I was surprised it didn't get discussed more. I didn't watch the second season of L'amica geniale but the first one was amazing
Dancing Queen,I feel like Dispatches From Elsewhere would be a good addition to this list. It didn't get a lot of pub but it was one of the most earnest and heartfelt shows I'd seen in a while.

Dancing Queen,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
Dancing Queen,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
Dancing Queen,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
Dancing Queen,is OP a feminist?
Dancing Queen,"Great list, keep up the great work"
Dancing Queen,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."
Dancing Queen,Bad list is bad.
Dancing Queen,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
Dancing Queen,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.
Dancing Queen,"Pretentious, but not as pretentious as av club."
Dancing Queen,You need to branch out A LOT.   You have some very odd tastes but I guess that’s just what you like.
Dancing Queen,"*Tower of God* but no *Re:Zero*? Damn. 

Even if I very much disagree with Re: Zero being left on any list. I’m glad to see one without *Lovecraft Country*. That show was such a dumpster fire I’m not sure how any competent person could watch it and says it’s good, let alone one of the best of the year."
Dancing Queen,Do you tell people that you own many leather bound books?
Dancing Queen,"Hey, have you watched: Alex Rider, Alice in Borderland, Someone Has to Die, The Flight Attendant, The Great, To the Lake? These have all been released this year so I was wondering if you'd watched them. I've been reading some of your reviews and you write pretty well, although I don't necessarily agree with all your opinions."
Dancing Queen,"I wasn't aware that Juno Temple was in another project titled Little Birds, so I thought you randomly threw a 2011 film on the list. I will have to check that out, as well as a few others."
Dancing Queen,Sounds like you would like Suburra on Netflix based on this list.
Dancing Queen,Part of why I love end of the year lists is that I often discover shows (or movies) I never knew existed and/or am given a reason to try a show I might have skipped.  Your list definitely inspires that.  Bonus points for articulating why the shows worked for you.
Dancing Queen,Tower of god (webtoon) is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. The anime isnt that great imo
Dancing Queen,What a great list. But please refrain from adding Japanese shows. No way that any is worthy of the top 25.
Dancing Queen,"> the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters

What show do you mean?"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Violet Evergarden: Special,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Violet Evergarden: Special,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia

Violet Evergarden: Special,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Violet Evergarden: Special,Needs more Jojo
Violet Evergarden: Special,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Violet Evergarden: Special,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Violet Evergarden: Special,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"

Violet Evergarden: Special,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Violet Evergarden: Special,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Violet Evergarden: Special,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Violet Evergarden: Special,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Violet Evergarden: Special,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Violet Evergarden: Special,Black Clover?
Violet Evergarden: Special,.
Violet Evergarden: Special,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Violet Evergarden: Special,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Violet Evergarden: Special,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Violet Evergarden: Special,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Violet Evergarden: Special,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Violet Evergarden: Special,[deleted]
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Violet Evergarden: Special,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Violet Evergarden: Special,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Violet Evergarden: Special,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Violet Evergarden: Special,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Violet Evergarden: Special,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Violet Evergarden: Special,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Violet Evergarden: Special,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Violet Evergarden: Special,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Violet Evergarden: Special,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Violet Evergarden: Special,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Violet Evergarden: Special,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Violet Evergarden: Special,This show was hilarious
Violet Evergarden: Special,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Violet Evergarden: Special,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Violet Evergarden: Special,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Violet Evergarden: Special,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Creeped Out,"You mean Requiem, the UK show? I don't recall that scene but I get why you're confused... it was a very confusing show."
Creeped Out,It was very confusing. Never even understood if it was cancelled or that was meant to be the real ending
Creeped Out,So confusing and ended on a cliffhanger.
Creeped Out,"Thanks for the heads up! My daughter loves watching Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the Dark, I'm definitely going to show this to her."
Creeped Out,R.L Stine's Haunting Hour show was pretty dark back in the day too. Some of the episodes did not have happy endings. 
Creeped Out,"UK viewers, it's been airing on CBBC (aka the BBC channel for children aged 3-16, not to be confused with CBeebies, which is for 3 and under) since around November? December?

Was tempted by it myself but haven't, yet."
Creeped Out,"I've seen most of the episode, it's very good. I'm surprised how dark it goes in some of the episodes!"
Creeped Out,Trailer looks great. Wish I had a kid to watch it with lmao 
Creeped Out,At least it'll make sense when a guinea pig solves a crime.
Creeped Out,Where do you watch GB and AYAOTD?
Creeped Out,"My grandpa plays a creepy janitor in 2 episodes of Goosebumps. They are both different but he apparently plays a good enough creepy Janitor they asked him to come back. He was a creepy dude.
"
Creeped Out,"I was in my mid 20s when Haunting Hour started but I was impressed and somewhat shocked at how dark it was. I loved Goosebumps growing up but damn I wish I could have had Haunting Hour. Pretty good production value given the audience.

I enjoyed Spooksville too. I was obsessed with those books as a kid. "
Creeped Out,You don't need a kid to watch it. I'm a college student and I'm watching it. 
Creeped Out,"Goosebumps is on Netflix. You can buy seasons 1-5 of AYAOTD on Google Play, it's also available in other degital stores in Amazon and iTunes. "
Creeped Out,"Canadian Netflix had them for a while, not sure if they still do."
Creeped Out,"Yea, I'm loving this show.  It's super creepy/thrilling.  Great soundtrack too."
Creeped Out,"I'm doing the same thing.  I'm trying not to research it.  I've only got through the first two chapters.  Is there more out?

I think he killed his wife, and I know he was only 7 at the time but I wonder if he had anything to do with his mother's death.  It was so odd the way he described it."
Creeped Out,I really hope we get to learn more about Susan Berman's murder. It is the most interesting death so  far. 
Creeped Out,"Just so it's clear to people who haven't heard of this, it's a documentary mini-series."
Creeped Out,"Yes, outstanding show from a great director."
Creeped Out,"Yeah this is probs my favourite currently airing show (main competitors: *Archer* and *Adventure Time*). Really interesting show and reminds me a lot of Serial which I also loved (though this is probably because I haven't watched/listened/read much ""True Crime"" stuff). "
Creeped Out,"An interesting show, true ""true crime,""...I also would have voted ""not guilty"" in the trial of the death of his neighbor - his defense was essentially bulletproof, given the State's inablility to disprove self-defense as admitted to by the detective on the stand. "
Creeped Out,"[SPOILERS]

> I dont believe he murdered Susan.

You hadn't seen episode 5 before you wrote this(?) He's in California at the exact time the murder is committed. He has no alibi. Then, he leaves California the day of the murder. His handwriting is an exact match to the anonymous letter. although, why did it take a independent documentary to dig this up? the LA cops couldn't A) find samples of Durst's handwriting, or B) get him to submit a handwriting sample?

Of course, I bet his million dollar lawyers would formulate a scenario in which someone was *framing* Durst, by sending those letters, impersonating his handwriting.

At first I thought the reason the Durst family is defending Bob was because of familial ties. Now, I think it's much more cynical. They don't care about him. They just know that if he's convicted it will reflect badly on *them* and their businesses.

> gave her son 100k

sure, he gave him 100k. *after* he killed her, undoubtedly to keep him from pointing fingers and riling up the police during their investigation. and, the way it was portrayed it didn't seem that money was the issue; it was more that Susan was going to be interviewed by the police again.
"
Creeped Out,"Just got through episode 3 and I'm really confused by his character during the interviews. When he's like ""well of course i shaved my head and brows, i was on the run!"" I didn't know whether to laugh or be creeped out. His whole demeanour is so disconcerting. "
Creeped Out,"See the soundtrack reminds me of this one episode of the good wife. Dont know if you watch the show, but there is a murderer that tries to collect money on a creepy song he wrote and then gets busted for a different murder
Anyway it has the same tone and creepiness to the song"
Creeped Out,"I know the suicide his dad made him watch. Totally bizarre. Part 3 is out. 

It's hard because I know if I google it, there's probably a ton of info, but I like how the story is told and I dont want to spoil it. Im tempted to though"
Creeped Out,"I know but it sounds like she couldve pissed off the wrong person. Maybe not even the mob, but someone close that could be affected negatively. Like a relative of someone she was going to write about? Things got heated and then she was murdered. The person felt bad. I doubt Durst would send that note. He doesnt seem to care much about murder. "
Creeped Out,"Spoiler!!!!
***********

"
Creeped Out,"I couldnt get into serial. I have a hard time listening for some reason. I love to read, but my brain just shuts off when it's passive listening. "
Creeped Out,"i dont see how its bullet proof... if im on the jury, id be more likely to believe self-defense if the defendant had immediately called the cops. much less likely to believe self-defense if the defendant had chopped the body and ran.

its just that durst had impeccable lawyers and Texas didnt use their varsity squad to prosecute him.  Very OJ-like situation."
Creeped Out,"Eeek, Im just finishin episode 4. It's fuckin fantastic"
Creeped Out,"Yeah I just watched ep 5 this am. 

The part that the cops didnt find the letter is odd to me too. Especially since they *really* want to get him. 

Oh I think the family wishes he was wiped out. They wish his name was not the same as theirs. 

The money part, I still dont really understand. I think its more that he doesnt really care about money. When you have so much, that's such a small amount to him. Maybe just blood money? I dont know

"
Creeped Out,"Me either. Then when he's like ""I didn't know they let accused murderers out. Of course I ran. Bye 250k"" super weird. Then when he talks about the sandwich. It's like he enjoys pushing the limits. That's probably why he murdered his neighbor. Just to see if he could"
Creeped Out,"Yes,  I love the Good Wife!  Not sure which show you're referring to, however.  Which season was it from?  That should help narrow things down."
Creeped Out,I took the suicide thing as an attempt by his Dad to convince his mom to not jump. 
Creeped Out,"Thanks!

I wonder what anyone makes of Durst's weird eye blinking thing."
Creeped Out,"Spoiler !!!!
*******


Episode 5 certainly points to durst having sent that letter to the police that said cadaver. "
Creeped Out,"I don't know what to tell you other than maybe ""try again"". Like most things, you'd probably get better at it the more you try. I really think if you like this it's very probably you'll appreciate Serial. "
Creeped Out,"or just getting a handwriting sample. those two letters are *exact*, for christs sake.

and they've been sitting on this evidence for 4+ years, editing the documentary. they kind of had an obligation to turn it over to the authorities before it was convenient for their documentary's PR campaign.... "
Creeped Out,"That sandwich part is just so weird. He's on the run from the police and despite having all this money, he decides to steal? His explanation in the interview was so not satisfying at all. All his tics, the way he speaks and explains himself.. I have no idea what to make of it! Like you, I don't want to look up the case too much, but i'm so tempted"
Creeped Out,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632296/ Season 2 ep 18. I dont know if you can find the song. It's a super creepy episode though
Creeped Out,"but they were inside, right? He didnt take Robert outside and say ""hey look what you have to live for. your son robert"" he just kind of showed him through the window. Bizarre"
Creeped Out,The tic adds to his overall odd persona
Creeped Out,"He sure seems to do it alot when they are asking tough questions.  
"
Creeped Out,"Looks like he has dead black eyes, too. "
Creeped Out,"noooo way! I havent watched it yet, but that's super exciting"
Creeped Out,"I just watched. WTF, wow. I am shocked. I dont want it to end next week. I cant wait to see his face when they talk about the letter!"
Creeped Out,"I just watched. WTF, wow. I am shocked. I dont want it to end next week. I cant wait to see his face when they talk about the letter!"
Creeped Out,Well why didnt the cops look through her stuff or her son? Her son had to know about the letter
Creeped Out,"Derealization makes you do weird things. 

I was addicted to xanax for a while, I started shoplifting just to see if I could. I didn't even take things I needed or necessarily wanted usually, I'd just see something on a shelf and decide that was my mark.

Living life the way he has I wouldn't doubt he has that same sort of confidence a xanax addict has. Just a total emptiness, sort of a ""Let's see what happens if I do this"" kind of mentality. "
Creeped Out,"The way the documentary seemed to frame it, this father Seymour was really a cold fish. Being almost confrontational with the wife about to jump, rather than conciliatory. "
Creeped Out,I think I'd like to play poker with him.
Creeped Out,"It was incredible, I got goosebumps. And I read the cops are watching the show as closely as we are to see if he says anything they can nab him for. "
Creeped Out,"They need to get another handwriting sample from him.

Of course, then, his lawyers can claim he was framed."
Creeped Out,Isn't that crazy??
Creeped Out,"Thats how I felt about it. Even if you're sick of your wife and dont care if she jumps, you wouldnt show your kid, unless there's something wrong with you"
Creeped Out,The only downfall i can see is that people sure seem to turn up dead around this guy.   
Creeped Out,I read that too! He seems pretty awesome at deception though. Im excited to watch
Creeped Out,I bet he'll spell beverly right this time!
Creeped Out,"What will he say? Im sure he wont show surprise, but I wonder how he would explain that? "
Creeped Out,"Well, if I did play poker with him, I would have some armed bodyguards because the people that turn up dead are all female."
Creeped Out,"I watched the movie last night, now I'm curious what role his family played in this. Such a good show, HBO rocks my socks off."
Creeped Out,"weird though, how he didn't bother to disguise his handwriting *at all*."
Creeped Out,"He's going to say he sent the letter, because he couldn't stand to see her laying there. And he just wanted to make sure she was found. Which if he says that is poppycock. It will be crazy to see what he comes up with. He's an amazing liar."
Creeped Out,His neighbor was male. No one is safe.
Creeped Out,What movie?
Creeped Out,Totally weird. I dont know what to think
Creeped Out,"Yeah he will never fess up. I cant wait, but I dont want it to end. Also the director needs to put out all of the interviews and cut scenes. Im sure there is lots more!"
Creeped Out,"Oh my god, I can't believe I forgot that.  I feel really stupid."
Creeped Out,"It's called All Good Things and the director of the documentary also directed that. It's what made Robert Durst want to do the interview. He's like BTK, can't stay out of the limelight. "
Creeped Out,"haha no biggie. Im curious about the trial [spoiler](#s ""because he got off somehow. I know he was aquitted but how do you go from a murder trial where you cut someone up to aquitted. I did read that he said it was self defense, but I didnt want to know much more. His money bought some damn good lawyers"")"
Creeped Out,"THANK YOU. So gonna watch. Im fascinated with him. He's so strange in a way that makes him such a fantastic character to watch. 

I think about the letter, he'll just say ""yeah that does look like my writing, but I didnt write it"" I dont see him getting flustered by it"
Creeped Out,"If by creeped-out you mean she was my imaginary girlfriend, then yes."
Creeped Out,I did a google search and found out what he looks like now and that she is 35... wow fucking time!
Creeped Out,Small Wonder...wow.

Creeped Out,"San Junipero is an amazing episode in the latest season, and almost uplifting by Black Mirror standards."
Creeped Out,"Black mirror is the kind of show where I watch one episode, decide I don't want another existential crisis, go for about 6 months and then decide ""oh I love this show, really makes me think"", and then I get through about 3/4 the episode and I repeat the cycle again... "
Creeped Out,I can see that. I binged it all though. One of the best shows I've ever seen.
Creeped Out,"About half way thru the first episode, thanks for the heads up."
Creeped Out,Wait until you see the rating people one.
Creeped Out,"Great advice. You get consumed by the strangeness and darkness of it, it feels too real."
Creeped Out,"I watched the first season in one sitting, it was very depressing. Last week I watched White Christmas. I can't even finish the series. It's too depressing and thought provoking. I am not about that. "
Creeped Out,Really? The only one that made me have to stop was playtest. That was too goddamn terrifying. 
Creeped Out,"Ive been trying to get into this show but I'm not sure if Netflix has the seasons out of order or it's being clever by starting with season 3? Was that just a goof, or is it in purpose? I know how dumb this question might be. "
Creeped Out,"no, you're all just drama queens"
Creeped Out,I never had problems binge watching this show. It wasn't near the emotional drain level of something like The Leftovers.
Creeped Out,Don't you watch it in order?
Creeped Out,I watched all of them one weekend. Really enjoyed it. 
Creeped Out,First rule of Black Mirror is you don't binge-watch Black Mirror.

The Third Charm,HBO to Naughty Dog: “ima need you to make a third game or we’ll write our own part three”
The Third Charm,But did you know that diarrhea is hereditary?
The Third Charm,Roughly 20% growth episode on episode is insane. These numbers are insane
The Third Charm,Execs everywhere now combing over every video game ever
The Third Charm,I’ve been loving this show so much. I’m so glad someone who actually cares for the source material is making this show.
The Third Charm,should hopefully keep steady til final.
The Third Charm,"How do the ratings compare between Friday and Sunday nights in the US? I know there are games on other channels on Sunday, but aren't a lot of people out on a Friday night?"
The Third Charm,"Crazy thing about well made shows: people watch them. 

Together we can stop shitty entertainment, but we need to work together on this people"
The Third Charm,"Said it the the second week, I'll say it again

Season finale will have HOTD finale numbers, 10+M."
The Third Charm,Well it helps that the show is really good. Not many shows live up to the hype this had. As a Halo fan I gave up on the show. I’m sure the relative loyalty of the source is retaining fans.
The Third Charm,Aw the IMDB review bombing is working real well
The Third Charm,[deleted]
The Third Charm,"The more I enjoy this great show, the sadder I feel about how they absolutely butchered the Witcher and the Wheel of Time..."
The Third Charm,This show is absolutely killing it!
The Third Charm,"i have not been a hype man for this show at all and i gotta say it's the best videogame adaptation that i know of. typical HBO quality in regards to everything. every episode has been solid and last week's was phenomenal and reminded me of what the walking dead could have been if it was on HBO.

if they push this to two or three seasons by adapting the second game i can totally see it becoming an all-timer for the network. the people making this show know what they're doing."
The Third Charm,"recipe to success is very simple

\- simple story

\- complex characters"
The Third Charm,Have they mentioned whether season 1 is the full game? Because already episode 5…meaning only 4 hours left of story which blows my mind.
The Third Charm,"**It's the behemoth that keeps on growing:**

>Episode 4 of *THE LAST OF US* delivered another series high Sunday night, with 7.5 million viewers across HBO Max and linear telecasts. Viewership was up 17% from Episode 3 last Sunday and 60% above the series debut night in January. Viewing is based on Nielsen and first party data. The series has grown its audience each Sunday night with the release of new episodes."
The Third Charm,cant stop the pedro train
The Third Charm,Season 2 is going to be off the hook.
The Third Charm,Not that surprising consider this is its first week without NFL playoffs.
The Third Charm,"I'm one of the people who helped it grow this weekend.  We hadn't checked it out yet, but I kept hearing so much good feedback about the 3rd episode that I finally decided to check the show out.  My wife and I watched the first episode Friday night and were instantly hooked.  What a well written, directed and acted show so far.

The 3rd episode was a masterpiece, imo.  I've never been so emotionally invested in a pair of one-off characters before.  My wife had tears in her eyes for half the episode.  Not going to elaborate to avoid spoilers.  

Only 4 episodes so far, but no clunkers and no filler.  If it keeps up this pace, it will be my favorite new show since The Expanse."
The Third Charm,"Oh, so you mean all the right wing backlash because episode three had some gay dudes in it amounted to nothing?

Shocker.

These people might be loud assholes, but they’re the minority and they’re slowly being relegated to the sad pages of history."
The Third Charm,A truly impressive video game to TV series adaptation so far. They deviate from the source material when it makes for a better story and I'm here for it
The Third Charm,"You know what?  Good for everyone involved.  When people make a good product to tell a good story everybody wins.  I'm looking forward to the season closing out so I can watch it all in one go and I'll do the same in the second season, too."
The Third Charm,"I love how terminally online bigots said it would drop like crazy after the third episode and then this happens. Like even I expected a slight drop, but it didn't come. This is absolutely insane."
The Third Charm,Surely this can’t be true. A bunch of people online told me that HBO pushing their woke agenda in Ep. 3 was going to kill the show??
The Third Charm,maybe an unpopular opinion but i felt Ep. 4 was the best one so far. only wish it was longer. great character development in this one and still some cool action scenes
The Third Charm,This is easily one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.
The Third Charm,"The creative talent behind this show is off the chain. Craig Mazin has done a tremendous job adapting the source material and building upon an already incredible story. The casting across the board has been A+. The decision to have Peter Hoar direct Ep.3 was a stroke of genius, with his previous work on It's a Sin making total sense. Just goes to show what can happen when talented people are passionate about a project and given the means to see their vision come about."
The Third Charm,"And this is in spite of half of Canadians being left unable to watch it for a couple of hours because our telecom company, bell, is garbage."
The Third Charm,Praise Druckmann. The man is just on a roll every week with the amazing episodes
The Third Charm,Dad jokes delivered!
The Third Charm,"It's amazing what can be achieved when they create a show that is faithful to the spirit of the source material, rather than trying to make wholesale changes in an almost condescending fashion. No one cares about a particular writer or directors idea for how to reimagine a beloved IP just for the sake of making it their own. The audience want the IP. They want what makes that series great.

I don't want an Assassin's Creed movie where the dude is jumping around in some virtual room for example instead of going into the animus as you do in every single game. What the fuck was that even? They completely missed what mattered"
The Third Charm,I have been doing my part to get as many people into it as possible haha
The Third Charm,"Pedro Pascal seems like a magnet to drawing viewers. GoT, Mandalorian, Last of Us he’s doing great"
The Third Charm,This almost guarantees a third last of us game and probably a 3rd season of the show also.
The Third Charm,Good show
The Third Charm,They can easily stretch part 2 into 2 seasons
The Third Charm,"Everyone and their mother is on this.

Which is great, it's a good story and they're doing a good job since they care.

Thing is that the game is cinematic on its own, and I'm glad new people are exposed to it (which was definitely one of the goals) but don't forget, It isn't totally new. So, I'm glad the adaptation is good but the story existed in the last 10 years at this point.

I guess this main stream we-discovered-something-amazing all of a sudden, kinda bugs me, I dunno."
The Third Charm,But but but woke broke or w/e!?
The Third Charm,I think ep4 was pretty mild compared to ep3. So I wonder if that surge will continue.
The Third Charm,"Last episode was okay, first three were huge."
The Third Charm,"It's so good. Not to harp on that dead horse velma, but when the wife and I decided to catch up on last of us..we had to get through three velma promotions to find it in the search bar. They're really advertising that sucker hard in front of last of us"
The Third Charm,"While this news is exciting, the last episode was the least entertaining so far."
The Third Charm,I must be the only person who felt that the show is severely overrated.
The Third Charm,I don’t remember the last time there was so much hype surrounding a show. I’m trying to wait until the seasons over to binge it but it’s getting harder each week!
The Third Charm,So tripping over the fact I watched the new episode with my mom of all people because apparently she is really into it. Pretty cool how its even pulling in people who have no frame of reference of the source material who are just loving it.
The Third Charm,"Crazy how if you make a good show, people will watch it."
The Third Charm,"Three seasons would be good, please dont drag it out forever like the walking dead"
The Third Charm,"I'm curious if the show is also driving sales/downloads of the game. I think it's one of the ps plus classics they're giving away. 

Though it's been out for so long and in the video game world people have been raving about it since release, so I don't even know how big any untapped market could be."
The Third Charm,"hopefully this sparks tv shows of other games. 

outlast, a good resident evil series, the evil within, amnesia, dying light, bio shock, horizon zero dawn, fallout, dead island, assassins creed. 

there is such a wealth of quality tv show content that could be made from existing video game universes"
The Third Charm,Oh boy I can't wait for the David episode
The Third Charm,It’s almost like good quality and slow releases build audience.
The Third Charm,I'm surprised that I like it since I can't stand anything zombie.
The Third Charm,"shows the benefit of streaming, can watch the service instead of having to have cable"
The Third Charm,Sony must be happy.
The Third Charm,E3 hit me right in the feels
The Third Charm,Some would say it is growing like a fungus.
The Third Charm,It was pretty good.
The Third Charm,I’d be one too if hbo max app wasn’t crap
The Third Charm,"Bruh i hope season two goes with the longer episodes every time, the shorter ones leave me wanting more but ep 1 n 3 really felt like complete episodes"
The Third Charm,The show is really great!
The Third Charm,I’m trying to get into it but im also still catching up on walking dead and I don’t think I have the capacity for both.
The Third Charm,New gay demo is like “this ain’t what I signed up for”
The Third Charm,Netflix would have cancelled it by now.
The Third Charm,They need an Xbox version. Don’t hate me
The Third Charm,I never played TLOU but am familiar with the concept and story line. Because of this show I'm watching a radbrad walk through and rewatched the last 3 episodes this week. Such a great show. Completely hooked.
The Third Charm,"I'm liking this series so far, and it's really doing the games justice from a drama standpoint, but I can firmly say now I prefer the way the game tells this story.  That ambush scene was pretty disappointing compared to the way it played out the game."
The Third Charm,"Still haven't seen one thing on this show that hasn't been done so many times before.  Character, plot, world, every single beat has been done so many times already.  Doesn't feel like there's any reason for the show to exist."
The Third Charm,This just does not happen. Even HOT which was a hit for HBO didn't do it . It was decreasing week after week ever since the second episod premiered. Word of mouth is what selling this show.
The Third Charm,"For those of you who haven't played the game, you can watch this playthrough of it once the show is over, (or can watch along as the show progresses). It will give you the gameplay experience and the close to a commentary from the creators/makers/performers of the game. Also helps in understanding the difference between the game and the show. Even for people who have this might give you a very good insight.

The playthrough is by Nolan North (performance actor for Nathan Drake of Uncharted, a generally bad gamer but funny person), assisted by Troy Baker (who plays Joel from the game) and more or less each episode will feature the actor who plays an important role in it. 

[Gameplay walkthrough ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeAoBVaD6aozN80rjIss28SHHlKf-mACx)"
The Third Charm,"When I first heard about this show I just thought oh no another Walking Dead, but I'm happy I started watching it, the first 4 episodes have been great but I hope they don't drag it out too long just to keep the show running. Quality of Quanity is better."
The Third Charm,This is spreading hugely by word of mouth in my office at work.
The Third Charm,The latest episode wasn’t anything special.
The Third Charm,"The show is definitely doing the game justice. If season one ends where the first game does though, that’s probably where I’ll jump off. I’m not a fan of any of what they did in the second game. That whole narrative direction can get f’ed."
The Third Charm,"It's a good show, I'm enjoying it....but I don't get the insane amount of hype surrounding it. It's good, but not the best thing I've ever seen, by a long shot."
The Third Charm,"""Go Woke... ~~go broke~~ eeer get a larger audience"""
The Third Charm,This show is so astroturfed.
The Third Charm,Episode 5 is about to tank hard since they are (temporarily) moving it to Friday due to the Super Bowl.
The Third Charm,"7.5 million viewers? If this were Netflix it would have been canceled 15 minutes into the first episode hahaha

/s so the Netflix love brigade does not kill me"
The Third Charm,Where is the Metal Gear Solid series?
The Third Charm,It’s too damn good.
The Third Charm,"Honestly so far I have loved the show and it has easily passed my favourite shows, I just wasn't very fond of this weeks episode, sometimes we need slower episodes yes, but it didn't feel as good as the first 3 episodes."
The Third Charm,Love to see it. This story was well written for the game and they have translated it so well to the screen. I hope we keep seeing growth as more episodes come out and I can’t wait to see the conversations that happens with the last episode and Joel’s choices.
The Third Charm,Is this legit good? I've never played the game before but love to immerse myself in a well told story.
The Third Charm,In episode 4 why didn't they just drive up the hill and cross the road and around the tunnel?
The Third Charm,"So far this show hasn’t really been anything new, it’s not really a breath of fresh air. It’s hbo so the casting & acting is always elite. So far after 4 episodes I’d give it around a 7.3/10"
The Third Charm,"sure it is, the publicity it's getting is also not normal"
The Third Charm,"Uh, so it went woke but didn't go broke"
The Third Charm,See what happens when you take the tome to show respect to the ip you’re adapting? It gets positive results. Take notes Velma 📝
The Third Charm,"I thought that episode 3 last week was really good, but I am happy that it looks like they are back on track with the game's story"
The Third Charm,Wow. I wonder what next week's headlines will be?
The Third Charm,It’s mostly hype. It’s already becoming the worst of the walking dead. An hour show where nothing really happens.
The Third Charm,Boring
The Third Charm,I might be having a contrarian view out here. But i just don't understand what is the hype all about? This is one of the most disengaging big shows in recent times i have seen
The Third Charm,So glad to know that episode three still did very well despite the homophobic review bombs
The Third Charm,Could you imagine if Sony didn’t drop the ball on uncharted and try to cash cow that movie. That series could have been just as killer.
The Third Charm,I cried when I finished game one.

i think matt and trey ended up writing a resolution to the story to appease fans but i remember it being somewhat of a big deal at the time it aired

>The finale ended on a cliffhanger, promising to announce the truth four weeks later in Season 2, Episode 1. Fans who tuned in for the revelation were instead greeted with a title card announcing the April Fools' episode called ""Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus.""

Beauty Inside,"Nobody's said this one, so I will - the reveal of the name of the Doctor. The episode title was leaked way beforehand. People spent months speculating, trying to figure out what the Doctor's name was before it was revealed. There's no real way to come up with a good answer, so there were lots of jokes answers. Then the episode airs and it's like, *oh, I get it. Nice.* It's not earth-shattering, but it was a cool moment. 

Also whichever Goosebumps episode it is where they're at a summer camp, and spooky shit happens. They think there's a werewolf or something?

Beauty Inside,"Sylvie kills He Who Remains and unleashes the multiverse on the MCU.  

Up until that point the shows reacted to the movies and not the other way round. Now at least three movies are going to be dealing with the repercussions of that episode."

Beauty Inside,"How to get away with murder: Wes is killed.

He had so much plot armor it didn’t seem like they would kill him off. Even after his death so many people thought it was faked and were waiting for his return. Good riddance also I found him so annoying."
Beauty Inside,Jesus chridt everybody just randomly naming shows but not even saying what the twist is. What's the point of these threads if it's just vagueness and names of shows?
Beauty Inside,Desperate Housewives 5 year time jump was subtle but very very well done and really gave the show a new lease on life. Not a big shocker but something that surprised and delighted and left me talking for days.
Beauty Inside,The betrayal in agents of shield season 1
Beauty Inside,"Squid game

The marble episode."
Beauty Inside,Turns out it was man all along.
Beauty Inside,Definitely the basement reveal from Attack on Titan. It is unparalleled. I genuinely think it’s the greatest twist in cinematic history for how much it changed. And it was so well foreshadowed as well.
Beauty Inside,"""You did it, Vic."""
Beauty Inside,"After the absolute devastation the protagonist has gone through, the big twist in season 3 of Mr. Robot is fucking devastating. It isn’t a huge “OH SHIT” moment, but a sad moment of sobriety that leaves you just depressed as fuck."

Beauty Inside,The rise and fall of game of thrones is probably one of the craziest unintentional twists in TV history.
Beauty Inside,"Scrubs - ""Where do you think we are?""


Good Place - The end of Season 1



Lost - ""We have to go back!"" and ""NOT PENNY'S BOAT""



Fringe - that last scene of season 1, and also ""Olivia, please don't tell him.""

Beauty Inside,"The most recent for me was in Squid Game second to last episode when you saw Sang-Woo standing there above the bed. Not really a BIG twist, but it really got me."
Beauty Inside,"> A pretty contrived peemise...

ha.

I liked the ending of the first episode of Big Sky."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Honestly, I’m shocked not to see The Woman King. The make up, and the hair styling was so diverse and outstanding."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Especially with Abbott Elementary getting a nod.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Diverse?
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Completely different categories
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"
di·verse
/dəˈvərs,dīˈvərs/

adjective: diverse
1.
showing a great deal of variety; very different."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"in terms of swapping a nation's history to make them appear less shit, I'd say it was diverse alright"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I'm a Lindelof superfan but I must say every new detail in this story makes me more excited to see it. Sounds like it will have similar vibes to Watchmen and the ""International Assassin"" episode of The Leftovers."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,New Lindelof-involved show? I'm in
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Betty Gilpin as a nun is truly pushing the boundaries of sci fi
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"First time hearing of this, thanks for sharing!"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Haven't kept up with this show but very hyped for it. Lindelof is probably my favourite show runner easy. Made 3 of my favourite shows. 

Not interested in his Star Wars movie(hope its good though) until we get reviews for that :). But show wise this is definitely one I'm looking forward to. Guess it will be Peacocoks's 2nd worthwhile show.

Didn't realise this was a Warner tv show.Surprised it didnt got to hbo max back then tbh.Also didnt realise this was coming out soon."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I can't get the article. Can someone share a rundown of it?
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"> Lindelof

*barf*"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Can't wait for the unresolved mysteries, daddy issues and hallucinations !"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I'm with you, Lindelof is a genius in my opinion and I'll watch literally anything he is in charge of."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Warner TV makes a lot of stuff for every network, similar to Sony Pictures Television. 

Since 2022, they’ve made shows for Apple TV+, Fox, HBO Max, NBC, The CW, Starz, OWN, Netflix, CBS, Amazon and have deals with Disney+, Peacock, ABC, Showtime, MGM+ in the future"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I don't know which other peacock show you're referring to as worthwhile but Poke Face and Paul T. Goldman are both recent examples of good programming on peacock
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"What evolved from these conversations is **Mrs. Davis**, *a Peacock series debuting April 20* about a nun named Simone (Betty Gilpin) who, based on her beliefs and a distrust of cheap magic, decides to take down a seemingly benevolent algorithm that has won over the entire world. It is a sci-fi romp about faith and computers and a love story about God and gamification, and it’s somehow also a wacky fetch-quest narrative about death, mid-tier Reno magicians, and the Holy Grail. Much of Mrs. Davis is difficult to discuss without ruining several of its best surprises, but its underlying preoccupations are most apparent in its many divergent influences — and what it clearly is not."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Ih yea I know they are behind stuff flike Ted lasso, abbot elementary but figured after leftovers and watchmen they would keep lindelof on hbo"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Lindelof might be my favorite writer-producer working right now. This seems right up his alley.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Is the nun’s name being Simone a reference to the film *Simone* (which had Sim-One — the singer Simulation One)?
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Huh. Apparently WBTV is an independent studio, but of course they still make their fair share of stuff for HBO 

>	Re-signing Lindelof comes as a coup for WBTV. As an independent studio, keeping top producers in-house remains a high priority as broadcast, cable and streaming outlets alike increasingly focus on ownership and have been producing content in-house. Lindelof joins producers such as Chuck Lorre, Greg Berlanti, Westworld‘s J.J. Abrams, Jonah Nolan and Lisa Joy, among others, at the studio."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I was in the USAF stationed in Italy back in the early 80's. A family member sent me a VHS tape of just Beverly Hillbillies episodes. After watching it I wrote my name on it and gave it to a coworker. That tape went from person to person for quite a while. For a couple of years people would come up to me, thank me and tell me they had passed it on. Good times, thanks for sending me down memory lane!"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I remember one episode where the grandmother thought the president was Jefferson Davis.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"There are two very good eps I particularly enjoy:  

[Manhattan Hillbillies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0522541/) - A trip to New York, encountering two Irish beat cops in Central Park, played by Sean McClory and Sammy Davis Jr.

[Robin Hood and the Sherrif](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0522555/) - ""You say your granny smokes *crawdads*?"""
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Well said.  My family all comes from West Virginia so it was a favorite in my household growing up.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Still fucking hilarious to this day!
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"The show was especially great in its early b&w days and got huge ratings. The first two seasons averaged 57 million viewers each episode. I believe it is the only comedy series to be #1 in the season ratings in its first year. (Laverne & Shirley debuted at #1 but ranked third in its first season.)

The most-watched half-hour episode of a TV show aired in 1964. ""The Giant Jackrabbit"" was watched by 65% of the people in the US with TV sets. It was no doubt helped by the fact that President Johnson's State of the Union address, his first since Kennedy's assassination, was the lead-in, but still. 

Until the Super Bowls regularly started drawing huge numbers, several episodes of Beverly Hillbillies were on the 20 most-watched broadcasts of all time list."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Of all the ""rural"" shows, this one was by far the best.  Managing to put the Clampetts in a lot a different situations and not just repeating themselves"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Am I misremembering or did almost every episode involve the bank guy/financial advisor/investment guy and his secretary trying to scam the family or something?
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I thought the movie was solid and excellently casted
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I had a problem watching this show when I was younger, because I took their hillbilly behavior at face value, and would simply be mad at them for not realizing that they look silly. Like why even go to California or Beverly Hills if not to seek a change in how you live?

And it always felt like they were demanding things. That the bankers were the ones who were being treated badly.

So I finally came across a few episodes on MEtv about a month ago, and I didn't take it so seriously. And that's when I noticed that there's quite of a bit of spicy innuendo for a tv show from the 60's. And I noticed that the Bank guy is a bit of a greedy jerk at times, who will subject his assistant to do demeaning things to keep the Clampetts happy. And there's quite a bit of slapstick that was pretty good for the time.

The movie made it more clear that Jed would have been perfectly fine never leaving the Ozarks, but he did it because he wanted to give his daughter a better life."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"It was mocking white southerners, but no one cared. 

Rednecks love redneck jokes. 

CBS cancelled it because it wanted to become a classy network. Its ratings were always high."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I still refer to the pool as the seamint pond.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Wasn't that long ago that they had the pilot and first shows on one of the far back cable channels.

Told my wife that new shows do not make you laugh as well as those did and they didn't rely on dirty innuendo, well maybe when Jed was talking about Elly Mae busting out of her blouses.

Also still enjoy the Honeymooners even though every one is a repeat."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Def watched this growing on tv land or something. also I love the movie adaptation from the 90s it's super silly
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,How lovely!
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Ouch.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I'm surprised you had TV in West Virginia based on the documentary this thread is about.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,They must have liked The Real McCoys also. They were from West Virginia.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"INteresting, did not know that"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Not scamming in the sense of stealing, just in keeping them comfortable in Beverly Hills so they'd keep their money in his bank. His secretary - Miss Jane - would sometimes reluctantly go along with his schemes, sometimes act as his conscience."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,That's the only version of the Beverly Hillbillies I've ever watched. I used to like it a lot when I was a kid but I don't dare rewatching it today.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,cement pond
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,I've seen all 39 of those original Honeymooners episodes at least a dozen times apiece! Greatest show ever.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"OTA are the way to go. Decades has The Honeymooners. There's also MeTV(M.A.S.H), Cozi(Colombo, Emergency), Antenna(SOAP) Comet (Dark Shadows OG)"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Cloris Leachman's Granny undergoing electroshock therapy absolutely killed me as a kid. And i still say ""happiness"" the way Lea Thompson does."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Shoes we don't have shoes.  We gots TV.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"MeTV just started running the Hillbillies at night, so they're in the early episodes. And it's on right before Green Acres."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Haha yes. also randomly today I was saying ""biig fancy car"" like jethro"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,MeTV is also showing Wild Wild West after Saturday morning cartoons now.  An hour of Popeye and Pink Panther followed by Tom and Jerry then Loony Tunes.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I just binged this last night, very fucked up situation. The 3 episodes really take the audience on an emotional rollercoaster.

The documentary itself was really well made & I liked the subtle electronic soundtrack.

Idk if I'd agree that Larry is brilliant, I think he is just an asshole with an inherent knack for manipulating people by browbeating them into submission after lovebombing them. He's like an abusive partner, but more sociopathic."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"It was a hard watch once it started to turn for the worst.

The fact that some of them weren't just intelligent but like top 1% intelligence is pretty insane.  Harvard and Columbia grad another Columbia grad. He turned their minds into mush.

Given his really unknown reason for having pretty legit political connections..not to mention his methodical brain washing and torture techniques..

Would not be surprised if he didn't at some point work at a CIA dark site or some shit.

Just find it hard to believe that he just
 naturally knew how to do that.. and that it would work. He obviously had done a job on his own daughter too. They didnt give much info on here so I done some research and yea.

The orchestration of it all.. getting so much money.. just reeks of some nefarious dark op in a third world country type shit


Also the fact he can't be analyzed. That is not natural."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Idk I think Isabella started changing her tune when she realized she was facing significant jail time. I don’t think she’s defending him as much these days. Her sentencing is on the 22nd. I think she plead guilty though, so she probably got a deal and will most likely get probation.

It was sad in the beginning when her and Felicia were both defending him really hard after he got arrested. You could see how broken and brainwashed they were."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,[deleted]
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Thank you for this recommendation!
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,College coeds fall under the spell of the old man from Metallica’s “Enter Sandman” video.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,just watched it. what the actual fuuuuuck?! these poor people!
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Man that Felicia chick went from being a doctor to becoming a fucking lunatic. Very sad
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Larry most definitely was a Cia employee and he was high up in republican party. Which is why I feel when he got out of prison he felt so betrayed he tried to create an army to take down Bernie. The government needs to look into this guy ties to top republican officials
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"My takeaway from Larry is he is a good listener. 
He spent a majority of his ""sessions"" Just letting these ""forgotten"" Poor kids just talk to him. 

Then he would identify their insecurities, and core issues, and manipulate it. He would then allow their irrational brain to make up (coerced)fantasies and blame. 

Followed by love bombing and then taking it all back and blaming the victim cycle."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Also believe that Bernie and Santos dad did know each other and Larry knew that. Back in the 80s Bish Sr. As head of cia and other Cia officials allowed cocaine into America for profit. Larry was likely a trained Cia intel officer and setup Santis dad to deal in new York under Bernies protection. Once he was arrested and Bernie failed to protect him he decided to to do all this as revenge. Betting even sending Talia to Santos to meet in first place. Classic Cia honey trap
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"He was also the most textbook perfect abusive partner to especially Felicia as well on top of it, when she explained their relationship in detail it really framed in my eyes how someone who was doing so incredibly well with her life ended up with all that. He was very all around an unreal sociopath"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"That hits the nail on the head I don't think I could have described this man any better. I was really wondering how these students allowed this to happen. Watching the documentary you would have thought that this man had their families held hostage the way they were so agreeable. I just don't understand how the students didn't report this girl and her father the moment he started sleeping in their living room, I would have kicked this fat prick out of my dorm the moment he wanted to stay."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"If you pay close attention, you'll see that out of the house of 7 students, he was only able to manipulate 3 - Isabella, Claudia, and Dan. (Santos was not a *clean* manipulation because of his desire to be connected to Talia.) So then we should focus on the shared characteristics of the people who fell under his spell. I'd argue that the ability to be manipulated has much more to do with a person's history of being forced to obey authority or give up agency. This is not an exceptional case - Larry is just an example of a person willing to use other people's weaknesses against them."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Only thing I thought was interesting in that scene after Larry has been a jail a bit, Isabella seemed more with it compared to Felicia, who honestly seemed like a dazed child. She didn't seem particularly out of it, just understandably worried her days of being Larry's little queen may have lead to a prison sentence."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I wonder if Isabella changed her tune and actually believes Larry is evil now, or is just putting on a show to get leniency."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Anyone think it's interesting that Felicia faced no charges? Do you think she participated in the crimes and was granted immunity for testifying? Or do you think she did not participate in the crimes? The documentary didn't make it clear - they only showed bad acts by Isabella.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,thats the part that threw me !! they had such conviction about homeboy...
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,This guy is way worse than any of those ppl.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Success lies in the hands of those who want it.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Yes! He def had ties to Giuliani and Trump (Larry was involved with Felix Sater and flew to Russia to deal with him). Sater was Donald Trump’s original conduit to Russia. Sooo much corruption.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,You sound like you're in Larryland
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Where did this info come from?  You can’t just say things like this without some sort of verification. Santo’s dad was a CIA  backed cocaine dealer? C’mon. I seriously doubt that Larry was ever a CIA agent, there’s no way he would have been able to keep that quiet. He’s such a narcissist that he would have told everyone how important and special he was."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Relevant questions that the documentary didn't answer: 

1) what did the Rosario father do for a living? 

2) did the Rosario family have any documented contact with Kerik? (Felicia said yes but documentary didn't investigate)"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"What about the idea that Felicia may have played a role of bamboozling the bamboozler??! I have a background in mental health and I know that anyone who has spent any time on a psychiatric ward has had their life threatened - IN PERSON - so the idea that Felicia, who completed multiple years of highly-competitive schooling and was in the 2nd (?) year of her residency psychologically broke in half and moved across the country after being threatened makes little sense to me. The speed of her brainwashing as well as how quickly she came out of it was also odd, as was the lack of evidence that she committed any crimes. Maybe the documentary just didn't show that footage, or maybe Felicia knew not to complete certain acts while under Larry's control? 

So yeah, Larry could've honeypotted Santos, but then Larry himself may have gotten honeypotted. Overestimated his abilities!

Sidenote: I found it super annoying that Felicia made claims about how easy it is to comprehensively manipulate a person's memory but provided no scientific or clinical evidence to back her claims. She is a highly educated professional so that was irresponsible of her and it was irresponsible of the documentary team to not fact-check her claims."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,He was her hunny bunny.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,This reminded me of the NXIVM Cult. I have no fucking clue how people can be so gullible. Lol.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"You are absolutely right. This documentary was particularly interesting to me because I am of the same nationality as the three siblings (Dominicans). A big part of our culture consists on abuse (including physical) and respecting authority unconditionally. You can look it up, but around the 50s 60s ish the Dominican Republic had a brutal dictatorship. The Rosarios parents seem about my parents age and my parents grew up during this dictatorship. It impacted the culture in a way that Dominicans look up to authoritative people. I see it in my family, very intelligent people mostly comprised of accountants, doctors, nurses and lawyers and they have most fallen prey to some form of abuse or scam."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"""Clean"" or not,.he was able to get Santos to defer any kind of critical thinking skills and to create a full dependence within just a few months. The relationship with the daughter was just an entry point just as much as depression or any other in thst Larry used."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"According to my experience, Isabella is an accurate representation of what a traumatized person who identifies with her abuser looks like. The damage is on the inside, psychologically, and it's difficult to observe. 

Felicia acted more like a caricature of a traumatized person. All of her trauma is apparent in her behavior, her tone of voice, etc., but that is not the usual clinical presentation."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,The scariest part to me was knowing that she was a doctor and had other humans under her care at some point. Yikes.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,fair point
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I’m not sure if it was a documentary on Hulu, or the one on Peacock about the same situation, but Felicia refused to take money from Claudia and didn’t wanna be a part of that even though she was aware that it was happening. Isabella, on the other hand was the bookkeeper. She would sometimes collect the money. She would also help launder the money, and she participated, or was at least present when Larry found out that Claudia was trying to escape his sex trafficking and tortured her. Larry and Isabella spent the night in Claudia’s hotel room while Claudio was strapped to a chair, repeatedly suffocated by having a plastic bag put over her head, beaten, dumped with cold water etc. in the audio clip, you can hear Isabella telling Claudia to stop being so dramatic and stop faking. During this night of torture, Larry and Isabella order food to be delivered to the room, sit down and eat, and then the torture begins again. It’s really sick and horrific and she definitely crossed the line into perpetrator. Felicia was not present for any of that."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"What makes you say that? Keith Raniere harmed dozens of more people. He just came off as ""gentler."""
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Read about Larry's background. You can definitely believe that there may be more to this story without siding in any way with Larry. He is absolutely a bad dude, but he had a lot of bad dude friends too."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,well played
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,my biggest question is about Talia - wtf happened to her? she just brought him into their lives and dipped out?? how did we not get any follow up info
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"1. The nymag article explains they owned a travel agency and grocery store. 
2. Felicia was brainwashed just like others to say Kerik was involved. There is no proof of that."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Did Felicia spend time in a psychiatric ward??
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Her giggling during that unnerved me greatly.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Ahhhhhh, makes sense!

Do you have any thoughts about Felicia saying that she met Kerik or that her family knew Kerik? Considering their family's history and that we don't know what the Rosario father did for a living, could that be true?"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Considering the suggestion that Felicia was completely under Larry's control and was sleeping in the same bed with him and Isabella, it seems strange to me that she would have the presence of mind to play no role in their primary method of making money? I also wonder how it could be possible that she wasn't involved in distributing drugs (e.g., adderall) to the group - including Claudia - considering her medical background?"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,He didnt use terrorist style torture tactics. Like pulling someone's tongue such pliers. Hitting them with hammers. All while force feeding adderall so they cant sleep for says until their minds turn to mush. I mean abuse is abuse sure.  Maybe it's because you actually see physical abuse in this documentary. The other group hid it a bit better.  All these manipulative bastards like to have cameras watching them tho. Scientologists keep theirs top secret. Kinda makes you wonder how bad it could get there.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Yeah, the left a lot out about Talia. For example, how did she and Isabella meet? Why did the documentary include a diagram that showed Talia sleeping in a bedroom with Isabella and her father? Was Talia involved in any encounters with Dan? I think the filmmakers said they didn't include info about her to protect her privacy - not sure why that same concern didn't apply to Claudia . . ."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"Did Felicia say she was brainwashed into saying Kerik was involved? Because she was willing to say that Larry manipulated her memory involving her dress, but I don't remember her stating that she believes that Larry planted her memories of Kerik."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"She was a psychiatry resident, I believe in her 2nd year. She should've been in psychiatric wards as well as other types of mental health facilities all the time. Since there was no indication that she was specializing in child psychiatry, then she would've been around adults with mental illness, which would've exposed her to all types of psychoses as well as personality disorders. A simple threat to one's life does not tend to shake anyone who has experience providing mental health care."
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"I don’t think it’s true. The Kerik thing was partly Larry’s obsession that Kerik was out to get him and also a reason to blame the parents. He needed to accuse the parents of something bad to keep the kids away from them and not trust them. 
I liked the documentary but I found it missing some information. The NYmag article explains: “They operated a small travel agency and a grocery store in Washington Heights and had saved enough to buy a home in the Bronx.”"
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,Oh course their parents didn’t know him.
Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,"To be honest, I am unsure about that part, however, I’ve been reading more on this case and Larry overinflated small facts such as being in the army (he was only in the army 3 weeks. My guess is that he got people to harass Felicia and make her believe that."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Love this show. Looking forward to finally watching the last episodes. The first two seasons were so great, with very solid writing and a hilarious cast. I know most people focus on the main girls, but the supporting cast of adults really makes this show stand out so much. Sister Michael leaves me in stitches every time she's on screen. I'd watch a whole series of just her."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,It's a great show and very funny and the last season gives you a little bit of everything. I enjoyed the show very much and will regularly revist it I'm sure. Besides the Orla dance along to start the final episode is too great not to watch over and over.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Sister Michael is my spirit animal
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Now, I know how daunting resit examinations can be, so if anyone is feeling anxious or worried, or even if you just want to chat, please, please, do not come crying to me. Let me see, what else?"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Shit, I forgot again. Why is it worth living?"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Jesus Christ, I think the show is funny but fuck off with that headline."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,That Chelsea Clinton ending was really embarrassing.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"first two season great, but terrible finale. i deleted it in my mind so i can remember it as a two seasons beauty."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I’m happy those middle aged women finally graduated high school.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"It was hard for me not to notice that a bunch of girls, almost 30 years old, trying to pull off playing teenagers."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,lol if you need a tv show to remind you why life is worth living you might just need to touch grass
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Did anyone else binge all of season 3 in two days? 😭 it was perfect.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"""I will not be going to Paris on account of I hate the French"""
Love Live! Sunshine!!,She's a boss! I went to Catholic School with a few nuns not too unlike her.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Because you get to watch Derry Girls.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Hahaha, so, I’m not the only one."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,It's the most deranged thing I've read in a while.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Lisa McGee, the writer, actually did send a letter to Chelsea when the Clinton's were visiting Derry in '95. ALthough Chelsea didn't write back, I thought it was a fitting way to end the show, making a random group of Derry outcast students relevant enough that the then President's daughter would take time out to wrote to them."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,It would have eorked do much better as a post-credits scene instead of the last scene of the show.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Completely agree. When I saw it was a flash to modern day, I really thought there was a shot at a tiny, 30-90 second update of their lives, as the credits rolled. That made me so disappointed."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Yes! It felt so...unauthentic? Empty? Like they took the first 2 seasons and tried to imitate it. Feels like they had a checklist of all the characters who had to appear and do their character-thing but failed to think about how to make it work.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I agree with you 100%
I think it became a huge cultural thing here in Ireland so they tried to tell a bigger story? Instead of just a funny comedy"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Your turn is soon, keep studying"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,So? I'd have preferred to see how their lives ended up.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"You are both getting downvoted but I completely agree. The third season was a massive step down in quality from the first two. It felt so lazy, just one gimmicky sitcom plot after the next, whereas the earlier seasons felt a lot more genuine. 

The humour was incredibly cringey and the characters lost all depth, just became walking catchphrases. Honestly reminded me of the humour from Mrs Brown's Boys at times.

The show was never high concept or anything but much of the final season was groan-inducing, and that finale was one of the worst I've seen in a long time."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"yeah thanks for explaining better than me, its been a while for me since finished it so dont remember much exactly. just the taste it left me with. it was bitter. i truly agree with how it lost its genuineness with final serie. how sad cause im gonna miss the cast."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Totally agree, just like Still Game it completely lost what made it great"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Wait….am I the only dummy paying for this…
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Now all these studios are starting to realize what a foolish move it was to start their own streaming services. Instead of, you know, just licensing their content to the big streamers like Netflix, HBO etc. and making easy money with zero overhead."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I worked in finance at NBC years ago & they were scared about what the impending streaming wars would look like. Life was good for these companies when consumers weren’t given a la carte selection of which channels they’d like to pay for & on-demand access to the entire back catalogue. 

The economics will likely never support this model of each channel having their own platform. They’ll spend too much on user acquisition, balloon their breakeven, & consolidate back to a joint model with several other platforms. We have maybe 5 more years of this."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,[deleted]
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Sony watching thinking ""good thing we failed streaming early on""."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"When it was still CBS All Access, I cancelled in-between seasons 1 and 2 of *Star Trek Discovery.* I continued to get the service until it became Paramount+, without paying another cent. I’m surprised people are still reporting this happening."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"""We don't have enough subscribers to cover our overhead, what should we do?! I know, we'll charge MORE for it! That'll have them ROLLING in!"" -Some over payed exec, probably."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Paramount+ was already overpriced for what it offers, the quality of the service is low and for many constantly has errors. 

.... and these chucklefucks still haven't fixed the subtitles. So much damn greed and poor management in entertainment."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Remember when studios just licensed their content to Netflix and everybody came out a winner?
What’s happening now is the same dumb shit as the record labels and iTunes. Every MBA thought they could slice off their own content and make more money. Look how that turned out."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"If they raise prises here in Switzerland, I'll cancel instantly. We're already paying 2/3 more than in neighboring Germany. I already cancelled Netflix this year after they'd raised prices for the third time within a year, while at the same time slashing the lineup"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I had paramount+ for a little while.  The content was just crap.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Streaming needs to take a lesson from Music-Streaming 

The reason every different record label does not have their own proprietary 'Spotify' subscription is simply because it's not in the consumer's best interest

We need more streaming platforms to COLLAPSE so that they can wise up and get their content added to a wider single-platform. Netflix (or YouTube) should have cancelled ALL in-house production and just spent the last few years aggressively buying out smaller streaming libraries in full 

This is nonsense. I do not want to subscribe to 5+ monthly services just get enough content not to be bored"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Thank goodness I asked for the one-year prepaid plan as a Christmas present.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Another streamer tripping over themselves to hand *all* of our entertainment to Amazon and Apple
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Lol if anything it needs a price decrease. They can't be bothered making their app widely available and won't offer the cheaper yearly subscription through the Amazon app. Now they want to charge more for something that is stupidly difficult to even obtain in the first place.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Nobody forced them to integrate Showtime, did they?"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"So if I get this straight: 

Paramount+ with Showtime will cost $12/month, as opposed to Showtime without ads currently being $15/month?

So $2/month increase for people who only wanted Paramount+ without ads, $3/month savings for ad-free Showtime fans, and $13/month savings for people who wanted both?"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Paramount+ and Peacock just need to merge already. They are worthless by themselves
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Honestly I basically used this purely as a Star Trek service but cancelled because it's too much for basically just Star Trek
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Have all these networks just had decades of mismanagement to be in this much trouble
Love Live! Sunshine!!,These services are writing their own obituaries with less value and higher prices. We just gave Netflix the boot and will punt HBO right after LoU wraps.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Shouldn't have cancelled the Workaholics movie then
Love Live! Sunshine!!,It’s kind of like not every network/studio needs their own streaming service. Hmmm
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"They cancelled the Workaholics movie.
I hope they fail completely."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I have 15 apps on my smart TV device and Paramount is always the worst. It was the worst when it was CBS and now it's the worst as Paramount. Across all TVs and devices. 

Fix your app. Advertise better. Develop a sci-fi genre original series."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,VPNs are most cost efficient these days.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Weird, I just got an email saying my price will decrease."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,The app is atrocious. Always freezes regardless of device I use or where I am. Completely unusable garbage for me. Maybe make a better platform before you charge more?
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Champions league is propping them up.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Got an email today saying my subscription is dropping to $11.99/mo from $14.99/mo with Showtime.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,So they are already tanking hard and their genius plan is to charge more? Got it.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I don't know if it's any different in the US but over in the UK paramount+ is a joke. They put up a load of ads around about the flatshare but it's literally just that, Yellowstone, South Park and Frasier that are the only things on there potentially worth watching. The only humour in the comedy central section is the fact there's only 5 shows available in it"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Wonder how this process increase will affect those of us, such as myself who have the Paramount+ w/ Showtime bundle all ad free at the discounted rate of $12.99 a month. 🤔"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Should’ve kept the workaholics movie
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Paramount+ looks like it wants to lose the Streaming Wars.
 
*watches their popsicle boat sink*"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,It seems so many of these streaming services are losing money. Seems like they’re learning their lesson that they should have just stuck to selling licensing. I’ll be happy to laugh in their face
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I tried Paramount+ in Canada. Intending to watch the Halo show. Except:

1) It only had Halo in 1080p SDR, not 4K HDR like torrent sites had.

2) There was no Star Trek at all on it, since Netflix and Crave have all the rights to Star Trek in Canada.

It was just a bunch of CBS shows targeted at retirees. I cancelled it."

Love Live! Sunshine!!,[deleted]
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I hate this shitty stream service.

Even if I have cable, I can’t watch NFL or CL games because I have to buy the service.

Meanwhile, I can watch sports on Fox or ABC without shelling out more for Fox Sports or ESPN."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,THATS WHAT THEY GET FOR SUCKING ALL THE STAR TREK IN AND THEN MAKING IT SUCK. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I have 15 apps on my smart TV device and Paramount is always the worst. It was the worst when it was CBS and now it's the worst as Paramount. Across all TVs and devices. 

Fix your app. Advertise better. Develop a sci-fi genre original series."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I might have kept my subscription but every time I tried to play it through my Xfinity cable,  it would glitch.   Constant error codes."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"whenever i log in, i get to see all the locks on the content that is showtime only."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,They deserve to be put to rest for what they did to Halo. It’s a sacrilege.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I went to watch a show last week and it was preventing me from watching that show because an ad was failing to  load. Then i remembered I was paying for this, and cancelled immediately."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I had this for like 5 months, mostly for their back catalogue of movies. I've found other services like MGM and Hollywood Suite are like $5 each and have a way better selection of retro movies compared to Paramount+"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I got an email that told me I was getting charged less per month now...
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Damn all these streaming services losing money… bringing ads in to make up revenue. Seems awfully familiar
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Good, maybe they'd realise they do/did not have enough content to warrant a standalone service"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"As a subscriber, I find plenty to watch.  I am surprised they went this long to raise rates."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I keep this around for stupid shows like Fire Country, that I can’t seem to quit, and for my folks who love NCIS."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I just bought a bunch of Star Trek box sets so I can cancel.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,My sub bundle with showtime seems to have gone down actually. I was paying 15 a month for it before and now they are saying it will be 11 so I am not sure what to believe.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,90% of their lineup you can watch for free.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I for one welcome the end of the streaming war and the return of Netflix as the only service in town.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I'm confused because I got an email today saying that my showtime/paramount plus bundle is decreasing from $14.99 to $11.99 (I signed up during a promo and already pay $12.99). Why bother dropping that price?
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"All of their apps run like shit, and they want to make people pay more?  Can't say im surprised sadly."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Noone wants your product, you should increase the price!"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I’ve been praying for its demise since they pulled Star Trek off of everything else. 

Dear Lord, please smite Peacock next?"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"Netflix, Paramount+ ... they are all falling one at a time. I miss the days when Netflix was the ""single"" portal for streaming. 😕"
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I think they need to stop handing out so many free month codes…
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Every streamer is raising their prices. NF trying to stop password sharing. What could go wrong?
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I bought a year during Black Friday and don't regret it. It's worth it for the price. There's a lot of good shows I like, but I don't know if I will keep it after the year is up."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Most are raising rates but so far not pulling what Netflix is doing
Love Live! Sunshine!!,[deleted]
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"The cable bundle works because everybody is subsidising everybody.

Now that people want a la carte well its going to cost a lot more for far, far less.

Suck it up its only going to get more expensive."
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I basically pay for it for Star Trek.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,I just subscribed so I can binge a few shows and then I cancel and then repeat elsewhere. there’s no reason to have multiple subscriptions really. for $10ish/month I have all of the services - just not at the same time.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Wow I’m still paying $5.99/month through Apple TV.
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Seriously? They have the worst selections of shows
Love Live! Sunshine!!,Man these fuckeds all need to realise the pie isn’t big enough for everyone to have a slice
Love Live! Sunshine!!,"I get it for free with Sky Movies in the UK so this doesn’t affect me.

All I want is the original Yo! MTV Raps show over here."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I know nothing about Gundam, but that title is metal as fuck."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Very happy about this, hopefully they'll pick up My Hero Academia next."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,What are the best Gundam series? I'm open to watching subs if that's all that's available.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"""I'M SCARED OF THOSE ORPHANS!"" - Jon Jafari"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Hot damn. Finally
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Directed by the Anohana director? Am I going to be crying uncontrollably while watching this one as well?
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Is this series any good? Old school gundam fan but I haven't been able to get into any of them since 00.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I haven't kept up with Toonami in a while (since Kill la Kill first started airing on it), but Gundam was always synonymous with the block for me, so this is some good news."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Good!!  Gundam is the only anime that I have ever watched and enjoyed.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,This was my first entry in the Gundam franchise and I loved it. Can't wait for it to come back in the fall.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"It's a standalone series so you can watch it without knowing anything about Gundam. It's a good series, very brutal."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,It IS metal as fuck. 
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Boku No Hero is going to be HUGE when it finally comes over here. The manga is great and I know the Anime is only like 6 episodes in but it's one of the best adaptions I've ever watched.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,">What are the best Gundam series?

Pretty loaded question, as Gundam has many, many ""universes"" and spin-offs.

However, /r/Gundam has a [couple guides in their FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gundam/wiki/index#wiki_new_to_gundam.3F_looking_to_watch_but_don.27t_know_where_to_start.3F)

However, almost every Gundam fan is going to tell you to start with the Univerisal Century timeline and the 1979 original series *Mobile Suit Gundam* (also known as Gundam 0079). It's old, its animation hasn't aged well, but it's *the* classic. The three compilation movies of the original series are also okay jumping on points, and they include slightly better animation - but, warning, some stuff is cut, some of it good, bad, or neutral."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I really liked Iron Blooded Orphans and 00. Thunderbolt is a visual masterpiece (and only 4 episodes)
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,check out /r/Gundam
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"well the original is arguably the best an most complete anime show of all time, so its kinda hard to top that. with that being said, there isn't one I didn't like."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"00 is a good starting point for newcomers I would say. 

It's one of the newer ones, good story, some of the better action and animation in the series. Good gateway series. 

Almost all of the gundam series are stand-alone."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I don't know the best, all I can tell you is avoid Seed and Seed Destiny like the fucking plague "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Gundam has been around for so long that there's a lot that people can point towards as worth watching, however for a more modern audience I would agree that 00 is probably the best to start with. But if you ever get into the series, 8th MS Team is my personal favorite. It's a short OVA, about 6/7 episodes long but it contains some of the best storytelling in Gundam. It's a show that it helps to have a bit of knowledge of the story to go along with though."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"UC timeline. Original series (currently being redone as an OVA series called Gundam the Origin), 08th MS Team, War in the Pocket, Stardust Memory, Zeta Gundam, Char's Counterattack, Unicorn.

Gundam Wing is pretty good, lots of people like SEED (mostly the first cour) but its pretty divisive, G Gundam is fun but very atypical for Gundam shows, IBO is good, Thunderbolt is good. Dive right in."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Hulu has IBO on right now I believe, subbed. "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,No idea what others will say Gundam Wing was my fav
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I am a personal fan of G Gundam
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Well, I don't want to spoil, but characters will die. "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Without spoiling anything, not really. It's mecha, they don't tend to go for tearjerkers. At least not in Gundam."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,As another longtime Gundam fan it's the first series that I've been satisfied with since 00. It is a bit unorthodox in its approach but I do welcome that in a franchise as long running as Gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Pretty alright series, great mecha designs, though the plot drags on a bit at times. "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,If you liked Gundam you might consider looking at some other mecha shows.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,[The hype train has no brakes] (http://i.imgur.com/8LdGu8e.jpg)
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"It's shonen as fuck, but so far it's shonen with perfect execution. In 6 episodes I'm completely invested in the main character and side characters and their relationships wth one another. Hell in 2 episodes I was 100 percent behind Deku. I can't think of another Shonen anime that's pulled that off in a very long time. Can't wait for more episodes. PLUS ULTRA"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,The first two episodes are already dubbed and viewable for Funimation subscribers.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Funi is dubbing it right now. 
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Really now? I loved 00 because it didn't require me to binge other series and it was pretty good as a stand alone. I watched the first episode of IBO and it was iffy, would you recommend continuing on? (I'm normally a HUGE fan of anime and manga, I've easily seen 150+ anime though I wish I had the patience to remember them and compile a MAL)"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Yeah, I think the original is something anyone can enjoy so long as they aren't flat out opposed to animation. It was a really well done legitimate war story with a lot of fully fleshed out characters. 0079 and Zeta are two of my favorite animes of all time. "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"> Seed 

I quite liked seed (though was my 2nd Gundam after Iron-blooded orphans, tried 00 and a few others before seed and couldn't get into them)."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Seed is still fun. Some of the episodes are really epic.

[spoiler](#s ""Like when Kira comes back and saves the day in Alaska"")"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"They're not re-doing anything with the Origin OVA, they're only covering the three volumes of the manga dealing with li'l Char, just as an FYI."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I'm of the opinion that, of the UC series, 08th MS Team is the best. It can stand on its own and the hero is just a normal guy, which is refreshing."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Gurren laggan would like a word
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Is that the Gravity Falls logo in Japanese in the bottom left corner?
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"For one it has a legitimately talented, take-no-shit pilot as one of the leads and not some angsty teen.  I mean it's seriously a breath of fresh air in Gundam world.

I really wanted to enjoy 00 - but you have to admit Setsuna & co were awful pilots considering the OP-ness of their gundams.  IBO is nothing like that.
"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"IBO is different from your average gundam in a lot of ways. I didn't binge it though, i watched it once a month while it was running in chunks of 4 episodes. I really recommend giving it at least 4 or 5 episodes. Also the ending theme song is one of the best. "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Oohhh ok. Maybe I was thinking of the manga version.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Gurren laggan was manly as fuck
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Yeah, that characters quirk is [zero gravity] (http://i.imgur.com/S2sGe6l.png) so i thought it would be pretty fitting."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I dunno. I think Mika's kind of a piece of shit, just in different ways. He's so... Edgy, for want of a better word. It's really hard to feel any sympathy or attachment to him when all he does is murder stuff. The first few episodes it was like... Him and Orga feel like they'd be shooting up a high school somewhere if they weren't in space."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I believe it's the one about the kids that were originally slaves and now they're fighting back against the ruling empire right? How the ""Gundam"" only reacted to this kid and how he led the fight right?"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Holy shit yes, Orphans No Namida."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Yea and I cried manly tears
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Ah, gotcha. That's actually kind of fitting, given what happens in ""Not What He Seems"". "
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I dunno if I'd call him edgy at all, more like he's cold-blooded.  I'm not saying he's the greatest example of humanity in the world, I just liked seeing that sort of character.

I can't think of any other Gundam pilot who'd have done what he did with Carta."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"What? If you've watched the whole season, [spoiler](#s ""you'd realize that Tekkadan has been on the **defense** the entire time. All his kills were done to protect his companions. He shot Crank because Crank had expressed his persistence even after he lost."")
"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I wouldn't say slaves exactly, they're child soldiers and they take up a  job protecting a girl who's trying to change the political climate. The Gundam isn't strictly his but the way they pilot in the IBO universe (some mobile suits phyiscally jack into the person and enhances the connection) means that he's really the only one who can pilot it in the circumstance.

I think it's a somewhat unorthodox Gundam series and opinions were somewhat mixed but the detractors seemed to focus more on it's non-Gundam aspects than it actually being a bad show. As someone who's been a longtime Gundam fan I found it to be a breath of fresh air after G-Reco and Age."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I don't mean he's edgy, per se, but he's definitely the writers being all ""Oh, we're so grim 'n' gritty.""

I don't think he's particularly interesting as a result because it's just one pointlessly grim thing after another and it loses all impact after a while because it's routine.

It's shocking when a character does something horrible after being normal because maybe they've been pushed too far, will they recover, et cetera, et cetera.

Nothing that happens in IBO is particularly shocking or surprising when the character's establishing character moment is shooting bound prisoners in the head."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Ahhh yea, the last series I thoroughly enjoyed were Unicorn and 00 when I went through a semi-binge. Ever since then, I haven't really liked anything, especially that toy one... but I'll check this out!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,The Toy one is actually great if you can get past the characters. It's a show where EVERY fight is last fight and everything can get absolutely thrashed. The fights are legitimately some of the best. But it's wrapped around with basically Yugioh and that can be a bit much to stomach.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Damn this takes me back. I remember CN would do other music videos with their shows/characters. I remember one with Atom Ant, another with Courage the Cowardly Dog...fun times"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Big-O was a fuckin banger
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,This is some solid nostalgia fuel
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Peter Cullen has that kinda voice that always gives you goosebumps
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Yeah.. I could use a Megadeus
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I remember downloading this on Kazaa. This and their other video “Mad Rhetoric”
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,The one downside of VoD is missing out on these vignettes.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I miss old TN and then adult swim / late night stuff till 4am…
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Man, Toonami was the absolute shit."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,It's tsunami megamix is pretty good with DJ Clark Nova
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"The voiceover is talking about a Terminator-style machine war, but most of the clips are showing mechs with human pilots. Even the bit from Dragonball Z has a human brain."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Fuck this is cool, I wish I'd grown up with Toonami"

Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,My favorite was the [Jabber Jaw](https://youtu.be/Vn1pf0Xi3nU) music video.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Wow I forgot all about those. Thanks for the memories!
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Still is! basically just ""if bruce wayne has a mech"" and also everyone in gotham has amnesia. i still rewatch it about once a year, so much style in that show"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Nothing makes you feel old like finding out Toonami turned 25.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Optimus Prime talking about machines/computers wiping out humanity as they grow self aware. 10/10
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Was that a site like Limewire?
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"**YES THIS IS IT!!!!**

Holy shit, thank you. I'm about to look for their old school bumps and just vibe out to nostalgia."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I remember a cartoon channel put together a bunch of clips of various cartoons set to Bare Naked Ladies “Falling For The First Time” and it always stuck with me.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,If you're interested the band that does this is called Pain and they make great ska music
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"[This is a great channel for that](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlimD716V2/videos), all of Toonami's finest remastered in stunning HD"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Well aware, but thank you! I'm sure Pain is the root of my love for ska as an adult."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"This show is a masterclass of raising stakes in a story.  Do not sleep on it, even if it is dated."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Man, first Babylon 5 is remastered on HBO Max,and now Mobile Suit Gundam is finally streaming.  Good week for sci-fi."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

After giving it a re-watch, be2i love the spin offs 08th MS team and sequel, Zeta Gundam. I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Recommended watching for seasoned mech fans if they haven't already seen it. 

It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

Also the robots r kewl."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,My body is ready for the Bright Slap.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"If you’ve never seen MSG and start with this, don’t worry if it’s not your cup of tea. The fun thing about it is there’s a Gundam for everyone. So you could try one of the other series. Want one that’s coo coo bananas? G Gundam baby! Small scale drama with a Romeo and Juliet bent? 08th MS Team (my personal favorite). There’s even ones that are beyblade with Gundam in Build Drivers. Possibilities are endless"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,[deleted]
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I just checked a week ago and was super disappointed. Checked it this morning and there it is! 

Man. Brings me back to the days of running to the living room, plugging in the code to turn the huge satellite dish, and then going downstairs to watch it with my glass of milk and Oreo pop tarts on my tiny tv."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I was really impressed when I watched this. They did an amazing job of actually making the enemy into human beings instead of just fist shaking villains. Plus, they actually had a setting in which they convinced me that using giant robots to fight made sense."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"I just wish we could get Zeta on streaming now, but I assume due to rights issues, pertaining to the opening, that won't happen."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"This show is awful, guys. Nobody watch it. Whole series is based on a lie.

The One Year War doesn’t even last one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,A story so good they told it again uh how many series are just a new take on MSG? 7 or so I think
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Can someone verify that this is what **Gundam origins** is the prequel too.  I confused myself reading up on it.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I wish I could bundle this service with other things. The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch but if it were a small add on to like Hulu this would be great.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,will hello kitty appear in the new time line?
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,I tried to get into this but couldn't :(
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Great news! I do, however, prefer the the theatrical movies, which do a good job at condensing the series and trimming out the unnecessary fat, not to mention they redid some scenes that looked kind of bad on the show. I'm just sad that we've yet to receive a proper remake of the original. The Origin OVA doesn't cover the whole Origin manga (which is an excellent remake of the original series, authored/illustrated by the original character designer). I'm also sad that we never got a 90s remake in the style of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRtFptEMF8). Damn it would've looked good!"

"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","To save everyone a click:

>But the worst part isn’t even in the actions of these horny fools. It’s a choice made by the show’s producers: Every contestant must share a bed with his or her sibling.

>Around a dozen queen-sized bed frames are packed into the love nest, meaning that players will have to cozy up with their sibling while their lover rests across the room. Should they sneak across the room to sandwich themselves between their romantic interest and his sister? Is it cool to wear lingerie to impress mates, even if you’re cuddling with your protective older brother?

>There is, thankfully, a slight catch. The beds are actually twin beds, and they’re separated from each other ever so slightly. One sits around six inches higher than the other. 

They have to do this because the basic premise (""your sibling helping you find someone to date or recommending that you date someone"") isn't really all that weird. If it was just that, the show probably wouldn't have been made since getting set up on blind dates by or getting dating advice from friends or relatives is pretty common. Being forced to sleep with your siblings, or going on a date with someone and realizing that if you want to hook up with them it will have to be with their sibling right next to you, is what elevates this to high art."
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","Wtf is going on with all these recent dating shows having terrible fucking premises? I already don’t watch any of them, but between this, that new one on Amazon about your astrological sign, and just the litany of others with some premise other than just “a couple dozen people vie for the ‘love’ of one bachelor(ette)”, it’s getting insane. Even worse is that I assume millions of people are watching these, as why else are they being made?"

"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","> what elevates this to high art.

I think you went too far there lol"
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","""High art"" being an extremely loose term in your vocabulary I take it lol. 

I'm not totally opposed to trash TV, even though I often wonder why I watch it, but I think the producers of this show and a few others need to realize the goal isn't to make everyone on the show unlikable. Yeah, you expect a few villians on the show or even several people that are annoying, but I'm ten minutes into the first episode of this one and I feel like even people I would normally find unoffensive are annoying. The people I would normally find unbearable, are somehow even worse than their normal selves or are letting us know too much of what is really going on inside their heads that makes them unbearable on another level.

I personally think they need to have people you want to root for, and you should introduce them before the worst people in the cast. Only ten minutes into this show and I'm not sure I can stand watching any longer."
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",Cheap to make and millions of people watch with them and engage online about them.
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",I'm actually surprised the astrology one hasn't happened sooner. It's so obvious for a reality show.
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","I work in development for reality dating shows - we even came up with an idea similar to this.

Every production company wants to have its Love Island basically. It's the dream to get a  shiny dating show on a streamer like Netflix or Prime. 

Weirdly, commissioners very rarely look for dating shows though - they want social experiments that are specifically not dating. The thing is coming up with social experiments that aren't dating is really tricky - so inevitably everything turns into a dating show. Dating just naturally leads to drama and high stakes."
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",I think they are just satirizing dating reality shows at this point and literally no one gets it
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",It's the bread and butter of trash tv. Single's Inferno is comparatively tame and wholesome but it still created a fuck ton of drama and even triggered a national issue in South Korea.

"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","Mtv has an entire genre of dating shows with terrible fucking precident, with a deep catalogue.  I've seen many and had lots of laughs, back when there wasn't so much choice to watch.😂"
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",I loved the show
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","Realty shows are cheap to make, require none or very little payment to the cast, can be as brainless and vapid as all hell (so no writers required), they can get ridiculous and stupid people willing to do anything to be on TV which makes for great 'so bad I can't look away' content, and then the muppets like us will talk about it online sending new viewers their way to find out what the shit show we're all discussing is!   
This show seemed to take a lot of cues from Love Island straight up using the same buzzwords (or the cast are big LI fans and just used them out of habit) but it was also like a mashup including Too Hot to Handle with the wildly annoying host trying to be loud and funny but failing miserably. Every time she made those fake phone calls it was like she may as well show her script on camera and honey you don't need to yell like that, the boom mic is right there!!"
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",I'm actually more inclined to watch reality tv with terrible premises than ones that try to take themselves too seriously.
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions","They've exhausted the normal concepts a long time ago, only wild shit remains. They have to be creative. 

Technically they're more creative than scripted TV greenlighting the 50th Marvel show or the 10th Star Wars spin-off you know."

They really have everything, they're basically cable as a whole and not just one channel. 

Ironically, a WBD/Netflix merger would be a good thing now, they're kind of the only service that can take both the HBO side and the Discovery side without it being too weird. Sadly, it probably can't happen because both have a lot of debt."

"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",The women aren‘t even that pretty. I expected shows like this to have model level attractiveness. Also cheerleader effect.
"Love, Chunibyo and Other Delusions",Because it's better looking on TV. I assume a lot of people really watch those shows to see hot people.
Hellsing Ultimate,"Yes but it’s not all about boobs and blood.

After Life is a perfect example. It’s a pretty bleak show. Largely about death, about suicide, about struggling with loss etc. Some censor has decided these themes are a bit on the tough side for a 15 year old. I couldn’t say if they are correct or not, but the few episodes I have seen of After Life suggest that it’s probably correct.

I do think violence should be rated more strongly - but it doesn’t always come down to the *amount* of content, but sometimes the intent of it, the emotional states driving it, or is it cartoonish or is it real? Some scenes just deliver a certain punch of shock that others don’t. But I think you will find that a lot of the rating is to do with the motivation or purpose of the violence, rather than the violence itself. It is those psychological aspects that make a more lasting impression sometimes.

That is definitely how sex is approached. It’s not about number-of-boobs per minute. Is there sexual violence? Coercion? Are women objectified? What is the emotional intent of the sex scene - is it just happy lovers, is sex being used to bargain, are people comfortable or uncomfortable. Is it vanilla or not? Is nudity with purpose or titillation? Natural or stylised? Foreground or background?

Etc etc. There are so many variables, but there are likely some pretty clear aspects of a character’s motivation or attitude that drive a higher rating. Censors would have lists of this stuff. There’s also things like drug use and language, (and language doesn’t even have to be swear words, but just particularly nasty attitudes) which can cause a higher rating even with minimal sex/violence."
Hellsing Ultimate,"Seems the same as TV-MA in the US. Castlevania is TV-MA here. It has strong language and extreme violence. That's just how the ratings system is. I think TV-MA is appropriate. It doesn't mean younger people can't still watch, it's just there to tell you what you're in for and for guidance for parents of children."
Hellsing Ultimate,https://www.classification.gov.au/classification-ratings/how-rating-decided
Hellsing Ultimate,"sexual violence, suicide and drugs push things up

gore is generally fine"
Hellsing Ultimate,"I get your point but we need an R18 so out video games dont get censored.  Also I feel too many stupid parents don't follow ratings anyway.  I'm going by how many kids I see being brought to R rated films then parents getting offended by the content Sex scene in Deadpool ringt in my memory.

What I saying if we didn't have a R rating in film and TV like we had for video games for years.  I wouldnt put it pass the Australian Nanny Government cencoring scenes and films and TV altogether."
Hellsing Ultimate,"It's a loosely numerical system assigned to the amount and severity of mature themes, including language, nudity, violence, illegal substances, etc. It's not entirely arbitrary, at least in the US, but there are definitely some flaws to any system"
Hellsing Ultimate,"It's weird how quickly they closed the chapter on the current plot, I felt like the creators expected the show to get cancelled so they provided some closure, but now they're renewed. Anyways, great news. Mr. Ellis, don't you dare to touch Sypha, she's the best."
Hellsing Ultimate,"To me castlevania is the best kind of game to tv adaptation; pays homage with slight headnods, whilst not being bound to its rules or conventions. It cherry picks the best parts; the tone, monster design, some spells and characters, and crafts it's own story.

Video games rarely have great writing, and although I've played quite a few of the castlevania games over my years, none of them stood out to me for their narrative. You don't need to have played the games, and even if you have, treat this as its own thing.

Those on the fence about watching castlevania on netflix; it's absolutely worth your time and stands well above its video game namesake. Season 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece, and I genuinely hope that others will give it a shot. "

EDIT: However, Season 3 having 10 episodes is a new detail. Very nice!"
Hellsing Ultimate,I thought they could've ended the series at 2 but fuck it. The show is amazing and I have faith they'll give us another quality season.
Hellsing Ultimate,"Good. I loved Castlevania. 

It should be a great example on how to actually write anime in the future as well. They almost all felt like actual people having conversations. Even Dracula and his forgemasters had real conversations here and there, behind closed doors when Dracula didn't have to posture for the other vampires.

It had a great subversion of expectations and there were a lot of scenes that made me say ""woah, that's fucking cool"" 

"
Hellsing Ultimate,Eventually we’ll work our way up to a 24 episode season right?
Hellsing Ultimate,Grant fans got left out. So will the next season be a direct sequel? An adaptation of Symphony of the Night? Or maybe a prequel that adapts one of the other games?
Hellsing Ultimate,"Fckin great series, Richard Armitage is a delight. "
Hellsing Ultimate,"Although it's not anime, this show reminds me of the anime OVAs and movies from the 90s- plenty of swearing, brutal violence and top-notch action. I've got those in my dvd/Blu-ray collection and I'll definitely add this if they drop it in physical form!"
Hellsing Ultimate,"I haven’t seen this show yet. Waiting to see if it’s actually connected to *Frasier* or if that’s just a rumour. David Hyde Pierce’s Niles *will* be in one of those castles, yes?"
Hellsing Ultimate,"Good to hear, I really enjoyed the show; more than I thought I would.

Some genuinely funny moments and a lot of great action scenes. Also loved how they portrayed and humanized Dracula."
Hellsing Ultimate,Absolutely it was; Season 2 was WONDERFUL. 
Hellsing Ultimate,If only the Berserk anime was this good 
Hellsing Ultimate,"The series moves too darn fast. They slowed down a bit in season 2 but it still does feel like a TV movie that's been chopped into episodes. I hope they extend the episode lengths past 20-25 minutes this season.

Love it, though, and I'm glad for more episodes!"
Hellsing Ultimate,"Season 2 started really slow but by the end I was happy with it, 3rd season is definitely going to be an interesting one. "

Hellsing Ultimate,Gibbe sakuga fights
Hellsing Ultimate,"I've never played a Castlevania game and I don't like anime, but something about this show seems really appealing to me. Would I enjoy it or am I delusional?"
Hellsing Ultimate,it should be renewed fprseason 5
Hellsing Ultimate,What there's a season 2?
Hellsing Ultimate,does that mean season 2 is out
Hellsing Ultimate,Is this worth watching? Honest feedback is appreciated 
Hellsing Ultimate,Happy to hear it! 
Hellsing Ultimate,The shows been a real surprise. It's one of the best shows on Netflix right now.
Hellsing Ultimate,Good
Hellsing Ultimate,"Makes sense, especially with how they ended it. Lots of loose ends to make another season with "
Hellsing Ultimate,On episode 4 now so far love it glad it's getting renewed.
Hellsing Ultimate,"i actually couldn't get past the first few episodes... the animation was lacking for some reason, just felt stiff. "
Hellsing Ultimate,"I dunno, I felt Season 2 was a bit flawed, it was fun but if you go back and actually watch it, the heroes were pretty lame. A majority of episodes were dedicated to them lounging in an underground basement looking for information, not exactly the most engaging path to take for a story like this.

  
I guess the moving castle being explained, was ok, but at the same time ti's kinda lame because it just served as a plot device to have the magician of the party do something. I would of preferred for of an adventure on the heroes side rather than destination A followed by forcing Destination B to them.

&#x200B;

Sometimes things don't need that level of explanation and using it as a means to have the Castle Travel was eh, it should of just been something tied to Dracula and nothing more."
Hellsing Ultimate,Is the show worth watching?
Hellsing Ultimate,One of the local art teachers here got an opportunity to work on Castlevania season two.  He jumped at the opportunity without thinking about it. What an amazing thing to have at your resume.
Hellsing Ultimate,Is this worth watching for someone who isn’t really a fan of anime?
Hellsing Ultimate,"[spoiler](#s ""I was really hoping for more Castlevania in a Castlevania series. Our heroes spent one episode in the castle itself. The rest of the season they were reading books. It was mostly a season about vampire politics and machinations. I wanted to see more exploration of Castlevania, avoiding traps, and fighting some more of the classic bosses. The only ones I noticed were the Cyclops, the Minotaur, and of course Dracula. On a technical level it was a great show, but for me as a fan it was lacking. "")"
Hellsing Ultimate,I'm excited for it. I love all the throwbacks to the various titles and Easter eggs.
Hellsing Ultimate,did season 2 even come out i been waiting since last year august
Hellsing Ultimate,Now to rewatch seasons 1 and 2 endlessly until season 3 comes out.
Hellsing Ultimate,"Was season 2 better or something? S1 was really lackluster. Not sure how people confuse this with anime, it looks really nothing like anime. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, though. The eyes kinda bother me but that's about it. "
Hellsing Ultimate,"Love the video games, is this show pretty good? I gotta check it out I guess."
Hellsing Ultimate,Yesssss 
Hellsing Ultimate,Is this worth a watch ? I'm been thinking about it 
Hellsing Ultimate,this is my favorite netflix show. the character design and animation are so cool
Hellsing Ultimate,"I didn’t know season 2 ever came out. The problem with Netflix green lighting every pitch, is that none of their content gets enough time in the spotlight. I didn’t know they had put a new season of daredevil until I heard that it was cancelled."
Hellsing Ultimate,I'm already sad enough at the end of season 2. 
Hellsing Ultimate,Yessssssss!!!!! Loved season 2!! Can't wait to see what season 3 has in store!!
Hellsing Ultimate,"This is a really good series. I’m already a fan of the games and was hesitant about the show. I really enjoyed the game references and especially the fight scenes in S2Ep.6. Also, in the same episode, the classic Castlevania tune. I’m eager to watch season 3 and see where they take us next. "
Hellsing Ultimate,"Dude, everything about this show was so good... admittedly I was high af and watch the whole 8 episodes in one night so I may be biased but holy shit that was game of thrones level good"
Hellsing Ultimate,This got a 3rd season? I didn’t play the game but man did S2 seem super lack luster until half way through.
Hellsing Ultimate,Since when was there a season 2?
Hellsing Ultimate,Wait... when did season 2 happen?
Hellsing Ultimate,"God damn I love this show. Never played a Castlevania game other than the 10 minutes I put into the SNES Classic version. I want to go back and play them because of this show! 

Question for Castlevania vets and Smash Bros fans: Is Trevor's Morning Star the same weapon as the one Simon and Ritcher are using in the upcoming game? "
Hellsing Ultimate,Can they please be more than 8 episodes and longer than 25 minutes?
Hellsing Ultimate,Good
Hellsing Ultimate,Probably because Satan fucking rules
Hellsing Ultimate,This show is totally amazing and I love the mood.
Hellsing Ultimate,u/kami232
Hellsing Ultimate,Isaac returns as the dark priest named Shaft
Hellsing Ultimate,"I fkn loved this season but I really wish those other vampire generals got to speak. They all looked so badass and would have been great to know more of the background. The producers probs couldn't be bothered hiring voice actors for minor characters that were gonna die anyway, but that is a shame."
Hellsing Ultimate,"Unpopular opinion: the show sucks. 

S1 was 4 episodes setting up the premise of the larger show. 

S2 was 6 episodes of lame power struggles within the Castle and 1 great action episode, and 1 episode to close it out. 

There's too much time spent on ""building"" the show and not enough time spent enjoying it. It's a cartoon, I want over-the-top violence and action. Not 3hrs of characters I just met being forced down my throat. I did that last season, let me enjoy what you set up!"
Hellsing Ultimate,"Did anyone else wish there were more/gorier fight scenes, seemed like a lot of exposition in season 2 compared to the amount of action."
Hellsing Ultimate,Watched season 1 and 2 back to last weekend. Episode 7 when the music starts. I knew shit was about to get real. When watching it I noticed this is basically a retelling of Castlevania 3 from 1990 on the NES. Excited to see what season 3 holds. 😁
Hellsing Ultimate,"Is the second season less ""Look at me, look at me, I know all the curse words!""?  Cause I fucking love some goddamn cursing, and I was still rolling my eyes at the dialogue in that first season.  It felt like the mid-nineties when someone realized that people considered anime ""adult"" and started just adding a bunch of cursing to all the anime movie dubs so that they could slap that ""Not for kids!"" logo on the case."
Hellsing Ultimate,"Eh. Season 1 was a bit iffy but I gave it a chance with 2 and honestly the story problems didn’t just not improve, they got worse. 

Still a decent show but really flawed story telling."
Hellsing Ultimate,Great news. :)
Hellsing Ultimate,That was quick! I'm glad though :)
Hellsing Ultimate,Awwww yeaaah boyeeeee
Hellsing Ultimate,Yaasssss sweet lord yaaassss ! 
Hellsing Ultimate,"This was actually revealed before Season 2 was out.

I'm excited though. Loved Episode 7 of season 2 and the entirety of season 1.

I had a feeling all 3 seasons would happen as I understand Warren Ellis wrote basically a trilogy (but made the first a standalone in case it didn't take off) for this project before it was to be adapted for television. "
Hellsing Ultimate,Nice!
Hellsing Ultimate,THANK YOU 
Hellsing Ultimate,Damn that was quick. I'm only halfway through S2.
Hellsing Ultimate,I watched season one and it was ok. Was season 2 better?
Hellsing Ultimate,Happy Halloween indeed.
Hellsing Ultimate,What wonderful night to have a curse.
Hellsing Ultimate,Maybe with such a good video game based anime we could possibly see other adaptations???? Metroid?????
Hellsing Ultimate,"**SPOILER**
Man I tell ya I thought it was over, and a crying Alucard being the last thing we saw made me sad ):, but I’m very happy they’re continuing it!"
Hellsing Ultimate,"Um this is kinda random, but how do I get a screen cap (I use Netflix on a firestick) of the waiting screen. I love the ombre red/black dress Carmilla wears in one of the screen. "
Hellsing Ultimate,I havent finished this season. Can't get into it like the first. The atmosphere just isn't the same.  :/
Hellsing Ultimate,"Their portrayal of Alucard, Trevor, Sypha, and Dracula were all fantastic!"
Hellsing Ultimate,i wish they would have let it be shown as whole set of 2 hour+ movies. i could tell that it was made as a movie and then broken up into episodes.  still a good show
Hellsing Ultimate,Just can't wait for season 2 to finish airing. Then will watch it all in one sitting!
Hellsing Ultimate,Keep bringing in original music!
Hellsing Ultimate,I would love to watch season 2 but every time I go to watch the first episode it just plays the first episode of season 1 instead. Cannot fix it.
Hellsing Ultimate,Is the series worth watching?
Hellsing Ultimate,WTF I thought this was still in planning stage.
Hellsing Ultimate,Such a badass show.  Those 8 new episodes fly by so fast.
Hellsing Ultimate,"I liked the show. It has its flaws, mostly because it still has some anime tropes like the brooding loner hero and the effeminate, also brooding, loner, hero. Though the fight scenes are great, the plot is well written, and it was so nice not to have to deal with subtitles and the over the top anime voice lines/acting that come with ports (ie. lots of wows when seeing food/boobs or random screaming/being angry like youre a douchebag perpetually stuck on a gym machine)."
Hellsing Ultimate,We got a season 2?
Hellsing Ultimate,I didn't even know Season 2 was out - nice.
Hellsing Ultimate,"I just found this series last night.. Awesome seeing it got a third season. I haven't finished it, but I'm going to tonight."
Hellsing Ultimate,"If I don't like anime should I watch this show?

I played a few of the games waaaaay back when but remember literally nothing about them "
Hellsing Ultimate,what glorious news!!
Hellsing Ultimate,What is a Netflix! But a series of renewals!
Hellsing Ultimate,"When are we getting more Knights of Sidonia or Ajin or another BLAME! Installment?  

I have been fucking LOVING these Netflix original series "
Blade and Soul,I know Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch did a great job with BR2049 but whoever does the music for this has a very high bar to aim for - Vangelis's music is amazing.
Blade and Soul,Hopefully the live action Blade Runner series is less like the trailer for the anime version
Blade and Soul,I want another Blade Runner video game tbh. The one made in 1997 was pure noir.
Blade and Soul,Culture is stuck
Blade and Soul,"After Prometheus and Alien Covenant, I'm not excited about this. Which is sad, because I love Aliens. Even read a lot of the books back in the day."
Blade and Soul,Deckard and Ripley were in *Working Girl* together
Blade and Soul,"Omg. Studios HAVE to start pursuing new, original properties, based on current visions of the future, the 80s nostalgia wave has already been dead for 4 years. The tank is empty guys, let it go."
Blade and Soul,"Not sure how I feel about this, hope they don’t balls it up."
Blade and Soul,"Call me a pessimist, but I'm pretty sure Ridleys just fucking up the franchise at this point."
Blade and Soul,holy shit can they stopp trying to milk dead cows and damaging masterpieces with this unneeded stuff?
Blade and Soul,The Blade Runner show would have to be on HBO right?
Blade and Soul,"Im okay with the blade runner universe as long as you expand it and not make it about blade runners hunting, make something new in this universe"
Blade and Soul,Every movie now remade for tv. Fucking shame.
Blade and Soul,Lol I just got done with the thread about him claiming millennials are the reason the last duel bombed and now it’s like he’s decided to pander to that audience
Blade and Soul,It's going to suck.  They're all going to suck.
Blade and Soul,"Jesus, please no...."
Blade and Soul,[deleted]
Blade and Soul,"No, please no. Those were one time hits that worked at their time. The nightmare versions Hollywood would produce now are too awful to consider."
Blade and Soul,FUCKING STOP WITH THIS SHIT
Blade and Soul,"WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?

Just let them rest in peace!"
Blade and Soul,Uuuuuuugggghhhhhhhh
Blade and Soul,Plz let it be the back story of Dave Bauptista's character in BR 2049. The guy is fantastic in everything he does and he could carry a series like a boss.
Blade and Soul,"What do they mean “live action?” Basically a tv series with actors instead of what, cartoons?”"
Blade and Soul,Just let Aliens die ffs.
Blade and Soul,Please don't involve Damon 'copout' Lindelof.
Blade and Soul,"Since I first saw the movies, I felt like they played better back to back.  Instead of being movies they were the first parts of a longer story. The fifteen minutes of set-up and exposition setting up the story arc."
Blade and Soul,"Can anyone remember the live action immersive kind of show they had in London in the early 90s? With the actors who were ‘plants’ and got killed by the alien?

You did the tour as a group but slowly some of the group were taken by the aliens."
Blade and Soul,"We know about Noah Hawley's Alien series already, presumably the Blade Runner show will be similar and tell a new story set within that world, rather than it being some kind of remake of the original film. 

I'm definitely into that idea, I think 2049 showed it's possible tell new Blade Runner stories and the short films that accompanied its release did that too. The original film is set in 2019, and clearly there's a history that leads to the events of that film that a TV show could explore, it could also be set between 2019 and 2049, or even be set further into the future too.

The funny thing about Blade Runner is that because the 1982 film wasn't a giant hit, it's a franchise that hasn't been run into the ground by endless sequels or spin offs like other great sci-fi movies. It's hard to get excited about a new Predator or Terminator film because there's been so many bad sequels, even Alien has had multiple sequels, prequels and spin-offs. But there are only two Blade Runner films, so I don't think people have had a chance to get bored of it, and there's a lot more room to be creative because you don't have to tell stories about one particular person or creature, so why not make a TV show and explore it more?"
Blade and Soul,EL-P from RTJ had a pretty dope unused track for the Blade Runner 2049. It would be dope to see him come back for this. (It was later used for the RTJ track on venom) [Here](https://youtu.be/zj43WElyPd8)
Blade and Soul,Would prefer another Blade Runner movie instead.
Blade and Soul,but why
Blade and Soul,Sigh
Blade and Soul,"I'm excited for both, but does anyone else get kinda sad about the fact that when these great, interesting franchises have a film that flops, they just immediately gets pushed to TV now?

Like Blade Runner 2049 is such a phenomenal theater experience. I can not see a TV version of that being as amazing as the film was

Like Altered Carbon was Netflixs attempt at that kinda Sci fi, and the establishing shots were all gorgeous. However, when it would cut to just characters talking in rooms, it looked like the most generic Netflix show ever. I'm worried that Blade Runner will fall down that same route. 

I have faith in Noab Hawley doing Alien though as a TV show (though I would've loved to see Ridley Scott's sequel to Covenant)"
Blade and Soul,"Calling it now, HBOmax. Scott already has a relationship there through Raised by Wolves, theybhave the capital and they are looking for major IP to full the GOT gap."
Blade and Soul,"I have low expectations from the alien tv show, feels like a complete bait and switch that will focus on the social political instead of the alien part.  Which I think most people want to see aliens attacking humans, but maybe that is just me.  

Blade Runner, I have no opinion on until we get more info, I just hope it follows the movies and does not follow the upcoming anime which looks pretty bad."
Blade and Soul,I really wish Ridley Scott would leave his good properties the fuck alone.
Blade and Soul,Holy shit this sub is full of whiny little bitches that hate tv
Blade and Soul,"And let’s hope Ridley is kept far, far away from these projects. He is no longer the visionary he once was and has become floated by his own success"
Blade and Soul,"I probably don’t want it getting made, but a Blade Runner series is feasible. Alien?Not so much. Well, I guess it depends, if they’re doing it Alien or Aliens. Atmospheric horror doesn’t really work on the small screen in episodic bites."
Blade and Soul,"Oh boy...

Blade Runner 2049 (Villeneuve) and the director cut (Scott) are one of my absolute favourite sci-fi movies.

Criminally underrated in box-office but not in home media sales I believe (VOD, amazon..).

So, very happy about that, I think the Blade Runner lore can really work around a live-action serie."
Blade and Soul,"More fresh ideas! Let's get another Bewitched reboot going! Say, has anyone made an Eight is Enough movie yet? What the hell are we sleeping on?!?"
Blade and Soul,/yawn
Blade and Soul,Fuck yeah!
Blade and Soul,Go away Ridley.
Blade and Soul,Facehuggers!
Blade and Soul,Please don’t let him ruin it.
Blade and Soul,Please let anything die
Blade and Soul,Jesus can we not write new shit!?
Blade and Soul,"Okay an alien series could work, if it’s on a populated planet where the xenos won’t just tear through the population in a couple of days. 

But why do we need a blade runner series? I love the original film but I really wasn’t left wanting more any of the times I watched it."
Blade and Soul,"FFS these stories have been *told*, can we not have something new for a change, in my sidebar I see an ad for Wheel Of Time, an overwrought overlong two-author series of tomes rivalling Mission Earth in length if not in style and I read them THIRTY YEARS AGO.

Even the shade of PKD must be bemused at the constant interest in remaking one of his short stories *but remade as a love story ugh*"
Blade and Soul,Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Blade and Soul,"Wow, how original."
Blade and Soul,"how bout come up with something original, fuck me"
Blade and Soul,Noooo… blade runner probably will be filled with wokeism and Alien with some pink haired geminaZi pseudo strong women shit
Blade and Soul,LOL just in case you didn't think that Hollywood had completely run out of ideas...
Blade and Soul,Oh cool so either they’ll destroy something I love or add a little bit to it when it was fine as is. Fun. I love when they do this instead of coming up with new stories and ideas.
Blade and Soul,But..*why*?
Blade and Soul,"Nice.

TV series > movies"
Blade and Soul,"I mean sure blade runner would be fun.Interesting set up universe there.

Alien is a bit overdone at this point.More raised by wolves and similar ideas instead would be my preferences.

So Noah Hawley is a doing an earth set alien show for disney/fx and possibly another alien shows now on the way...actually wait it seems hes talking about the same show nvm. Dunno why to think of the show tbh.It has potential. But Hawley did go off track with Legion and his movie debut so im not getting too hyped yet"
Blade and Soul,"i truly hope ridley scott decides not to incorporate the religion vs atheism theme in these, which he seems to be doing in his works for the past 10 years"
Blade and Soul,Ridley Scott needs to leave his shit alone
Blade and Soul,Are there no new stories we could tell???
Blade and Soul,Please don't let Scott have anything to do with either of them.
Blade and Soul,"Oh god. Neither of these franchises will benefit from a monster of the week approach, and if they can't put together a solid plot for any of the recent feature films, how the hell are they going to make something compelling in serial format?"
Blade and Soul,Cmon please just leave my two favorite movies alone.
Blade and Soul,Didn’t he bitch about marvel not having original ideas like a week ago
Blade and Soul,Kind of disappointing that Scott will be anywhere near them
Blade and Soul,Ffs. Just give Blade Runner to Denis and leave Alien alone...Prometheus was so bad.
Blade and Soul,"The *Alien* show needs to make sure there are a lot of politics around corporate greed and corruption, which is the parable of the movie.

*Blade Runner* should teach the value of diversity and life and the triumph of love, which is the parable of the movie.

If they stay true to these while making sure there is plenty of action they will be good."
Blade and Soul,oh god
Blade and Soul,No thank you.
Blade and Soul,"It's not like the Alien franchise can get much worse now, so that part I'm fine with."
Blade and Soul,"Re-watched both those movies recently, two of the best scifi flicks ever.  Saw the original Blade Runner in the theater when it first came out, was quite impressed, too bad it didn't do better."
Blade and Soul,I am always eager for more cyberpunk themed shows. Maybe one day a Shadowrun show can happen.
Blade and Soul,Why are we using the term “live-action”? They’ve always been live action. Must be the new Google buzzwords or something
Blade and Soul,Flying snake in both shows.
Blade and Soul,"If the writer of the live action bladerunner is  alex de campi then im out, her writing good, almost great but shes rather shitty of a person"
Blade and Soul,Chris evans as Rick deckard in his 40’s
Blade and Soul,Ugh no more remakes please
Blade and Soul,Let’s goooooo
Blade and Soul,No don’t do it
Blade and Soul,"Hate to be a downer but how often can you tell the story of ‘what does it mean to be human, surprise the android is more human than the humans’."
Blade and Soul,Hire Blomkamp to direct and produce Alien tv series.
Blade and Soul,"I just want an replicant, AI, replicant threesome again"
Blade and Soul,"Anyone remember Almost Human? With Karl Urban? That was basically the Blade Runner TV show, and it was pretty great. Sadly, Fox pulled a Firefly and canceled it after one season, but I really liked it"
Blade and Soul,I’m just so tired
Blade and Soul,Doesn’t Blade Runner and Alien exist in the same universe? That’s been confirmed right?
Blade and Soul,"I just want more of the pilot in aliens. Coolest minor character ever. 3, 2, 1, drop"
Blade and Soul,"i really don’t want a BR tv show but i guess it depends who picks it up. apple seems to be a pretty good home, or hbo."
Blade and Soul,"Not too thrilled about the Blade Runner show, 2049 is my favorite film but I don’t want to see it milked, 2049 worked because it had something more to say and explore. If it’s just to “expand the Blade Runner Universe”, I have no interest in the show."
Blade and Soul,Alien is already kaput.
Blade and Soul,"Sorry but the last two films in the series were far inferior to what was not only expected, AND promised - but you think TV will save you?! Ha! If and only IF It’s In the same vein as HBO series with action violence and adult language - - - it will fail."
Blade and Soul,Please don’t
Blade and Soul,Does anyone even want this???
Blade and Soul,Do not want
Blade and Soul,I thought the Total Recall 2070 TV series was done pretty well and still holds up. It’s worth checking out if you can find it.
Blade and Soul,Ugh I really hope they do both these series justice.
Blade and Soul,I wonder when he’s going to option Thelma and Louise as a TV show.
Blade and Soul,Why write live action?
Blade and Soul,Hoping for Michael Fassbender to return for the Alien series. Him finding his way to earth or another human colony with his alien babies would make for a fresh story.
CLANNAD,"Used to love this as a kid, the music by Clannad worked so well. It was never the same when they replaced Michael Praed’s Robin with Jason Connery though. Praed wanted to quit so a replacement was needed but they chose poorly."
CLANNAD,"I first saw this series around 1989-1990, I think it aired on USA PBS stations. IMO it was and is easily the best ""Robin Hood"" adaptation on the large or small screens. Took the slightest dip when Sean Connery's son replaced the original Robin Hood actor, but just the slightest."
CLANNAD,"They did an audiobook story extension a few years back with many of the original cast members involved. I was lucky enough to have been asked to contribute some lines as background characters. Check it out if you’re looking for a fix, appreciate its not TV but it’s another story at least. 

https://www.thedreamcage.com/2015/09/audio-robin-of-sherwood-knights-of.html?m=1"
CLANNAD,"The Brother Cadfael series is a fairly close match to your wish, but with a bit less swords and horses."
CLANNAD,"This show was a little before my time. But I watched it years later due to having some interest in the stories. It seemed to take a lot of inspiration from the 1981 film Excalibur. Especially when it got into the mystical stuff.

Spoilers in case anyone cares for a show this old. The second Robin Hood was actually Sean Connery's son.  I also heard there was another Robin Hood show in the 2000s, but never saw it."
CLANNAD,"It was a part of my childhood as well, which is exactly why I hope it never gets remade/rebooted. I would like a new show with a similar vibe, just not another Robin."
CLANNAD,"Wow, a reboot of a classic show I remember from my childhood. What a brilliant idea.
I can’t see how this could possibly be ruined by modern TV or streaming companies. In fact based on all the amazing ideas brought up just in this thread I think it will be the greatest show ever made. 

Now I must go and get this gaping head wound checked."
CLANNAD,"Maybe it's the fog of age, but I recall the great soundtrack.  Together, we."
CLANNAD,"Haven't rewatched it recently, but as a kid I absolutely loved the BBC Robin Hood series featuring Jonas Armstrong"
CLANNAD,"it's time for a great reboot where Maid Marian becomes the new Robin Hood, but better"
CLANNAD,"You are absolutely right regarding Clannad, btw. Im fact, I'd even say that the songs and sound sequences they produced for the show were absolutely defining. I'd be hard pressed to think of another show whose music was so much part of its identity. For me, the Normans-theme alone (""Strange Land"") is similarly iconic as the Imperial March or the Terminator theme."
CLANNAD,"True, Connery was a bad replacement. The show, however, maybe even became better, all in all, in season 3. Good scripts, better action scenes and slightly higher production values. A shame they couldn't continue with Praed, they probably would have gotten an additional season with him.

Just started rewatching after 10 years, maybe I'll try my hand at writing the reboot I wish for for myself 😄"
CLANNAD,"Yes, I watched it on Oregon Public Broadcasting back in high school, probably 87 -88 I think.  

Great atmosphere and vibe."
CLANNAD,"Thanks, I'll check it out. 👍

But still, I say the world is ripe for a *good* new incarnation of Robin Hood.
In my childhood and youth, Robin was always around and a significant influence, in three different versions. In Kindergarten, I loved the Disney film. In primary school, it was Robin of Sherwood (nothing ever came close!), and in high school, the Kostner movie was a cultural event.

And today? Flop after flop. The film with Russell Crowe was pretty forgettable, and the one with Taron Egerton a major bomb. For 30 years, kids have grown up without a proper Robin Hood of their own... time for Herne and the Hooded Man to liberate them. :)"
CLANNAD,"The Robin Hood in the 2000s struggled a bit during the first season as they were trying to retell the classic stories. One they started to branch out from those stories, it really founds its feet. I highly recommend it. 

If you're in the UK, it's currently on iplayer"
CLANNAD,"But the look was much more dark, real and dirty than Excalibur. I wasn't happy with the extreme, chromy shininess and colourful light of that film, so I only watched it once. Didn't really connect with the story eiher.

Fun fact: Robert Addie, who plays Guy of Gisbourne in RoS, also plays Mordred in Excalibur."
CLANNAD,"I understand your concern. 
However, I think a new Robin series- if done well - would have so much potential, and not take anything away from the original.

A reboot would allow for more character-centered episodes and add longer-term storylines to the crisis of the week model of RoS. The seven swords of Wayland, for example, could be explored much further, as does the Herne mythos."
CLANNAD,"Don't want to further alarm you, but have your doctor check your irony gland, while he's at it. Looks like it might be hyperactive, from the outside.

Amazing ideas such as?"
CLANNAD,"No fog there, it was great indeed. ""Together we"" was one of the tracks used as a theme for the light-hearted moments with the gang in the forest or friendly scenes in the villages."
CLANNAD,I'll check it out.
CLANNAD,"I hope that trend will have run its course by then. 😏
But I was indeed also thinking about the possibility of adding more female characters. 
Always difficult, in a medieval setting. Changing olde England into an equal opportunity feminist utopia would ruin the atmosphere.
But then again, in hindsight, adding Marion to the core group was already very progressive by the showrunners, at least for the times. And the satanic nuns from season 2 made for great villains.

I'd probably give the Sheriff and Abbot Hugo a sinister sister who dabbles in dark magic and court intrigue.

A ruthless female cutthroat might be a believable addition to the Sherwood crew. Maybe a love interest for Will Scarlet.

On the celtic mysticism side, a druidic priestess might serve as an interesting counterpart to Herne, maybe adding a second, conflicting side to the more spiritual episodes."
CLANNAD,"For those who are too young to have this mystical masterpiece in their vaults

https://youtu.be/WorgQGCFeLM"
CLANNAD,"I think it's because the proper modern Robinhood is a series that's about the Crusades, where Robin is a subplot, kind of like a Game of Thrones thing."
CLANNAD,"Excalibur was slightly hammy, but great fun imo. In the words of Merlin 

"" A dream to some. 

A NIGHTMARE TO OTHERS !!!"""
CLANNAD,"The swords were frustrating for me as well, I was hoping to learn the whole story. I would watch a show developing the mystic aspect of RoS for sure."
CLANNAD,Thanks! I remember one used as a tension builder before and during battle. Tried to find it on YouTube but was unsuccessful. These were memories from when I was a child so I don't have much context to search.
CLANNAD,"You think everything needs to be ultra-epic and on a global scale? Hmm. Maybe politically, with lots if scenes showing the corrupt politics at court, beyond Nottingham. But actually showing the crusades would be too wide a focus, and too expensive."
CLANNAD,"You'll find all songs on the album ""Legend"" by Clannad."
CLANNAD,"I actually think the problem is that a modern Robinhood TV series has too *little* going on. 

It would make a great mini-series, but it would either get too soapy or too samey or jump the shark after 1.5 full seasons.

But it a broader period series, the Robinhood focused-episodes would be the most anticipated ones of the season."
CLANNAD,"Interesting point. I'm just rewatching RoS and I guess I see what you mean. However, I think the concept could still work if it was heavily expanded in the right directions. The Carpenter series took a lot of liberties itself, and these additions were among what I liked best about the show. Robin being the agent of a pagan god. Seven magic swords. A Saracen dual-wielder. Pightish barbarian shamans.

You could add much more in a similar vein to the mix, turning Sherwood Forest even more into a bit of a pagan fantasy world and merging Arthurian aspects into the Robin character."
CLANNAD,"Fucking amazing show. Season 1 was good and Season 2 - After Story had my attention waning... until halfway through, it became one of the best TV shows of all time."
CLANNAD,"My probably with Clannad is the characters are not given any sense of believability. The daughter for example is not treated as a character she's a carciture of a perfect child. She's a pure, innocent, morally perfect character with no hints of being mischievous or child like at all. She's basically an angel descend from heaven so I can't take her scenes seriously there's no effort to actually make her feel like a character. So scenes like this or when she dies don't carry any emotional weight I don't find them sad like many anime fans do. I'm a big anime fan but personally I can't stand shows like Clannad they are way too simplistic and emotionally manipulative to actually be consider good drama."
CLANNAD,I know right season 2 was insanely good.
CLANNAD,"Kyoani is the gold standard in the anime industry when it comes to how they treat and pay their employees, which makes this all the more baffling and horrible. 

Why would you attack *them*?"
CLANNAD,"There's a thread over on r/anime with more details. [This is currently the top post with a detailed timeline as things were happening.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/cemj4w/kyoto_animation_studio_kyoani_had_a_fire_break/eu3kibv/) I'll summarize the main points here: The suspect is a 41 year old male. There are reports this guy poured gasoline on employees, not just the building. He allegedly had knifes as well and was standing outside the building as people fled.(It's unclear if this was just his plan or if he was actually able to hurt anyone as he is said to have injuries from the fire as well.)  After being taken into custody he supposedy said something about KyoAni ""ripping him off"" and ""I was robbed"".

It's still unclear who from the studio has been confirmed as safe as there is a lot of second hand confirmations being thrown around. The building had an on-site nursery for children of employees. There is no word if any of the victims were children.

In addition to what the article mentions, Kyoto Animation is also the studio behind anime such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, Sound! Euphorium, Nichijou, Hyouka, Free, Lucky Star, and others i'm sure i'm forgetting.

EDIT: Since I have top post here and not everyone seeing this will be a regular on r/anime I briefly summed up what information there is about the attack in the paragraph above.

[Latest death toll is 25.](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20190718/k10011997921000.html)

[Here's the link to GoFundMe page.](https://www.gofundme.com/help-kyoani-heal)

EDIT2: [Number of dead seems to have gone up to 33.](https://twitter.com/ultimatemegax/status/1151830902126891009)"
CLANNAD,"Supposedly 10 dead, with up to 20 missing, on top of the 38 injured. There were around 70 people in the building at the time of the attack.

Edit: 12 dead as reported by the AP, 18 missing, although some may not have come to work

Edit: At least 23 presumed dead"
CLANNAD,"What a horrific story, burning people alive is fucking sick."
CLANNAD,There are too many sick fucks in this world.
CLANNAD,What a senseless and tragic loss of life. *K-On!* and *Haruhi* were two of the shows that really got me interested in anime during my formative years. It's an absolute gut punch to hear about this.
CLANNAD,"Sentai Film is making a gofundme for Kotyo Animation. Please help out because nobody deserves this.

CLANNAD,I hope he is still alive so he can go to prison

CLANNAD,Is this an explosion or an arson attack?
CLANNAD,"33 dead and barely a peep on the news..   Christchurch shooting, all across the networks..  Are Japanese not worth the airwaves?"
CLANNAD,"This makes me wonder how good their fire emergency preparedness was. If the fire was detected quickly, the fire alarms and sprinklers were activated and evacuations were started there shouldn’t have been so many deaths."
CLANNAD,Just saw this on Twitter :(
CLANNAD,"This is horrible, 23 presumed dead. R.I.P"
CLANNAD,Anyone knows what anime comes out from kyoto animation studio?
CLANNAD,"im curious what exactly happened. he didnt have a gun, he just set the building on fire? arent there fire drills to evacuate etc.? seems like the amount of deaths is extremely high. did no one try to take him down as well etc. so sad"
CLANNAD,[deleted]
CLANNAD,[deleted]
CLANNAD,will this effect the production of Dragon Ball Super season 2???

CLANNAD,The attacker apparently claimed that Kyoani ripped him off/plagiarized him/stole his idea.
CLANNAD,"They also make some of the most wholesome, cute, fluffy and inoffensive shows. So any ideological motivation too doesn't make any sense."
CLANNAD,"I'm not familiar with this studio that much, how exactly is it different from other studios in how it treats its workers? I know that the Anime industry can be horribly exploitative, but I'm now curious what Kyoani does differently."
CLANNAD,"Holy shit yes, they're a very progressive animation studio. I really don't get why they have to be the ones to get attacked like this.. Such sad news."
CLANNAD,"You know there's a huge problem in the industry when ""disgruntled overworked animator"" is the first thing everyone thought about when news of the fire broke."
CLANNAD,Fuck! Jesus fucking Christ...
CLANNAD,Now 33 dead :(
CLANNAD,Unfortunately duds come with the fact of 7.7 billion people sharing the same rock.
CLANNAD,"He is still alive. However, considering this is one of the worst mass murders in Japan since WWII, he'll likely face the death penalty. Japan still has legal public hangings."
CLANNAD,Life on death row in Japan makes the US equivalent look like a cake walk.
CLANNAD,Arson
CLANNAD,Arson :(
CLANNAD,"I first heard it was an explosion, but now it seems people have agreed on arson."
CLANNAD,I heard the story on NPR this morning fwiw.
CLANNAD,[deleted]
CLANNAD,"Probably because it's not part of a larger story. There is no racial/ethnical tensions regarding anime studios at the moment.  
  
Neither does it go under ""attack on free society"" since the perp seemingly was motivated by a perceived personal injustice.    
  
Maybe it could have been a bigger story if it had been framed in ""social upheaval against corporations"", but a single anime studio doesn't really sell the ""attack against the multinationals""  
  
I'm not saying that this is good or correct, I'm just explaining why I think ""it's not a bigger story"". 
As for ""are Japanese people not news worthy?"", just ask yourself, how many mass killings in Mali this year do you know of?"
CLANNAD,Saw this story on the CBC news homepage this morning.
CLANNAD,[deleted]
CLANNAD,It was on Good Morning America (ABC) right at the start of the show with pretty extensive coverage.
CLANNAD,"It was front-page news on the Washington Post, New York Times, ABC, NBC, BBC and CNN."
CLANNAD,"If it wasn't with a gun, it's not exciting for the viewers"
CLANNAD,"Lives don't matter to the media unless they're ended by guns held by white men. 

The truth is that mass casualty knife, arson, vehicle, etc attacks are common all over the world, but are very underreported by the media because they don't have the same ad and eyeball value as stories that activate anti-gun bias. They also don't like running these stories because they point out that even in the most restrictive countries, a lone dude can still kill dozens of people without needing a gun. ""We'll make sure you're defenseless against every other form of violence"" is a tougher sell than ""let us take your guns and you'll be safe""."
CLANNAD,[deleted]
CLANNAD,Because it doesn't involve Muslims.
CLANNAD,"Though I’m sure it’s a conversation that will be had, I don’t know how much fire alarms and sprinklers help when people have been doused in petrol, among with the entrance and exits... everything. Someone else will say, where’s the security etc, we can blame other things, and maybe it’s a valid point, but really the focus conversation should be people need to stop being monsters."
CLANNAD,"off-hand list: Clannad, Air, The melancholy of haruhi suzumiya, Lucky Star, Free, Miss Kobayahi's Dragon Maid, Violet Evergarden, Hyouka."
CLANNAD,"Kobayashis Dragon Maid (director is missing), K-On, Clannad, Violet Evergarden, Nichijou, etc."
CLANNAD,"On top of /u/Khaix's list, K-On and A Silent Voice are two major ones as well."
CLANNAD,Only moe shit
CLANNAD,"He started a fire and was brandishing a knife, dousing people, entrances and exits, everything in petrol. 

I think he burnt himself in the process, but I do know that he waited outside with knives to stop people from escaping, but here he was taken down. 

I’m sure there will be many conversations about the design of the building and fire precautionary measures to be had, I don’t know if that’s information available yet, but it sounds like this guy didn’t make it easy."
CLANNAD,"You don't need a gun to kill large numbers of people. A few arson attacks have [killed more people than the worst mass shooting attacks](https://www.ranker.com/list/worst-arson-attacks-in-history/eric-vega). If anything, the potential for deaths is higher in an arson situation if steps are taken to prevent escape, which looks to be what might have happened here. 

A fire can kill everyone in a building. A shooter has to actually have line of sight to kill you. You can't rush a fire, and the police can't shoot it."
CLANNAD,This was before the deaths were confirmed last night.
CLANNAD,Wow seriously dude? Go fuck yourself.
CLANNAD,I understand the analogy you're trying to draw but this isn't the time to push any kind of agenda.
CLANNAD,"That's Toei, not KyoAni. Second, that's an insensitive question to ask right now."
CLANNAD,"Police have confirmed this guy has zero affiliation with the studio (has never worked there, etc). Kyoani is also really good to their employees."
CLANNAD,Hmm yes that is certainly an understandable and valid reason to FUCKING KILL AND BURN PEOPLE
CLANNAD,That's interesting given the studio seems to focus solely on adaptations of printed works rather than original series.
CLANNAD,"Not even necessarily his idea, the reports just have him raving mad about them being plagiarist.

I literally think he is just some mentally unstable fan that thinks they ripped-off another anime.   
Mental illness is not something that should just be left alone...."
CLANNAD,"The guy who killed dimebag darrell thought pantera was stealing his lyrics and rhat the band members were gonna steal his identity. 


After they had already broken up. 



Some people unhinge really hard."
CLANNAD,Can you link the source to where you got that information.
CLANNAD,"They've basically become as self-sufficient as possible, to the point where they have very little outsourcing. 

Their staff is salaried (instead of being paid per cel/drawing and made up of freelancers), they finish most of their shows before airing (which as baffling as it sounds, is unheard of in the industry - they typically have a buffer of 3-4 episodes that shrinks and forces insane levels of overtime as the season wears on), they have a dedicated school taught by their top creators, childcare facilities, accommodation, etc. In a business that has extremely high turnover, almost no one who joins them leaves.

A couple of studios are trying to follow their example, but it's very hard in the current climate (Kyoani was only able to achieve this by having a couple of monster hits, and then funneling most of their money into completely changing how they operated, which was crazy risky, especially when they had a good thing going). 

[This article goes over a lot of their unique aspects if you're interested in knowing more.](https://blog.sakugabooru.com/2018/08/25/the-evolution-of-kyoto-animation-a-unique-anime-studio-and-its-consistent-vision/)"
CLANNAD,It feels like it's always the regular good people that die in these mass killings.
CLANNAD,Because a non woke studio would make it okay
CLANNAD,"The problem with that: KyoAni is actually one of the better anime studios to work at (salaried staff, has a dedicated school to teach new talent)."
CLANNAD,"I know right, it's KNIVES"
The Princess Wei Young,"Xena was silly, and didn't take itself seriously."
The Princess Wei Young,Xena and the whole kitten / cougar vibe was 🔥
The Princess Wei Young,Buffy had a much higher standard of writing and storytelling. Xena was super campy and low budget.
The Princess Wei Young,"Buffy was considered the more sophisticated show because it wove in themes and metaphors to examine a young woman growing into an adult dealing with life's choices.  Whedon's use of quippy language also became almost ubiquitous in many other shows inspired by Buffy.  Even current Marvel's quippy language is highly influenced by Whedon.

Xena was just a fun show which didn't take itself overly serious."
The Princess Wei Young,"Who considered *Wonder Woman* to be highly rated?  The TV show in 1975 wasn't outstanding.  Lynda Carter was hot, but beyond that, it was comparable to *Six Million Dollar Man*.  Watchable shows with adequate writing. 

Wonder Woman that character gets mentioned, but people don't really talk about the show."
The Princess Wei Young,"People in this post acting like Buffy doesn't still top ""best of"" lists and/or get named by today's best tv/movie writers for its influence."
The Princess Wei Young,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQjV0u6wCrM&t=244s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQjV0u6wCrM&t=244s)

Why was Xena not regarded as highly as Buffy? Dont get me wrong i love them all and Hercules. I cant answer your question but I have a similar question to ask.

Why didnt Monty Pythons Ministry of silly walks receive the Oscar for best picture that year?! It was very moving and it kept a consistent pace throughout. Why is it not regarded as the greatest thing ever made?"
The Princess Wei Young,"You mention Wonder Woman but you don’t mention Bionic Woman, a tv show that aired at the same time as Wonder Woman and was also about a woman with superhero powers.

Works that are not as good or as popular as similar things in the same era tend to get lost with time. Kinda how it’s worked since art has existed.

Buffy was the more respected show. It got all the major contemporary press and is more fondly (give or take a Whedon) remembered years later. So it goes."
The Princess Wei Young,"Buffy and Xena were actually pretty comparable in viewership.

WB and UPN affiliates were essentially the same channels airing syndicated shows like Xena. And if you look 'em up, both had roughly the same highs (7-8 million viewers) and lows (around 4 million)."
The Princess Wei Young,Xena was on that TV Guide cover with Seven of Nine.
The Princess Wei Young,"I mean, people are still making Wonder Woman movies and comics so it's not hard to imagine why she might be called to mind sooner than Xena. As far as I can tell there haven't been any recent Xena movies or rebooted TV shows."
The Princess Wei Young,I guess it depends what your social circles are.  I know a LOT of lesbians who are still as obsessed with the show as the day it premiered.
The Princess Wei Young,Xena is the standard of what happens to a tv show Buffy is the exception.
The Princess Wei Young,"Buffy was a weekday prime time show made for mainstream audiences.

Xena was was a weekend show made for a more niche fantasy-loving audience. 

Everyone in the 90's watched Buffy, not everyone watched Xena, it's that simple."
The Princess Wei Young,"it might be odd to say looking back, but star power mattered more in the 90s.

SMG's run on Buffy overlapped with her also being a household name movie star, so that raised the show's profile. Whereas Lucy Lawless was just Xena in most people's eyes."
The Princess Wei Young,Watched Xena. Didn't watch Buffy.
The Princess Wei Young,I prefer Xena over Buffy (and Buffy fans seem to hate Xena for some reason I don't understand it)
The Princess Wei Young,There is a ton of thought put into Buffy's writing on a thematic and philosophical level that makes it a goldmine for discussion. Tons of books and essays have been written about it and I think there are even college courses about it.
The Princess Wei Young,I thought it was. Xena had a good run
The Princess Wei Young,animorphs was quoting xena all the time
The Princess Wei Young,"Xena and Buffy were about as highly regarded at the time.  Buffy is one of those shows that was not very popular (it did not have a high viewership) but had critical acclaim and a devoted fanbase.  And people still talk about it - so it seems like it was really popular.

The main difference is that vampire shows became popular and common and fantasy shows did not.  So people think of Buffy as having more influence."
The Princess Wei Young,"I just googled the ratings, and Buffy was twice what Xena was. 

https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-ratings-5631/

Plus, Buffy was kind a flagship show for a new network."
The Princess Wei Young,That show just wasn't as popular.
The Princess Wei Young,Xena was a dumb popcorn show compared to Buffy which later on got some incredible serious episodes.
The Princess Wei Young,"It's weird, isn't it? It seems like some great shows just kinda become forgotten, and in the case of Xena in particular it's a damn shame, considering it was always miles ahead of Buffy in terms of quality. Perhaps not in the sense of its cinematography and writing at times, but just in the sense of being far more entertaining to actually watch. Such a more enjoyable series. Honestly, even before he ruined his career, Buffy - and most of Whedon's work really - is just kind of insufferable.

Edit: I knew the fanboys would attack lmao If you don't praise Whedon, you may as well be committing a television sin. Ah well."
The Princess Wei Young,"When we talk about weekend syndicated series, the only things that get brought up are Star Trek and Baywatch. Hercules and Xena had an audience, don’t get me wrong, but they just weren’t regarded in the same way that primetime sci-Fi shows like Buffy and Charmed were."
The Princess Wei Young,Because of the writing. Xena put no effort in
The Princess Wei Young,"I don’t know, I loved it as a kid."
The Princess Wei Young,Thinking about female driven shows around those years can someone tell me how big Relic Hunter was? I watched it in Spanish TV and enjoyed it a lot as a female Indiana Jones
The Princess Wei Young,Where is Xena available to stream? I wonder if that makes a difference.
The Princess Wei Young,"Flat out truth of the matter is people generally didn't respect the network it was on.

USA shows did not ever get the level of respect they deserve. Weird Science was perfect for what it was. Goofy, sex fueled teen comedy. Duckman was genius. But that era of USA is usually pigeonholed into what Up All NIGHT was. Crappy, campy, b movie level entertainment hosted by c or d level celebrities, (downtown Julie brown, pre Aladdin Gilbert Gottfried, the Ramones...).

Hercules and Xena came in at the end of that era of USA and surprised people, because they were campy, seemingly low tier tv, but still entertaining. USA still had the funk of late night schlock and it rubbed off on Hercules and Xena. It didn't help that the other major thing the network was known for was professional wrestling. So Xena and Hercules seemed like the professional wrestling tier of television shows.

Look at Burn Notice. It was one of the most watched shows on television, but it's largely dismissed when it comes time to list the best of shows of all time. Because USA is where television goes to die a slow death."
The Princess Wei Young,"Most of these shows are very specific to people. I love xena it's fun as hell but you couldn't pay me to sit through Buffy, idk how people like it really."
The Princess Wei Young,"Yeah, Xena and Hercules were always meant to be part-adventure, part-action, part-comedy."
The Princess Wei Young,"Yeah, it was a Sam Raimi thing and had that somewhat comedic vibe.  I remember watching *Army of Darkness* sometime after Xena had premiered and it took a while to realize why the tone was so familiar."
The Princess Wei Young,Buffy was the same as well.
The Princess Wei Young,"they did film in New Zealand after all, which for a very long time, was a place alot of shows with a smaller budget filmed, its where Power Rangers went when LA became way too expensive to film in anymore unless you were doing a hollywood blockbuster [and i think it was also before parts of Canada started becoming favorites for TV shows to start filming in too]"
The Princess Wei Young,You didn't watch season 3. That shit was so good. The Debt is top tier still
The Princess Wei Young,"It doesn't seem like you've watched the show before writing this comment. Xena is an amazing story about redemption, forgiveness, self-acceptance, tolerance and companionship. It did have campy and TV budget moments just like Buffy - I do remember Buffy's big praying mantis teacher that wanted to mate with Xander in the basement. But that's just 90s TV. Even so, if the cheese is entertaining, it doesn't make the show bad.

Xena is not popular nowadays, because NBC Universal is doing a terrible job with their properties. They won't spend money on anything that is not Minions, Jurassic World or Fast & Furious. That's the reason why Xena is not popular.

That said, it seems like it's getting a cult following. People have been suggesting a revival in animation or gaming and gamers are asking for guest appearances in games like Mortal Kombat, Fortnite and the Evil Dead Game."
The Princess Wei Young,"They were live action shows for kids, essentially."
The Princess Wei Young,"Well Yeah TV before that was monster of the week.  There were some overarching season long story arcs only like Twin Peaks or I guess Soap Operas. But Buffy nailed that formula of an over arching A plot to the season with usual cutaways to that while the rest of the episode could be Stand alone or B plot. 

Look at season 1 of the Xfiles which was just monster of the week and then after Buffy they changed the formula to the Buffy format. You can even see the influence on Star Trek where for the most part TNG was episode of the week while for DS9 the meta plot of the show became the Dominion War even though there were plenty of stand alone episodes like Quark episodes or Chief O'Brien episodes."
The Princess Wei Young, xena and Hercules were supposed to be the most watched shows in the world for a while
The Princess Wei Young,There was a Xena reboot in development at NBC that ultimately fell through.
The Princess Wei Young,Weren't people making college courses and papers about Buffy?
The Princess Wei Young,No not everyone watched Buffy lmao. I don’t know a single person who watched it and I’m 40. Xena was huge tho.
The Princess Wei Young,I grew up in the 90s and didn't watch Buffy until Covid. I have all 6 seasons of Xena on DVD - the original set with the commentary.
The Princess Wei Young,"As someone who was in this demo at this time, (I was in 9th grade when the show started), you either were team Buffy or team Dawson’s Creek. This is what everyone was watching, but more people were watching Dawson’s Creek, at least in my school. 

I watched both, but I was pretty much the only one I knew that watched Buffy. Dawson’s was the show everyone cared about and talked about."
The Princess Wei Young,"> SMG's run on Buffy overlapped with her also being a household name movie star,

She wasn't even a movie star when Buffy first aired. She did win a Daytime Emmy for ""All My Children"" when she was on there. I remember her from that and Swans Crossing. Then a few years later she came starred in Buffy."
The Princess Wei Young,You should see it
The Princess Wei Young,I guess you'd have gone to see the play Gabrielle and Xena: A Message of Peace/Faster Chakram! Kill Kill rather than Buffus the Bacchae Slayer.
The Princess Wei Young,"I like both, and I personally think both were best in their earlier seasons before they started to get too serious."
The Princess Wei Young,"> Buffy is one of those shows that was not very popular (it did not have a high viewership) but had critical acclaim and a devoted fanbase.

This revisionist history. You don't get seven season, whether you switched network or not, and not be popular. Considering that it was the WB and UPN it did pretty well.

Season Premiers:
1) Bargaining I & II (7.65)
2) Anne (7.06)
3) The Freshman (6.79)
4) Buffy Vs Dracula (5.83)
5) Lessons (4.99)
6) Welcome to the Hellmouth (4.59)
7) When She Was Bad (4.37)

Season Finales:
1) Graduation Day II (6.53)
2) Becoming II (6.37)
3) Grave (5.31)
4) The Gift (5.22)
5) Chosen (4.87)
6) Restless (4.50)
7) Prophecy Girl (3.97)"
The Princess Wei Young,"Fantasy shows absolutely became popular, to the point that they eclipsed Xena."
The Princess Wei Young,"That's not rating as in ""how many watched"" btw."
The Princess Wei Young,"Yeah, sure the writing and cinematography and acting and storylines and themes and jokes and characters and directing are better in Buffy but other than that Xena was always miles ahead! 

Be serious. Xena isn't even ahead on anything compared to Buffy let alone miles ahead."
The Princess Wei Young,"Gotta agree, although I only watched 3 seasons of Buffy vs all of Xena's, and overall I think the most fun and memorable show for me has always been Xena. Buffy took itself too seriously and quite frankly I always found Xena more badass."
The Princess Wei Young,nothing on Xena cant be worse than Buffy seasons 6 and 7
The Princess Wei Young,Hulu
The Princess Wei Young,It’s pretty easy to see why people like Buffy
The Princess Wei Young,I'm guessing you never watched buffy.
The Princess Wei Young,Wonder Woman was definitely silly too.
The Princess Wei Young,"Nah Canada was used on a lot of shows during the late 80s/early 90s, both Vancouver and Toronto home bases, especially for independent syndicated distribution models. 

I am purely speculating, but I believe that New Zealand was used for not only the tax breaks the country handed out at the time to get any sort of production there, but also the landscape and cheaper labor expenses involved at the time. Combined that with it being a lot more 'low brow' and extras driven compared to most shows there was no need to consider flying in strong actor of the week types to shoot a one off vs the rest of the shows at the time so the local talent was good enough for the most part. 

The ones that shot in Vancouver of course used it as a standin for Seattle or California primarily and the place was suited for that. Also it didnt cost a lot to get an up and coming, character, or C or D list actor to come up for a week and shoot a role of the week bit or even semi recurring roles for minimal costs. 

I think this persists to this day and there are more long term shoots that take place in New Zealand/Australia like movies and Canada gets far more weekly episodic productions due to cheaper to shoot in california and easy to get talent to fly there for a week or two."
The Princess Wei Young,"Yup Joss basically invented the idea of the big bad. It was also almost unheard of to hint something in one season then pay it off years later. 

TV used to be just about syndication rights so they wanted episodes to be able to play at any time and audiences could watch it without needing to know what happened before"
The Princess Wei Young,Baywatch
The Princess Wei Young,They still are
The Princess Wei Young,Not really both that and buffy had similar viewership numbers
The Princess Wei Young,Now that sounds like a fun time.
The Princess Wei Young,Nah later Buffy easily destroys early buffy especially in the acting department
The Princess Wei Young,"those were probably great numbers for the wb and upn but back then shows would usually get cancelled with ratings like that on nbc, abc , cbs and fox"
The Princess Wei Young,To each their own. I openly admitted Buffy was ahead in every other way except general enjoyability.
The Princess Wei Young,Not true I liked Buffy season 6 and 7
The Princess Wei Young,Buffy was definitely silly
The Princess Wei Young,"I have seen Buffy more times than I can count. I've been a fan since season 5. The show had awful episodes like ""Superstar"" for pete's sake."
The Princess Wei Young,"Xander throws a biscuit at the Grizzly Bear form of a Native American spirit attacking their Thanksgiving dinner:

""Hey, Gentle Ben! This is for giving me syphilis!"""
The Princess Wei Young,I remember reading stuff about them surpassing baywatch
The Princess Wei Young,"I mean, it is no secret that the WB/UPN could not compete with the big networks. It's the same with TheCW and the big networks now, only that the gap between them is much smaller due to audience erosion.

I'd say Buffy was a big hit though, considering the kind of merchandise they had. For a while, they even had Buffy bubblegum or whatever. Not sure though what kind of merchandising there was for Xena.

That being said, I feel like Xena is still being brought up a lot in conversation about shows with strong female leads."
The Princess Wei Young,season 7 is awful Buffy telling a sucide victim that she was weak and pathethic
The Princess Wei Young,"Xena could sometimes be over the top silly and was self aware about it. Joxar, Bruce Campbell's various characters, and Kevin Smith (Aries) would often be over the top. I love that shit though."
The Princess Wei Young,Joss whedon silly is very different than Sam Raimi silly.
The Princess Wei Young,Buffy also has one of the most serious and difficult to sit through episodes in all of television history.
The Princess Wei Young,Buffy was just a better show.
The Princess Wei Young,Can't believe you're in here calling Superstar awful.
The Princess Wei Young,"I, too, have seen that article floating around online this last month"
The Princess Wei Young,Can I ask how big Pacific Blue was? It was quite big in our autonomic tv channel
The Princess Wei Young,"*Ares

And a different Kevin Smith than I thought."
The Princess Wei Young,"The word everyone is looking for is campy. Sam Raimi just can't help himself with campiness, e.g. spiderman 3 peter dance."
The Princess Wei Young,I never said it was the same kind of silly. I know Xena was more campy but she was still a strong female character
The Princess Wei Young,Yeah! Superstar is one of my favorite episodes. I think it's better than Hush (although I don't expect many people to agree with that).
The Princess Wei Young,Yeah I was also picturing silent Bob as the god or war lol
The Princess Wei Young,And sadly passed away falling off prop tower at a studio during an after party. He was just cast alongside Bruce Willis in Tears of the Sun when it happened.
The Princess Wei Young,The only flaw with Hush was that the idea that the Gentlemen float to avoid making sound is completely invalidated by the weird little mummy ghouls that flop around right next to them.
The Princess Wei Young,Guys Ni'jah won 26 grammys.
The Princess Wei Young,"Damn, not that much a fan of her a music but Billie killed it as this weird cult leader figure in episode 4. I would totally watch an entire movie about her in that role"
The Princess Wei Young,"I've only watched the first two episodes so far but I'm enjoying it.  It definitely has a gritty, dark feel to it while balancing against the humor.  Some great up and coming stars in it too (it took me a minute to realize that Khalid was Franklin from Snowfall).    
  
I was curious, is the title cards in the beginning of each episode, 'This is a true story, any similarities to persons, living or dead is intentional'.  Is this more a tongue in cheek commentary about social media stalkers/stans or was there an actual case this is based on?"
The Princess Wei Young,"So dark! This show is wild AF but it's an entertaining take on stan culture. I definitely can't use stan anymore cause it's not that serious 😩😂

Can we talk about the dog being name Otis and the actor who played Marissa's dad in epi 5 who was in The Temptations movie 😂

'Aint nobody thinking bout you Otis!'"
The Princess Wei Young,Well this is bonkers. Obviously if you like Atlanta it's for you. I like it but can't binge it because I need to like...digest it and watch some light stuff to break it up.
The Princess Wei Young,The Show is twisted AF & I'm here for it. I've watched the first 4 episodes so far & really dig it.
The Princess Wei Young,Is Dre special needs? Flat out serious. I’m watching the first episode and I’m just trying to understand some of her actions/behavior.
The Princess Wei Young,Stan culture getting dragged and I love it.
The Princess Wei Young,Really enjoyed it but I'm not sure how I feel about that ending. Kept thinking >!it was a delusion Dre was having!< so that ending left me a bit puzzled. Wild show though. Nice to see Dominique Fishback again after The Deuce.
The Princess Wei Young,"If Donald Glover is attached in any capacity I’m here for it, but the plot sounds good too. I’ll definitely give it a watch."
SIGNAL,"Having less staff and making them do twice the work so they don't have to pay better wages... yeah, this sounds familiar."

(The statute of limitations for any legal repercussions elapsed back in 1992, so there's really no reason for anyone with any knowledge not to come forward save for the fact that it's just more interesting if they don't.)

It's also a real and valuable glimpse into a now-long-gone era when television, as a medium, actually felt as though it could potentially be *dangerous*, that it could be (and, here, was) harnessed for culturally subversive means. Cable TV piracy was a real thing (as was the truly bizarre Wild West of public access television, where any nutbar with a soapbox could and would put themselves out there for the world to see), and - as David Cronenberg has remarked, when discussing the inspirations for Videodrome - there seemed a real possibility that an unwary viewer might stumble across something forbidden, something they weren't really meant to see. TV signals are protected now in ways that render this all but impossible, but this incident is such an encapsulation of that scary and kind of thrilling idea."

SIGNAL,"I remember reading somewhere that the local station office has a small satellite dish on top of the building that beams their video a rather short distance to the tower that has a receiving dish, and the tower beams out the transmission to its local viewing area.

So the ""hackers"" were just able to set up another dish nearby to just beam their signal  to the tower and play their video.

So they didn't need to access the inside of the tv station, at all."
SIGNAL,I saw the WGN one and heard about the WTTW one later.

Are broadcast signals easier or more difficult to hijack now? Why doesn't this happen more often?"
SIGNAL,"Could you imagine being on psychedelics watching Tv (or just having it on in the background) while this happened??

I would have a hard time choosing if I’d want to run to a hospital or a church or a military base…but I’d be running somewhere and fast!"
SIGNAL,"I hope that the people behind this reveal how it was accomplished before they pass away, but I suspect it will remain a mystery forever."

SIGNAL,"It was only some side ass shown but I wonder if the person had basically hacked explicit porn, if the TV station would be at all culpable for a fine? 

Also why was it not explicit porn? You’d think if someone was able to do this they’d go all out."

SIGNAL,"I was a teenager then living in Chicago. We used to record Doctor Who most of the time because it was on too late to stay up and watch on a Sunday night... because we had school in the morning. For some reason we forgot to set the VCR to record that night.

When the news came out that this happened on WTTW during Doctor Who, we were SO MAD that we didn't have the VCR recording of it.

I'm still kind of mad at myself for this.

Always thought it was so weird that people went through all the trouble and possible jail time to do this (the FCC takes this kind of thing VERY seriously), then have basically nothing interesting to broadcast. Sure, it's weird and freaky. But you'd think they'd have had something more interesting to broadcast than a bunch of garbled nonsense in a Max Headroom costume."

Whatever it was, it almost certainly required a lot of technical expertise, so at least one member of this probably was familiar with the setups of local TV stations transmission, probably from working there (although doesn't HAVE to be that, its a good chance), had access to good equipment and more.  -- assuming this is how they did it, which we still don't know, it certainly could have been a far less technically sophisticated situation."

SIGNAL,"No. I personally remember seeing WGN on cable in the '80s, but according to wiki, their first cable service to carry them was in 1978."
SIGNAL,"WGN had essentially two feeds. One local for Chicago and one for nationwide. The nationwide feed would carry many of the same programs as the Chicago feed, but sometimes the feed would be different. This is because some of WGNs rerun rights were only for the Chicago market. 

It was a similar situation for WTBS in Atlanta"

SIGNAL,"*The company says its flagship Disney+ beat Wall Street expectations by adding 12.1 million subscribers to 164.2 million, and overall streaming subscribers passed 235 million, with Hulu adding 1 million subs in its last quarter, and ESPN+ adding 1.5 million.*

Impressive gains in an era where everyone else is struggling. Hulu just added double what HBO Max did domestic in the quarter! ESPN+ did even better. 

Chapek says DTC losses have already peaked in this quarter. Forecasts losses decrease through 2023 before profitability achieved sometime in 2024. 

Nice to see Hulu’s strong investment in content rewarded in the quarter."
SIGNAL,And  the stock is down 7 percent on its earnings.
SIGNAL,convenient this comes out right before they tell subscribers that the prices are going up.  im canceling this month.  37.5 % increase from 8 bucks to 11 starting next month.  see ya
SIGNAL,$1.5 billion lost on streaming in the last quarter but sure everything is fine.
SIGNAL,[removed]
SIGNAL,"Well, they're just about to raise prices, and the 3 year D23 prepaid subscriptions end this month, so they might get more profitable, and they'll probably see slower growth in domestic subs next quarter."
SIGNAL,Losses have peaked? Shouldn't it be thalweged?
SIGNAL,"I'm not surprised, with all the companies that Disney is slowly but surely gobbling up D+ is becoming the Netflix that used to exist."

SIGNAL,"Yeah, Disney is in a weird place. They basically needed the streaming but it's really hurting their smaller movies."
SIGNAL,"Here is the thing...

Lets say each sub here pays 5 dollars per sub that is 14 billion in revenue a year. That is more than even disney's best year financially. They are making their money back without the theater just fine"
SIGNAL,"Or . . . they don't need theaters anyway.

Encanto theatrical, critically adored but box office lacked luster.

Encanto after Disney+ , crank up the merchandising and derivative synergy because this thing is hot.

Yeah, there have been decent money makers outside the worst of the pandemic in that space that challenge the notion (Minions: The Rise of Gru), but it is quite possible that parents are not going to be taking kids to see these movies in theaters as much anymore.

Was Lightyear dismal because of Disney+ or because it was a mediocre movie?

There are probably actual profit questions too after theater distribution (they can compare pure release numbers like Turning Red against theatrical long run profits), but to me it seems like people on reddit are assuming all these movies would be like Minions: The Rise of Gru if they had a 90 day window. (Minions; TRoG was 85 days) I am going to have to see that to believe it.

And it is still going to need to be a better deal than what merchandising and other derivatives are getting them throughout the rest of the company."
SIGNAL,[removed]
SIGNAL,"I signed up for ESPN+ in August because AmEx is offering $7 back on Disney bundles.  I already had Disney+ and Hulu, making it a bundle with ESPN+ lowered the cost by like $1.50.  Add in the $7 cash back and I'm saving $8.50/ month by having ESPN+.  The only time I've ever opened the app was that one NFL game that was exclusive to ESPN+."
SIGNAL,"Don't fall for subs as the key metric.  A dozen subs that make money is better business than a billion money losing subs.  

Disney's subs are money losing.  They don't even charge enough to cover administration costs, never mind the content cost.  

HBO may have modest subscriber numbers, but they know how to control costs and they charge a premium price.  From a business perspective, that's where you'd rather be.  

And it's unpopular to raise here, but Netflix is another service that is actually not profitable, despite their own deceptive claims, which have been circularly regurgitated in medium.  (Their ""profit"" claim is a heavily adjusted number that excludes major costs like their debt and content obligations.)

Similarly, don't fall for executives touting BS stats like ""views"" or ""viewing time"" or ""watch time"".  Unless you're selling advertising, views and viewing time are a drain on your cost side, and they don't add a single penny of revenue.  Plus Netflix is sneaky about how they define ""views"".   

If you sell ads, then yes, view time and number of views and number of viewers matter.  But if you have an ad-free subscription model, they don't drive the financials."
SIGNAL,"They gained subscribers but lost $1.5B *in a quarter* in the process. Money is more valuable today than it has been anytime in the last 15 years, so just growth is no longer enough. You have to have $$$ on your balance sheet at the end of the day or your stock is going to get screwed. Look at all the tech giants down 75% from last year."
SIGNAL,"I think it might be 10% when the market opens. Simply put the gains in streamers matter less to investors than the costs to bring in these gains.

The free money era is gone."
SIGNAL,"Their stock went down 6% after hours and it’s down to $94 a share, from their peak last year at $197."
SIGNAL,This sub definitely hates Disney beyond any reason so yeah there's definitely going to be tons of triggered comments soon enough.
SIGNAL,If you actually look were the growth is coming from it’s  these cheap poor countries where Disney plus is 2$…esp India. It cost 11$ a yr in India. These numbers don’t mean squat if it’s constant losing money per year as shown in the article.
SIGNAL,I think it's the 45 day window that's killing them. I don't have high hopes for strange world and I wouldn't be surprised to see black panther not met predictions.
SIGNAL,I have heard the money is in the parks anyways.
SIGNAL,"Their clueless execs botched it.

Entering the streaming world was due.  But they should have tried to emulate HBO.  That would have been a streaming option in parallel with keeping their existing (and incredibly profitable) platforms going.  

That streaming service should have been premium priced (like HBO, and like everything else Disney sells)

And the streaming should not have given away the entire farm, and the town, and the railroads.  It could have had featured content, and then a rotation of the biggest favorites.

They should have kept the lucrative BVD and foreign licensing going, while allowing the digital business to continue to prosper, even if it meant the subscription numbers would come along more slowly.

Instead, the exterminated their most profitable divisions and replaced the, with one that just burns money in a furnace."
SIGNAL,Redo your math. 235 million  x $5 is $1.1 billion
SIGNAL,Don't they include Hotstar subs in this? I pay the equivalent of 10 dollars for my yearly sub.
SIGNAL,Makes me wonder what their plan is for it when they fully take over Comcast's ownership. Would make sense to consolidate into one service but giving up 45 million other subs who may or may not switch over or pay more for a consolidated D+?
SIGNAL,"You are wrong. Netflix are actually profitable right now. On track for $6 billion in paper profits but, crucially, $1 billion in FCF for 2022. Debt is only $14.5 billion. Pretty manageable as long as they do not suffer severe subscriber losses in the next 2-4 years. 

HBO Max is haemorrhaging cash all over the place as is WBD in general. Absolutely drowning in over $50 billion of debt with cable revenues (their main revenue source) plummeting 8% year on year. Zaslav is curbing the losses at HBO Max which will be good for short term cash flow and profitability but is probably likely to negatively impact streaming growth in the medium term. Which is an issue as they are now facing being a mid-pack streamer alongside NBCU and Paramount. Crazy considering they have the tools to best Disney and Netflix. They just do not seem to have the cash needed to grow the service over the next 3 years to get it to scale. 

Disney laid out the plan quite clearly to investors at this quarterly report. DTC losses have peaked in this quarter. They will narrow in 2023 and profitability is expected sometime in 2024. DTC is not some endless money pit for Disney. There is a clear path to profitability.

Netflix are the most transparent in the industry when it comes to defining “views”. Every week they release viewership hours charts at [this](https://top10.netflix.com/tv) website. An imperfect metric for sure but far more hard data than we get from any other service in the industry!"
SIGNAL,"> Money is more valuable today than it has been anytime in the last 15 years

I want to expand on this that the market feels incredibly risk adverse right now.

The only companies that haven't had major draw downs in their stock price have done (relatively) good work at showing resiliency in the macro."
SIGNAL,"Not really surprising.

Disney's entire media business made an operating income of just $83 million down from $947 million in the same quarter 2021.

Disney shareholders have to be thanking the gods for Walt's decision to go into theme parks."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"The app troubleshooting scene *""Alright... sounds like we were successful.""* is one of the funniest and darkest things I've ever laughed hard at."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,I love the idea of him going to all the past people Barry killed and ratting on him so Barry has a bunch of people after him
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"The titles of Barry's episodes kind of crack me up. In the first season, they all start with ""Chapter #:"". In the second season, they dropped that but kept capitilization in the episode names until the finale. And now in the third season, it's all lower case.

Are the episode titles intentionally becoming as unhinged as Barry is? Maybe next season, it'll be formatted like text chats and this episode would be named something like ""all d saucezzz"""
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,The ending joke was hilarious
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"was surprised to see some of the comments here. imo this was one of the best episodes, amazing writing"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I really liked how the show handled Elsie Fischer’s character in this episode and how they warned Sally out of concern about Barry being violent. 

They could have gone the route of Sally lashing out or have her respond by defending Barry like everyone else has this season, but they cleverly subverted that trope and I think that is impressive.

That scene showed how important it is to have the courage to speak up and say something when you notice that type of behavior in people, even when it’s awkward and not easy to do so, and it’s good that the episode had Sally respond by listening and realizing the truth and then finally ending things with Barry. *This* is how you write strong and complex female characters. 

It was great direction in having the camera stay on a tight POV close up of Bill Hader’s face when Barry was excusing his behavior by saying he was just “having a bad day”. Who knows? Maybe some people watching that who are stuck in toxic relationships of their own will be able to recognize that in their partner. .


In general the social commentary on Barry is always handled so well. It deserves a lot of credit for how tactfully they approach such complicated issues."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Anyone else spy jack Nicholson shopping when gene went for the suitcases
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Sarah Goldberg is amazing.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Is Hiro Murai directing anything this season? I know that he has a voice cameo this episode as ""the bomb""."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Katie is too young and naïve to be taken seriously about stating Sally is dating a violent person.

Yes, she happens to be right, but usually at that age kids don't know anything. 

She reduced their entire relationship to one outburst and one puzzle piece about Barry being in the military.

I don't see why her opinion matters so much."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Yeah, this is a complicated one. It's hard to judge until the season's over, but there were a few moments that didn't quite gel on this episode. The Variety article that practically heals Cosineau's reputation overnight was far too contrived, and Sally suddenly becoming an amazing showrunner just doesn't make sense. Previous seasons depict her as a promising actress but a thoroughly mediocre writer.

Barry is no stranger to absurd plot developments, but usually those developments are *intentionally* absurd for comedic effect. In this episode it just feels like the show is taking lazy shortcuts to get from A to B, and I won't be sure of that until I know what B is. So far it's hard to say. All the stuff I'm feeling iffy on might be subverted in interesting ways later on.

Still, the episode had its moments, and the acting is always superb. Sarah Goldberg never ceases to amaze, and Miguel Sandoval's hilariously menacing delivery of ""aaaall the sauces"" had me laughing out loud."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"This episode had some really funny moments but overall something about it did not work for me, the whole Cousineau plot felt kinda weird, and it was kinda hard to care about the ending since what is that dude gonna do,lol. I am not surprised Berg directed this one, it seems like whenever Hader directs he adds so much more spice."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Sally is a horrible fucking person lol. It’s kind of funny to read posts of people acting like she’s a victim haha. If that was truly the writers’ intent, they’ve done a poor job. 

This show is similar to the boys in that every character is a terrible person 😂"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,[deleted]
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Yes sally!! Not the best person but I’m so glad she stuck up herself and got out of that relationship. Why did it take a teenager to be the only one to say something?
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Personally I'm not liking season 3. Bring on the downvotes.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,[deleted]
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,The show is turning from a dark dry humor comedy to a pure drama show.  If they don't correct course soon they will be toast.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"People are talking about how weak this season is which is fair, but a few of my favorite gags have already come out of it and it and individual performances are outstanding."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,It had me practically rolling. Fantastic bit.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Curious if this is going to lead to Sally being attacked or killed by one of them. Her kicking him out means they’re not likely to find him at the address Fuches gave them. I could see one of their plans going wrong and something happening to her accidentally.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Thought it was a tad unbelievable that these families will just take this guys word for it without asking more questions. How do you know he killed my family member? Why didn't you bring this information to the police. Feels a little like a lazy plot point, they're be a huge chance that it would backfire on fuques. Especially the more people he approaches"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Thought there would be a third. Rule of three and all. 

Btw, what happened to the karate girl?

Edit: Or Gene"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,The first season titles were all titled “Chapter #:” because those are the names of the chapters in Cousineau’s book.

Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"The gun store?

Isn't it like really tough to get a pistol in CA?"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,I thought I saw him too!
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Where was he? I keep looking and can’t find him.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Check her out in Hindsight one season, from MTV"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"tbh i knew there would be someone with exactly this opinion when i watched the episode, so i came to the reddit thread to find someone with this opinion, and explain what's happening to them.

pointing out that someone did something bad is something only a kid would do. this isn't because they're childish, but because they haven't grown up to accept the terrible behaviors and actions of adults - it's too awkward to talk about what barry did for most adults. in this way, her youth is a virtue - she still has hope. she's also a kid in a show about empowering women, so, being very impressionable (and also just a kid in today's society), she decides to stand up for something when she sees it.

we've already seen the perspective that you shouldn't listen to young kids, and that kids don't know anything - when katie talks to someone about it in a previous episode they dismiss her, and it's obvious nobody wants to speak up and cause trouble.

her opinion matters because she's right. she said something everybody else was too afraid to tell sally, and something sally was too afraid to admit to herself. what barry did was unacceptable.

it's been a while since s1 and s2, but i don't really remember barry having a pattern of abusive behavior, but what he did there was not something a healthy relationship can come out of unscathed."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I think, for Sally, it was that she hadn't realized what it would look like from the outside looking in? Especially in light of her show being received warmly by the critics, she wanted to prune any chances of her exploding career being put at risk because of her relationship with Barry."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,well she's in a show about a abusive relationship so it kinda tracks
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Buddy if you don't think Barry has been abusive in this relationship you need to take a very serious introspective look into your own behavior.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"> Yes, she happens to be right, but usually at that age kids don't know anything.

Have you met a Gen Z kid before? They're extremely online, and hyperaware of situations that can be deemed toxic or abusive. They don't even have to experience the thing to feel like they're experts on it. And that's not a criticism. Sometimes they're overreacting to an honest to god mistake. Sometimes, like Katie, they *are* right about things."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I feel the same way. She feels like a ""plot insert"" character."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Because sally knew before Katie even said it. Last week she literally went out and bought him gifts and apologised after he yelled at her, like she did with Sam. She didn’t want to admit it out loud but as soon as Katie said something she realised she already knew deep down."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"> previous seasons depict her as a promising actress but a thoroughly mediocre writer.

I keep taking it as a critique on how shallow Hollywood is until proven otherwise. She hit all the notes the critics needed and she got good reviews but was is shown is just mediocre drama that pales to the story they're actively showing this episode with Fuches."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I understand that sentiment, but I think it all helps with the larger thematic statement of how hollow Hollywood can be, which has rung true through all three seasons. We're seeing an escalation of the central questions from the first two seasons which are ""Can people change?"" and ""Can acting heal?"", both of which this season has firmly answered ""No."" Barry, Sally, and Cousineau all sought salvation through Hollywood, which they are now learning the hard way is a terrible place for people to heal. We've seen two seasons of their failures prevent them from healing, now we need to see how their success will prevent them from healing. And this is further underscored by how blatantly uncaring the entertainment industry is; one minute you're a nobody the next you're a star, one minute you're reviled the next your beloved. But you're still the same shitty person you were before, even though you truly believed that you'd stop being so shitty after all your dreams fell in your lap.

Which for Sally and Cousineau means trouble, but for someone like Barry spells disaster."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"i thought Barry must have orchestrated that article, but obviously nothing was shown. i didn't consider contrived because i already assumed it was planted by Barry in some way to further boost Gene's reputation, but if not then i agree too contrived. also mostly agree with sally as a great showrunner, however on second thought - the whole world we see is pretty much farcical quality tv. i don't know that we've seen a single instance of a show or movie that exists within Barry's world that didn't seem like an inane parody. so in that vein i figure almost any show could be as lauded as the next."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Reminds me of Atlanta how from season 2 to 3 many characters make a complete 180 career wise. I think it’s obviously to explore more in-depth and specific character moments, but I agree with you it was jarring seeing her move up to the level she did but I love the way her story is being told this season to be honest. I haven’t dug her character much but after episode 4 I really empathized with her so much more, and even rewatching season 1 I’m accepting her as kind of a mess, but she’s a beautiful mess."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I also thought Sally's on-stage emotional breakdown wasn't convincing. The facial expressions of excitement, panic, fear, and happiness cycled maybe two too many times. It went on too long."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,What do you mean what’s he gonna do? He’s gonna try and kill Barry along with a bunch of other people that he is sending to him. Kind of a genius plan
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"There are literally people in this thread excusing Sally's abusive tendencies but dogpiling on Barry, completely missing that they're both shit people. One being on a higher scale of shit doesn't dismiss the other one, but that's too much media literacy for some watchers."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"facts! I’ve hated her for how she treated Barry from the very beginning but now she’s the victim? I get she doesn’t want to go through with that again and it looks like she’s gotten slightly better.. but let’s not act like she’s a massive victim here and hasn’t been awful to Barry. Almost everyone is a terrible person, correct man."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Agreed
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Her abuse drama got highly praised, and when she comes down from the stage, Katie reminds her that she's now again in an abused relationship. And I think the contradiction hits her hard."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Me neither, the plot feels meandering this season. I don't really care about the gang violence, or the girlfriend's show, and Barry is so checked out it's hard to get invested in his struggles. For me, it's lost the charm of the previous seasons."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"My problem is that it feels like they skipped over a seasons worth of character development and story beats in-between seasons 2 and 3. I'm finally getting into the season, but it's still not fully working for me. I honestly think it would be even weirder binging it.

And I might be the only one but I sorely miss the acting class."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I'm with you. I am hoping it picks up or this is all setting up for something great. The first two seasons were so great, and so far these haven't been at that level."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Curious have your watched it live weekly?? From the start?
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Look at you, just stinking up the place with this steaming hot take..."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Misogynist says what
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Just don't watch the show bud.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,I thought i was the only one fast forwarding everytime she comes up. Downvotes welcomed 🙂
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Oh yea the typical drama show that features a hitman calling into customer service to help his bomb explode. Are you just missing the comedy?
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,There were a lot of funny moments in this season so far. It is still a dark humor show mixed with drama. I am curious how you see the difference.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Right the first two seasons were about acting and funny now it's so serious.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,I feel like this is just the tone of conversation towards the beginning of a season of every show on reddit
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"How is this season weak ?

Personally I think its great"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,man reddit is weird. this season has been banger after banger. if anything season 2's start of the season was far weaker.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"This season is def darker..Barry is cracking and now that Sally dipped, he really gonna go ham!!"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,or they just shoot at each other
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"It's not, it's actually really easy, people exaggerate. All I had to do was go to a gun shop, take like a 30 question test about basic gun safety, and they gave me a gun license. After that, I was able to a purchase a pistol, rifle, shotgun, etc. and all I had to do was wait a couple days before I could pick it up. I have tons of friends who complain about how strict CA is, and they have full arsenals, so idk what they're bitching about.  


Plus, I'm not 100% sure the mother and son live in CA. I know it shows Fuches meeting them, and then Fuches meeting with Ryan Madison's father, so it's safe to assume they both live in LA, but it's kinda up in the air. I could absolutely be wrong though."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"As an Australian this scene really made me laugh. In Australia it’s literally impossible to buy a gun. I’ve never met anyone who has one, never seen one (apart from in cops belts) and have never seen a gun shop. We always talk about how scary it is than anyone in America can just go and buy a gun so easily."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,There's a man who looks like Jack Nicholson character from The Shining pushing a cart thru the aisle before Gene enters frame
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"There were moments when he seemed to be on the verge of yelling at her, but then she would either leave, unknowingly resolve the situation, or act, all without noticing."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,">  she wanted to prune any chances of her exploding career being put at risk because of her relationship with Barry.

ahh, gotcha, thank you!"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I think he has been abusive; 

>Yes, she happens to be right"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Well, the plot insert character did her job. I'm glad they broke up. Barry should not be in a relationship. Especially a victim of abuse. Also, his character needs the chains off to find himself. Better for the plot. Helps him grow.

This also gives her character room to grow."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"That wouldn't be a critique of Hollywood, it would be a critique of critics. Sally's show gets a 98% on RottenTomatoes.

Granted, Hader and Berg might be setting up a joke about how binary RottenTomatoes is, so the 98% score might be comprised of reviews that are *barely* positive, and the Metacritic score might turn out to be something like 60-70.

Now that *would* be funny, AND plausible, so here's hoping that's where they're headed with that one."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I agree with you wholeheartedly as far as the thematic intent goes, it's the execution that was a bit lacking on this episode. The storytelling shortcuts that don't feel believable or earned, even if you take them as expressions of how superficial Hollywood is. Sally's success is too overdone. Cosineau's shot at redemption comes from something too thin. In fact, it feels like the whole hostage thing with Barry was over too quickly. It was a great opportunity to study both characters in a new context but it was underdeveloped. It's like this season's in a hurry and skipping beats it shouldn't skip."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Nahhh in my opinion it was TOO real, it was so uncomfortable you really felt like you were watching someone have a breakdown and cycle through so many emotions we can’t even begin to comprehend for her. Her crying afterwards and the silence was so powerful, honestly. I’m loving her story this season so far and I’m glad she dropped boob"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Nah. She did great. Cringe as any of us would be in front of all those people with a tummy full of butterflies and anxiety. Shocked he started talking again. She's on cloud nine and has no idea how to handle it as she's not used to handling these kinds of emotions and empowerment.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Plus if Barry just murders these people that go after him, he is killing people who aren't involved in crime or for a job, and that can weigh on him. This creates interesting avenues for story anyway it goes."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,I just mean he poses no threat to Barry
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Thanks, thought it was just me. It seems to have lost its way, unless I just miss bingeing it, and week to week isn't as good."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,[deleted]
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Or it's just not that funny to him? I like the show but I didn't even crack the faintest of smiles at that scene.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,[deleted]
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I honestly thought it was weak until this episode. Just felt like we were burning rubber not going anywhere, but there was finally some payoff and progression this episode while setting up lots for the second half of the season, can't wait to see the rest of it"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,I don't think this show has had a single weak moment across all seasons
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"That was the hit in the first scene of the show, right? Didn't Fuches mention in the pilot that it was somewhere in the Rust Belt?"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I had to go to an all day firearm safety class with live fire exercise, interview with a police chief, have my fingerprints and photo taken, and wait 6 months for a license to be processed before being able to buy my first firearm. Then every five years I have to have another interview with the police in order for my license to be renewed."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,">she reduced their entire relationship to one outburst

This is what you're trivializing and what I'm basing my comment on.

Rewatch that scene dude. Jesus Christ, if you don't think that's abusive even without any context at all, I don't know what to tell you."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,i think i might assume the hostage situation is not necessarily over.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Sally has those moments on mania when she become very anxious/excited.  Not unlike many of us.  It makes her character real
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Himself no but 10 of him without knowing maybe
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"""female""

Incel levels off the charts here"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,They didn’t say it wasn’t funny. They said there was no humor anymore
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"If the first hit was in the rust belt, it's possible the mother and son don't live in the rust belt since the father was taking a flight home."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,In California? Because I absolutely did not have to do any of that.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Still just one moment; not enough to say Barry is violent.
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I disagree with the guy, I like Sally, but calling him a misogynist and incel is proving nothing and makes you look immature. You're not even going into how he's a misogynist or an incel your just calling him that. where's your proof? Is it just your feelings that make him a misogynist? Your words hold little value"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,The point stands that not liking one woman doesn’t make you a misogynist
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"Right, but in that case there's no reason to assume they live in CA, right?"
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"How long ago?

That said, sounds like they're talking about the CCW process."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,"I understand both you and the person who says that you're wrong to mention this.

As the audience, we know Barry is violent. Katie has only seen one instance of it, which is why you say she's right. But the other pov is also right - just because it was a one off incident for Katie to observe doesn't preclude Barry from being a violent individual. To say 'one bad day' or 'one bad moment' actually is trivializing the obviously bad behavior on Barry's part, but the statement applies to Katie who has only seen it once."
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Yes it is
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Who cares? Bullying is its own reward
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo,Yeah bud the losers who troll these threads only have ever disliked one woman ever. You're so smart
Hot Date,I don’t know what this means; but I’m pretty sure I hate it.
Hot Date,“Stars”
Hot Date,I’ll give it a chance…seems like a rip off of Are You The One
Hot Date,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
Hot Date,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
Hot Date,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
Hot Date,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
Hot Date,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
Hot Date,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
Hot Date,"Rick Riordan:

>“Last day of filming for Percy Jackson, and we’re ending, appropriately enough, with some underwater scenes. What a season it has been! But wrapping filming is only the beginning. Post production work (editing, music, visual effects, etc.) takes almost as long as the entire filming process. Industrial Light and Magic is on it though!”"
Hot Date,Let's hope they keep a tight schedule on this. The main characters are young kids and there is a lot of material to go through. A 2 year hiatus between seasons is not going to work.
Hot Date,Please don't suck.  I love the books so much.
Hot Date,"It has six episodes according to IMDb which I think is the right choice, always thought that if they did a Harry Potter show, the first three books should be a six episodes each."
Hot Date,"The movies were so bad, but I really like the lore of this story. I never read the books but I am excited to see these kids on screen."
Hot Date,So now that film can be burned and never shown to anyone hopefully
Hot Date,Please better than Willow series & movie adaptation
Hot Date,This series has all the right ingredients to be as big as Harry Potter was. I hope it's a hit both because I loved the books growing up AND Disney+ really needs some original content IP that isn't just the latest Star Wars or Marvel show
Hot Date,Why the kid look older on the thumbnail ?
Hot Date,"I'm watching this for 2 only reasons:

1) I kind of liked the 1st movie as a kid (TIL there was a sequel lmao)

2) It has Adam Copeland aka WWE's Edge as the villain, can't wait!"
Hot Date,This will be fun for an episode and all of America will hate on it for some silly reason about there being a black person in the show
Hot Date,So a Christmas release date?
Hot Date,Meh
Hot Date,Prediction: this will be as mid as all but a few Disney+ series.
Hot Date,Any predictions this won’t do well?
Hot Date,Didn't this movie come out like 15 years ago?
Hot Date,"Yes! Probably won’t watch the show, but I loved the books

Also: Fuck the haters"
Hot Date,Are they seriously trying this again after how badly the first two movies flopped?!?!
Hot Date,so they already rebooting this harry potter knockoff?
Hot Date,[deleted]
Hot Date,Again
Hot Date,"I thought the show was going to be animated, hopefully they don't try to rush it for the kids to remain looking as kids."
Hot Date,"I still think they should've gone the animated route, and then taken time to explore the books and not worry about cast aging out"
Hot Date,"Personally I can't wait for the Underworld and the Percy vs Ares fight. The 1st and 2nd books are relatively laidback before everything goes crazy in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th books."
Hot Date,brilliant i’ll be waiting for this
Hot Date,I know that but when is it coming out? I need a date people.
Hot Date,OooO they got ILM for the VFX. That's always a nice win
Hot Date,Interesting ... don't recall any underwater scenes in the first book? Maybe he meets >!his Dad!< in the series?
Hot Date,"This would've been a non-issue if they'd made this animated.

But I guess USA is not yet ready."
Hot Date,"It will undoubtedly be years between seasons, that's how shows are now."
Hot Date,Honestly wouldn’t mind if they changed the cast up every season
Hot Date,i think they filmed the first 2 seasons back to back
Hot Date,"Just my thoughts, I think they should make it 3 seasons: the first covering the first book, and then 2 more 12 episode seasons split to cover a book each. I definitely think the first book has the most plot points and story to cover, and the last book feels like it’d be challenging to spread out to 8 full episodes. Plus it would work well since the second and third book happen summer/winter and the fourth and fifth books I believe happen pretty close together as well. It would solve the cast aging problems, and if they wanted to do heroes of Olympus on TV it won’t be like a 10 year process. I bet they could do two 12 epsidoe seasons in ~2.5 years each"
Hot Date,"After the movie, I have *very* low expectations, but am also holding out on a kernel of hope."
Hot Date,"They got a good-ish writer, and a bunch of okay-decent directors. It will probably be better but not look better than the movies. It'd expect something that feels like the average Disney/Netflix show."
Hot Date,"I loved *Black Sails* and *The Old Man.* And the showrunners on *Percy Jackson* are one of the co-creators/showrunners of those two shows (Jonathan E. Steinberg), and the other one was a writer/EP on both shows.  [Riordan has also been praising the writer's room](https://rickriordan.com/2021/07/vroom-vroom-in-the-writers-room/) as well as being in it. 

I think the chances are good with this one."
Hot Date,I say this about almost every show and movie I watch and yet...
Hot Date,Rick Riordan confirmed season 1 is 8 episodes.
Hot Date,Some Disney plus shows have suffered from the “6 episodes” structure
Hot Date,"The 2 hour sorcerers stone pretty much had every scene from the book, even 6 episode is a lot haha."
Hot Date,6 20 minute episodes
Hot Date,"Been ages since I’ve read the books, but I’ve been thinking for some time now that the structure lends itself better to an episodic structure. Exactly how many episodes I’m not sure, but one episode to dealing with Medusa, another episode to deal with the casino and if they keep going like that they should have enough time to give every story the attention it needs rather than rushing and skipping story beats like the movies did"
Hot Date,"Take it from someone who has read the books, the movies are hated and despised by the entire community, even Rick Riordan has mentioned how awful the movies are. He’s talked about how he would email the producers and directors about his ideas and they would just flat out ignore everything from him."
Hot Date,"I liked the first movie. When I watched it i never read the books before and aside from the story accuracy I think it’s overall decent. I’ve heard others have a similar opinion to this. 

The 2nd movie was pretty unbearable. Couldn’t take Tyson seriously at all was one of my complaints."
Hot Date,"For starters, this show is made by 20th Television and not LucasFilm. So that's a huge positive."
Hot Date,"Lol no way, HP still is several magnitudes ahead in terms of worldwide penetration, even after 15 years. But I hope it's a success, fans deserve it after these godawful movies"
Hot Date,Once we get into the later books...it is going to get crazy. I just hope they don't cancel it after 1 or 2 seasons.
Hot Date,The kids are slightly older than in the books but only by a year or two for most of them. It makes sense...using 12 year olds would be kind of hard. They are also likely upping the agest of the character by 2 years to fit this. Instead of the prophecy being about a 16 year old it's about an 18 year old and that would allow the actors to age with the show better
Hot Date,There was a black person in the movie and it was one of the few things that *wasn't* wrong with it.
Hot Date,"To be fair, everyone hated when they made Annabeth brunette in that terrible movie. 

I dislike this change, because in this book series all characters have very specific and very memorable physical descriptions, and to me they are parts of the characters.

My favorite character in the franchise is from the sequel series, a native american named Piper, and you can be sure I'd be just as mad if they'd changed her look as well."
Hot Date,They have already started.  Annabeths actor was bullied off of social media.
Hot Date,"Or maybe it'll just be a bad show, then people will run to reddit and call America racist because that's what always happens."
Hot Date,It has a 2024 release date on the IMDb fwiw.
Hot Date,Prediction: A lot of people on this sub would call the series bad no matter its quality because of their own political opinions.
Hot Date,Artemis Fowl was appalling. I just hope this doesn't go the same way 🙊
Hot Date,"'Andor', Loki, 'Wandavision', 'The Bad Batch' and 'The Mandalorian' were good but outside of Marvel and SW, there isn't much.

I know 'Willow' wasn't all that amazing but I still want another season."
Hot Date,"Yeah, and it was a dud, along with the sequel.  The series is better suited for a miniseries anyways."
Hot Date,"Yes, but this time with the author actually involved, and starring actors that are of similar age to the characters."
Hot Date,Anyone who won't watch a show because a black person is in it is not someone you want associated with your brand anyway.
Hot Date,"This is so dumb. There are black characters in the books, just like there are asian, hispanic and native american. Not every character looks Greek. Even the Gods are said to change form over time to look more like the modern times and to match the land they are in.

The demi gods dont only have 1 parent. They all have 2 and should look like their human parent as well."
Hot Date,"Yeah, it sucks that people are still racist like that."
Hot Date,Why especially internationally ? Those that seem to be the most upset are Americans.
Hot Date,"Not necessarily. It depends on how much money they have for their effects budget. Go back and watch ‘Spawn’ from the late 90s. McFarlane insisted on ILM for the effects but they basically got their D team and it all looked like a cheap video game. 

Obviously, effects have improved since then but it all depends on the budget and the time they have"
Hot Date,ILM => Lucasfilm => owned by Disney. :D
Hot Date,"He jumps into the Mississippi River from the St Louis Arch and meets a water spirit. To a lesser extent, he also ends up at a water park with Annabeth fighting metal spiders for Ares, and the group use the pearls to escape the underworld and end up in the ocean rescued by the Coast Guard or something."
Hot Date,"There was, can't recall the creature. But it's after he goes into the river."
Hot Date,Damn I'd never considered that. Percy Jackson is perfect for an animated series.
Hot Date,Is any country? Most adults over 40 still see animation as a kids thing.
Hot Date,"The US may not be ready but that didn't stop DreamWorks from turning TrollHunters and How To Train Your Dragon into successful animated TV shows (I know the HTTYD franchise is mostly known for their films but their TV somos spinoffs were quite successful).

In all seriousness, the core reason Rick Riordan wanted it to be live-action in first place is because he claims it will bring in more viewers and that live-action carries more weight to the story than animation, which I find really silly as most animated films and TV shows in last few years can carry a story very well, or even better, than live action. It may bring in more viewers but I also believe he's also not thinking very practically as this problem of finding kids that looked like the characters or if the kids grew too old or if the special effects were too phony could've been avoided if he gave animation a chance"
Hot Date,I'm might get downvoted for this but I feel like the show should've been animated from the get-go. I'll still watch it when it comes out but I feel like live action/CGI is the wrong medium for a story as big as Percy Jackson.
Hot Date,"some of us dont want to watch cartoons

im sorry yall dont want to grow up 🥲"
Hot Date,Americans appreciate live action more than someone’s drawings. And rightfully so. Seeing something animated is about 50 times more lame than seeing something in live action with real people portraying real emotions. Why do you think animes and old Disney movies get live action remakes. Sure they aren’t all good. But the world isn’t 7 years old and most people don’t wanna waste their free time watching a cartoon. It just won’t hold as much weight. Sorry bud.
Hot Date,"Oh please. If I wanted the self-checkout version of visual entertainment I would go there.

But instead of having the creators demand I do half the work for them, I'd rather be entertained by convincing portrayals and cinematics."
Hot Date,Sucks because the East is over there consistently proving how incredible it can be used
Hot Date,That's how shows in the UK have been for years.
Hot Date,You don’t want the story told by the books?
Hot Date,"Yea I agree. If they want to adapt HoO they need to cut it down somewhere. And it's a lot easier to do that in the first series. 

Otherwise the absolute best they could manage is 1 season per year. It could work, adapting each series with 1 season per book, meaning 10 seasons in 10 years. Anything longer than that though would be a nightmare trying to keep the cast together for that long."
Hot Date,The major difference here is that Riordan has an active hand in involvement for the show
Hot Date,"Honestly, I think that's enough. The story is so strong that even *decent* production value can make the show pretty damn good."
Hot Date,"To be fair as much as I loved the books its not like they were amazing or all that well thought out. It was very much a book for kids and written from the POV of a kid. 

The next Harry Potter in terms of quality this won't be, but Disney could have a massive streaming hit on their hands that appeals to the younger generation and fans of the books.

And just like Harry Potter, I could see the show aging up with the cast and becoming a lot more serious. There are some fantastic moments in the last few books, but fuck me that final book is going to need a massive budget to do the third act justice unless they give it a movie to finish off with."
Hot Date,">They got a good-ish writer,

I'd say Rick Riordan has a better than good-ish handle on how to adapt the Percy Jackson franchise. ;-)  Both Rick and Becky Riordan are [in the writer's room](https://rickriordan.com/2021/07/vroom-vroom-in-the-writers-room/), and Riordan himself is co-writing the pilot episode. 

In addition, the showrunners who are the guys who are in charge of the show, its tone, and overall direction are [Jonathan E. Steinberg](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2379544/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) (co-creator/co-showrunner of *Black Sails* (the show we send all the sad GoT fans who want more to) and *The Old Man*) and [Dan Shotz](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0795222/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) (writer/EP on those two shows. If you're old like me, you might also remember *Jericho,* which was theirs.

In addition, they've also got [Monica Owusu-Breen](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1044428/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) who wrote for *Lost, Fringe, Agents of SHIELD,* and created/showran *Midnight Texas;* and Joe Tracz, who worked on the *Lightning Thief* musical, as well as wrote for *A Series of Unfortunate Events.* 

So, in my book? they got a **lot** more than just ""a good-ish writer."""
Hot Date,"My guess at the pacing:

>!**Episode 1** - The beginning of the novel up until the Minotaur fight  
**Episode 2** - Introduction to Camp Half-Blood, probably ends with Percy getting claimed  
**Episode 3** - Percy is sent on his quest, encounters the furies on the bus, fights Medusa  
**Episode 4** - St. Louis and the Arch  
**Episode 5** - Denver, Ares, abandoned amusement park  
**Episode 6** - Vegas, Lotus Hotel and Casino  
**Episode 7** - Entering the Underworld, probably up until Grover almost gets dragged into Tartarus  
**Episode 8** - Confronting Hades, fighting Ares, returning the Bolt, and being betrayed by Luke!<

This fits the structure pretty well imo"
Hot Date,8-13 is the perfect streaming amount of episodes for me. 6 is just too few most times
Hot Date,Hello there!
Hot Date,"It actually cut a pretty big chunk out of the book. 

We only see the one quidditch game, so we don’t see Harry follow snape and see him confront Quirrel in the woods. 

Norbert is cut completely. Harry and Ron in detention is cut. And a couple of the tasks protecting the stone were cut. 

Mind you, the only thing I think should have been included was the potion task so Hermione could have her moment. But at least a solid 50-60 pages of material was cut."
Hot Date,"It’s crazy that it was Chris Columbus who directed. From watching the movie, you couldn’t tell he did Harry Potter. He didn’t phone it in, he was asleep at the wheel."
Hot Date,The 2nd movie was especially bad.
Hot Date,people somehow forget HP had an entire generation of kids eagerly awaiting a book to come out
Hot Date,I can't see them cancelling it so soon.  If they do it right they'll have another cinematic universe on their hands with all of Riordan's later series. Disney has the money to build this into a pop culture juggernaut.
Hot Date,It’s been confirmed that they aren’t upping the ages of the characters. So he’ll just be 13 playing a 12 year old which is fine with me as long as they don’t wait 2 years between filming seasons like a lot of shows do now
Hot Date,Why would using twelve year olds be hard? Weren't the harry potter kids eleven in the first movie?
Strong,"Strong: I looked at the method acting plan, and I looked at Brian's plan, and Brian's plan was better."
Strong,"This is a great response to shut this convo down. 

I like Jeremy Strong and still feel like The NewYorker profile was unnecessarily harsh. In the era of nepobabies, let this man from a regular ass background be great and obsessive with his craft."
Strong,"This is a pretty wholesome exchange, really.

Cox was worrying about Strong's health and Strong is respecting Cox's opinion and experience."
Strong,"It feels slightly like because Jeremy Strong isn’t a Paul Rudd / Keanu Reeves / Pedro Pascal style sweetheart, the entertainment press is trying to make this guys life and career harder than it should be.

He’s a great actor who takes on great roles. Let him be slightly intense if he wants to. No need to manufacture discontent between him and his co-stars."
Strong,"There are levels to this and when method acting becomes an issue, it should be called out. I can’t remember the exact details but Aaron Sorkin said that Strong wanted to be pepper sprayed for real to get a genuine reaction but Sorkin shut it down because it would endanger the rest of the crew nearby with the spray. I think that’s the fatherly concern Cox has and why he sees it as too much at times

Edit: Here’s the link. It was tear gas he wanted https://twitter.com/jes_chastain/status/1469447303350173704?s=46&t=GCsHzjZ-aKdW-Wpfy9JCGQ"
Strong,"Jeremy Strong:
>Everyone’s entitled to have their feelings. I also think Brian Cox, for example, he’s earned the right to say whatever the fuck he wants. There was no need to address that or do damage control…. I feel a lot of love for my siblings and my father on the show. And it is like a family in the sense that, and I’m sure they would say this, too, you don’t always like the people that you love. I do always respect them."
Strong,"I really love Succession.  It's like a seriously serious version of Righteous Gemstones.  Some of the strange behaviour of these rich assholes is just fascinating. Like the birthday party episode last season, god damn was that depressing and weird."
Strong,"To quote Brian Cox from the TV show Deadwood: ""Fuck you, sir!'"
Strong,"I’m so befuddled by this, lots of actors utilize method acting.  Is it that Strong gets into it too much for his own good or is he just an asshole when he’s “in character”?"
Strong,"Reminds me of that conversation between Lawrence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman had been running around in circles to wear himself out and get sweaty for a scene, and commented as much when Olivier asked what he was doing. 
“My dear boy, why don’t you just try acting?”"
Strong,BOAR ON THE FLOOR
Strong,This is what all people in their 80s think
Strong,"I genuinely love how he handled this. Jeremy Strong Is really amazing, I adore him."
Strong,I love people being allowed to just disagree with each other and then respect that.
Strong,"I love this bit.  
/Cox also told the press that “there is a certain amount of pain at the root of Jeremy, and I just feel for that pain,” but Strong does not necessarily agree.  
“You know, I don’t think so. I don’t think there is,” Strong told GQ as a rebuttal. “There’s certainly a lot of pain in Kendall, and I haven’t really met Brian outside of the confines of that.”/  
People's perception of you is their own. Brian and even Alan Ruck want to assign some pain to Jeremy Strong because they can't conceive of someone bleeding for their craft the way he does.  
I am sure their hearts are in the right place but it's ainsulting to speculate on his emotional and mental well-being."
Strong,I wonder what Kirk Lazarus has to say about Strong Too.
Strong,L to the OG.
Strong,This is actually all just method acting for the next season of succession
Strong,"Cox's statements were pretty tame. I'd be concerned about Strong too. He didn't say Strong was unpleasant, or difficult, or a bad team player.

I'm not a fan of method acting, but at minimum, I think Cox's thoughts are healthy ones. What impact does this have on Strong long term? Is it sustainable? Is it something that should be lauded? To think critically about Strong's methods isn't to condemn him *or* his acting."
Strong,"Method acting has a spectrum. You don't have to be 100% of the character all the time after you get the role to still have people say you are ""Method Acting""."
Strong,"I just did a “Hey, it’s that guy!”

I don’t watch Succession, but did just finish watching The Big Short a few hours ago. In one scene I thought to myself “This dude chews gum with the intensity of a peak Mike Tyson in a stare-down.”"
Strong,"Why do people get so riled up over ""method"" acting?"
Strong,Why everyone in this cast beefing with each other all the time lmao
Strong,"I'm a computer dev and when I'm coding, I go 'into the zone' where I actually disassociate from the world around me and go on autopilot. If you ask me questions in this state, I answer without thinking, or it knocks me out of said state while trying to stay there. I bet method acting is the same as far as getting lost in the job. I imagine any time his character is insufferable, he is too. I bet he even feels a separate set of emotions when in character."
Strong,Is sucking up to Brian Cox a sign that he's still method-acting right now?
Strong,"I always love the idea of method acting but I love what Lawrence Olivier said about Dustin Hoffman's dedication to method acting in Marathon Man. “My dear boy, why don't you just try acting?”"
Strong,"He’s worried because if you get too method, especially in dark characters, it’s hard to dig yourself back out of that hole.


Look at Heath Ledger as an example.  There are others too"
Strong,"If he’s not hurting anybody else, let him act however the fuck he wants to do it, and fuck off!"
Strong,"This is like the third time someone has written an article about Brian Cox bitching about Jeremy Strong’s method acting style and every time Jeremy Strong responds in a respectful, classy way. It’s starting to feel like Cox is a jealous mean girl harping away at the same thing every time he’s interviewed."
Strong,[deleted]
Strong,"Who? Stop watching TV, don't you know it rots your brain?"
Strong,"To date I've enjoyed Brian Cox in just about everything I've seen him in. But over the past couple of years, the fact that he has revealed how shamelessly anti-American he is, has given me pause. Cox is a hypocrite in that he seems to enjoy the opportunities that the American entertainment industry has brought him, and yet he seems to hew to the notion that all Americans are mouth-breathing buffoons.  Of course, even old dried up, pock marked, windy  bagpipes like Cox are entitled to their opinions. But this buffoon of an American also has the right to stop supporting projects in which he appears. Update: I see the Brian Cox sycophants are here in full force."
Strong,Never heard about Jeremy Strong's method acting so far. Has this been a hot topic before?
Strong,That also should have been his reaction to the New Yorker article that started this Streisand effect of how weird he can be.
Strong,wow
Strong,So did he give himself a cocaine addiction?
Strong,We all have the right to say what we want
Strong,I cannot wait for the new season!
Strong,That's what I would say
Strong,I don’t talk about that.
Strong,Good answer
Strong,Can’t wait. March which day?
Strong,I love that this all fuels the performances between the two
Strong,"I fucking loved Brain Cox in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" his introductory scene was amazing. Also one of Samuel L Jackson's best parts. It was a pretty great 90s action movie."
Strong,Spoken exactly like Daddys Number 1 Candy baby
Strong,Ahhh its always nice to see redditors who are average regular people arguing about wealthy actors lol.
Strong,Well thats nice
Strong,A confident man.
Strong,"Jeremy, I've seen your acting method get you fucked.., a lot. Brian, I haven't seen get fucked once."
Strong,ugh method actors. i can imagine method actors playing frontiersmen and deciding to not shower for a month to get in the headspace of the character.
Strong,Again! But more dead inside this time.
Strong,Hahaha this got me
Strong,This is great.
Strong,I'm laughing so hard rn!
Strong,Dude you have impeccable timing.💪
Strong,I also love actors who are just a lil weird (in a harmless way which it seems like he has been I don’t think he’s been abusive to any cast mates or anything) like they have such a weird and wacky job I love when they get super into the craft of it and lose their minds a bit
Strong,"Method Acting is after all being practiced by many many actors. Also I think the New Yorker profile is being misconstrued by many. I don't think it was necessarily criticising him. 

The side effects of playing a character like Kendall must be soul sucking, and this is visible more to the cast especially Brian, and he showed his concern there is nothing wrong with that. Their approaches are very different and I can totally believe Jeremy goes deep into the character every season. Look at the misery he radiates on screen. He is so sad, pathetic and cringu at the same time. He fucking deserves all the awards he gets and more and so does Brian. Brian would make me fear If he was in character near me.

They both have different approaches and get masterful performances out of it, so yay?!"
Strong,The era of nepo babies? You mean literally every era?
Strong,">	I like Jeremy Strong and still feel like The NewYorker profile was unnecessarily harsh. In the era of nepobabies, let this man from a regular ass background be great and obsessive with his craft.

The reason they did the profile is that they heard the multiple claims Strong is very difficult on set because he doesn’t turn Kendall off until filming is complete. The profile interviewed him and his co-workers who all kind of agreed that’s his process so it’s not like they painted an unfair picture"
Strong,Yeah it made him seem way more arrogant and full of himself than it probably needed to.
Strong,What conversation? Cox *barely* expressed an opinion.
Strong,Amen brother. He’s so good.
Strong,Fucking preach 🏆
Strong,"oh yes, nepobabies, truly a new phenomena...and so unique to the acting world..."
Strong,Is nepotism new or is nepobaby trending now?
Strong,Is this the hip new thing to complain about? Nepobabies?
Strong,"eh idk about wholesome, Cox uses the term ""annoying"" to describe Jeremy a couple times. I am sure he is also concerned about him but Jeremy genuinely seems to be getting on his nerves."
Strong,"Agreed — and, at this point, we have some pretty good examples of the truly *problematic* and, though sure that could change, I see no current reason for his constant demonization."
Strong,"The art world has a lot of room for quirky, weird, assholes. Some of the best art in history has been created by obsessive, angry, maniacs. 

Obviously you're free to take issue with that and complain but IMO complaining online really pulls into perspective the difference in significance between the complainer and the artist. One person is honing a craft and making timeless art while the other is shouting into a void. 

You don't need to want to have dinner with someone to be able to enjoy their art. There's a reason they say don't meet your heroes. As long as they're not literally hurting people who gives a fuck?"
Strong,Pedro👀😳
Strong,I’ve only seen him in a couple things but the guy completely nails playing a rich asshole. He was great in the big short as well.
Strong,I am amused that Aaron Sorkin doesn't use social media and told Jessica Chastain to post this.
Strong,"Strasberg’s Method (not to be confused with Stanislavsky) is a recipe for disaster if one is not very psychologically stable.
The Classical system yields wonderful results. Considering the various acting systems available, Strasberg’s has always seemed like the most unnecessary taxing on the performer. It’s an interesting phenomenon, given that the US is generally interested in efficiency above all else."
Strong,I didn’t read the profile but these answers make it pretty clear that Sorkin thinks he’s amazing.
Strong,">so I declined to spray him with poison gas.

On one hand I get not wanting to expose people to it or going through all the work to set it up an area so only Jeremy Strong gets hit with it, but on the other hand CS gas is pretty harmless and far from “poison gas” lol"
Strong,Whoa those last two lines. I wonder if there's hidden beef. And we've seen some of those funky quotes from Cox so who knows
Strong,"I was trying to sell the show to someone who had watched a couple of episodes and called it quits, giving the reason of ""I have no one to root for, they're all assholes,"" and I was like.... Yeah. And then I struggled to come up with the reason that I like the show.

I think you nailed it. They all operate like aliens, some of them having brief moments of relatable humanity. It's fascinating"
Strong,The whole thing is goddamned Shakespearen. Almost like an inversion of King Lear.
Strong,It always reminded me of Arrested Development more. But Righteous Gemstones also remind me of AD so...
Strong,"Lol!  I seriously think about that 30 second exchange on Deadwood a lot for some reason.  

It has to be one of the more wonderful ""fuck you sirs"" in TV history

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDiZsl10Zyk"
Strong,I think Robert Pattinson was the one who said “how come you only hear about method acting when someone is playing an asshole?” Or something to that effect.
Strong,"To be fair, Brian Cox also seems like an asshole at times."
Strong,Maybe you should read the article then because it says why Cox feels that way.
Strong,"as someone who has studied as an actor and knows someone that studied at Strasberg’s Acting Studio, one issue that becomes frustrating is that many actors use “the method” but that doesn’t require you to stay in character at all times. Over the decades, it’s what the media has used to describe actors that stay in character all the time, but it is not taught that way."
Strong,"Last time I heard that story Hoffman went without sleep to wear himself out, which makes more sense you can act sleep deprived but you can't act sweaty."
Strong,"Actually “A story circulated for a long time that Dustin Hoffman (being a ""method actor"") stayed up all night to play a character who has stayed up all night. Arriving on the set, Sir Laurence Olivier asked Hoffman why he looked the way he did. Hoffman told him, to which Olivier replied in jest ""Why not try acting? It's much easier."" Hoffman repeatedly denied the story, and finally cleared up the matter in 2004. The torture scene was filmed early in the morning, Hoffman was going through a divorce from his first wife and was depressed, and had spent the previous two nights partying hard. Hoffman told Olivier this and his comment related to his lifestyle and not his ""method"" style of acting.”"
Strong,"Oink for your sausages, piggy!"
Strong,He literally said he has only met them in character and that character carries a lot of pain. So they are perceiving what he is showing them. What else are they supposed to think.
Strong,Because they can be difficult to work with.  For example Jeremy won’t rehearse any of his scenes with   Brian and I can imagine that’s very frustrating for him.
Strong,I could imagine working with someone who is method acting is really annoying.
Strong,They never method-act as a nice person
Strong,Because a lot of actors use it as an excuse to act like an asshole.
Strong,Mostly cause it’s unnecessary I feel like. Would you like to be around someone pretending to be an asshole all day at work around you? You try talking to them like normal but they’re “in character” and just make it all around weird and awkward to be around.
Strong,"A film set is a workplace like any other, and it’s very frustrating when actors feel they can be rude or demanding of their coworkers for the sake of “the performance”. Expecting everyone else to cater to your obstructive behaviour in a professional setting is frankly egotistical, and not to mention hardly ever necessary. There have been plenty of actors who didn’t need to go method for an outstanding performance."
Strong,"It's unnecessary, it's pretentious, it gets in the way of filming, and some actors use it as an excuse to act like an arsehole without repercussions."
Strong,"Lotta people replying to you with likely little experience working on art or with artists. Some people require different processes to get where they need to be, that’s all it is. 

Sure—like absolutely anything—it can go too far. But that doesn’t really seem like the case here."
Strong,Cause the new season is dropping soon and they need to increase the web traffic
Strong,"lol was there more beef that I missed? 

Kieran Culkin and the redhead seem like somewhat normal actors."
Strong,Method acting
Strong,You do method coding?
Im Sorry,"one of my faves from recent years and they (trutv, not hbo) fucking canceled it even though the whole third season was already written and ready to be shot."
Im Sorry,"Oh man, I loved this show. I also was confused when I watched it when it was on trutv because it’s so dirty. I watched it on Netflix a few years ago. Makes me laugh out loud. Glad to know it’s on hbo"
Im Sorry,"Amazing show, gone too soon."
Im Sorry,"They had all the scripts written for season 3, but the show got cancelled after initially being renewed when COVID hit."
Im Sorry,Loved this show! My wife and I still quote it to each other all the time. The relationship between the husband and wife is so sweet and charming!
Im Sorry,Terrific show. Blew my mind to learn she is the psychiatrist from Step Brothers.  Check out The Detour for another great sitcom that pushes boundaries.
Im Sorry,"i freaking LOVED this show!!  Andrea Savage and the rest of the cast were perfection in it!  imo it was one of THE funniest shows i'd seen in a while.........and lame TruTV cancelled it and yet the station unfortunately insists on non-stop marathons of the god awful show ""Impractical Jokers"".  I'm Sorry was TruTV's best show imo. i wish another station/streaming site/etc. had picked I'm Sorry up once TruTV had cancelled it."
Im Sorry,Great show. Enjoy the run.
Im Sorry,"I liked it, it came off as a basic cable “Curb Your Enthusiasm” with a female lead."
Im Sorry,I have been telling everyone about this show for years. One of the funniest shows I’ve seen.
Im Sorry,"The episodes are labeled ""explicit"" because TruTV broadcast the censored version but put the uncensored up on their website.

Really liked the show, don't see why it got cancelled. It's pretty loose storywise so they could've just continued it later. TruTV was a joke of a network to put it on, should've had it on TBS or even TNT."
Im Sorry,SO SO FUNNY!
Im Sorry,"Very disappointed that it got renewed and canceled, season two was really funny and I was looking forward for more. Warner should've moved this show to HBO Max (and slashed the episode count to make up for the additional covid related budget) instead of letting it die on whatever Tru TV is"
Im Sorry,They aired edited versions on TV. The uncensored versions were available OnDemand at the same time.
Im Sorry,I circled this show for years when it was on but never dove in. I am assuming I can start it and not be too upset it did not get renewed (i.e. no cliffhangers)?
Im Sorry,"Good show, but way too much of the main character. She’s in every minute of it."
Im Sorry,I was just thinking about that but I still need to be more informed.
Im Sorry,"Damn, I didn't know this got cancelled. I thought it was just delayed because of the pandemic. Surely it'd be cheap and easy enough to restart if it got more attention."
Im Sorry,"One of my favorite comedies. Whenever I want a genuine laugh, I watch this or Santa Clarita Diet!"
Im Sorry,I love love love this show. It’s the perfect example  of someone I’d hate to be married to but love to see on the screen.
Im Sorry,They did the same to People Of Earth
Im Sorry,Didn't they start filming and then had to shut down and got cancelled before they could resume?
Im Sorry,Well now I'm sad they cancelled it.
Im Sorry,"The first couple episodes have so many scenes that made me laugh out loud.  I can't believe I just found it if it was on NetFlix, too."
Im Sorry,Isn’t it? So charming. I love this show
Im Sorry,She also has a recurring role in Veep. Her agents is earning that 10%
Im Sorry,"I think when the show first started, TruTV was ran separately from any other Turner network and the guy in charge really seemed to want to create a bunch of niche comedy shows. stuff like Adam Ruins Everything, Jon Glaser Loves Gear, Those Who Can't, At Home with Amy Sedaris, and I'm sorry. basically using the money they got from airing Impractical Jokers endlessly for this. in 2019 TruTV got absorbed into TBS and TNT, the guy in charge left, basically everything but Jokers and Tacoma FD ended in favor of new unscripted stuff"
Im Sorry,">The episodes are labeled ""explicit"" because TruTV broadcast the censored version but put the uncensored up on their website.

What was censored?"
Im Sorry,"Love this show. Great couple show and there aren't that many out there where two people are 
1. In love. And 
2. Funny to see how comfortable they are with each other.

Without trying to do the whole....oh no they might get divorced because tiddies show up or they are struggling one month. 
I get that it's basically a sitcom but it does it's job well"
Im Sorry,"Interesting.  That is what I was wondering since they were labeled ""explicit."" I didn't know how they would edit them but the On Demand option makes a lot of sense.  Thanks"
Im Sorry,">The uncensored versions were available OnDemand at the same time.

What was censored?"
Im Sorry,"I was so bummed about People of Earth being cancelled too! Especially after the season 2 finale, ugh. But wasn’t that on TBS? Not TruTV?"
Im Sorry,What an amazing show that was.
Im Sorry,"yeah, something like that."
Im Sorry,"""She works almost exclusively out of her butt."""
Im Sorry,"I don't know, I never watched the censored version. There was never any nudity or anything like that so probably just the language."
Im Sorry,"""Look at her! Such a little cocktease!"""
Im Sorry,I feel stupider every time I’ve seen an episode of Scorpion. 
Im Sorry,It's crazy that this guy still has a job after [that insane sexual harassment story](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2018/12/19/eliza-dushku-responds-what-happened-cbs-took-job-and-because-objected-being-sexually-harassed-was-fired/OCh7h0pwg4Aq7xfwOUasyO/story.html) came out. How is Aunt Becky fired immediately from both of her shows for writing a big check but this guy keeps working? Unreal.
Im Sorry,"If you want a good lawyer show, watch boston legal."
Im Sorry,"The only way CBS could make the show worse is by wrapping it in the American military motif that they are smearing over their other TV shows.

My roommate after watching 15 seconds of ""Seal Team"": ""Sooo, this team of models fight wars?"
Im Sorry,And it stars a sexual harasser.
Im Sorry,"Anything Kardashian.... Bachelor/Bachelorette, home video of my last family reunion..."
Im Sorry,I thought this gonna be about Night Court Bull and somehow he got a show.
Im Sorry,"If it's based on Phil McGraw as I gather it is, then it's starting from a ridiculously low base of fucktardary and narcissism to begin with. "
Im Sorry,It's mindless television but no worse than something like MacGyver. Some shows go nicely in the background while you mess around on Reddit.
Im Sorry,Fuller House
Im Sorry,I’ve never seen it but a show based on Dr. Phil sounds pretty dumb to me.  Plus the lead actor is an asshole. 
Im Sorry,"SWAT is pretty bad, in a group they stand in a semi circle so they can take it in turns to speak !! "
Im Sorry,"Have you seen ""Whiskey Cavalier"" yet? I think it could give ""Bull"" some competition in the dumbest show on TV contest."
Im Sorry,The Rookie is awfully dumb but I enjoy it nonetheless.
Im Sorry,"Midnight, Texas was hilariously stupid. It knew that and it still worked. Damn I miss that show. "
Im Sorry,I could never get past the premise of Suits. 
Im Sorry,The Ranch
Im Sorry,Does *Fox & Friends* count?
Im Sorry,As it isn't a reality show… no.
Im Sorry,"some cw stuff, even the good shows can be incredibly dumb.  Legends does it in an entertaining way but it's clear some of the show's writers are incredibly high lol.

The Flash team is supposed to be a group of geniuses and a veteran detective.  However, I dont think I can name many shows where the protagonists have made dumber decisions"
Im Sorry,"The funny thing about Bull is that it could be a great show if it wasn't a procedural.

Focus on one or two cases for the entire season and build up the characters...it would essentially be a season of American Crime Story.

Reduce the crazy technology they use and focus on real life psychology...

It's frustrating, Bull is enjoyable in it's own stupid way, but it could've been so much better.
"
Im Sorry,To make you feel worse: the premise isn’t made up. It’s LOOSELY based off the early career of one of its [producers. ](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1114695/)   That’ll make you feel way worse about the show.    
Im Sorry,Whiskey Cavalier is pretty dumb. 
Im Sorry,I feel FBI is the dumbest show on TV right now.  I watched the first 4 episodes and I felt like I was watching a MADTV skit about CSI.
Im Sorry,"I have never seen *Bull*, but I have two friends who keep telling me how goddamn generic and garbage it is. The only reason they watched it in the first place was because their dad was an extra for one episode."
Im Sorry,"What’s the premise you’re talking about that makes it so bad, I’ve seen it in passing, and would never defend it as a good show, I always just brushed it off as one of those formulaic shows like CSI that starts with a crime and ends with a confession 90% of the time."
Im Sorry,"Ugh, this show is insulting.

TV should be a bit unrealistic, but this premise is just insane. This type of business just does not exist, nor would it work, nor would anything they do be legal. The lead character being flawed can work, but when that character is a womanizing drunk who gets away with misogynistic crap and succeeds, (ironically being the most realistic thing in the show) sends a very bad message. Finally, this show can't figure out what it wants to do and meanders all over the place, trying crap out that makes no sense. All of those ancillary characters have become basically meat hanging in the view of the camera. 

&#x200B;

This show is bad in every sense, but goes to show how stupid people are."
Im Sorry,*Carter* (2018) was pretty dumb.    (Most of the show on HGTV are pretty dumb too.) 
Im Sorry,Network tv is so exhausting 
Im Sorry,Why is it still on the air after it came out that Michael Weatherly is sexual predator? 
Im Sorry,ever watch the walking dead
Im Sorry,"Anything could be dumb, depending on what you like/don't like to watch. We don't watch Bull, gave it a try, but it didn't keep us interested. But in our house we watch about 40 different shows in any given time. Some are great murder/fun mysteries(Midsomer Murders), gruesome/but delectable(Hannibal), reality(GBBO), or yes, even CBS shows. Like I said it just depends on the mood one is in. If our brains are working, we'll watch Jeopardy. But if we just want to relax & zone out, we'll watch NCIS or one of those people like to call-old people shows(even though we're 50). It's called a comfy show, folks. It's not about what intellectual stimulates us. I don't understand why people have a problem with shows like these, but comic/superhero shows, for the most part, are considered great. I have a feeling, like us, most people have an array of different genres they'll watch. If you think it's the dumbest show(although you must not watch much tv), great. But there's a reason why there's so much out there. What doesn't interests one, will interest another."
Im Sorry,"I haven't watched that yet, but it's hard for me to imagine that there are worse shows on tv than the ''Arrowverse'' shows. "
Im Sorry,I could never get over the premise of a jury consultant.  That screams boring to me.  Anything with the letters CSI are up there as dumbest on TV.
Im Sorry,"Mhmmm, Magnum P.I. reboot is pretty dumb. I saw the first ep and walked away. Space jump into North Korea?! *rolls eyes*"
Im Sorry,"The winner of Worst Network TV Show of all time has to go to the 1990 series ""Cop Rock"". A musical police series that left viewers bewildered"
Im Sorry,Oh CBS this is what happens when you can amazing shows like person of interest.
Im Sorry,Bull was one of the worst shows I've ever seen.  Thought it would be canceled midway through the first season. Can't believe it's still on the air.
Im Sorry,"I generally liked S1 - although I would not call it ""great"" TV.  I have been recording S2 although I stopped watching it about 10 episodes ago.  I may watch more over the summer.  If not, I will delete my recordings and forget about it."
Im Sorry,"CNN Tonight with Don Lemon is still on, so...

No? "
Im Sorry,"I haven't seen it, and Bull may well be the worst of the bunch, but your description of it pretty much sums up why I avoid the major network channel dramas in general."
Im Sorry,It’s still on?
Im Sorry,"In all honesty, I never really expect CBS to put out that much intelligent TV, and usually skip over them every season. Not all of them though, because I’ve heard good things about Criminal Minds and The Good Wife, but never watched them, so I’m not saying one thing or another about them. I’ll admit I’ve also thought about getting All-Access for Discovery, but that’s it. They literally only air multi-cam comedies with laugh tracks, procedurals and reality. There’s so little variety to them compared to other networks. 

My parents watch a lot of what’s on CBS, and I always feel dumber after watching it. Going off my parents, it was so weird watching it with them this last time, because my dad turned on some show and said, “I hate can laughter,” and I just said, “But Big Bang Theory is one of your favorite shows?” He literally replied, “It doesn’t have can laughter in it.” He then turned it on and just said, “Oh shit, it does! I never noticed it.” I then told him to tune out the laughter and pay attention to what’s going on. He’s been watching it less and less since, which I feel bad for ruining it, because that wasn’t my intent. I feel that there’s something about their shows that really do make the audience tune out their mind and ignore things like that. I’m not saying it’s all bad, I’m just saying I feel like it has so little variety and so little quality when compared to NBC or FOX."
Im Sorry,"No, Sean Hannity's show is. Have a nice day. "
Im Sorry,Orville.
Im Sorry,It's why I watch Netflix. Some of the shows are just... they're just terrible. 
Im Sorry,I totally agree. What a load of crap. Worst show on telly at present by far.. It's so far fetched it's ridiculous...
Im Sorry,Is Scorpion the one where they tried to connect a laptop between an airplane and moving car? 
Im Sorry,"Oh come on, it was amusing, almost like a /r/iamverysmart come to life."
Im Sorry,"For those who missed it, the guy who ""inspired"" that shitshow made a pretty weird AMA back then: https://old.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2h5c7p/i_am_walter_obrien_the_inspiration_behind_the_cbs/?sort=qa"
Im Sorry,"Damn you, I think you may have me beat."
Im Sorry,I have that feeling when I watch The Flash.
Im Sorry,This show is stupid but what bothers me is the guy from American Pie and his silly hat. 
Im Sorry,Scorpion was fun regardless if it was accurate.
Im Sorry,"Holy fuck is Scorpion still on? I was into it for the first couple seasons but gave up when they launched a nuke down an abandoned mine shaft with little to no consequences. 

Did the head nerd ever get to bang the hot mom?"
Im Sorry,How is dead-by-trailer not a term?
Im Sorry,The Scorpion pilot is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. Watching it drunk after the Super Bowl with my roommate was kinda of fun though
Im Sorry,Yeah but isnt Scorpion for kids? 
Im Sorry,Easy he’s the star.  Fuller House can work without Becky. Bull can’t work without him and if they cancel early they have to pay put for a bunch of contracts. They will run out his contact and accept whatever profit they make until then. 
Im Sorry,He’s a man plain and simple
Im Sorry,">If you want a good lawyer show, watch ~~boston legal~~ Better Call Saul.

Better Call Saul"
Im Sorry,💯
Impractical Jokers,"Considering 90% (rough estimate) of TruTV’s programming is Impractical Jokers reruns, you know that they’re going to try to keep the gravy train rolling as long as possible. The show just won’t be the same without Joe."

Not sure how it works without him though."

Wish him the best"
Impractical Jokers,Damn he just did a Cameo for my wife which was amazing. He really put the time in to it and made it special. Wishing him and his family the best.
Impractical Jokers,Isn’t this show like the best possible job in TV for a family man. It’s largely shot in the NY area and mostly during the day time.
Impractical Jokers,I’ve loved this show for so long. When I was in the hospital a year ago for my depression I watched this everyday and it helped me a little. Gonna miss the jokers
Impractical Jokers,"Damn sad way to start the new year, I don't think it'll last more than another season unfortunately 😔"

Impractical Jokers,He had just posted a pic of his wife with a nice caption like 2 weeks ago. Oof. Wish them both all the best.
Impractical Jokers,"Jesus I just saw this on Twitter and thought he died with the way they worded it: ""Tragic News as Joe Gatto of Impractical Jokers Leaves Show"", accompanied by a black & white photo if Joe Gatto! What a way to phrase a headline, Twitter."
Impractical Jokers,"Damn, this really sucks. His joyous spirit is what gives the show life. He’d do anything but he was never cynical. If you look close I feel like you can see slight tension between the other jokers sometimes. Joe seemed like the glue. Hope they can carry on without him"
Impractical Jokers,2022 isnt starting off great
Impractical Jokers,Maybe it’s a punishment.
Impractical Jokers,"Damn, the show won't have the same feel without him. I hope they don't try to replace him. It will probably be good without him but not as good"
Impractical Jokers,Wow..this sucks. Been watching this show with my 8 year old throughout the pandemic. It’s provided some much needed laughs
Impractical Jokers,The show won't be the same without him.
Impractical Jokers,"Aw man this sucks. I'm not up to date, but have enjoyed watching these people do the show together.

Won't be the same without all 4 of them"
Impractical Jokers,Well there goes the shows funniest one.
Impractical Jokers,"Making Joe, tonights biggest loser."
Impractical Jokers,"Well 2022 is starting off a real downer, we lost Betty White and now Joe is leaving Impractical Jokers. He's my favorite out of the four and I really can't see the show working without any of them, hopefully I'm just being overly pessimistic and it will all work out."
Impractical Jokers,He can now focus full time on his Lakers coaching gig
Impractical Jokers,So 2022 is already ruined. Huh
Impractical Jokers,let them do guest hosts to give the show exciting flavor of the week fix and a couple years later once Joe remarries and the kids are older hell come back and the show will have that going for them
Impractical Jokers,"I'm genuinely surprised. He's the last of the four I'd have expected to leave. Sal has been trying comedy and touring pretty consistent. Murr has his writing and seems to be doing pretty well on his own. Q has his podcast and some other things going on too.

Besides being a family man with his (and his wife's) dog rescue it didn't seem like Joe really had a reason to leave. I guess that might be why. Maybe he just doesn't want to keep up with the insane filming schedule and touring while raising a family.

Also speaking of him and his dog rescue. I respect what he does but look at his social media, it's gotten insane with how many dogs they've adopted and keep in their home. They currently have like 9+ dogs in their house now. There's no way that can be mentally healthy for a husband/wife with two kids. 

Hopefully Joe, his ex and his kids come out okay from all of this."
Impractical Jokers,"I’ve been thinking it must be so hard now that they’re so famous they should do a game show style show. Get 4 contestants who are friends, the Jokers tell them what to say in the normal fashion. Whoever loses the friends work with the Jokers to decide the punishment"
Impractical Jokers,They may as well cancel the show. Joe is the funniest joker.
Impractical Jokers,"Gonna miss that man. During my worst depressive episode back in 2020, the first time I laughed in months was watching Impractical Jokers one night. The challenge was the guys were waiters and had to get people to come to the basement of this restaurant. Joe’s excuse was “We got a dog hooked up to a lie detector test.” And I nearly pissed myself."
Impractical Jokers,He's pulling a Rick Moranis!
Impractical Jokers,I think Chris distefano would be pretty entertaining as a joker but we haven’t seen it yet so there’s no way of knowing
Impractical Jokers,"Sad to hear. Has to be a rough decision. I don't know what that split is like but I could imagine a desire to put one's focus and head into work to cope, to keep the mind busy. The combination is a big life change (not that either is easy I imagine), and I hope it works out for Joe.

Joe was certainly unique for his willingness to commit to the bit. Other cast members frequently choked out their fed lines through giggles and cringe but Joe took many on as a new character to play.

I think Joe balanced the show out in that way. Every time you thought, ""that line they fed wasn't that bad, I would have easily done/said that,"" you were really just waiting for Joe. Kind of a release, like.... Comedy relief in a way. 

Good luck Gatto"
Impractical Jokers,"I noticed Q, Sal, and Murr’s statement didn’t mention anything about respecting his decision, he has our support, etc. 

Wonder if they’re pissed at him."
Impractical Jokers,Well 10 years isn’t a bad run for a tv show. Hope everything goes well with Joe.
Impractical Jokers,What a bummer! I love the chemistry and friendship these guys have. I will continue to be a big fan and wish Joe all the best in his life.
Impractical Jokers,"2021 is the worst year in ages 

Nothing but bad shit and endings to good things"
Impractical Jokers,I literally teared up when I found out Joe was leaving the show :(
Impractical Jokers,"I hope they just stop it now. They’ve had like 10 great seasons I think, and it this point it’s a lot more difficult to make challenges because so many people recognize them. It’s still funny but it’s not hard to observe the show has gotten slightly worse with each of the past 3 seasons. It’s still funny, and they should just cut it off now while the show still has a good reputation"
Impractical Jokers,Damn they're taking the punishments far these days
Impractical Jokers,"I felt like the show ended when Covid hit.  Lots of their bits involve interacting directly with people and with social distancing, health restrictions, etc it would have been harder to film anything new for a while.

Joe was def my favorite as he had no shame and seemed to embrace every bad thing thrown at him.  Perhaps it's time to end it since many of the guys seem to do more touring now anyways"
Impractical Jokers,Joe was the funniest of the four and willing to say/do anything for a prank. This is definitely going to hurt the franchise. Hopefully he and his family work things out and he can make a return to the show.
Impractical Jokers,So Him and his wife break up so he leaves his show?
Impractical Jokers,"This random but probably the only time I can bring this up.

I was at a Will Smith book event in Brooklyn back in November. I kept joking with my friend “what if I bump into Joe” cause I saw he was planning on going to the event on instagram.So right when I’m walking in, he walks next to me, I complement his jacket, he goes thanks and carries on. Now I had my suspicion cause it sounded like him, but he had a mask on so I wasn’t sure.

About 10 minutes later, I see him again, we accidentally bump into each other walking opposite ways and I have a brain fart, going “hey, are u famous?”. Joe goes “no”, laughs really hard, then walks away. Honestly seemed like a Joe thing to do so at that point I was pretty sure it was him. Shit was hilarious regardless.

My suspicion went even higher when I realized he was a few rows behind me, but I didn’t want to bother him and I had my own thing going on.A few hours later he posts himself at the event, so I was right the whole time. I practically got pranked. So lesson learned, never double check yourself.

Anyways he's my favorite joker and my father and I have bonding moments watching the show and their standup so this is a huge blow for me, but I highly respect his decision to take care of his family and maybe he'll come back in the future."
Impractical Jokers,"Chrissy ""i need to pay for my house i thought Bitcoin would pay for"" D  steps in. Bet."
Impractical Jokers,I hope this can be taken at face value. I love Joe. But something in this smacks of him getting ahead of something that’s coming out. How do they continue though. New format?
Impractical Jokers,"Ah that’s too bad, he’s my favorite. Hopefully everything will be ok for him with whatever he’s dealing with."
Impractical Jokers,This makes me so sad. He’s hands down my favorite joker 😭
Impractical Jokers,"I worked with Murr’s cousin 8 years ago at a snackbar, AMA."
Impractical Jokers,Joe's reaction when Sal first saw his Jaden Smith tattoo is one of my favorite TV moments of all time
Impractical Jokers,Well that's the end of Impractical Jokers then. I don't see how or why they'd continue without Joe
Impractical Jokers,Bruhhhh
Impractical Jokers,“I’m the beef”
Impractical Jokers,Joe just lost a challenge and had to write that post!
Impractical Jokers,😭😭😭
Impractical Jokers,Can't wait to see what challenge he lost to have to do this!
Impractical Jokers,"Well, they need to bring on a Shemp. Gonna miss Joe."
Impractical Jokers,*sad nom nom*
Impractical Jokers,"Fuck…. That sucks… it’s understandable though, but man it sucks…"
Impractical Jokers,"incredibly sad, he is not replaceable, but I hope they try with Rob or Roy emmer"
Impractical Jokers,“Sometimes I peeps when I toot toot”
Impractical Jokers,Noooooo :(
Impractical Jokers,"LARRY!? 

Gonna miss Joe, but best to him and his family."
Impractical Jokers,"Joe is also a producer on the show, and I get the impression that he was the comedy backbone of the whole enterprise. I don’t think it’s going to work as well without him. 

And replacing him is impossible, as half of the joy of the show is these guys being lifelong friends. You can’t just put some stand-up comedian buddy out there. For that reason I expect the format to change considerably."
Impractical Jokers,Dah-na na na but sad
Impractical Jokers,Joe was easily the funniest of the bunch. He dived into his characters without fear. Gunna miss him!!
Impractical Jokers,What really happened? Infidelity? A new boyfriend or girlfriend? Hopefully he had a prenup…
Impractical Jokers,"When my wife was suffering with ALS we would watch this show and laugh. Night after night. I’m thankful the show was given a chance and put on air. I know a lot of the vision came from Joe. Wishing him and his family good fortune. Maybe that guy Rob Emmer can get some more airtime now, hopefully they do a revolving joker each episode. Also pulling for Roy Emmer to finally get his shot too. Lol"
Impractical Jokers,Not going to work without him
Impractical Jokers,"My guess is they will keep it going for now. Hopefully this is a temporary thing that Joe sorts out for a season or two. I can easily see them bringing in Joey Fatone to take his place or another comedian. Sal has been on tour non-stop and bringing in a new face may just be the shot in the arm the show needs going into the next season. No one can replace Joe, but having some new life will bring the show in a new direction. A new face is also good because the Jokers have all gained fame and become noticeable now by fans too. I wish Joe all the best in sorting things out but I doubt this is forever."
Impractical Jokers,"I've routinely worked around sports stars, politicians, and musicians in my career. NO ONE made me star-struck like seeing joe gatto in person. I was in Nashville for a buddy's bachelor party and I was completely annihilated...but out of the heavens, I saw a beam of light: it was joe casually walking on the busy downtown street with his wife. I was speechless. He asked for some privacy, as a few other people recognized him, and I respected that. 

I'll miss you Joe. I think I speak for all us when I say it feels like we've truly known them for years without even meeting them."
Impractical Jokers,They should not continue the show. Take some time off and see if there’s a chance joe comes back in 5 years or so.
Impractical Jokers,Damn he's the best one.
Impractical Jokers,"Scoopsie potata.....  


.....Scoopsie.....potata  


:'("
Impractical Jokers,Joe is the best joker
Impractical Jokers,"No Joe, No show."
Impractical Jokers,This is absolutely devastating to me. I love this show so much and it has helped me through so many tough moments with laughter. I hope for the best for Joe Gatto and his family. And possibly hope to see him return one day.
Impractical Jokers,Joe is literally the voice of the group. Wouldn't be the same without his yelps and screams.
Impractical Jokers,I'm sad to hear this. I would think he would want to continue working with the guys as a distraction and to add levity to his life. I could see why he wouldn't want to tour but I don't think he spends a whole lot of time working since they only seem to do like one season a year. and he works locally. Maybe being unemployed is a way to avoid paying child/spousal support.
Impractical Jokers,"Personally, I found Joe to be the least funny of the four, but this is still sad and the dynamic will be thrown off.  Hopefully they can continue without him, either with the 3 or promoting another crew member (frankly, might be a good idea to get new jokers in general just because it's getting harder for them to escape recognition)."
Impractical Jokers,"Give him a few months, he'll be back."
Impractical Jokers,not even 1 goddamned day into 2022
Impractical Jokers,I can’t see the jokers without Joe. This show has to be finishing up soon. Not everything can last forever
Impractical Jokers,No reason to watch anymore. Joe carried the show.
Impractical Jokers,"Well, that's a damn shame, because he was the funniest one.  Trash can sandwich is one of my favorite bits."
Impractical Jokers,[deleted]
Impractical Jokers,"I wonder if she cheated seeing as she was ""totally out of his league"" looks-wise.  He was obviously loaded with cash."
Impractical Jokers,"No, this is weird. There’s more to it. He did something awful I’m guessing."
Impractical Jokers,Prank?
Impractical Jokers,"Smart man, gonna get the divorce in as an unemployed man with $0 income, then once it's finalized he'll get his job back with twice his former pay."
Impractical Jokers,The only one i liked..
Impractical Jokers,Show sucks anyway
Impractical Jokers,I never watched that show then a now ex girlfriend put it on while we were at her parents house. We watched a marathon and it was actually pretty funny. I had totally forgotten about it til I saw this post I wonder if it’s on Netflix or peacock cause that’s what I got.
Impractical Jokers,Bessy would not only ruin bits on the show but I bet she is the one who ruined their marriage. Seemed like the world revolved around her.
Impractical Jokers,"I, for one, welcome the unfunny minority woman that will inevitably join the show."
Impractical Jokers,Was this show still going?
Impractical Jokers,Never heard of it
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Awesome, she deserves it. "
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Amanpour is very educated and def. deserves it, congrats"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Rory's gonna be thrilled
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I suppose that's better than when CNN was trying to make her the Anthony Bourdain of sex. Bleargh. 
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Watched the first ep of this. Really liked this. Does anyone know if this is on daily, or every other day? My DVR is saying there's not a new episode tonight, but there's a new one tomorrow night."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I like how when viewing the article with the window maximized on my ultrawide, her head gets cut off the image. If I resize the window to half the width of my screen she appears normally."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Really liked her in the documentary ""War Photographer""
"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"slot, hows the slot?"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,[deleted]
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Nah, she completely failed at all her dreams solely by being lazy, self-absorbed, and entitled. Despite being handed every golden opportunity you could hope for, she still wound up pregnant and alone. I think she’d take the news badly. "
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Wasn't that Lisa Ling?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"> Craig Melvin 

who?"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,She was probably too busy being self-absorbed to notice.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Mitchum Huntzberger's double take when she first turned down that internship offer might be my third favorite moment in that show after Luke's wedding cruise and ""she's in my house"" rants. Hate that his character really couldn't exist without that goofy family feud subplot."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Yes.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,[deleted]
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Travelers is a good time travel show
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Love this show so much.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"great show
always recommend it"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Someone must have never seen futurama
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I think Dark has something to say about this
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Good summer binge show
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,[deleted]
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Very nice
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Dude spoiler!
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Upgrade!
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Shame about *The Rig*.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Christiane Amanpour: Sex and Love Around the World,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Is this the only question he is asked by reporters?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Robert Pattinson gave the best summary of this situation…

>	I always say about people who do method acting, you only ever see people do the method when they’re playing a a–holes. You never see someone being lovely to everyone while they’re really deep in character."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"At this point, this ‘method beef’ story is starting to feel like marketing."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Cox:

>“He’s (Jessie Armstrong) very disciplined in that way, and also he’s very British in that way. The American inclination is to milk it for all it’s worth.”

>“I’ll miss the cast, I’ll miss the atmosphere, I’ll miss the bonhomie. Logan, probably, I’ll miss a bit. But upward and onwards.”


On Jeremy Strong:

>“I’m glad he is not in pain personally, he's a wonderful actor. It’s really a cultural clash. I don’t put up with all that American shit. I’m sorry. All that sort of ‘I think, therefore I feel.’”

>“Just do the job. Don’t identify.”"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"I like to think he does this as his own way of method acting to keep Jeremy/Kendall in character as hating Logan. But he's probably just an old grump, and that's fine too. He's earned it."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"He is aware that the king of method acting, Daniel Day-Lewis, is from London right?"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Daniel Day Lewis….."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"The majority of big-name actors who I’ve heard of doing this aren’t American, though…"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,He sounds cranky like his character anyway so method acting is sort of a moot point.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,DDL isnt American
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Brian Cox is a crusty old Scot and I FUCKING ADORE HIM.

""If you were my son, Mac, I wouldve *smothered* you by now!""  Fucking love him in Super Troopers 🤣🤣🤣"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Maybe my favorite anecdote from the New Yorker piece on Jeremy Strong is that Brian Cox once asked him why he behaved so oddly and insisted on avoiding the other members of the cast and doing all this method acting stuff etc. and Jeremy Strong basically said ""I don't know another way to embody and perform as this character"" and Brian Cox said ""....have you tried...acting?"""
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"They could all take a page out of Jason Alexander's book ""Acting Without Acting'."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Ironically, Brian Cox is currently engaging in method acting by being so vocal about how he hates what Jeremy Strong is doing."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"There’s more than one way to skin a cat. If getting your best performance is method - great! If it’s not - great? 

Do method actors annoy some people on set? Yep. At my job there’s plenty of people who annoy me - as long as they don’t keep me from doing my part though that’s not my problem"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,I think Brian Cox is a great actor but I wouldn’t ever want to spend any time with him. Absolutely annoying AF
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"I think that most American actors pursuing method acting **today** were probably inspired by the quite English Daniel Day-Lewis.

**Edit:** Added a word."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"“American shit?”, every method actor I know is British"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,How does he feel about actors talking shit in the press about their coworkers on a constant basis?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,His tendency to try to be shocking is just as tiresome as the media that keeps reporting it.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"This is the guy from super troopers, right ?"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Didn’t a Russian come up with method acting? How’s it American?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Heh. My brother is an asshole. He got cast as an asshole in the high school musical and tried to call it ""method acting"". heh."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Hmmm. Method acting? Didn't he play a rich guy in the show? Did he have to go on vacation for months to play a rich guy? Or is he already a rich guy? I could get used to that method acting.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Does he think Method Acting is exclusive to American actors?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"How is The Method which was invented by Stanislavsky in Russia an ""American shit""?"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Lol he put up with it for years to make money, so quite clearly he will put up with it. 

Sadly, the irony of he himself being a method actor asshole is lost on him."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,My dumbass thought Brian Cox (physicist) and was very confused
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Couldn’t he be considered a method actor himself? He always plays the same asshole.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Sounds like he's method acting a grumpy old man
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Isn't the most famous method actor in the world British?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Maybe he was in character when he answered? lol
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Isn't Daniel Day Lewis a big method actor?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Christian Bale is one of the most notorious method actor. And famously, not American"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"He used Daniel Day Lewis as an example of how shit method acting is, despite the fact that the man is English lol."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,The method acting stuff gets all the attention but I'm really here for his weed takes
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Daniel Day Lewis. English.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Method acting is Russian in origin.

And it's most famously used by Daniel Day-Lewis, an Englishman.

Dude sounds like an asshole. Seems like he just wants an excuse to bash Americans."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Does Mr. Cox know that Stanislavski was Russian lol
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,OMG! This notion that acting is hard.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Great pitchers are different. Some throw 100 mph fastballs, some throw 85 mph curveballs. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLSNgZNE-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLSNgZNE-Q)

Daniel Day-Lewis method acts and is the only actor I know that was heralded for his 1800's accent that is no longer spoken.

Brian Cox is an actor who can close his eyes and be in character. 

Doesn't mean one process makes a better actor."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,I’m sorry but I’m calling bullshit on Cox. He tolerated American Jeremy Strong method acting for 4 seasons of succession. So he apparently does put up with that “American shit”.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"This one time I directed a simple short film about a scientist who traveled back in time to save his wife, we all knew that the shirt film was cheesy but that’s why we made it. We found this one random actor through Facebook who was an interesting guy… he was also a “method actor”, so this whole time he wanted to keep the props (our take time machine) during shooting (even when the cameras were turned off) so he could remain in character. He also wanted to ask the cast to refer to him to the characters name all time and he almost hurt the other actress bc he was too much in his character. The funniest part was that during a crying scene he asked someone from production to go to the grocery store to buy onions cause he couldn’t feel the emotions. Crazy experience"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Honestly sounds like something Logan would say - maybe Cox is next-level method acting so deep he doesn’t even know it?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,He sounds like he’s method acting as Rupert Murdoch
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,What if he's the *ultimate* method actor and this is all so he can continue to hate Jeremy Strong's character?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,you mean to tell me Captain John O'Hagen was not method acting? my world has been shattered.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Ok but the most famous method actor was British, Brian (DDL)"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,And yet I'm still seeing him in dumb ass commercials...what's wrong Brian do you somehow not have ENOUGH money???
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,All I'll say is him and Jeremy strong have dynamite chemistry together so whatever drama they are trying to drum up is clearly working. Keep it up!
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"> ""Acting is about the exploration of character rather than simply a projection of self. I was in New York with Maggie Smith recently, promoting a film, and we were asked about the Sanford Meisner Method school of acting which is based on ruthless self-exploration. Maggie, in her unique way, said, 'Oh, we have that in England, too. We call it wanking.'""

Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,I’ll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet!
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,My take is that Jeremy Strong accomplished exactly what he wanted with his method acting.

Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,Isn’t method acting French?
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Like Robert Pattinson once said: actors who go method always do it when they’re playing crazy assholes. No one ever says, I’m being super nice because I’m method acting a kind person lmao."

Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,TIL Daniel Day-Lewis is American.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"First off, it's *Russian.*

Strasberg, Adler and Meisner might have made it popular in the States, but it was Stanislavski who created it.

But second, ***yeah, Mr. Cox, we can tell don't use it because you play the same character in every fucking thing you do.*** 

Meanwhile, Gary Oldman along with DDL are considered the best actors of your generation, so I guess that ""American shit"" has worked very well for them."
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Basically the guy who plays a jerk, is a jerk.  How is this not surprising?"
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,I wonder if Jeremy Strong is an asshole to others on set or if he just does something weird that Brian Cox doesn’t like? I’m sure there’s details in an interview somewhere but the rest of the cast all seem to get along fine with Jeremy so I think Brian just lets it bother him way too much.
Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Isn't the most famous method actor English? I'm talking about Mr. Learned to butcher meat, Czech speaking, touches his eye with a knife, dress maker, Daniel Day Lewis?"

Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Honestly, it sounds like Jeremy Strong had been getting on Brian Cox's (and others) nerves while filming.  I'd read the plan was originally 5 seasons (and is what HBO hoped for), but I'm guessing season 4 was a tough shoot and the creator just thought it was best to end it.  My worry is that this being the final season was announced months after season 4 filming ended, so I hope we get a proper ending."

Double Decker! Doug and Kirill,"Method acting the way people think of it today is not really a thing. All actors have their own process. If that includes some Stanislavski, Mizner, Adler, Chekov, etc.. great, but anyone that has studied any of the classic American acting philosophies will tell you that the “method actor” of today is not practicing a true school of thought."

Made in Mexico,Conan remote/travel segments are amazing. This will be great!

I take it that Conan will be travelling to Mexico very soon around late January, early February, and this won't come out until March 1st.

Same thing with Conan in Berlin, they were running commercials for that for almost a month.

I have a feeling that this one will be the craziest. Sure would be awesome if he took Triumph or had Smigel make a mexican equivalent with mustache and sombrero."

O'Reilly?

You can just quote them. That is not hard.

""He does not pay taxes and that makes him so smart, he does not need intelligence briefings"""
Made in Mexico,"Ya, but there is no value add in just quoting him, CNN does that! Comedians are supposed to add something to reality via exaggeration, and with Trump, it's very difficult because he is already intrinsically flanderized. "
Made in Mexico,"Really impressed with the twist on how the ""villain"" of the show was made. Loved that they try to be honest about how some people really do try to just follow a script and they don't try to cover up that fact but use it as part of the drama. I really enjoy the characters so far they are interesting to follow, and it shows another side of Mexico that isn't just the stereotypical ""poor people and drug cartels"" and actually show the beauty of Mexico City and how it is a modern city. That is perhaps my favorite part of it. That's not to say that the small village areas aren't beautiful, they are. But this shows a different side that perhaps not many people knew about Mexico. 

The arguments I've seen made against it are that the cast is too ""white"" but I don't think those people realize how diverse Mexico is. Not everyone in Mexico is short and brown. Brown people can come from light skin and dark skin parents, and light skinned Mexicans can also come from mixes of dark and light. Mexico was founded on this mixture of two worlds, between the remnants of colonials and of indigenous people. You don't call early white Americans ""British,"" they are part of being American. You can't erase history and say that any person with light skin is somehow not ""Mexican enough,"" if you look at their family tree you will see a mix. Same goes for the darker skinned Mexicans whom Americans tend to think are ""more Mexican"" than others. They probably have light skinned ancestors as well. They're all Mestizos, dont try to divide people just because their genes came out differently. It saddens me when I see Mestizos get defensive against their own Spanish heritage as if they themselves are just pure indigenous, because there are Mexicans who are actually still in their native tribes and still follow their indigenous traditions. You can't just try to erase part of your heritage to try to claim the ""minority"" group, because it is offensive to that minority group that actually experiences even more societal problems and poverty than the Mestizos. I feel like those people who criticize the color of the cast have never actually experienced how diverse Mexico is and are just getting angry because of the stereotypes they themselves hold against Mexicans. Just because this show exists doesn't mean it's ""erasing"" the class and colorism problems that Mexico faces, and it doesn't try to do that (in fact, the 'villain' is the one that tries to take advantage of that and create fake activism, and she is a villain because of those ignorant beliefs). This show is just showing a very small part of Mexico and of an even smaller culture of 1%, but I don't see how that has any bearing on anything else. The show is simply a reality tv show, same as the Kardashians. You wouldn't get angry at that show for not showing all types of Armenians. 

I'm kind of shocked people are that upset about that, since they will easily watch any other show on Netflix that has a full white cast and not bat an eye but suddenly this one doesn't fit their stereotype of what Mexicans look like and they get upset about representation, despite the fact that this IS a part of Mexico whether they like it or not. Yes it would be nice to have a show that shows more of the average working class people but there's no need to get so angry at a reality tv show for that. This is obviously aiming towards a certain audience, a lot of people don't like reality tv but some really enjoy it. It's not meant to be for ""everyone"" and it isn't trying to. Let people enjoy what they want. A lot of people have been vocal about their desire for a more ""representative"" show so hopefully Netflix will listen and do a show for that audience. But no need to get so up in arms because of a show that wasn't trying to target you to begin with. "
Made in Mexico,"Future guilty pleasure, check

Move over jersey shore reboot"
Made in Mexico,Just watched and episode and it’s very interesting. I didn’t know what to expect but interesting. Lots of glamour and beauty to far.
Made in Mexico,">The reality show “Made in Mexico” casts a light on Mexico City’s wealthy families and their opulent lifestyles as it trails nine socialites and the expats vying for a spot in their rarefied environment.

Color me a too sensitive American, but this seems awfully tone deaf. Then again, I don't watch much reality TV, so not exactly the target audience."
Made in Mexico,"Totally agree. This is just one part of Mexico and Mexicans, so what’s the issue? These people live (and most are from) in Mexico City. I guess it could have been named Made in Mexico City??
Does everyone realize while watching housewives of each city that those only represent tiny portions of those cities too."
Made in Mexico,"The colourism issue on the show is really important. In all of our big shows, movies, commercials, everything, all you see is white actors/models. That does not reflect the majority of Mexico and the rest of Latin America. It’s frustrating for us to see this, becausewe have so many problems with colourism in our societies that is a direct effect of  colonialism. The ideal look is a tall, thin, white person, with blonde hair and blue eyes. This is a ridiculous standard of beauty to present to a country that is mostly not white. 

There is a need to “get all up in arms” because this is a prevailing issue in our society. People with light skin get treated better, and have access to better jobs. 

The main target of this show was Mexicans and other Latino’s, and they did a terrible job with representation.

You wrote this huge essay on colourism and mestizaje, and while some of the things you have said are true, you have missed the entire point of what people are saying about the show and why we’re saying it. 


ETA: I do enjoy seeing my favourite parts of the city on the show. It is important that people have the ability to see Mexico in a different light. Mexico City deserves to be showcased. "
Made in Mexico,How do you mean? Is this not the exact same as those real housewives shows and Kardashian and those al9jg the same theme?
Made in Mexico,"I don't think the target audience of the show were Mexicans living in Mexico. There has been a lot of marketing in NYC. I think it is more to show foreigners a different side of Mexico instead of the same stereotypical narrative people like Trump and Hollywood try to show. Some foreigners might actually assume that all Mexicans look a certain way and are ""bad hombres"" but this show shows them a completely different side that they may have never seen before. For Mexicans who don't look the way the stereotypes make them out to be, it is a huge relief to see themselves represented, too. Of course colourism is an issue and we need more representation of all colors, but I find it vicious to see people say that light skinned Mexicans shouldn't be represented either when they also lack in representation in foreign media. You would never see complaints going the other way around, light skinned people would never be outraged to see their fellow darker skinned family be represented in the media, because any representation is a good thing. But inside Mexico of course there is a great need for more representation of darker skinned Mexicans and not just light skinned. But in the US or foreign markets where the image of ""Mexican"" is already ""brown person with a poncho and sombrero,"" I see no harm in showing other types of Mexicans as well. It is not strictly either-or, there can be a need for representation of both types depending on the context. "
Made in Mexico,"They were showcasing the fabulous rich life of DF's top 1%, which is predominantly white. I do agree about representation but that's what the upper class in Mexico looks like 🤷🏽‍♀️"
Made in Mexico,"You may be right. Again I'm don't watch much of this stuff. To me though, those two shows you mentioned sound more specific/have less direct ""aristocrats vie for status"" premises. I'm not saying they won't share major themes. But Real Housewives seems at least somewhat about the concept of being a housewife; it's what links the characters. And the Kardashians is a show about a family.

With this show, the only thing that appears to link these characters is their socioeconomic status, with the explicit premise of the show being, ""The reality show “Made in Mexico” casts a light on Mexico City’s wealthy families and their opulent lifestyles as it trails nine socialites and the expats **vying for a spot in their rarefied environment.""**

Now, I'm sure we have or had shows like that in the states. But in 2018 to launch something that explicit? And in Mexico of all places, who just elected AMLO?"
Made in Mexico,Most of the Housewives are not actual housewives. Those shows are ALL about their status.
Made in Mexico,Was looking to something to learn some spanish on. I applaud you for bringing this to my attention

Conan O'Brien is a talk show host who:

* went on a cross-country tour after he was fired
* is willing to host an anti-Scientology advocate guest
* has appeared in a NC-17 movie
* hosts a widely popular segment in the cutthroat world of video game reviews by feigning/demonstrating ignorance
* dealt with the 2008 writers' strike by starting a banterless feud with John Stewart and Stephen Colbert
* according to Andy Richter, wanted to continue doing the show after he suffered an on-air concussion during a footrace with Teri Hatcher
* and has now completed a monologue in a second language

You have to click on each video individually but it seems like it's a full episode. No ads either. This along with Conan's AMA has made me remember why he's one of my favorite comedians of all time."
Made in Mexico,I was just thinking to myself that we could really use more tv shows about spoiled rich people. 
Made in Mexico,Really won’t be any different than the vapidness of US socialites. 
Made in Mexico,"When Mexico sends its tv shows, they’re not sending their best"
Made in Mexico,Pero por que?
Made in Mexico,"They're sending shows that have a lot of problems...They're bringing crime.  They're rapists.  And some, I assume, are good shows."
Made in Mexico,"Dear FrankOcean2 - thank you so much for your incredibly kind message. Your note perfectly reflects the sensitive and generous spirit of all the Mexican people I met during my visit last week. I spoke with thousands of Mexicans over a seven day period, and to a person they were funny, wise, and eager to hug a clueless, skinny gringo. It's true that my team and I did make the trip, but the credit for our show goes to you and the people of your great country. My favorite part of this project was that it was a real collaboration between new friends from different cultures, and I am prouder of this hour of television than anything I've worked on since I began my curious career in 1985. I have many questions -- mostly about your obsession with Frank Ocean -- but I wanted you to know that your letter means a lot to me and to everyone at our show. I will make it back to your city soon, but until then ---- Viva Mexico!

Su amigo,
Conando​"
Made in Mexico,[deleted]
Made in Mexico,Am white.  Wife is Mexican.  Inlaws are the best.  No joke.
Made in Mexico,"That was beautiful. Conan, I think, is the best late night show host."
Made in Mexico,"You could tell from the way Diego Luna acted that he *really* appreciated Conan making the trip. 

It's funny...I think a good portion of Americans think of Mexico as some sort of lawless third-world country. Even seeing skyscrapers on the backdrop of the set does a lot of help change that perception--to say nothing of Conan out on the street, hanging out with Mexicans who are (surprise!) just a bunch of regular people. "
Made in Mexico,"[Conan touched on a lot of your points in this interview](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/03/01/conan-relocates-to-mexico-for-a-special-episode-lead-obrien.cnn). It's sad that our politics and headlines are creating this divide between the US and Mexico because we share so much. 

Serious props to Conan for this episode. Not only was it hilarious but I really think he accomplished his goal of making Mexico the star. He even apparently hired an all Mexican crew, which could not have been easy logistically. He touched on all the stereotypical Mexican things like lucha and telenovelas but in the genuine, silly Conan way. And to top it all off he had one of the best AMAs of all time. Viva Conando."
Made in Mexico,"If it helps you, I just saw these people as average Mexicans even before you said that you thought it was a good representation. I don't have any bad feeling about Mexico nor Mexicans. "
Made in Mexico,Mexicans can take a joke a lot better than the French. 
Made in Mexico,"His remotes are so funny, and somehow you learn something useful from it"
Made in Mexico,[deleted]
Made in Mexico,Is there a link to this?
Made in Mexico,You had me at Thundercats.  
Made in Mexico,I was in Texas a few years ago and the Mexican people I lived and worked with were some of the most polite and friendly people I have ever met. I have made lifelong friends with those people.
Made in Mexico,"And I feel represented because not the majority of us Americans dislike Mexicans. Conan really conveyed that on his visit. The majority of us love *all* people, as you can see from our many protests. We care about you guys back! Thank you for this letter."
Made in Mexico,"Conan's the best! Been watching him for 25 years 

As to all of you that's pro wall, [please watch this ](https://youtu.be/K_P9PR5ckFk) "
Made in Mexico,"Conan puts on a good public front, but it doesn't excuse the wall of masturbating bears he's proposed arousing to keep Canadians out."
Made in Mexico,"I visited Aguascalientes and Zacatecas Mexico a few years back and found almost every single person I met to be super friendly and happy and so, so giving. A very family-centric culture existed from the poorest to the most affluent. Loved every minute."
Made in Mexico,"What a nice post. 

I'm guessing that was part of Conans reason for going, to remind people from both of our countries that we have long been allies and friends. I hope the Mexican people realize that not all Americans agree with Trump about immigration and the Wall, in fact many of us are pretty mad and never forget Trump lost the popular vote. 

I really liked the guy who put his middle finger into Conans wall donation box.

Edit: I see the Donald users have found this post... I will reiterate they don't reflect all of us. But often they're the loudest :/"
Made in Mexico,Thundercats bringing people together after all these years! Honestly this was pretty beautiful
Made in Mexico,¡Viva México!
Made in Mexico,"I happened to be looking at a map of Mexico while delivering beer to a Mexican restaurant yesterday. Was trying to imagine what each major city would be like. Then I realized all I could conjure up were images similar to what I've seen in movies. Dirty, poor, high crime rate, white people not welcome, drugs, etc. Made me sick to think that was my default perception of an entire country. An allied neighbor country at that. I just reminded myself that Mexico isn't so different from the US and that the people are just like us, even if I haven't witnessed it through reality or media, I have to believe that's true. "
Made in Mexico,Couldn't agree more. He is an excellent microbiologist.
Made in Mexico,"Yea, empathy for people who aren't exactly like you or look like you is a challenge for people from a certain end of the political spectrum in the USA.  "
Oh My Ghost,"While it has all the fundamentals of Dark, i dont think this show quite captured the “spark” that Dark was so famous for. Too many one dimensional characters for my liking, so above average at best."
Oh My Ghost,"Dark just copied that Ethan Hawke movie ""Predestination"""
Oh My Ghost,"I’m a big fan of Dark, so I’ve started this but after watching 2 episodes I have to admit it hasn’t really grabbed me yet, I’ll give it one more episode, but tbh I’m just about ready to tap out."
Oh My Ghost,"Would be interesting to see how it performs for people who have NOT seen Dark think that is likely the most important thing.       

Lot of Dark fans will likely watch it even if they dont think its good"
Oh My Ghost,"This show has a much longer slow burn than Dark S1, because Dark’s premise started immediately (time travel). You don’t even get to anywhere near the premise until episode 5 or 6."
Oh My Ghost,"It feels like they spent more time setting up the mysteries than actually creating intriguing characters, everything feels very storyboarded and stiff. But I’m also only on episode two so will watch at least four before I make a judgement. I like all the actors enough and the setting is fantastic. I just wish they could draw me into the atmosphere more, it feels like everything is just place to place with nice outside shots and then people meeting and having mysterious conversations."
Oh My Ghost,"I didn't see Dark (though now I want to watch it). I LOVED the earlier 1899 eps, but the ending is falling flat for me (I'm in the middle of the final ep now... and as you can see I'm on Reddit on my second monitor). 

I really don't like the twists that came in the latter half (even though they're being explained in this final ep), I wish we knew a lot LOT LOT more about the characters, and the pacing just seems to be totally off. It feels almost as if the entire Lost, all the seasons, were packed into 8 eps."
Oh My Ghost,"Not sure if you would prefer, but the NFL app is also showing it for free. No subscription required."
Oh My Ghost,I find CBS looks really rough when coming through my Fios box but on Paramount Plus the game will look nice and sharp.
Oh My Ghost,"Fox will broadcast in 4k though, which only ABC will also do."
Oh My Ghost,"Ha, always look forward to FOX having it since they’re the only ones who bother to do it in 4K (upscale, but looks way better than broadcast 1080i).

Give it a shot - as long as you’ve got the Fox Sports app and a fast enough connection you’re good to go. No cable login needed."
Oh My Ghost,"I'm just glad it's not on NBC.  I'm a YouTube TV customer and in my area, every time SNF would have a replay where they were using the telestrator/video marker, the feed would drop for 1-5 seconds.  I opened a ticket with YouTube TV, but they couldn't resolve it.

With Fox, I have noticed that they seem to always have 1 or 2 cameras that are shooting SD quality.  Not sure if it's a camera issue, signal issue, or broadcasting/transmission issue."
Oh My Ghost,I think many people forget about antennas. OTA TV is broadcast in HD as far as I know. Whenever I watch local channels it's crystal clear.
Oh My Ghost,"What, you don’t like the big dancing battle robot?"
Oh My Ghost,Really? I hate CBS because their games have a weird grey tint and seem to go an hour longer than usual.
Oh My Ghost,Fox and NBC do the best coverage.
Oh My Ghost,20 years in broadcast distribution here. All these 4k comments are funny. Broadcast is not 4k.
Oh My Ghost,I just wish they'd kick-off a few hours earlier so we can watch it in the UK without having to stay up half the night zzz :)
Oh My Ghost,"It sounds like your local affiliate, not Fox themselves. My local ABC station is pretty low budget and still broadcast at 720p, and the difference between them and other stations, all doing 1080p in my market, is noticeable."
Oh My Ghost,"The audio on Fox sounds so different than any other network, it lacks … depth? Bass? The stadium is mic’ed in a manner so cheering sounds hollow and disembodied. The mix is off as well: announcer overlay volume sounds too loud,  game sounds too quiet, fans too quiet. Been watching football on Fox since Fox has had football and it has always been hard to watch a game on fox because it sounds so different. I really enjoy the sound of NBC Sunday night football the most (It was perfect until they replaced Al Michael’s big game voice with Mike Tirico’s ESPN higher pitch. Regardless of how they call the game, Michael’s has a fuller voice). As I’m typing this all out I slowly am realizing my thoughts on this are probably really weird!

Am I crazy? Do I have some weird Audio thing that I’ve completely made up in my head?"
Oh My Ghost,"YouTube tv has it in 4K hdr. Idk if it’s real, but damn it looks really good. Way better than the 1080i or 720p"
Oh My Ghost,Fox Sports app has removed restrictions for today only so ANYONE can watch the game for FREE as long as they have internet and a device that they can download the app to.
Oh My Ghost,There's always the puppy bowl.
Oh My Ghost,Fox has the best coverage on the Super Bowl. They have been for years.
Oh My Ghost,fox is the only network that has shown the superbowl in 4k.  This is the second time they will
Oh My Ghost,You could watch a British one with a VPN.
Oh My Ghost,What you talking about mate.. BBC showing it? Lol
Oh My Ghost,"I've been reading comments and with all the streaming apps that exist nowadays, TV shouldn't be the reason why some broadcasts look horrible. They need to do something to finally take this to the next level when you see European sports that are Broadcasted in 4k they look and sound so crisp its beautiful. The fifa WC feed for example looked so good and makes you wonder why sports that costs billions like NFL or NBA can't make the final step to finally improve. Some feeds aren't even in 1080p and that's pathetic."
Oh My Ghost,Thats why my family just gathers around the AM radio for the super bowl
Oh My Ghost,"I agree 100%. Fox compression is terrible, and most games on it look terrible."
Oh My Ghost,Denver is the same. Fox looks like they’re using technology that’s a decade older than everyone else around here. It’s awful. Even the colors are off.
Oh My Ghost,Announcers are terrible on fox too
Oh My Ghost,I like how over the air Fox in the Atlanta area worked perfectly fine all day long UNTIL the Super Bowl came on and then it looks as fuzzy as late night 90’s Cinemax. They have to lower the broadcast range for the game because the commercials are clear as can be.
Oh My Ghost,It's means no Bob's Burgers.
Oh My Ghost,I tried but their stream is ass.
Oh My Ghost,They also talked about how rupert murdoch and elon musk are tech geniuses leading to the future or some fucking shit live during the game. Fucking scum
Oh My Ghost,They are the only network doing 4K broadcasts which are noticeably higher quality than the other networks 1080 broadcasts. Would recommend upgrading your equipment to take advantage of the 4K stream if you are having issues.
Oh My Ghost,Last year NBC had it and stuck it behind a paywall.
Oh My Ghost,"Disagree. Fox has the best graphics in my opinion. I can't STAND the CBS packages. NBC is just blah to me.

If the robot mascot doesn't make an appearance I will riot though."
Oh My Ghost,"Plus we have to see ads for the fucking bastards over at Fox News, along with the ones paid for by that Christian anti-LGBT/womens right hate group... ""He Gets Us"""
Oh My Ghost,Yeah I don't watch Fox on principal. They are the originators of modern reactionary media.
Oh My Ghost,Idc if they show “the big game” on Lifetime. As long as I don’t have to listen to Adam archuleta on color
Oh My Ghost,I solved the problem of having to watch the super bowl on Fox. I don't watch it at all.
Oh My Ghost,Watch on the Fox Sports app. It will be 1080p or 4K depending on your setup.
Oh My Ghost,Let’s just be thankful there is no Tony Romo today.
Oh My Ghost,My Fox comes in perfect! Maybe move
Oh My Ghost,Meh I can’t notice any difference
Oh My Ghost,"Dafuq.  Looks perfect to me. Upgrade your equipment and speed? I downloaded the FOX Now app right before the game. Will delete after though, lol."
Oh My Ghost,"Just think, not even 20 years ago the broadcast looked like it was 1980s quality. Now, if it isn’t looking like 5K HD Ooba Looba Ding Dong quality  and you can’t make out the start of whiskers on the players y’all whine the quality isn’t good enough. Good lord."
Oh My Ghost,"I just can’t stand Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, they’re so fucking boring."
Oh My Ghost,"FOX is owned and run by such garbage ruinous anti Democracy MAGAts, I hate watching anything on any of their branded networks.  The only thing I watch on any FOX network is football, since there is no other choice, but when I've got one, they don't get my eyeballs."
Oh My Ghost,Don’t blame the network for your shitty local station.
Oh My Ghost,1st world probs.
Oh My Ghost,"Where can I watch if, hypothetically, I don’t wanna pay?"
Oh My Ghost,"The worst part is we have to listen to Greg Olsen’s annoyingly smug voice.

I wish it was on CBS where we get to listen to Nantz and Romo"
Oh My Ghost,"I remember back when fox started carrying the Super Bowl, what seems like every other year, I would always ask a buddy who kept with it more than I did what network had the Super Bowl. If it happened to be on fox he’d just look at me and do some exaggerated fox sports sound effect with his mouth. Followed by me saying, that’s what makes my hangover worse the next day, drinking enough alcohol to get through the broadcast without losing it."
Oh My Ghost,I’ve been saying this for years lol. Almost all of my Vikings games are on fox and I’m like “dammit I wish it was on cbs” lol
Oh My Ghost,FOX sucks!!
Oh My Ghost,Watching the end of the game...it seems the audio drops and comes back over and over again. Is it my setup? Is anybody else hearing this? What's going on?
Oh My Ghost,NBC is the best. Crystal clear
Oh My Ghost,"I hate Fox mostly because their commentary fucking sucks, even now they've replaced Joe Fuck and Potato Head."
Oh My Ghost,It's all shit dude. Owned by the same 4 guys.
Oh My Ghost,"It's in 4K, so that's how I'm watching it. Thank you Fox!"
Oh My Ghost,I wish it was on Saturday and also at night time. Last year's halftime show was epic but it felt like I was watching a rehearsal with it being in daylight. Felt weird.
Oh My Ghost,God I love Fox.
Oh My Ghost,If it's on FOX why isn't it on MSNBC?
Oh My Ghost,"It should always be Buck and Aikman, regardless of what network or brand they are employed by. They’re the best broadcast duo in the NFL."
Oh My Ghost,"It’s a you problem, Fox looks the best and they do 4K."
Oh My Ghost,Although they are saying it’s 4K this year I believe it’s just upscale 1080P. Still will look better than most other things down the same pipe.
Oh My Ghost,"Happy for Burkhardt and Olsen, a fantastic team all year, but yeah, the Fox presentation is always in the uncanny valley to me. Overly sanitized and looks like if an AI art program was told to run an NFL broadcast. CBS is still the gold standard"
Oh My Ghost,"As long as it looks better than my illegal streams during the season to watch the Ravens, I'm fine with it. Can't be worse than having to refresh every 10-30 minutes and click out of 5 ads"
Oh My Ghost,NBC has an awful audio delay.
Oh My Ghost,"I prefer FOX over CBS. CBS always looks like the worst quality compared to FOX, NBC, Prime and ESPN. It seems that way to me anyway when I'm watching RedZone and they bounce between CBS and FOX for eight hours of commercial free football.

Honestly though I'm just happy I get to hear KB call the game. As a Mets fan I'm stoked for the guy."
Oh My Ghost,Fox is broadcasting in 4K
Oh My Ghost,"I have verizon fios, and fox has it on the fox 4k channel. I have watched other sports in 4k, and no idea if it true 4k, but it definitely looks much better than the regular chanel"
Oh My Ghost,Stream it with the Fox Sports App.  Much higher quality (4k if your TV does it).
Oh My Ghost,For those who want to know why they aren’t  more sports or networks that broadcast in 4K this video might be helpful https://youtu.be/UX75uEq9IdU
Oh My Ghost,Fox has the best sound mix as far as bringing in the crowd noise.
Oh My Ghost,"You can wish in one hand and crap in the other, see which gets filled first."
Oh My Ghost,Now that you mention it you are right lol how is that so?
Oh My Ghost,"I usually like Fox doing the Super Bowl, but no Troy Aikman and Joe Buck at Fox makes it less good."
Oh My Ghost,"I Wanted To See Someone Post The WHOLE ENITRE Super Bowl On Youtube, So That Way I Won't Have To Watch It On Fox. If So, Is There A Link On Youtube For The Super Bowl?"
Oh My Ghost,Here in Sioux Falls it’s our NBC affiliate that suffers from the problems you’ve described. Sunday Night Football is almost unwatchable. I’ve talked to people in the industry who say it’s due to the secondary channels that the affiliate also broadcasts that eats up the bandwidth.
Oh My Ghost,The picture quality isn’t the issue for me.  It’s the crappy Fox announcers (yes I think Joe Buck and Troy are  far superior to whoever these guys are)And we’ll also have to put up with the shots of various Fox tv series actors sitting in the stands pretending they are there because they care about the game.
Oh My Ghost,Use the fox sports app. It will look great
Oh My Ghost,Just watch via the fox sports app. It looks great.
Oh My Ghost,It used to be on BBC one In my country no ad breaks now it's on itv and for some reason sky at the same time
Oh My Ghost,I prefer fox broadcasts but i guess it's just what I'm used to
Oh My Ghost,Probably something on your end. This isn't true for everyone.
Oh My Ghost,Completely disagree. CBS looks like shit and fox is consistently the best.
Oh My Ghost,They gotta use all their high tech $ trying to make Sean Hannity look good.
Oh My Ghost,"I get the four major networks on my antenna. NBC, ABC, and CBS all broadcast at 1080, FOX is still at 720."
Oh My Ghost,"I think Fox looks the best 🤷‍♂️ 

NBC has the best overall presentation though. CBS looks outdated. ABC/ESPN is mid."
Oh My Ghost,I think the replays on SNF and TNF are the best
Oh My Ghost,FOX is the only network that broadcasts in 4K for the Superbowl.  So happy for that.
Oh My Ghost,"Fox on antenna works perfect *until* there is a big football (either type) or baseball game on here in the Tampa market. Garbage talk shows and infomercials come through crystal clear all day, but the moment that whistle blows it's pixelated or the signal drops completely. NFL, NCAA, World Cup, World Series- all of them. I watched the Univision coverage of the World Cup on Peacock.

Free Fubo trial for the Superbowl today, maybe another service trial in 4 years with a different email address, who knows. What's frustrating is almost all of the networks broadcast from the same antenna array here in the Tampa Bay area and my antenna is aimed in that direction. Every other channel works fine, it's just Fox and just during games."
Oh My Ghost,I am down with fox because they have Terry Bradshaw and I love that man
Oh My Ghost,"At this very moment, sound isn’t synced with mouth movements."
Oh My Ghost,Maybe your antenna has an obstruction.
Oh My Ghost,"Last year, the hotel offered to install an antenna in the rooms because the satellite was garbage. It was crystal clear 1080 with bunny ears."

I've seen directors say they omit subtitles in some scenes where they want the audience to be as clueless (vulnerable, confused, whatever) as the character.

Maniac,"I'd like to know what hack directors say that so I can *not* watch what they make.

Maybe what else you said is a factor though."
Maniac,"> what hack directors 

Steven Spielberg for one..."
Maniac,I'll shut up now.
Maniac,"Absolutely loved it when it came out, great performances and visually interesting. One of Jonah hills best 

Weird of Netflix’s part, they advertised it for about a week and then it got completely buried. It never turned up when scrolling. I actually thought they had gotten rid of it until I manually searched it."
Maniac,"This show was the *talk of the town* when it first came out. On here, on twitter etc. Then.... *crickets*! I don't think I've ever seen the buzz die for a series so quickly. It's like a week after it premiered the internet was done with it."
Maniac,"Annie!  It's me, Owen, as a hawk!!!"
Maniac,"Terrific show.  I still think about it a lot.  The Utangatta episode might be my favorite.  I'll say, Hill gets a lot of praise here for it (and Stone is fantastic) but I loved what Justin Theroux did in this show.  I also thought Billy Magnussen did great work with not too much material."
Maniac,"After The Leftovers, Maniac and Station Eleven I’ll watch anything Patrick Somerville does"
Maniac,Man it was one hell of a trip binge watching it on shrooms. Very under appreciated and underrated show
Maniac,I was really excited for it when it came out but it didn't grab me when I watched it and I had to force myself to finish. It may have been that I wasn't in the right frame of mind. Might be worth giving it another shot.
Maniac,"Really loved it. Nothing else to contribute, it was great!"
Maniac,"I was Dr. Mantleray (Justin Theroux’s character) for Halloween the year it came out. 

No one got the costume, but I had fun anyway."
Maniac,"7.7 on IMDB  
84% on RT   
76 on Metacritic   
7.8 on Metacritic audience"
Maniac,Great show. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.
Maniac,"Yeah, great show. Re watch it when I can handle it."
Maniac,"Years ago I had heard about this show so I used my Google Home to start it. “Hey Google. Play Maniac from Netflix on the TV”. 

What I got was the original Norwegian series from 2015. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3714902/

After watching I forgot about this version and years later I looked it up again and finally watched it and thought it was great. 

TIL the Jonah Hill version was a remake of the Norwegian original. 🤦‍♂️"
Maniac,"Idk where exactly it ranks, but this is definitely one of my all time favorite limited series. It’s incredibly well executed and there are so many details that make rewatches fun and necessary to fully appreciate it."
Maniac,"I much preferred the original, though they have almost nothing in common."
Maniac,It’s a great show.  One of the best Netflix originals imo
Maniac,That's the thing I dislike about Netflix the most they have plenty of great shows but people just don't know about them because they don't advertise them well.
Maniac,They still promote shows better than Prime does
Maniac,Bill Hader mentioned this happening to friends when he talked about Barry Season 3. I wonder if the plot was based on Maniac.
Maniac,Because Netflix keeps pumping tons of movies and seasons all at once without space to breathe.
Maniac,like any other netflix series
Maniac,One of the issues of dropping all the episodes at once. Also it was huge on released but a lot of people didn’t really like it which imo it was a unique show that was overall kinda shallow and disappointing. Unfortunately fairly forgettable
Maniac,If you watch sports then they do advertise. I saw tons of Netflix commercials during last year nfl and nba seasons
Maniac,They’ll throw everything into their cash grabs or their nonsense reality shows and then shove them in your face for months but things like rrr had two days of front page showcase and then absolutely gotten rid of
Maniac,"I’ll agree to that any day!

When was the last time they showcased originals like  red oaks, comrade detectives or the tick??"
Maniac,"They are cramming in as much as possible with no thought about whether they should or if we want it 

We used to have bojack, bloodline, maniac, sense8, derek, house of cards and now we get fucking resident evil and selling sunset"
Maniac,"I think it's in large part due to dropping episodes all at once. There isn't week to week anticipation, water cooler chatter, it's a flash in the pan right now.

One episode a week also allows for people to get see what the fuss is about after hearing about it week over week. It's in the zeitgeist longer and makes for breaks between seasone (sometimes) shorter."
Maniac,"You also get Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy, Ozark, The Witcher etc"
Maniac,"Now we also get Borgen, Jeen Yus, Stranger Things, Umbrella Academy, Sea Beast, Juvenile Justice, DP, and yes, Selling Sunset (which I absolutely love...and Snowflake Mountain which was also very good). And they’ve just released a new Bill Burr special!"
Maniac,I Think You Should Leave
Maniac,"All very okay, I’ve enjoyed watching them but they’re not great"
Maniac,Yeah to be fair I think you should leave and aunty donna are both top tier
Maniac,"I hope this has a bit more care put into it then that previous animated series based on his shorts. 

His manga is so amazing but that show made them feel so bland and lifeless in their adaptation. It was basically like someone badly traced his work and added some lifeless colours for the sake of it. The animation was also lifeless and dull, it added nothing to the work. 

Hopefully this is not connected to that though and does his work justice. If not at least the uzumaki show looks great and is being run by the same guy who did the flowers of evil adaptation which had a great atmosphere and tone to it (and I really enjoyed the look though I understand it's controversial)"
Maniac,Where the heck is Adult Swim's version of Uzumaki?
Maniac,The hanging balloons! JUST HOOK IT TO MY VEINS!!
Maniac,"Will this include an adaptation of his by far scariest work, Junji Ito's Cat Diary?"
Maniac,"Hell yes. Tomie and Hanging Balloons are great. Personally not a big fan of the Souichi stories though, I think the character is mostly just annoying. But looking forward to this nevertheless!"
Maniac,"Oh man, The Hanging Balloons has one of my favourite Ito series of panels in it, so I can't wait.

Also it never ceases to amaze me how *normal* Junji Ito comes across in person. How can a guy like that come up with some of the best most fucked up horror stories of all time?"
Maniac,Has he released anything unique in the last 10 years? Last thing I remember from him is dissolving classroom back in 2014.
Maniac,"I'd tried a few of his mangas, and I just don't understand the appeal, and I must be alone in that because all of his books have 5star reviews from thousands of people.  I recently bought Remina, and it had to be one of the most poorly written book I can remember reading.  I'll still watch this anime, maybe the dialog will be better with voice acting."
Maniac,"Judging by how detailed and well done the model sheets are (using my animation experience here), I’m inclined to think this is going to be a good one.

Also for what it’s worth Netflix actually seems to put in the work when it comes to animated adaptations of big name mangakas so I’m not too worried. If it was live action though….we would be having problems."
Maniac,"I'm optimistic about this one since the previous series was a pretty major bomb and everyone knew it.

Uzumaki has been shown to have **dramatically** more effort behind it so I would hope that Ito's being a bit more hands on with making sure the Collection isn't repeated. This one's through netflix though so it can really go either way. Netflix can say all they want 'the creator was directly involved' and we all know they're lying through their teeth. Not to say they haven't put out a handful of good anime but their track record is inconsistent to say the least."
Maniac,It got pushed back to October 2022.
Maniac,"Read that manga during my winter holiday alone in my dorm, had to close my blinds and hide under the sheets after I was done. No balloons are gonna catch me slipping lol.

Love ito Junjis work, but man you have to be prepared sometimes."
Maniac,It's to Ito's credit that he can take a completely ridiculous basic concept like The Hanging Balloons and make something horrific out of it.
Maniac,Souichi stories are just for a different audience. Always seemed like kids stories where he gets his comeuppance for behaving badly and ends with him running away with nails in his butt.
Maniac,"In terms of english releases anyway, I believe Sensor was toward the end of last year. This year we have Liminal Zone and Black Paradox in fall/winter. So, new to english speaking markets for sure. However I'm not positive on whether he's still writing."
Maniac,"https://www.mangaupdates.com/author/44ljnuu/itou-junji

Looks like one online comic in 2020 and several releases in 2018 and years before that"
Maniac,"Pulling back a little, my concern is more with how netflix works with JP creators. We all heard many tales about how they worked hand in hand with Shinichirō Watanabe for the turd that was live action Cowboy Bebop, of course we all later learned that no one on set ever spoke to him."
Maniac,That's actually sooner than I thought it would be.
Maniac,I hear you. The first time i read The Enigma of Amigara Fault i woke up 3 times that night from nightmares.
Maniac,"I have no idea why you're getting downvoted, because this info is right. If anything, there's been more stuff from him getting released in English in the last few years than ever. And some of that stuff was even new in Japanese more recently than Dissolving Classroom, too."
Maniac,"It can still get pushed back again, so I'll only believe in that release date once it's aired."
Maniac,"""I've been blinded by my mother's toxic love!"""
Maniac,I would recommend Legion and DEVS for the visual aesthetics and world building as well.
Maniac,Justin Theroux is hilarious in this.
Maniac,"Always happy to see Maniac get mentioned.

I don't have too many all-time favorite shows. Breaking Bad/BCS, Game of Thrones (at least in its prime), Mr Robot, Dark, The Leftovers, The OA, and maybe even Utopia (UK).

Maniac is also one of them. Something about it... dense quality packed in to almost every aspect. It's fun, it's got some depth, and it's visually stunning. For a miniseries, I think it's perfect (which is different from flawless, as I don't think any story can be flawless, especially considering that many flaws are subjective. For me, a story can be perfect as long as it hits enough notes higher than most stories do)."
Maniac,"I absolutely loved it as well, it's one of my favourite shows.  
   
But the storytelling is very unique and I can definitely understand how it is not for everyone. It has an almost Twin Peaks level of weirdness. Visually, it is pretty much flawless."
Maniac,I wanted to like this so much more than I did. And I liked it. I just didn’t love it. But it certainly had moments of brilliance.
Maniac,That show is really fucking good.
Maniac,I particularly appreciated the way they represented schizophrenia
Maniac,Annie I'm a hawk
Maniac,The lemur episode is one of my favorite pieces of tv ever!
Maniac,"I feel like this show disappeared from the collective conscience very quickly, maybe because it was too off the wall. But I'm glad you reminded us to que it up for a rewatch."
Maniac,It’s the best thing Netflix has produced.
Maniac,"I didn’t like it at all. So much time is spent on the meta plots they go through after taking the pills that it became tediously pointless. 

Like, when they’re doing a murder mystery party or when they’re in the 80’s trying to steal an iguana, etc, all of that felt so tediously irrelevant and pointless that it made me not enjoy the show. The characters aren’t aware of who they are in the real world, so it felt like the plot and characters weren’t progressing for long periods of time. 

Just didn’t work for me. Justin Theroux was the best part though and I loved the first episode."
Maniac,"Check out station eleven when it comes out on Thursday, same show runner."
Maniac,"It's been a while since I have watched this show but I agree,it's a really good minisseries with a beautiful message."
Maniac,It was pretty good.
Maniac,Maniac is awesome!
Maniac,I'm still using that wake up ringtone after all these years! Great series!
Maniac,I really need to get a poster of this show.
Maniac,Loved Maniac. This post might inspire me to do a rewatch. The music has stuck with me through all the years.
Maniac,I watched it and thought it'd have a good payoff in the end but it was just zany and off-putting. Wasn't my cup of tea.
Maniac,"Really well written and yes, the world building was beautiful. Emma Stone knocked it out of the park and Justin Theroux was hilarious.

I thought Jonah Hill struggled a bit with the acting scenes. He’s not a great actor and he has kind of a turkey neck in this (not his fault but it distracted me). 

Everyone else really out-acted him and I felt sorry for him. Especially when he puts on a fake accent, it was too cringey for me."
Maniac,Seemed like a ripoff of Legion
Maniac,My GF started watching it and likes it a lot. I will give it a go.
Maniac,"I watched it, but I barely remember anything about it"
Maniac,"What's wrong with the world isn't that I'm sick....

It's that I don't matter."
Maniac,"It was a really good show.  Jonah Hill surprised me, because he was mostly annoying in everything else he’d been in.


I wish we’d get more"
Maniac,"Exceptional show, really liked it. Justin Theroux kills it, i watch everything he stars in since his performance in The Leftovers. Criminally underrated actor."
Maniac,Cheers for the heads up - a comedys with Jonah Hill rated 7.7 that Ive never heard of?  FUCK yeh - thats higher than Superbad!!
Maniac,Devs is brilliant and on par with Maniac in quality even though they’re very different thematically. Great rec.
Maniac,I really loved the first season of legion. Need to go back and finish the series
Maniac,I thought Legion supposedly jumped the shark or something? I haven't watched it tho
Maniac,"While this is obviously subjective, if something is comparable to Legion, I'm instantly & completely turned off and most likely won't give it a chance. 

Legion is basically the definition of style over substance. What a waste of time that show was."
Maniac,"I know this sub can get kinda annoying with all the Patriot-praise, but based on the shows that you mentioned I feel like you would probably love it."
Maniac,a couple others I would add are Halt & Catch Fire + You're the Worst
Maniac,I don’t have the same list but it’s a good list
Maniac,"Patrician taste, i think Mr. Robot does not get enough praise, especially the last season was  absolute top-tier. Leftovers is one-in-a-million, too, next to Six Feet Under the most human show i've ever watched, extremly talented cast as well."
Maniac,"Excellent list, I would say a few strong 10/10 you got there."
Maniac,"Oh wow, I adore *BB/BCS*, good *GoT*, *Mr Robot*, *Utopia UK* & *The Leftovers*. 

Guess I need to give *The OA* and *Dark* (and *Maniac*) a shot!"
Maniac,"Another Neflix show which I think fits in this general genre of shows is Russian Doll.  It's a show you really, really have to let get going.  You think it's going to be a very specific type of season for the first three episodes, but then it really takes things in a new and pretty great direction."
Maniac,Found this while I was searching Maniac. We have very similar favorite shows. Definitely check out Severance ASAP if you haven't had a chance.
Maniac,5 6 7 8
Maniac,"I prefer Dark between the two of them, but love both."
The Good Cop,"It’s because all of those things were already (somewhat well-known) idiomatic phrases in English. 

Even a quick google search shows me plenty of examples for each. “The good doctor” is sometimes used ironically, sometimes not, and has been for many years; “the good wife” had different origins but seems in the mid-20th century to have come to refer to the sort of model American wife; “good cop” is more common as it is used in the phrase “good cop/bad cop” so it isn’t quite as big of a stretch; “good place” is the similar to “good cop” because it’s used in juxtaposition with “the bad place,” which is mostly used as a way to avoid saying “hell” for people who think that’s a swear word, and it’s just extrapolated from that; “the good witch” has probably been around for a while but was popularized by *The Wizard of Oz* and Glinda, the Good Witch. This probably doesn’t cover *all* the shows named like this, and I definitely think there’s some synchronicity to the whole thing, but it isn’t necessarily just lazy writing/naming.

TL;DR: these examples in particular are just existing English phrases (or parts of common phrases)."
The Good Cop,"The Good Place...

Good is the new American. Everything used to start with American."
The Good Cop,The Good Universe is one of the more underrated cinematic universes.
The Good Cop,"I remember during the 2010’s that every movie begin with Bad …

Bad Santa
Bad Cops
Bad Teacher
Bad Neighbours
Bad Grandpa"
The Good Cop,"In the case of *The Good Wife* and *The Good Fight* specifically, it's because the shows are a series."
The Good Cop,"The reason for this is that there are a lot of common phrases which start with ""The Good/Good"". Let's go through your list: 

The Good Doctor, a very common olde timey way of greeting a doctor, ""Ah look, here comes the good doctor now.""

The Good Cop, good cop bad cop interrogation tactics, a very common trope.

The Good Witch, a reference to Wizard of Oz.

The Good Place, a common term used to refer to heaven.

The only one I can't think of a phrase for is Good Wife, but that is probably created by self-referencing the ""Good"" trope."
The Good Cop,"Better standard of show beginning “Black…”

Black Monday, Black Mirror, Black Books, Blackadder, Black Sails, Black Bird

Orange is definitely NOT the new Black."
The Good Cop,[deleted]
The Good Cop,Bandwagon. Once someone does something that works it's milked to death.
The Good Cop,"New trend: names of shows just being the year. 1899, 1923,"
The Good Cop,"Because the Bad Doctor, the Bad Cop, the Bad Wife, just sound like real life."
The Good Cop,"And why do we need to see the ""Rise of"" so many things?"
The Good Cop,"It's a common linguistic structure. 

In the case of these shows, there seems to be an element of irony or dramatic tension to it. They're either not about ""good"" people (good wife, good cop) or about a type that isn't typically good (good witch)."
The Good Cop,TIL there’s a show called The Good Witch.
The Good Cop,"TV/Hollywood have a bad time in general at naming their shows.

I mean as soon as i saw Avatar: The Way of Water i rolled my eyes."
The Good Cop,[deleted]
The Good Cop,Show runners aren't that clever with titles?
The Good Cop,"not sure, but probably because it's a word anyone knows the world over and so it is immediately recognisable, not necessarly indicating that the x character is good per se though

talking about The Good Wife, man, ain't Julianna Margulies one of the most beautiful women on the planet? Her face is literally perfect, that smile can melt concrete"
The Good Cop,"Right up there with show names that end in ""ish."""
The Good Cop,I don’t know but The Good Cop underrated for real… not just cause I was on it
The Good Cop,Good is good which people like
The Good Cop,"Nothing except what the show is trying to put forth. Not any different than putting the word new, bad, etc in front of something."
The Good Cop,"The Good American is certainly coming. /s

For American, wasn't it mostly the American Crime/Horror Story saga mostly."
The Good Cop,This is the best one though
The Good Cop,The dot is what broke me.
The Good Cop,"the good wife was a reference to the ""good"" wives standing by their man at press conferences as they apologized for cheating on them."
The Good Cop,"""Goodwife"" is also an old timey way to speak of a married woman. Sometimes shortened to ""Goody""."
The Good Cop,Or The Girl...
The Good Cop,better than colon origins.
The Good Cop,"It's actually just ""Good Witch"" if you are talking about the tv show.

""The Good Witch"" refers to a series of Hallmark movies that the show is based on."
The Good Cop,It's on Hallmark.
The Good Cop,edit your comment please. you have no right to spoil.
The Good Cop,"Pretty sure every show that ends with “-ish” is related (Black-ish, Mixed-ish & Grown-ish). Correct me if I’m wrong though"
The Good Cop,"Isn't that just sort of a calling card-type thing to evoke shows from one particular creator? I can't think of anything that ends in ""ish"" which isn't from that person."
The Good Cop,I loved the good cop

The Good Cop,The Old Man...
The Good Cop,"You are being downvoted but that person just spoiled arguably the biggest twist of The Good Place, I guess it's unlikely that anyone who reads it is likely to watch it"
The Good Cop,Yeah they're all literally spin-offs...
The Good Cop,Oh heck yeah nice! I’m Ryan lol
The Good Cop,"The Americans. 

Also, after reading your list the world American seems weird."
The Good Cop,[deleted]
The Good Cop,American Sniper
The Good Cop,The Farty Adventures…
The Good Cop,"since instead of editing it they decided to downvote me, i m assuming its not a mistake but deliberate.

bad people everywhere there is nothing we can do about it. and yeah that moment was golden. the good place is really good series and i wouldnt want that spoiler for any of new audience."
The Good Cop,Dude no freaking way! Ryan is absolutely hilarious
The Good Cop,The World American (2023)
The Good Cop,no i didn't. its between American Gods and American Crime Story
The Good Cop,"First off, I don’t even think what they posted can be considered a spoiler. Second, even if it was, that doesn’t make them a bad person lmao. And third, the first season of TGP is almost five years old, I’d say that’s plenty of time for people to have watched it if they wanted to; the internet as a whole can’t be expected to tiptoe around spoilers forever"
The Good Cop,Ah damn thank you! Andy Breckman really wrote a perfect character for me lol
The Good Cop,"that kinda thinking ugh... no time limits for anything. and you can always talk spoiler free. or you can cover it. we re not getting your money for it. and yes if they cant see or dont wanna see how they can ruin someone elses joy for the series with some unnecessary information, they are bad people. and yes >!telling wife is not good might not be spoiler but telling good place is not a good place!< is major spoiler."
The Good Cop,Has anyone else noticed the transitions from one episode to the next?  I think it was really creative the way they play with the newspaper to just seamlessly move onto the next story.  
The Good Cop,"I like it for it's simplicity. It feels like a traditional network show. And that will be the same reason some people hate it. With TV in a sort of golden era right now, it feels sort of weird to enjoy a show that isn't reaching for the top rung, but I also feel like simple TV shows like this still work for a lot of people."
The Good Cop,"I enjoyed it, didn’t love it. It reminds me exactly of a show on USA. "
The Good Cop,"It’s a well-made USA style buddy cop show, and I think Danza and Groban have a fun little chemistry. It has moments of weirdness, that I hope it leans into as the show goes on."
The Good Cop,"Here's part of an interview with Cindy Holland, the Netflix VP of Original Programming. This was part of a question about *The Good Cop* and serialized vs episodic shows. Kind of made me smile to read between the lines.

""We want to see what our viewers make of more procedural storytelling. It’s a definite interest of ours to understand what are the boundaries of episodic versus serialization and everything in between.""

""We’ve already got another few that we’re working on that are more procedural, less serialized. Because we know that there is an audience who prefers to watch storytelling unfold that way. And we want to see how that fits with the Netflix viewing experience. A lot of our members come to us to get immersed in a world and stay there for a while. Our members tend to start with one show and finish it. They don’t really hop around and watch multiple things at once. They tend to go start to finish and then move on to something else.""

https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/why-netflix-dramas-sag-midseason-cindy-holland-interview-707986/

Netflix often gets slammed for being ""lowbrow"" or ""not HBO,"" but I honestly appreciate that they try to have something for everyone (including my home improvement show-watching ass)."
The Good Cop,"I really liked it. There weren't really any characters I didn't like and their chemistry was really good together. Hopefully, Netflix keeps it going. "
The Good Cop,"Haven't seen it but the description of breezy USA show I'm seeing on here makes it sound very appealing to me as I loved those shows. I also see it's made by the same guy who did Monk.

Side note...what's with all the ""The Good XYZ"" shows? The Good Wife, The Good Place, The Good Doctor, and The Good Cop are four examples I can think of. "
The Good Cop,"I worked on the show and while its corny and not something I imagine 20somethings will latch on to, it reminds me of the creator's previous show, *Monk*; its cute and I think I could watch it with my mom and my nieces.

Watching it with my girlfriend who also worked on it, I keep wondering if the mysteries (as intentionally absurd and silly the solutions are) work for the audience, since we already know what's coming and knew as we filmed it so we never got that experience of seeing the scenes cut together in order with the mystery unfolding.  Also, we only got a few episodes in so far (busy on another show right now) but we definitely noticed a jump in quality starting at Episode 3; we remember shooting those first 2 and they were still figuring out the show...there were a lot of notes that came after that and they had seen the footage as far as what they were missing and needed to change going forward, etc., and I think it shows it Ep. 3, 4, 5...I think that's as far as we've watched so far."
The Good Cop,This looks like a fake TV show on 30 Rock or something.
The Good Cop,"As someone who dislikes cop shows because it's always the same plot and concept, I love this show. I really like how it almost feels like a sitcom. It's light and not serious. I love the characters too. "
The Good Cop,"It's it pretty by the book formula mismatched partners cop show with the crime of the week.  Pretty basic, no real mystery as any reasonable person can figure out the ""crime"" or twist pretty early on. It's watchable though and a good time killer to throw on when you're doing something else around the house."
The Good Cop,Fluffy but breezy watch. The recurring jazz-lite music become annoying real quick though.
The Good Cop,"Agreed, I tried episode 1 and was a little bored. Wasn't a fan of the music, made it feel a tad sitcom-y for my tastes too.

Definitely agree that Tony Danza's character is the most interesting, I was only really paying attention when he was on screen by the end of episode 1."
The Good Cop,"I thought the first episode was alright, but have no real desire to keep watching. Having said that, something tells me that it will be a huge hit. People outside of internet message boards love this type of stuff.

It's like how Fuller House among their biggest shows of all time. Things that *feel* ""mainstream"" tend to do way better than niche stuff. And this show is the most ""mainstream"" thing I've ever seen on Netflix."
The Good Cop,"Overall, I really like this show. Sometimes it's nice to have shows you don't have to give too much attention to. There's some crazy plotlines in this show that frankly make zero sense though.

In one episode, they're several months behind on their mortgage and then a few episodes later Groban and Danza are able to get a loan for over a million dollars. Things like that just feel super lazy. "
The Good Cop,It was so bland I couldn’t even finish the first episode. 
The Good Cop,"Definitely looking forward to checking it soon. The mention of spaces for commercial breaks is very intriguing to me. It sounds like maybe they made this show for someone else, but Netflix bought it and said “you know what? This works, we’ll just leave it as is”.

But also, I think of all those monk marathons and blue skies USA shows. They’re designed to have little breaks, rather than be one long thing. It works for the format."
The Good Cop,"I don't mind the show, but the episode titles give away too much of the plot."
The Good Cop,"No. It looks really bland, and also I don't really like Tony Danza."
The Good Cop,"Just started this on netflix yesterday. I was quite happy, as I was a huge fan of Monk series, and this one has the same style (somewhat). But the truth is it has nothing to do with Monk, that's why it failed and eventually cancelled. Monk was brilliant, smart and kept you guessing till the last moment. The good cop? I am on 3rd episode and this is so shallow. Within the first 3 minutes, when you see the days' story, you know who did it and how, no mystery at all. The model suddenly attached to Anthony? Obviously she is the mastermind and wants something from him. A guy escaped prison, a murder nearby, the husband survived? Obviously, he did it and grabbed the chance. The first episode with the dead body behind target had this element of unexpected, but they could find traces of burnt wood on bullet wounds, or the body would bleed after being shot in the same area 6 times. Sad"
The Good Cop,Its a show i really enjoyed watching casually the cops dad is my favorite character he's hilarious. I wasn't surprised but I was disappointed that Netflix didn't renew for a second season.
The Good Cop,"I was to amazed and gassed about it when I finished the first episode just now, I had to google it and found your comment. I hope other netflix shows pick up on this technique. "
The Good Cop,It's Monk by the guy who made Monk. Minus Monk.
The Good Cop,"From the creators of Monk, so that doesn’t surprise me"
The Good Cop,Even the quirky guy with the water watch?
The Good Cop,It would be neat if they all took place in the same Good World.
The Good Cop,A shit trend by shit network proced’s 
The Good Cop,"The Good Doctor is actually a remake of the Korean Drama of the same Name, which is completely different from the other 3 shows"
The Good Cop,"Well I've only seen the first episode, I did enjoy the mystery of finding out how they used his gun. It was probably obvious in hindsight, but it was a clever reveal to me. "
The Good Cop,Have you seen Monk or Psych?
The Good Cop,The music was the worst! 
The Good Cop,"The thing with the broken light.  That wasn't really breaking a rule, it just showed that the character doesn't have common sense. "
The Good Cop,"No but if it's anything like the good cop, I'll check it out. Honestly, the show is great to binge casually. I just finished the entire season and while I'm disappointed that it's over, I'm completely satisfied. It made me laugh, love and the murder  mysteries kept my interest throughout each episode. "
The Good Cop,"I get they're trying to contrast the two, but in doing so they have made the protagonist incredibly boring to follow. 

The black guy was pretty great too, enjoyed him quite a bit. Wasn't a fan of the awkward teen tech support person? Felt very dumb and forced."
The Good Cop,"They are both much better than the good cop.  Monk is made by the same guy.  Psych was spawned by USA due to Monks popularity.  They are both hilarious.  You'd probably like Psych more.  
  
They are both on Amazon Prime."
The Good Cop,The black guy?? [Sheeeeeit](https://youtu.be/l1dnqKGuezo).  That’s Clay Davis!  (A.K.A Isiah Whitlock Jr.)
The Good Cop,Psych is the one show I can watch once a year and love it every time
The Good Cop,"The Good Wife, The Good Place, The Good Fight, The Good Doctor, and now The Good Cop? Time to call Kenan and Kel and make The Good Burger"
The Good Cop,"Worked on this, I think if you know and like *Monk* you'll dig this.  It's not Brooklyn 99...creator said in interviews he wants it to be light and not edgy or at all controversial fare, in so many words.  Its wacky and occasionally corny with that Monk melancholy and neurosis, not topical and hip."
The Good Cop,"Kinda reminds me of *The Unusuals*, the early Noah Hawley broadcast TV cop show, which I watched recently. Netflix really is trying to do it all, isn't it. Broadcast-type , or USA Network Blue Skies-era stuff, whatever you want to call this, plus the multicams they're getting into. They want to *be* TV."
The Good Cop,"This trailer didn't do it for me.  Looks like a boring version of Psych, but with these actors and the Monk association I'll nonetheless be giving it a shot."
The Good Cop,I love me some Josh Groban! 
The Good Cop,I better hear Isiah Whitlock say Sheeeeeeeiit a couple of times.
The Good Cop,From the creators of Mon... I'm in. 
The Good Cop,"I can't wait! I love Monk, so this will be right up my alley!"
The Good Cop,"We've seen Groban play a lot of minor roles, as far as I know this will be his first starring one. (And it doesn't look like a role that will immediately make him sing either!) Not sure if it's my cup of tea but still looking forward to watching it. "
The Good Cop,"I’ll check it out, the cast and tone pique my interest "
The Good Cop,Monica Barbaro was the only reason I sat through Chicago ~~Law~~ Justice so I'll check this out for sure.
The Good Cop,"Jesus! I was not ready to see old tony danza.  I mean, all things considered he actually looks pretty good, but I havent seem him in anything since ""angels in the outfield"" more than 20 years ago, so suddenly seeing him older felt like I was watching some black magic curse take effect. "
Hilda,She also is on game of thrones as a bad ass child too. Kids got good acting chops
Hilda,"One of these days I'll get around to watching this. It's got that Gravity Falls vibe of ""weird but funny and charming."""
Hilda,"I've seen a lot of hatin' on the casting of Ellie in HBO's the Last of Us, so here's some stuff to put your mind at ease.

Bella Ramsay starred in Netflix's Hilda, an animated show that's been running for two seasons and a movie. If you want to see her humor and acting range (and also watch a wholesome adventure cartoon during cold weather), check it out. Here's the trailers for [Season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCojP2Ubuto) and [Season 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26fBRrCdiWU).

Also, she was in three seasons of '[The Worst Witch', which is like Harry Potter but...worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlxrcDMvnVs). Still, [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOGD-ad-ru0) [a few](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F9bsT9QOL0) [clips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko2cADf-VOQ) if you're morbidly curious. She's also had an appearance in Series 2 of BBC's His Dark Materials, but I can't find any clips for that.

And of course, there's her as [Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0aqb0VOMu4). Apparently it was her first acting job, AND she did a lot of her dialogue scenes in one take.

Bella Ramsay has the acting chops to play Ellie from 'The Last of Us'. The only problem is that she doesn't look like her character from the games, but who gives a shit? Unless you can clone a 14-year old copy of Ashley Johnson (who was in her 20s when mo-capping as Ellie in the game, by the way), I only care about the actress's performance.

Also, [she plays guitar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNEfE0FS7dI) That's like 4% of Ellie's character down already."
Hilda,"Love this series. As for the character, it sucks that she’s getting hate for not looking like Ellie. Though I guess that’s because the most “Ellie” looking actor is Elliot Page when he (then she) did Juno. Think it was a meme about how the last of us had hat girl from Juno in the 2010’s."
Hilda,[deleted]
Hilda,"Bella Ramsay also plays Lady Jane Grey in Starz's ""Becoming Elizabeth"" and she's pretty good in it."
Hilda,"It very much has those vibes and I'd rank Hilda as a similar quality to show! While others have mentioned feeling it's sweeter or less menacing than GF, I'd also note that to me it feels like a more melancholy show? There are a lot of quiet, melancholy moments sprinkled throughout which I adore about it. It's a really lovely show all-around."
Hilda,I really liked it! My 4yr got into it and he loves it. Has Gravity Falls/Adventure time vibes but just a little sweeter.
Hilda,"I’d definitely put Hilda along the same lines but perhaps less menacing sans Uncle Stan, hah.  A great watch and I’m excited for season three, just have to know going in that they’re only doing the three seasons and movie post-season two."
Hilda,"I’d agree with that! It has a similar cozy but slightly eerie vibe (Gravity Falls is more overtly eerie, where Hilda is more magical). I really like the creature designs and character development (there’s an episode from last season that made me literally sob because of how emotional it was). 

Anyway, I clearly recommend it."
Hilda,"> look like her character from the games 

Let’s be real: it’s not that she doesn’t look like Ellie from the games; it’s that they don’t consider her good looking enough to play Ellie. That’s their real issue. I’ve already seen too many comments dragging her looks, and it’s honestly pitiful that people need a 14-year-old kid to be good looking for them to like a character. 

I really hope Ramsey stays far away from social media, because most of us are already insecure and self-conscious in our teenage years, but gaming fans really take their vitriol and bullying to another level."
Hilda,"I think Bella will probably do a fine job. I was personally rooting for Mckenna Grace to be cast, though."
Hilda,"She’s Hilda and the Worst Witch? Cool. I have kids who are at the age where they watch this. I think she’ll be great in the role, I can picture her in TLOU better now."
Hilda,"To be fair, The Worst Witch came out years before Harry Potter; it started in the 1970's and had a kid's show on CITV long before there was even talk about movies."
Hilda,"> Bella Ramsay has the acting chops to play Ellie from 'The Last of Us'. 

Maybe, we'll see when it comes out, but the evidence you (and she) have provided so far does not prove this statement.  She was particularly awful and one note in Thrones."
Hilda,Those two shows are not related in any way shape or form other than being animated…
Hilda,"Bella Ramsey is adorable, anyway. She seems super sweet. People just enjoy being dicks.

https://v.redd.it/mfaagh1xpbp91"
Hilda,"I'm sure that's a factor for some; there's no end to perverts out there. Especially on social media.

But for many people it is in fact just a matter of her not looking like the character.

I mean hell, Daniel Fucking Craig got roasted for years after getting announced as the new Bond, simply because he had the wrong hair color. 

Doesn't mean the show will be bad by any means, but it's pretty fuckin disingenuous to paint criticism of the casting as just a bunch of pedos/incels wanting a pretty underage girl."
Hilda,Esp with how creepy it is people complaining an underage girl is ‘not good looking enough’. I hope she’s got someone to filter her social media since imagine being 14 and there being waaay too many people criticising how you look. Self image and issues that child actors have had in the past. Stranger things actors talked about this (being compared on looks) and also the creepy stuff they had
Hilda,"I just don’t think she looks like Ellie. Pedro Pascal is fucking perfect, while she looks very different. I’m sure I’ll like her in the show, but I’m just too used to the way the character looked in the games."
Hilda,I liked her in Ghosbusters Afterlife.
Hilda,I like the Sopranos more than Desperate Housewives lol.
Hilda,And that’s perfectly fair. Obviously not everyone’s skeptical just because they’re secretly shallow.
Hilda,I was very scared for Hilda when I heard Netflix was canning a bunch of animations
Hilda,"Nice. Bella Ramsey has been great in this role and judging by her previous performances, if she can show her strength as an actress once again the new Last of us show then it should provide her with the career boost to be an popular actress for a long time."
Hilda,Wait really?!?! I thought the movie was the series finale? Sweet this is awesome!
Hilda,Fuck yea. Great show that I can't get any of my friends to watch. I'm sure they'll try to tell me about it years later when they finally get around to watching it.
Hilda,Good.  Since Kipo ended we've been worried about Hilda.
Hilda,"3 seasons, one of Netflix longer running series"
Hilda,Nice. My kids will be happy and if not I’ll watch it myself. It’s so fun
Hilda,"Actually really happy about this, I’m not a kid but I thoroughly enjoy the color pallet, story, characters, and designs from this show. Looking forward to the ending"
Hilda,This is old news isn't? I think it was confirmed some months ago..
Hilda,Gonna be interesting to see where they take the story now that they're past where the books were
Hilda,This is a pleasant surprise.  We just finished watching the movie and thought that it was over.
Hilda,Thank you for giving us a last one 🥹
Hilda,"Awesome! Hilda has been great for my kids to introduce them to magic, monsters, spooky stories, etc. I love Hilda!"
Hilda,Happy to hear that they made it official the series has been living rent free in my mind since it first started. The sense of wonder you feel as your watch it never ceases to amaze me.
Hilda,I’m so upset it will be the final season..wish there was more and more of it
Hilda,"> Third

:)

> and Final

D:"
Hilda,Can we get some love for the color palette of this show?
Hilda,"Meanwhile, it's starting to look like Bone is just destined to never get a film/TV adaptation."
Hilda,[deleted]
Hilda,I'm still holding out hope for Scott Pilgrim.
Hilda,"I thought the same, pleasantly surprised by this."
Hilda,"Me too. Pleasantly surprised that it's getting another season, the movie felt like a conclusion"
Hilda,When I finished gravity falls I really wanted another show like it and while Hilda isn’t exactly that it comes *really* close. Can’t wait for season 3!
Hilda,Yh I'm gonna feel so vindicated when my friends start it.
Hilda,My spouse’s the same; she just started watching *The Boys* yesterday.
Hilda,"I had a friend like this, I'd enjoy something and would tell him and he's like yeah alright, then like 5 years later he's like oh man, have you seen this show it's amazing how come we didn't watch it back then? And I'd just say ""You would've if you had listened to me."""
Hilda,I miss kipo
Hilda,They also released a movie recently.
Hilda,It's fun but also kind of soothing.
Hilda,I think the creators said they were working on it but there wasn't any netflix announcement.
Hilda,"That was before Netflix suddenly cancelled a ton of animation shows, so it was still up in the air if this was getting a next season or not"
Hilda,Sounds like it will get a proper conclusion at least.
Hilda,What do you mean in-house? Netflix has no animation studios.
Hilda,"If you were a fan of Gravity Falls, I would also recommend Amphibia and the Owl House, if you haven'tchecked them out. While they aren't quite the same as gravity falls, they do capture the overall feeling that Gravity Falls had."
Hilda,I have been trying to get my dad to watch The Expanse for well over a year. The man is retired and says he can't find the time..... He's watched a couple of the starting episodes but you have to get further into season 1 before it really grabs you.
Hilda,It’s so soothing! I wish the background music was available on Spotify.
Hilda,"They cancelled shows that wasn't been released yet, there's nothing to do with already renewed shows."
Hilda,Well... not anymore.
Hilda,Hootie makes Owl House.
Hilda,"When does amphibia get into their larger plot, is it a steven universe situation where its many filler episodes to get reveals or clues baked in like star vs the forces of evil?"
Hilda,I love Hootie but how can you not love King?
Hilda,I guess it's both? It really has a lot of similarities in humor and story/character progression with gravity falls. The creator was one of the writers of the show.
Hilda,"Amphibia is closer to the SU/star situation, there’s a lot of filler and is overall a much goofier show 

The owl house does a better job at hiding the filler and is more mature imo"
Hilda,"It’s only three seasons long. Like most Disney shows it takes a bit to get into the over arching plot. I think it’s worth the wait personally, let’s you get to know the characters. Second half of season 3 is nothing but callbacks."
Hilda,"Oh my gosh yes! I loved the first two seasons, they had this great balance of seriousness and silliness. I can’t wait for this."
Hilda,">An 80-minute movie, titled ""Hilda and the Mountain King"", is set to premiere on Netflix on December 30, 2021.

Yay!
> A third and final season is currently in development

Le sad :("
Hilda,So excited!
Hilda,"Fuck yes new Hilda! A little bummed out they confirmed 3 will be the final season, but they’ll finish strong. And we get this movie as a bonus."
Hilda,Oh finally. I am so hype for this.
Hilda,"Well, I don't think that Hilda would go forever, 3 seasons and a movie it's a good journey, looking forward."
Hilda,Hilda is the best. It's like laid back Gravity Falls.
Hilda,I’m still waiting for that bone adaptation
Hilda,"This looks really cool! I’ve never heard of it, will check it out."
Hilda,"Oh, this looks cute. Throwing you into my TV Calender."
Hilda,I think them running out of comics to adapt and having to come up with original stories hurts the second season. I couldn't finish it as I thought it wasn't as funny as the first season.
Hilda,I watched a few episodes of this and they ended up in a boring modern city. Do they go back to the countryside as I was enjoying that stuff.
Hilda,Hilda is awesome
Hilda,So fucking psyched for this. randomly found the show on Netflix.for my son and it is legit one of the best cartoons in a long time.
Hilda,They adapted all the comics right? I'm sure there weren't that many stories left to tell.
Hilda,"You and me both, man. You and me both."
Hilda,There's more magic stuff going on in the modern city than it first appears. They do venture outside if from time to time as well.
Hilda,[deleted]
Hilda,"I’m just glad there will still be more to look forward to after this, even if it’s only one season."
Hilda,">Most of season 2 was already original to the show

And absolutely fantastic. They could easily keep going with original content but I don’t mind if season 3 is the last."
Hilda,"A lot of older people comment on how they enjoy this despite not being in the target audience.

For me, this is not a surprise. It is the difference between a childish show and a show aimed at children. If a series is competently written, it will appeal to all audiences. There are many shows out there like this one. For every *Paw Patrol* out there, there's sure to be an *Adventure Time*.

I do recognise that *Hilda* does have its unique appeal, mostly due to its pastel Nordic aesthetic. It is definitely a treat, both for the eyes and the heart."
Hilda,[deleted]
Hilda,"Can I get that in triplicate with signatures on pages 112, 237 and 515?"
Hilda,"Awesome! I'm a mid 30s male and I love this show. Great characters, great stories, great fantasy world and beautiful animation style. This is my happy place."
Hilda,[deleted]
Hilda,"Finally! Really looking forward to watching this with my niece, been waiting forever."
Hilda,Awww good. I love that show. It’s so sweet and relaxing.
Hilda,"Great, me and the kids have been waiting a while!!"
Hilda,At last.  Been waiting for an announcement ever since they premiered two episodes at [NYICFF](https://nyicff.org/programs/hilda-2/) in February.
Hilda,Fucking finally! This show was so good me and my ex kept watching after our daughter went to sleep.
Hilda,"This is one my favorites! So kind, wonderful problem solving and modeling of interpersonal skills.  It's in the short list of shows I love watching with my kids!"
Hilda,"I absolutely adore this series, so much so that i started buying the comics. i am beyond pleased to finally have a narrower release date"
Hilda,Is this one wholesome like we Bear Bears?

The Lost Treasure of Aquila,National Treasure isn’t even from the 90s.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"My only problem thusfar is the friend that records everything.
Stop making evidence!"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Press X to doubt
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"I love seeing headlines titled like this, they're so obvious with how densely packed they are with nonsense.

""It is possible one of the best films this year!  Packed with the funniest youth humor possible!  I cried butterfly tears!  Some actors name!""

Also, they make me look up something I didn't know existed.  How about that?  The show is getting panned from all sides.  I mean wow, critics and audiences really hate this BOMBASTIC GOODHEARTED MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT! (articles first line lol)"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Actually its just daft.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,This is a steaming pile of dog shit and should be avoided
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"[44% with critics, 32% with audience.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/national_treasure_edge_of_history/s01)

I get that even shills have to pay rent, but *come on*."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Actually it sucks ass
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Who can beat the 28 minutes I wasted watching this
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Couldn’t make it past 7 minutes.  Disney, wake the fuck up/"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"This show is fucking garbage. Saw my father enjoying it since he watches everything, but holy, it's so bad."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Terrible.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Not even trying to conceal the shilling
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,This show is legit dogshit
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Daft Fun.    
Now that is the word I was looking for.    
To describe my current taste in movies."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"As big of a fan of the movie's I am not touching this show, ever."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,There is so much wrong with this headline I don't even know where to begin...
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Well we now know who OP is a shill for....
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Lost me at “youth-focused”
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Worst acting I've ever seen. Didn't make it 5 minutes.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,It’s a pretty okay show. Not great. Not the steaming pile of shit this sub purports it to be. Honestly the worst aspect is how aggressively they are aiming this show at Gen Z when it’s thirty something millennials who would have nostalgia for National Treasure.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,The happiest three star review of my life
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"No Nic Cage, doesn’t count. Fuck this show."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Why does the person who wrote this article look like she's about to cry?
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Lmao, it's not as good as this article is making it out to be, but it's also not as bad as some people are making it out to be. It's just fine. Bit cringe with how they try inject gen z humor in certain parts to cater to a younger audience, and the tone is lacking compared to the movies, but it's watchable."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Haven't started it but... Youth focused? Is it another ""kids save the day"" remake?"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Any one attached to this show should be embarrassed for themselves. It’s fucking horrible, I watched two episodes and it was one of the worst written and acted shows I’ve ever seen."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,How much did they get payed to write this poop? I guess they are getting desperate as no-one is watching it
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I see it a big hit with the fans on Rotten Tomatoes at a rousing 37 percent. I guess it’s better than She-Hulk and Willow
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Turned it off after 20 minutes. The writing was so bad
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,counterpoint: it’s bad
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Hold up, is there really an albino monk assassin in this show? Now they're ripping off the problematic parts of The DaVinci Code too?"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I’ve been hearing the exact opposite
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"“Freemasons, albino monk assassins, Harvey Keitel … this youth-focused spin-off of Jerry Bruckheimer’s adventure movie franchise is loads of daft fun”

I read that in the voice of Stefon."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"So this is an ad, got it."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Sounds like a bad Stefan sketch.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"This is nothing like the fun of the first movies. Zero charisma. Even that funny little sidekick guy made the movies magic. This just more of Disney cheaply cashing in on the ip it owns.   Ahh this point with star wars and marvel basically ruined it's time to start boycotting Disney plus.

If they know we will eat this shit and keep paying our subscription fee. They will keep making shit.  RIP starwars, marvel"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Both the series and this article were written for the Young Adult demographics.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"The problem they have is this. These sort so of movies have very little to no political messages in them. The problem is that screenplay writers now I think are physically incapable of *not* shoehorning in some political message that derails the episode or plot, or is just in your face and patronizing. 

So they’ll ruin it with some form of modern politics."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I read that in Stefan’s voice
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,There was an article on the front page 2 days ago calling it the worst tv show ever made.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Inb4 Reddit cries about how this show ruined their lives and this author is full of shit lol
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,[deleted]
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Where can you watch it in UK?
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,National Treasure sucked. Bring back something in the air of The Goonies and I’m in
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,If you love the first and second movies you’ll be at home in this series. It’s basically the same thing but in a tv form.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"If it's anything like the movies it's just daft, no fun."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,So here for it. This needs to be told from a woman of struggle- and recognized as a part of this white santuario of immigrants that some white folk know as the US
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I watched the first episode. That was enough for me.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,You had me at albino monk assassins.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Uh , hello advertising"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Suuuure. When people actually watch it, the consensus will probably be that it's another crappy Disney+ show."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"It's a fun show... biggest issue for me is that they've tried to split Riley's character over Oren & Tessa.... and it's not worked. 

&#x200B;

If the show was Jess & Brainwave Jr with one other person, it would flow a lot better i think."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"I remember when the Guardian was a good outlet, it was circa 1996 when it started spiralling downward"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Not every reboot beeds to star the entire Burger Kind Kids Club from 1993.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I guess they didnt learn from what happened with the irregulars.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Fuck off
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"This is SOOOOO not National Treasure like. It feels like an ABC After School Special.
#AnotherDisneyFail"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,This show was destined to flop simply due to not making a 3rd movie with Nicolas Cage.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"It's like when people call stuff from the early 90s ""so 80s."""
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Neither is the Da Vinci Code which the albino monk assassin is from.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Sure, but the title doesn’t say it was either."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Is he making HD video evidence of a criminal fucking conspiracy?
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"My problem (and I wholeheartedly love how kitschy national treasure is) is her one friend is the woooorst. The guy who gets kidnapped because hes lured with shoes, ruins their escape room, and tells secrets instantly. Why are they friends with him?!"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"nah, if anything that's the most realistic thing about it. people these days, especially gen z, literally record everything. the weird shit you sometimes stumble upon tik tok or other social media and think ""that should've stayed private"" is ridiculous. people just got used to sharing everything about their lives so they film everything, including shit they shouldn't"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"What's with this trope in shows/movies involving kids now-a-days??

Ghostbusters: Afterlife literally had a kid named ""Podcast""

The new Mighty Ducks show has a kid that goes around interviewing everyone.

This show has the video kid."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,So def some Gen Z appeal.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Didn't notice the showrunners (Cormac and Marianne Wibberley) are the same team who actually wrote the *National Treasure* and *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* screenplays, did we?"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,This is The Guardian. They will praise anything (and I dislike using this term) that people would call 'woke'.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"The article is sarcastic AF!

""Sadly Peter Sadusky dies - presumably after the script for the second episode.""

""Catherine Zeta-Jones in a blonde wig, which should have gotten separate billing.""

""It is Latin, she tells her boss, for “I am a ghost”. He reels, he does. Reels."""
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"The article is a pretty scathing tear down of the series, title not withstanding"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"""Embedded marketing"" vibes big time."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"most underrated/underwatched ever! best <media> you didnt know/watch! im so sick of this marketing shit. 

im glad to see even a horde of bots couldnt  bring this shit to 4 digits."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,streaming* pile
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Is it really that bad? I love the national treasure movies and anything even remotely similar to them would be great.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,… that doesn’t mean the average critic rated it a 4 out of 10. It means 44% of critics liked it. Clearly the one who wrote the linked review is among them.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Welcome to /r/television
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Tulsa King ep1 is impressively bad

Lmao you people unironically like Tulsa King, you're beyond redemption."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I stopped right after the introduction. I couldn't go on. They just threw out every red tv show flag they possibly could right in the beginning.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"I made it thru the first episode, it got worse after the 7 minute mark."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I'm imagining this comment in response to one of those Disney Channel movies from the 2000s and its cracking me tf up
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,They're woke that's the problem.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I thought they were already woke. I can’t keep track of who is making me angry and for what anymore...
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Sorry, they can't hear you over the sound of the cash registers."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"The ""Youthinizing"" is getting so fucking old.

""Let's reboot this beloved franchise (insert Mighty Ducks, Ghostbusters, National Treasure, etc.) and make it with kids who are so smart and save the day while the adults are near useless!""

Even the MCU is ""Youthinizing"" the popular characters like Doctor Strange & Hawkeye"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"idk what to say man, to me it clearly is a steaming pile of shit."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Yeah, that’s exactly my take. This is the first time I’ve watched something that truly made me feel “old”, in the sense that everything about this show is aimed at a whole generation (or two) below me. The thing is, it isn’t really done in the best way either. It’s clearly not written *by* people of that generation. It’s written by people my age or older, throwing in all the stuff they think younger generations care most about. “We’ll pay rent by getting a vital dance video on TikTok”. Seriously? And the way she used supposedly being non-binary to literally bully a man out of a men’s bathroom, that was truly painful (or “cringe”, as the kids would say). 

I get it, they want to make this show to draw in younger generations, not necessarily just cater to millennials’ nostalgia, but it’s so cheaply and badly done. I want to enjoy the silly adventure mystery stuff, but the rest just takes me out of it. It doesn’t take either me *or* younger people seriously at all, and at times feels almost insulting."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,dude I'm gen z and no one wants this crap. we'd be happy with good shows too
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"I agree. I'm sticking with it, but it's clearly made for a younger audience for some perplexing reason. I get it with Mighty Ducks Game Changers since it's about a youth hockey team, but National Treasure is a weird thing to gen-Z-ify when there is an actual desire for an adult (but still family friendly) National Treasure revival."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Agreed, that’s my issue with it."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,It's the Guardian's house look.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"The problem isn’t the humor, it’s just a terribly written show. I’ve seen episodes of duck tails with better story lines."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,The actual content of the article sounds like it completely agrees with you about the quality of the show
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"It's not a remake. It's set around 20 years after the movies. And they are young adults, not kids. Unless you think anyone less than 50 is a kid, then yeah ... kids probably save the day (though so far I haven't yet seen much saving, more struggling)"
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,There are parts of *The Da Vinci Code* that *aren't* problematic?
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,I'm certain they were forced to mention DACA a set amount of times.
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Are you a yoga instructor?

Cause that's a helluva reach just to defend bad writing."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,"Sorry… noped out in the second episode where the female protagonist made four extraordinary leaps of logic to almost instantly solve an ancient codex…. Yeah, nah."
The Lost Treasure of Aquila,Catherine Zeta-Jones murdered my whole FAAAAAMILYYYYYYY!
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"The most important character in all of Federation history is in DS9

Union Man Miles O'Brien"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I like DS9, but it's routinely cited as the best or second best Star Trek series. Not exactly ""underrated."""
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"The best supporting cast in history of TV: Garak, Weyoun, Gul Dukat, Rom, Brunt, Grand Nagus Zek, Vic Fontaine, and countless others. Insane amount of well written, well acted characters. And they're not even in the main cast."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9’s longer serialized storytelling and arch’s have aged incredibly well.  It’s like it was made for binge watching.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"""You punched me!?, Picard never punched me!"""
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,‘Underrated’ hahaha by who? It’s always been ranked among the top for Trek series.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"My rule on DS9 was its kind of rough to get into, but once they changed the uniforms to the fancy ones with very limited colour, and Sisko got a goatee and shaved his head, the series got really frigging good"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Hello childhood, loved this show."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Everything about DS9 is just incredible. I only got into it a few years ago, but I've watched it start to finish a few times now. It may not have the same 'iconic' characters as TNG, but everything else is what makes it great.

The storytelling/writing is Shakespearian - the character arcs, the subtle tensions, love/hate relationships, murky grey areas of life, love and politics - it all paints a truly believable world, filled with hope, turmoil, and everything in between.

Nog's story arc may be the best character development in the history of Star Trek - from petty thief to war 'hero'. The Dominion War is one of the most incredible story arcs I've seen on TV... it all starts from a single off hand comment in S2E7 about 'doing business with the Dominion' - and then not even bringing 'Dominion' up again for a bunch more episodes. Hell, even the costumes tell a story - when Bashir was replaced with a changeling, everyone on DS9 changed to the new style costumes (including the changeling imposter), but Bashir himself was wearing the old style costume in the prison. Also - Dukat is one of the best 'villains' on TV - and I love how close they came to making him likable in certain episodes.

The whole series is just filled with small details and nuances that make the whole thing feel truly alive. It's one of the best shows I've ever seen, Star Trek or otherwise."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Is DS9 ""underrated"" in the classical sense, or the Reddit way where it means ""something I want to talk about""?

DS9 it's widely regarded as the most mature and plot driven of all the Star Trek series."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"It's Starfleet at the frontier of the federation. This isn't the liberal utopia of the core worlds that Rodenberry envisioned. It's more like our own because the place is messed up. There's lingering political upheval, racial tension, money, corruption, religion, and a cold war enemy that isn't going to be bullied around.   It's ""Dark Trek"". And while it easily resonate with more people who know all about dysfunctional systems, it's.... not the bright optimistic portrayal of ""how to do things right"" which is what I really like about Trek.

They probably should have touched more on the problem of keeping starfleet personnel on the station. People only sign up for starfleet because they want to. There's no pay or rewards. It's just prestige and altruism. Which is in short supply on the ass-end of the map.

I went to a smaller sci-fi convention recently. The demographic is really aging. None of my younger co-workers have even seen Trek. ANY of it.  And it hit me. The younger generation is a bunch of depressed doomers, partly, because they've never even seen an optimistic future of how everything could work out. Trying to think of non-dysfunctional families in modern media is hard. There's no cpt. Planet telling us how we can save the forests. There are no stories out there where of course the government would step in and do the right thing. That's almost laughably unrealistic.    

Even all these new Trek shows aren't exactly optimistic. Picard centered around how Starfleet changed for the worse. There's so much wrong with STD. Lower Decks is nice. I like it. Funny. But it certainly shows Starfleet as being way less competent than pretty much any other series. SNW is really damn good though."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,All Hail Quark
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Always thought Sisko was the best captain.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Question is, is there enough of a resurgence to warrant remastering the series?"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Underrated? By who?
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Of all the TNG era Star Trek, I’d say DS9 has to most solid writing, because after a shaky start, they were telling a defined story. Yeah you had filler episodes, but there was an overarching main story going on. Sisko as the Emissary, his part to play in Galactic happenings vis-a-vi the Dominion War. 

Everyone got a chance to shine! The actors were all brilliant. The stories gripping and surprising to see certain characters grow into fan favorites. Nog joining Starfleet and his motivations for doing so, followed then by his maiming in the war. Motherfucking Garak, there’s never a bad time for him. Bashir’s reveal that he’s an augmented human. I also enjoyed the showcase of Sisko, O’Brien and Worf as differing images of fatherhood. Major Kira as the BEST first officer in the franchise. Odo as the beat Cop who knows every inch of every bad deal going down and how to nip it in the bud. 

Goddamn I loved that show…everyone should give it a spin at least once."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"People saying DS9 isn't underrated clearly weren't watching live back in the 90's. It's also weird that modern Trek is obsessed with Voyager, the worst one, and not DS9, the best one."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Easily my favorite Star Trek, and probably show, of all time. 

It’s one of those shows that when I start a rewatch, I’m on the sixth or seventh season before I even notice. And while there are some groan worthy and skippable episodes early on, even some of the worst are “absurd and fun in a way only ds9 can be” instead of unwatchable. Move Along Home is the exception here and should not exist. 

That documentary they did a few years ago is an incredible watch too, even with the crazy blue facial hair on Behr. 

It makes me extra sad that we have lost so many main cast members early."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Don't believe DS9 was ever considered underrated. The later seasons with the Dominion War story arc formula was phenomenal and well liked. Two episodes off the top of my head (The Siege of AR-558 and Far Beyond the Star) are two of the most renown Trek episodes out there.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 was in the A class of Star Trek series.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Massive Trekkie here. I love the shows and movies, especially TNG, but DS9 (especially seasons 3-6) is by far the best Trek I have ever seen. So glad people are discovering it now. It was far ahead of its time, and has some of the best writing and characters in television, let alone sci-fi."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 is definitely not underrated.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"DS9 has some gems but A LOT of filler.  I’m rewatching now and there is a lot of Quark episodes.  I like quark but its a lot.

Just watched the episode where Ducat is leading the Pa Wraith cult and Kira is just pulling her hair out at how stupid the followers are.  Seemed familiar….  I mean the baby was Cardassian!  Also Ducat has to be one of the scummiest TV characters out there."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,A whole article without a single word justifying the premise. What resurgence?
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Its great to see it get the love and respects it deserves. DS9 was too different at the time and a lot of people hated that. Now, its being rediscovered and people appreciate how good it was."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Best Star Trek series ever.  It took a couple seasons to find its stride, but once it did, it was amazing."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Underrated? Don't think so. ST: Enterprise was and should have been given a bit more room to grow. They gave all the wiggle room needed to Voyager despite it focusing far too much on the hologram room and an ahole who wanted to build a sooperdooper fast space car but the terminated Enterprise without thought or care.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Stop it. Who has been saying it’s bad? Or underrating it? It’s constantly held alongside B5 as the best of 90s scifi and foundational to some of the tv we got in the 21st century.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 swapped to non-episodic content after Babylon 5 showed them how it was supposed to be done.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"ITT: people confusing ""underrated among Star Trek fans"" with ""underrated in overall pop culture"""
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 was a good show but it has become so overrated by fans these days.  Like most Star Trek there were good episodes and stinkers.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"""We're running a little low on entertainment content this month. Can you find some random entry in a legacy series and write an article about it how it's underrated regardless of the actual critical and audience receptions?""

""Yeah, I think we've only done 621 of those so far this year. We're still good for a while."""
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,One of my favorites Star Trek series
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Babylon 5
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 is my favorite.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own, Kai Opaka > Kai Winn forever
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I have nothing to say besides DS9 is one of the best tv shows of all time, let alone of ST. When I see the abyssal difference in quality besides this and Discovery or Picard I go medieval, and strange homicidal thoughts invade my brain"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Loved that show.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"It’s not underrated? It’s just as popular as TNG, underrated would be Enterprise since nobody even talks about it.."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I’ve watched next gen, ds9 and voyager. Ds9 is definitely the best of them imo"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"It was really good, then it got great when they shaved Avery Books head and he got to be Hawk in space. I suspect very few will get this reference."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Babylon 5. 

The two shows were on at the same time, B5 blew DS9 out the water. We were a firm trek household but DS9 just didn’t cut it. Still not been able to do a rewatch! 

B5 has aged terribly from a VFX point of view, but everything is else was strong. 

If DS9 wasn’t a trek show it probably would have moved out to the margins."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I admit I am not a Star Trek guy, but is DS9 still underrated? A lot of my friends and social media mutuals are big Star Trek fans and they talk about it all the time - and have been doing so for probably a decade now."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I wish it was wide screen. It’s what we call in our house a “square show”. I do enjoy it though.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I've never watched more than a few episodes of DS9.  

I'm saving it for a special occasion, like a bottle of wine.  I like knowing that it's there for me to experience fresh when the time is right."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Is DS9 really underrated? When I binged all the 90s Trek shows during lockdown, I had to look up info on the shows since I'd never watched them growing up and just about every place I looked rated DS9 rated as the best of the 90s shows (Voyager and Enterprise seemed evenly split as the worst, though I ended up liking both better than Next Generation 🤷🏾‍♀️)."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Cool, let me know when it’s B5’s turn."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I had a friend who was adamant that I watch DS9 from the first season all the way through, and he was right.  It takes a little while to find it’s footing (and for the good writers to roll off of TNG) but the character development throughout is just incredible.  Going from absolutely hating Quark to becoming my favourite character says a lot in itself, but they did such a good job playing with our built in allegiances and insinuations, bringing depth and humanity to Garak, Rom, Gul Dukat and many others.  The interplay and evolution of the main cast was truly remarkable as well."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"DS9 isn't underrated, but it was ahead of its time in plenty of ways. It's got dark politics, morally gray characters, moral characters who break down in war and lose their purity, an overall fog of doubt, and verisimilitudes (approach most characters and every scenario with doubt about the truth or how people appear).  

The first season is sometimes weak, and the show has plenty of weaker episodes that I skip on rewatches. But overall, it's a gem and one well suited to current geopolitics."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Best Star Trek Ever.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Yeah I'm almost done a full watch of DS9 for the first time and as really surprised how relevant it is today. Some of the things it tackles in early seasons are:

- The moral plight of dealing with refugees.
- The rise of religious nationalism. 
- Trans issues
- Sexual harrassment

And it goes on."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Watched and finished it in about like during the second and third month of the first lockdown two years ago honestly in my top 5 tv series of all time
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Great, can't wait to watch Move Along Home again."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,The long running Dominion War storyline is why that show became so good. If the writers had stuck to self-contained episodes like the original series or TNG it never would have come into its own. It proved the value of long running story arcs and buildup.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,">underrated

mhm

that being said it's probably the best Star Trek gets, sure its not true to Roddenberry's vision but it has some of the best character development and story of the entire franchise"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Best star trek series there's been
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"DS9 is second only to TNG and, even then, barely so."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I’m waiting on the sanctuary districts of mid 2020s to become a reality that they predicted. We might not quite be there yet, but it sure feels like we’re headed in that direction as a society."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I’m not really a huge Trekkie, but after finding out it was made by Ronald D Moore, I gave DS9 a shot.


Fan-freakin-tastic series. Loved every episode, and every character. Such an underrated series."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I joined the star trek fan club in Singapore in the early 2000s and I was the only person who loved DS9. It's good to see it being appreciated more these days
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 is anything but underrated these days. It's often cited as one of the best Star Trek series ever made.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Jadzia Dax is one of my favourite Star Trek characters.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Quark’s price of peace explanation *chef’s kiss*
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Deep Space Nine is truly the best Star Trek show. It has hiccups and it needs time to grow its beard, but the long term story hits hard. 

It’s about both the promise and earnest beliefs of the Federation, it’s failings, and perhaps it’s insidious flaws too. It’s about a conquered people and their conquerors. It’s about religion and terrorism. It’s about identity. It’s about fatherhood. It’s about trauma. 

It’s side characters and villains grow more than most main characters in Star Trek. 

“It’s easy to be a saint in paradise”"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I really liked ds9
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I miss the characters so much... like a good book
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Where are my Garak fans?
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Eh, Babylon 5 was better."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Outside of TOS, DS9 is my favorite Star Trek series."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,How is it underrated?
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I’m just a tailor- Garak
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 is so good. Such great character development and storylines that last the entire run
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Great show that has a few massive humdingers dragging it down a full letter grade

>!The Dominion as a whole fizzled out when only one and a half new alien species were all we saw of it (the Breen don't count they were SUCH a late introduction; Founders+Vorta+Jem'Hadar were all kind of one species, not in a literal sense but in how they were used/all made by the founders), the Bajorans being right about literally everything, and Sisko is actually unironic space Jesus!<"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Underrated where? By whom? I'm so tired of people discovering something for the first time and start screaming about it being Underrated. I'd live to see all ""Underrated"" posts banned."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Ds9 best trek
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"LOL who wrote this? DS9 has always been known as one of the best ST shows out there. Plus, many if some writers could take notes, current shows wouldn't suck."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 was stolen from Babylon 5 creator.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"For a TV show that ended in 1997, it ended up predicting post-2015 political life in the west pretty well. The Gabriel Bell story arc in the Past Tense episodes and the “sanctuary districts”, the Gil Dukat story arc is basically a story of both regular fascism and Christo-fascism in one storyline, the attempted takeover of the federation by an Admiral, the Circle on Bajor. 

Come to think of it, the writers were really fascinated by fascism."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Thought DS9 was beloved if not the most popular show in the franchise.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 is the only 80s/90s Trek I can watch without hating 90% of the cast or dying of boredom.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Whenever I’ve been asked if I prefer Kirk or Picard I always say Captain Sisko
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,The only thing I couldn't stand about the series was The Defiant.  It was supposed to be this super secret badass federation weapon and **every time** they took it somewhere it got immediately fucked up.  It was less useful than a shuttle
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Whoever said DS9 is “underrated” is an idiot. Best Star Trek since TOS
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Enterprise is the most underrated.

DS9 is often regarded as the best , sometime second best"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,Babylon 5 was better and they thought of it first
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Deep Space Nine is a sitcom set in space.

Sometimes people go to war."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 has been a fan favourite for a decade. It’s Enterprise that’s underrated and currently undergoing a resurgence of popularity
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,DS9 is bifurcated in other ways. It is responsible for some of the dumbest tv ever broadcast. (The mirror universe episodes are particularly atrocious). But it also has some of the best political commentary and worldbuilding of any sci-fi show in tv history.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"I don’t think DS9 is underrated. I mean especially amongst Trek fans it’s not infrequently the favorite of the series. Also it has the best writing for female characters of any of the shows, SNW pending."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Would be nice if Paramount would divert some of the money it insists on burning with Discovery, and give DS9 the same HD treatment TNG got."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Ds9 is my favorite trek. I never understood how it's not considered the top. Relatable, humanized characters in a sci-fi setting that depicts a lot more of daily life, hopes and dreams, and some solid faction story telling"
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I 100% agree. DS9 is so multifaceted and so fucking awesome!
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"Anyone who likes this show owes it to themselves to watch Babylon 5 on HBO Max or Amazon Prime. But don’t just take my word for it.

https://youtu.be/m-kNPxua0aU?t=611

These two Trek nerds are very intrigued after season one."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,The first season is not underrated. It's nuclear waste.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,You mean the show that clearly ripped off Babylon 5?
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,"DS9 sucked hugely. It was not underrated, it was unwatchable."
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,[deleted]
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,This was an awful version of star trek.  It's the only one I can't watch.
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,This fails to take into account that it was a Babylon 5 rip-off
Littlest Pet Shop: A World of Our Own,I'd argue the stargate series is more realistic in the long term.

Inside The Freemasons,National Treasure isn’t even from the 90s.
Inside The Freemasons,"My only problem thusfar is the friend that records everything.
Stop making evidence!"
Inside The Freemasons,Press X to doubt
Inside The Freemasons,"I love seeing headlines titled like this, they're so obvious with how densely packed they are with nonsense.

""It is possible one of the best films this year!  Packed with the funniest youth humor possible!  I cried butterfly tears!  Some actors name!""

Also, they make me look up something I didn't know existed.  How about that?  The show is getting panned from all sides.  I mean wow, critics and audiences really hate this BOMBASTIC GOODHEARTED MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT! (articles first line lol)"
Inside The Freemasons,Actually its just daft.
Inside The Freemasons,This is a steaming pile of dog shit and should be avoided
Inside The Freemasons,"[44% with critics, 32% with audience.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/national_treasure_edge_of_history/s01)

I get that even shills have to pay rent, but *come on*."
Inside The Freemasons,Actually it sucks ass
Inside The Freemasons,Who can beat the 28 minutes I wasted watching this
Inside The Freemasons,"Couldn’t make it past 7 minutes.  Disney, wake the fuck up/"
Inside The Freemasons,"This show is fucking garbage. Saw my father enjoying it since he watches everything, but holy, it's so bad."
Inside The Freemasons,Terrible.
Inside The Freemasons,Not even trying to conceal the shilling
Inside The Freemasons,This show is legit dogshit
Inside The Freemasons,"Daft Fun.    
Now that is the word I was looking for.    
To describe my current taste in movies."
Inside The Freemasons,"As big of a fan of the movie's I am not touching this show, ever."
Inside The Freemasons,There is so much wrong with this headline I don't even know where to begin...
Inside The Freemasons,Well we now know who OP is a shill for....
Inside The Freemasons,Lost me at “youth-focused”
Inside The Freemasons,Worst acting I've ever seen. Didn't make it 5 minutes.
Inside The Freemasons,It’s a pretty okay show. Not great. Not the steaming pile of shit this sub purports it to be. Honestly the worst aspect is how aggressively they are aiming this show at Gen Z when it’s thirty something millennials who would have nostalgia for National Treasure.
Inside The Freemasons,The happiest three star review of my life
Inside The Freemasons,"No Nic Cage, doesn’t count. Fuck this show."
Inside The Freemasons,Why does the person who wrote this article look like she's about to cry?
Inside The Freemasons,"Lmao, it's not as good as this article is making it out to be, but it's also not as bad as some people are making it out to be. It's just fine. Bit cringe with how they try inject gen z humor in certain parts to cater to a younger audience, and the tone is lacking compared to the movies, but it's watchable."
Inside The Freemasons,"Haven't started it but... Youth focused? Is it another ""kids save the day"" remake?"
Inside The Freemasons,"Any one attached to this show should be embarrassed for themselves. It’s fucking horrible, I watched two episodes and it was one of the worst written and acted shows I’ve ever seen."
Inside The Freemasons,How much did they get payed to write this poop? I guess they are getting desperate as no-one is watching it
Inside The Freemasons,I see it a big hit with the fans on Rotten Tomatoes at a rousing 37 percent. I guess it’s better than She-Hulk and Willow
Inside The Freemasons,Turned it off after 20 minutes. The writing was so bad
Inside The Freemasons,counterpoint: it’s bad
Inside The Freemasons,"Hold up, is there really an albino monk assassin in this show? Now they're ripping off the problematic parts of The DaVinci Code too?"
Inside The Freemasons,I’ve been hearing the exact opposite
Inside The Freemasons,"“Freemasons, albino monk assassins, Harvey Keitel … this youth-focused spin-off of Jerry Bruckheimer’s adventure movie franchise is loads of daft fun”

I read that in the voice of Stefon."
Inside The Freemasons,"So this is an ad, got it."
Inside The Freemasons,Sounds like a bad Stefan sketch.
Inside The Freemasons,"This is nothing like the fun of the first movies. Zero charisma. Even that funny little sidekick guy made the movies magic. This just more of Disney cheaply cashing in on the ip it owns.   Ahh this point with star wars and marvel basically ruined it's time to start boycotting Disney plus.

If they know we will eat this shit and keep paying our subscription fee. They will keep making shit.  RIP starwars, marvel"
Inside The Freemasons,Both the series and this article were written for the Young Adult demographics.
Inside The Freemasons,"The problem they have is this. These sort so of movies have very little to no political messages in them. The problem is that screenplay writers now I think are physically incapable of *not* shoehorning in some political message that derails the episode or plot, or is just in your face and patronizing. 

So they’ll ruin it with some form of modern politics."
Inside The Freemasons,I read that in Stefan’s voice
Inside The Freemasons,There was an article on the front page 2 days ago calling it the worst tv show ever made.
Inside The Freemasons,Inb4 Reddit cries about how this show ruined their lives and this author is full of shit lol
Inside The Freemasons,[deleted]
Inside The Freemasons,Where can you watch it in UK?
Inside The Freemasons,National Treasure sucked. Bring back something in the air of The Goonies and I’m in
Inside The Freemasons,If you love the first and second movies you’ll be at home in this series. It’s basically the same thing but in a tv form.
Inside The Freemasons,"If it's anything like the movies it's just daft, no fun."
Inside The Freemasons,So here for it. This needs to be told from a woman of struggle- and recognized as a part of this white santuario of immigrants that some white folk know as the US
Inside The Freemasons,I watched the first episode. That was enough for me.
Inside The Freemasons,You had me at albino monk assassins.
Inside The Freemasons,"Uh , hello advertising"
Inside The Freemasons,"Suuuure. When people actually watch it, the consensus will probably be that it's another crappy Disney+ show."
Inside The Freemasons,"It's a fun show... biggest issue for me is that they've tried to split Riley's character over Oren & Tessa.... and it's not worked. 

&#x200B;

If the show was Jess & Brainwave Jr with one other person, it would flow a lot better i think."
Inside The Freemasons,"I remember when the Guardian was a good outlet, it was circa 1996 when it started spiralling downward"
Inside The Freemasons,Not every reboot beeds to star the entire Burger Kind Kids Club from 1993.
Inside The Freemasons,I guess they didnt learn from what happened with the irregulars.
Inside The Freemasons,Fuck off
Inside The Freemasons,"This is SOOOOO not National Treasure like. It feels like an ABC After School Special.
#AnotherDisneyFail"
Inside The Freemasons,This show was destined to flop simply due to not making a 3rd movie with Nicolas Cage.
Inside The Freemasons,"It's like when people call stuff from the early 90s ""so 80s."""
Inside The Freemasons,Neither is the Da Vinci Code which the albino monk assassin is from.
Inside The Freemasons,"Sure, but the title doesn’t say it was either."
Inside The Freemasons,Is he making HD video evidence of a criminal fucking conspiracy?
Inside The Freemasons,"My problem (and I wholeheartedly love how kitschy national treasure is) is her one friend is the woooorst. The guy who gets kidnapped because hes lured with shoes, ruins their escape room, and tells secrets instantly. Why are they friends with him?!"
Inside The Freemasons,"nah, if anything that's the most realistic thing about it. people these days, especially gen z, literally record everything. the weird shit you sometimes stumble upon tik tok or other social media and think ""that should've stayed private"" is ridiculous. people just got used to sharing everything about their lives so they film everything, including shit they shouldn't"
Inside The Freemasons,"What's with this trope in shows/movies involving kids now-a-days??

Ghostbusters: Afterlife literally had a kid named ""Podcast""

The new Mighty Ducks show has a kid that goes around interviewing everyone.

This show has the video kid."
Inside The Freemasons,So def some Gen Z appeal.
Inside The Freemasons,"Didn't notice the showrunners (Cormac and Marianne Wibberley) are the same team who actually wrote the *National Treasure* and *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* screenplays, did we?"
Inside The Freemasons,This is The Guardian. They will praise anything (and I dislike using this term) that people would call 'woke'.
Inside The Freemasons,"The article is sarcastic AF!

""Sadly Peter Sadusky dies - presumably after the script for the second episode.""

""Catherine Zeta-Jones in a blonde wig, which should have gotten separate billing.""

""It is Latin, she tells her boss, for “I am a ghost”. He reels, he does. Reels."""
Inside The Freemasons,"The article is a pretty scathing tear down of the series, title not withstanding"
Inside The Freemasons,"""Embedded marketing"" vibes big time."
Inside The Freemasons,"most underrated/underwatched ever! best <media> you didnt know/watch! im so sick of this marketing shit. 

im glad to see even a horde of bots couldnt  bring this shit to 4 digits."
Inside The Freemasons,streaming* pile
Inside The Freemasons,Is it really that bad? I love the national treasure movies and anything even remotely similar to them would be great.
Inside The Freemasons,… that doesn’t mean the average critic rated it a 4 out of 10. It means 44% of critics liked it. Clearly the one who wrote the linked review is among them.
Inside The Freemasons,Welcome to /r/television
Inside The Freemasons,"Tulsa King ep1 is impressively bad

Lmao you people unironically like Tulsa King, you're beyond redemption."
Inside The Freemasons,I stopped right after the introduction. I couldn't go on. They just threw out every red tv show flag they possibly could right in the beginning.
Inside The Freemasons,"I made it thru the first episode, it got worse after the 7 minute mark."
Inside The Freemasons,I'm imagining this comment in response to one of those Disney Channel movies from the 2000s and its cracking me tf up
Inside The Freemasons,They're woke that's the problem.
Inside The Freemasons,I thought they were already woke. I can’t keep track of who is making me angry and for what anymore...
Inside The Freemasons,"Sorry, they can't hear you over the sound of the cash registers."
Inside The Freemasons,"The ""Youthinizing"" is getting so fucking old.

""Let's reboot this beloved franchise (insert Mighty Ducks, Ghostbusters, National Treasure, etc.) and make it with kids who are so smart and save the day while the adults are near useless!""

Even the MCU is ""Youthinizing"" the popular characters like Doctor Strange & Hawkeye"
Inside The Freemasons,"idk what to say man, to me it clearly is a steaming pile of shit."
Inside The Freemasons,"Yeah, that’s exactly my take. This is the first time I’ve watched something that truly made me feel “old”, in the sense that everything about this show is aimed at a whole generation (or two) below me. The thing is, it isn’t really done in the best way either. It’s clearly not written *by* people of that generation. It’s written by people my age or older, throwing in all the stuff they think younger generations care most about. “We’ll pay rent by getting a vital dance video on TikTok”. Seriously? And the way she used supposedly being non-binary to literally bully a man out of a men’s bathroom, that was truly painful (or “cringe”, as the kids would say). 

I get it, they want to make this show to draw in younger generations, not necessarily just cater to millennials’ nostalgia, but it’s so cheaply and badly done. I want to enjoy the silly adventure mystery stuff, but the rest just takes me out of it. It doesn’t take either me *or* younger people seriously at all, and at times feels almost insulting."
Inside The Freemasons,dude I'm gen z and no one wants this crap. we'd be happy with good shows too
Inside The Freemasons,"I agree. I'm sticking with it, but it's clearly made for a younger audience for some perplexing reason. I get it with Mighty Ducks Game Changers since it's about a youth hockey team, but National Treasure is a weird thing to gen-Z-ify when there is an actual desire for an adult (but still family friendly) National Treasure revival."
Inside The Freemasons,"Agreed, that’s my issue with it."
Inside The Freemasons,It's the Guardian's house look.
Inside The Freemasons,"The problem isn’t the humor, it’s just a terribly written show. I’ve seen episodes of duck tails with better story lines."
Inside The Freemasons,The actual content of the article sounds like it completely agrees with you about the quality of the show
Inside The Freemasons,"It's not a remake. It's set around 20 years after the movies. And they are young adults, not kids. Unless you think anyone less than 50 is a kid, then yeah ... kids probably save the day (though so far I haven't yet seen much saving, more struggling)"
Inside The Freemasons,There are parts of *The Da Vinci Code* that *aren't* problematic?
Inside The Freemasons,I'm certain they were forced to mention DACA a set amount of times.
Inside The Freemasons,"Are you a yoga instructor?

Cause that's a helluva reach just to defend bad writing."
Inside The Freemasons,"Sorry… noped out in the second episode where the female protagonist made four extraordinary leaps of logic to almost instantly solve an ancient codex…. Yeah, nah."
Inside The Freemasons,Catherine Zeta-Jones murdered my whole FAAAAAMILYYYYYYY!
Three Wives One Husband,"It wasn't great, but it was good. And honestly Alfred Molina is always incredible to watch.

&#x200B;

And the fact that we won't see what happens after the cliffhanger finale really sucks."
Three Wives One Husband,Cancelled for being misleading. There was clearly way more than three pines.
Three Wives One Husband,"I HIGHLY recommend reading the entire Inspector Gamache series from Louise Penny that this was based on. It takes a couple of books to get into a rhythm, but you end up just loving Three Pines and all of its characters. Feels so cozy, inviting, and amazing. Minus the murders of course."
Three Wives One Husband,"Prime needs to have better promotion, I hadn't even heard of this."
Three Wives One Husband,Molina was great but the show was only okay
Three Wives One Husband,"Shame. While it didn't break any new ground, it was a pleasant by the book murder mystery that I, personally, enjoyed. I could have seen it play well on a network about ten to fifteen years ago."
Three Wives One Husband,That's too bad.  It was well written and acted out series . Was looking forward to season 2
Three Wives One Husband,"What the ***FUCK***, I loved this one! Hope Sony and Left Bank can shop it around, at least... was really looking forward to a season 2.

Edit: Weirdly, it seems like everyone *wanted* to bring it back, but the deal fell through at the last minute. And I remember it doing okay viewership-wise on Prime Video. 

A negotiating tactic, perhaps?"
Three Wives One Husband,"Damn, is in my watchlist but haven’t gotten to it. Without major spoilers does anyone know if it ends on a cliff hanger or not?"
Three Wives One Husband,This show felt kinda hammy so I bailed on it really quickly.
Three Wives One Husband,"Well damn, don't know why I bother getting invested in any streaming show. We really liked this show and Alfred Molina was absolutely great in this."
Three Wives One Husband,Damn this sucks.  I love Alfred Molina.  I hope he stars in a sitcom next.  He's been hilarious in every comedic role I've seen him in.
Three Wives One Husband,no Mall involved? pass for me
Three Wives One Husband,"I only watched a few episodes and just had them on while I was working, so I wasn't really *watching* them. But weirdly, Alfred Molina's voice, without seeing his face, sounded so much like Alec Baldwin's to me."
Three Wives One Husband,"That's too bad, we found it well written and entertaining."
Three Wives One Husband,"It was not a great show, I get it."
Three Wives One Husband,"I liked it, it was a bit eye roll inducing, but VERY Canadian in it's sensibilities, and as far as these ""mystery of the week with overarching thread built in"" shows go, it was very watchable.  Not a terrible loss, but a shame nonetheless."
Three Wives One Husband,I loved this show. Goddammit!!
Three Wives One Husband,What?!? I am not happy with this decision at all!
Three Wives One Husband,"Streamers have trapped themselves: I saw this available and had one season, figured I would wait to start until it aired all episodes and I knew if it renewed. It’s not renewing, so I’m not going to start. Check and egg problem. The streamers have to show a willingness to finish their shows and stories even if the audience doesn’t arrive immediately. If they won’t invest their money to make sure it’s a complete experience, I’m not investing my time."
Three Wives One Husband,"TBH, this kind of right down the middle murder mystery would’ve played better set in Oxford. No one believes Canadians could ever commit that many murders per capita. 
/s"
Three Wives One Husband,Maybe if this wasn't the first time I'd heard there was an Alfred Molina-led series...
Three Wives One Husband,I figured it would be over anyway after the final episode.  I did appreciate the native influence and thought the stories were well done.  Did just seem like it would be one and done though.
Three Wives One Husband,"Good, it was awful just like the books it was based on."
Three Wives One Husband,"That is sad, I really like it! The characters were so Interesting."
Three Wives One Husband,Good show with little to no promotion.
Three Wives One Husband,"No! Come on, I liked that show! I wanted more of Detective Alfred Molina. Yes, it was formulaic at parts, but I liked watching the mysteries unfold with his empathetic heart at the forefront. I liked Jean-Guy, Nichol and Lacoste too. And that whodunnit episode with the rich family's hotel was basically like Knives Out.

I enjoyed the storyline about the missing Indigenous women as well, because that's certainly an issue here in Canada that has popped up from time to time, but hasn't been regularly talked about lately.

Overall good series. I recommend watching it while eating Froot Loops (idk that's what I did)."
Three Wives One Husband,"Ah, I was going to get to it eventually, and now I feel guilty for not supporting it earlier."
Three Wives One Husband,I’m seriously bummed. I love the Louise Penny novels and thought this was an excellent adaptation (though there were some differences). There’s so many other books in the series that would make great episodes.
Three Wives One Husband, Boring and unwatchable
Three Wives One Husband,"I actually really enjoyed this, how unfortunate."
Three Wives One Husband,I'm still disappointed his previous show Matador didn't get a second season. That was great
Three Wives One Husband,"Damn, Molina was great in this. Incredibly compelling presence, wish he would play the lead more often."
Three Wives One Husband,"Of course they did. One because of that cliffhanger, and two because I watched it and liked it......"
Three Wives One Husband,"I love these books, but haven’t watched. Worth it to start, knowing it won’t continue?"
Three Wives One Husband,"[This version](https://acorn.tv/stilllife/) was quite good, and also led to...no further episodes.  :("
Three Wives One Husband,Bummer 🙁
Three Wives One Husband,"I've given up with Prime. Unless you're as popular as The Boys, you'll get one season. Unfortunately, the productions companies don't seem to understand this and leave everything with a cliff hanger. Night Sky worked as a standalone as I don't think you could carry it on without it becoming a completely different show but the vast majority are just an incomplete story."
Three Wives One Husband,There’s a whole series of books if you are itching to find out!
Three Wives One Husband,"they work the cliffhangers in specifically blackmailing the networks to renew them, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't"
Three Wives One Husband,"First few episodes I enjoyed. When they got to the big lodge with the super-dramatic family though....whomever directed those episodes just kept saying ""MORE....BIGGER..."" to the actors whenever they had an emotional moment. The whole thing collapsed under the weight of the extreme over-acting. Was there a good story under all that? Who knows, the scenery had been shredded and the children had all run away."
Three Wives One Husband,"The cliffhanger was a mistake. It was a cozy mystery series and having that cliffhanger undercut the tone of the show so much. I went from enjoying it to deciding never to touch it again.  If they were hoping to pick up more watchers after the season was out, that wasn't going to happen with a cliffhanger like that."
Three Wives One Husband,It was 4 but Marty McFly ran over one.
Three Wives One Husband,"This is the second attempt at trying to bring the series to the small screen, and i was a bit disappointed with this one, but not as much as the first attempt. The books are just so great, it is hard to capture."
Three Wives One Husband,Is he like what Molina portrayed in this TV show? I loved his character
Three Wives One Husband,"Did the show adapt Brutal Telling? For some reason I got both that one and the next book in the series, but don't necessarily want to start reading from the beginning."
Three Wives One Husband,"Most prime shows get zero publicity, didn't even know this existed. Doesn't help that their app is kinda terrible"
Three Wives One Husband,It was bad. I love the books and I’m not that picky a TV watcher and I thought it was awful.
Three Wives One Husband,Totally agree. I’m bored with the Isolated Town Whose Colorful Residents Are Wary Of Strangers trope
Three Wives One Husband,Same... I recommend it to all my friends...
Three Wives One Husband,I really liked this show! I hope it gets shopped to other services. I liked Alfred Molina in it.
Three Wives One Husband,"Yes and no. The main overarching mystery gets solved, and the ""cliffhanger"" is silly as the existence of a second season would let you know the outcome. I enjoyed it and am bummed it's cancelled, but no part of me is like ""OMG now we aren't going to know what happened!!"""
Three Wives One Husband,me too. I couldn’t buy the acting.
Three Wives One Husband,"hammy is exactly what it was, especially the francophone"
Three Wives One Husband,"Yep, same."
Three Wives One Husband,"I really don't get this perspective at all.

If no one watched anything until there was a renewal announcement, nothing would ever get renewed, and no one would watch anything.

The last episode of this series released almost 3 months ago."
Three Wives One Husband,">Check and egg problem. 

Chicken and egg?

r/boneappletea"
Three Wives One Husband,"Congrats, you're probably the reason it got cancelled."
Three Wives One Husband,I dunno they murder the Americans at ice hockey.
Three Wives One Husband,"I don't think even ""sometimes"", it never works."
Three Wives One Husband,It was odd because it often felt tonally like two different shows depending on whether Molina was in the scene or not.
Three Wives One Husband,That McFly. Guy's dumber than a screen door on a battleship.
Three Wives One Husband,"I haven't watched the show yet, so I don't really know. But I do know that the author, Louise Penny, wasn't overly happy with how the characters and stories were portrayed, so something was probably a bit different."
Three Wives One Husband,"I'm not sure, as I haven't seen any of the series yet. But, I will say The Brutal Telling is right when the books really started taking off for me. So that's a great jumping-in point in my opinion. You might miss out on some of the character development from the first 3 books, but you should be fine."
Three Wives One Husband,I don’t mind it if down right but there are a LOT of podcasts with the same trope and it can get tiring.
Three Wives One Husband,I am new to this trope and loving it. Who does it right?
Three Wives One Husband,"Right? Wasn't exactly groundbreaking, but my folks and I had a *blast* watching it!"
Three Wives One Husband,"> If no one watched anything until there was a renewal announcement, nothing would ever get renewed, and no one would watch anything.

Sure. But they brought this upon themselves, by releasing and then cancelling seasons after seasons of unfinished shows where the audience is left with unresolved cliffhangers.

So now part of the audience has wisen up and will no longer watch a show unless there's a clear resolution in sight. 

I loved that Neflix made a two-hour tv movies to end Sense8. That gave them a lot of credits from me. But since then those credits have run out. Now I won't watch a Netflix show if I know the season ends on a cliffhanger."
Three Wives One Husband,so that’s why he wore the life preserver!
Three Wives One Husband,"Alright, thanks a lot!"
Three Wives One Husband,Damn. I liked Let the Right One In
Three Wives One Husband,damnit! I really wanted a season 2 for Let The Right One In.
Three Wives One Husband,"Dang it! **Let The Right One In** deserved at least 2 seasons. I hope someone else picks it up and gives it new life, maybe HBO or Netflix."
Three Wives One Husband,"Sucks to hear that, i enjoyed both of them.

  
Was really excited for season 2 of ""Let The Right One In"" after the last scene in the finale."
Three Wives One Husband,"Man I liked Let the Right One in, was hoping for a season two especially after that final scene!! Lame."
Three Wives One Husband,"Both shows were worthy of continuing, but especially Let The Right One In"
Three Wives One Husband,Sad they cancelled Let the Right One In.
Three Wives One Husband,Where is my I Love That For You Season 2 renewal?!
Three Wives One Husband,"Fucking hell. Demian Bichir doesn't deserve such bullshit. FX, ABC have done my man dirty and that's bullshit. 

I appreciate that he grinds thru with new projects even as all this bullshit networks put on him."
Three Wives One Husband,"*American Gigolo -* I managed to watch 3 episodes and decided to stop. I haven't watched the original movie and can't quite tell you what I thought the show was going to be about (besides what's obviously in the name), but this wasn't it. I expected much more. It's got an interesting cast but the writing is pretty dreadful and weak. Made-for-TV-esque. The show is not glam or mysterious, it's just dark and repetitive. You can play that *Call me song over* and over but there just isn't enough to the story to hold me interested."
Three Wives One Husband,Jon Bernthal can not catch a break!
Three Wives One Husband,Wtf! They already shot a whole season of Three Women. What a blow to the crew and cast. Honestly disrespectful.
Three Wives One Husband,bloodbath january
Three Wives One Husband,"Devastating...I really feel peacock, hulu, or Amc +will pick this show back up.I mean, what a cliffhanger. #LTROI #anikanonirose"
Three Wives One Husband,Whats the date showtime and paramount+ merge
Three Wives One Husband,Let the right one in was good but not great and not surprised in honesty
Three Wives One Husband,"Can someone ELI5 the logic behind shelving all these shows/seasons that have already been produced?

The Batgirl and Scoob stuff (obligatory Fuck Zaslov) makes sense (kinda) because there was a tax benefit due to the merger. But now all these other networks are starting to do the same thing. 

Why spend Millions of dollars making a season of television and not air it? Like, 95% of the cost has already happened."
Three Wives One Husband,Deuce Bigalow deserves better than being cancelled.
Three Wives One Husband,"I'm really hesitant to start TV shows these days because you really do never know what's going to get cancelled.

You have your surefire hits like The Last of Us, but I'd say a solid 90% of shows you don't really know if they're worth the investment because they might not get any sort of payoff."
Three Wives One Husband,"Maybe if they created an original vampire show instead of remaking a classic that they’ll never be able to live up to, it wouldn’t have gotten cancelled. I actually would have watched the show if it was a new dark, creepy vampire show that’s emotional and touching like LTRRI. 

By all accounts the show is seemingly not bad, so I give credit to the people involved for not making it terrible. I just think there’s nothing that needs to be remade 3 times. Why would I want to see a version of a masterpiece that’s merely ‘decent’? I’ll just watch the version that’s a classic instead..."
Three Wives One Husband,American Gigolo was so bad and Bernthal didn't even show any peen.
Three Wives One Husband,Does American Gigolo end on a cliffhanger?
Three Wives One Husband,Same but saw the viewership numbers so knew it was coming
Three Wives One Husband,I had no idea it had even started already
Three Wives One Husband,"What was the point of that show anyway. They already did a very faithful remake of the original movie, just stop there."
Three Wives One Husband,Showtime are open to other services picking up their shows (American Rust is moving from Showtime to Amazon) so there is some hope (unlike Netflix or HBO Max where in-house productions are locked down)
Three Wives One Husband,"Damn what a different response it’s gotten after coming out. On Reddit it was almost “cool” to shit on it and do the whole “why, no one’s asking for this” or “just watch one of the films” probably a big contribution to why it wasn’t watched by many."
Three Wives One Husband,Love the original.  Didn’t mind the US remake.  Enjoyed the show and thought it had potential… so of course it gets cancelled :(
Three Wives One Husband,"Yeah me too!  I hope someone else picks it up, because it was a very good show"
Three Wives One Husband,Probably at least a year or less
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge," “It went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.”  

Sounds like a Sam Levinson project."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"> “It was a show about a woman who was finding herself sexually, turned into a show about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.” 

😬"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,">Casting K-pop superstar Jennie of Blackpink was the biggest get for Levinson. Under the show’s hashtag and teaser trailers, her stans steamrolled comment sections to cheer on the singer in her first acting role. But crew members claim Jennie has barely any air time and an inconsequential story arc. “It was like three or four lines per episode for her,” a production source says. “They didn’t let her talk that much. Her job was to sit there [and] look pretty, basically.” 

Like YG Entertainment would have agreed to anything more. They now have a well-established reputation for overhyping and underdelivering."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Sam Levinson seriously needs to jerk off before coming into work.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,">The first public inkling of trouble came last April, when director Amy Seimetz, of The Girlfriend Experience and She Dies Tomorrow, suddenly exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished. HBO addressed the news by confirming The Idol was set to have a major creative overhaul and would be adjusting the cast and crew. There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

&#x200B;

I mean, the protagonist is a woman, how is leading too much into a female perspective is bad?"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I understand that Levinson is a fucking creep, but let’s not forget that The Weeknd is co-creator, co-writer, exec. producer, and apparently put in the request that turned the show on its head. Whatever comes of this, he deserves just as much blame as anyone else, and it’s crazy that most people are kinda glossing over that."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,It’s insane that Euphoria will coast over 100 million for the next season.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Man, I was mostly interested in this show just for Amy Seimetz. Replacing her killed my interest even before all that shitshow."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Every single thing I read about Sam Levinson screams *”I’M THE SON OF A FAMOUS DIRECTOR SO I THINK I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!”*
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I seem to recall that the original director had wanted episodes exploring Lily rose depp’s character’s personal life and relationship with a childhood friend- good reflective stuff that gives the show depth. Anyway The Weeknd vetoed it for being too feminist 💀
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"> Levinson allegedly stopped sending scripts to HBO and certain department heads, according to two people familiar with the matter. “I got the vibe that the mood on set was, ‘What’s HBO gonna do, pull the plug? Yeah, right. If they want a third season of Euphoria, they’ll give me what I want… We’re just gonna shoot what we want and if [HBO execs] have a problem with it, that’s their problem,’” they explain. 

wouldn't be surprised if Euphoria gets canned after this, the arrogance is astonishing"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"*Seimetz seemed set up to fail from the start. When she arrived on set seven weeks before the show started filming, she was given half-finished scripts, a first-time showrunner in Epstein, a tight schedule, and near-impossible expectations from HBO, those sources say. “Amy was doing her best in an impossible situation, but she was going to lose this no matter what,” one production member says. “Honestly, I think HBO handed her a shit stack.” (Seimetz declined to comment.)  HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria’s upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...  It's sounds like the developmental execs at HBO are terrified to do their job well given all the projects getting axed by the new overlords."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I went from wow that sounds like a mess to work on to wow an egg where and she is begging him for what?!?! I like dark shows and shows that push the envelope but this is not it.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I know several people worked on this show and I’ve yet to hear a single person say a good thing about it. Such a fucking mess and it definitely crossed into dangerous territory once Levinson was there.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,They gave The Weeknd too much power and not surprisingly he went on an ego trip. He has that movie with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan that he's also writing and producing up next which is too bad because we'll probably hear something similar there.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I'm genuinely starting to believe that this show does not and never will actually exist, and that its seemingly neverending promotional rollout/behind-the-scenes soap opera is in itself a work of Andy Kaufmanesque performance art. Certainly I'm no closer to knowing - beyond the bare-bones outline - what the hell the actual story is supposed to be than I was when it was first announced approximately two thousand years ago, so maybe it really is all just an elaborate Situationist prank?

At any rate, I think it's very funny that everyone's wringing their hands about an obviously planted story that paints the show as a dark, dangerous, boundary-smashing orgy of decadence, which just so happens to be the exact image its makers are going for. [This legendary Onion story](https://www.theonion.com/marilyn-manson-now-going-door-to-door-trying-to-shock-p-1819565904) kept springing to mind."

Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I'm not going to be surprised at all if some kind of Kevin Spacey/Bryan Singer/Harvey Weinstein type stories come out about Sam Levinson. I am surprised they haven't come out yet.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Sam Levinson’s got some issues.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Warning: Rape, Sexual Assault

“At various points, Levinson’s scripts contained disturbing sexual and physically violent scenes between Depp and Tesfaye’s characters, three sources familiar with the matter claim. In one draft episode, there allegedly was a scene where Tesfaye bashes in Depp’s face, and her character smiles and asks to be beaten more, giving Tesfaye an erection. (This scene was never shot, the source says.) Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.) “

Can someone check Levinson’s and The Weeknd’s hard drive and search history please. I know that these ended up not getting filmed but why were they up for consideration in the first place?"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Even since it was revealed that The Weeknd felt that the show was heading too much into a ""female perspective"" and therefore decided to change that I knew the show would end up being messy."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,This will either bomb or this will be such a huge hit that talking heads will question if this is the further moral decline and decadence of society.

Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Wish Harmony Korine was at the helm 😀
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Well I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks Euphoria is creepy voyeurism and not the show of a generation anymore
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Reading the whole article, it appear that as problematic as Sam's writing is, the issues were apparent long before he took over.

Looking at some of these quotes in bold:

**As promising as those initial scripts were, the scripts for the final episodes were still only half-finished and the finale completely unwritten. Seimetz was encouraged by HBO and producers to put her own spin on the show and write the last episode, a source explains. As a result, Seimetz was polishing up scripts and writing while directing. She also had her assistant, who had no previous credited writing experience, writing scenes, with HBO making the assistant a staff writer last January. (The assistant did not respond to a request for comment.)**

**Organization quickly evaporated, mainly due to changes in the script, sources say. One production member says the first version of the show went through more than 20 rewrites, saying scripts were being updated constantly: “We did it every fucking day. It was insane.** 

**Eventually, the crew say they stopped getting one-liners, an industry term for daily schedules of what was being shot. And the few one-liners that were given out quickly became useless due to changes, sources say. Decisions were being made on the fly, frustrating several crew members who say they felt they could never properly prepare for the next day of work. “I’d be driving home [at the end of the day] and they’d be like, ‘Oh, we’re adding a scene, but it hasn’t been written yet,’” one says.** 

**A report from April blamed the show’s overhaul on Tesfaye, who was reportedly unhappy that the story was focusing too much on Depp’s character, according to Deadline. A source with knowledge seconds that Tesfaye was the reason behind the shakeup, wanting to tone down the cult aspect of the storyline and pivot into something else entirely, dropping the “feminist lens” through which the show was being told as a result. “It was like the Weeknd wanted one show that was all about him — Sam was on board with that,” another source explains to Rolling Stone.**


In a six episode season, if you still have unfinished scripts for the remaining episodes and an unwritten final episode while you are filming an hectic production, it is obvious that the problem are deeper than just one person.


From reading the quotes above, It look like nobody had any actual finished outline of what direction the show was going toward or how it would end since they admitted that they already have gone through 20 rewrites while Seimetz was still in charge of the show. 

When you are rewriting scripts that many times and you still haven't even finished the scripts for the remaining episodes in a six episode season, it will be difficult to have a coherent story and character development. 

The crazy thing is that if this was a 22 episode season, it would make sense to have rewrite or revision to the scripts due to the length of the season but when you are struggling to write up only six episodes with a small timeframe for shooting and production, this is basically an issue from HBO management to the writing team. 

As problematic and disturbing as the reports have been about Sam especially backstage on Euphoria, it appear that just blaming him is the easy way out regarding the issues plaguing this show. 

The article make it clear that the issues were there from the first day of production before he was even involved and that the issues just kept getting worse as shooting continued. 

Also, It look like Tesfaye wanted the show to be more about him and his character compared to Depp's character. When you have one of the two Main Character of the show apparently having an issue with a woman character being the focus, you are going to have a difficult time appeasing him unless you recast him with a new actor who would be fine with allowing a woman to shine.

Honestly, you can just lay the blame on HBO management which appear to have an unrealistic deadline and a refusal to oversee what actually is going on regarding the scripts and production."

Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Slightly off topic but does anyone else share this opinion about The Weeknd:

He sings about all the drugs and sex he does but form the very beginning I was like “nah,  I don’t believe you.”  He’s trying too hard. Like that kid that brags about his hot girlfriend but you don’t know her cause she goes to another school. He’s always giving lil dick energy. Some artists can pull it off, the attitude, the machismo, but not him. He’s a dork to his core. A pretender. 

Solid pop music though. Can’t argue with his phenomenal success!"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I mean Euphoria was softcore porn with the appeal of teenagers pretending they invented fucking wasn't it?
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I always found the critics absolute obsession and love for this show odd. The length to which they show drugs and sex not only feels weird to watch it’s also just not accurate. Then again maybe most of the critics hadn’t experienced high school in some time so they actually thought this was accurate.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Honestly I stopped watching euphoria after a season because it just made me feel yucky.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Tbh, you could also make a fine argument about euphoria glamorizing drugs and debauchery, more than actually addressing its problems. Just watch the first few minutes of the very first episode and you'll understand,lol"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Same with Euphoria.  It’s porn.   You can tell his intended audience is one that enjoys sec versions of saw.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"His Netflix film, Malcom and Marie was utter garbage in my opinion. I enjoyed Euphoria but when I look back on why I enjoyed it nothing comes to mind. I tried rewatching it with my girlfriend and found it to be more annoying than thought provoking or even entertaining."

Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Sam do be into depraved, toxic sexuality."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"on the fence about whether this is *intentional* marketing -- but given that this exact article has been posted on Reddit 11 separate times, has almost 1500 comments on this thread alone, Tesfaye had a targeted and ready-made clip to respond to Rolling Stone with, and it subsumed discourse all day yesterday on other social media platforms incl. Twitter, I'm pretty sure it generated exactly the kind of outrage/buzz that will propel the premiere to sky-high viewership. Happy to revisit this comment when the show premieres and eat my words if I'm wrong but I doubt I will be. It's worth noting that the loudest critics of Euphoria have usually watched 16 episodes, maybe even all 18.

I'm pretty disturbed at how comfortable everyone is casually slinging around rumors about Levinson being some kind of predator, though. Not only is there zero evidence of that, but there's not even any *allegations* of him being remotely creepy. There's not even anything to disprove, just people clearly hoping that bad things will come out about him presumably because they dislike his work so much. Levinson certainly doesn't seem to find his own work as titillating as everyone here clearly does -- [seriously, I'd recommend reading this THR interview with him, he comes off as very thoughtful and just...not creepy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/euphoria-creator-boundary-pushing-hbo-drama-didnt-pull-punches-1218588/) -- and nearly all the social media comments are bursting with inter-generational hysteria about Kids These Days and dismissing Euphoria as porn while clearly ignoring the fact that Euphoria is making a commentary on how the ubiquity of internet porn has affected culture and particularly teenagers. I respect it for at least trying to start a cultural conversation on how porn is affecting youth and sexual expectations/gender dynamics especially when a lot of the takes around porn are just like, ""why don't you just jerk off in the privacy of your own room, you sick freak, and we can all pretend this huge cultural force doesn't exist.""

All this is not to discount the worrying accusations in the article, such as that of a disorganized set -- poor work conditions are no joke -- but all of the other stuff like the description of the egg scene, which wasn't even filmed, is to some extent clearly being enjoyed as salacious and transgressive by those who read it. Rape kinks are real and [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19085605/), another thing that could stand to be critically engaged with instead of acting like it's some collective dirty secret. Maybe the show failed at that but we can't really say until watching, which I'm sure most people will -- but I'm fascinated by how many people will eat up Levinson's work and then will completely miss the commentary or continue to insist he's some pervert. This conflict between what people do/want and what they openly admit to doing and wanting is a running theme throughout his prior work....and if you don't believe me on that then read the THR interview. anyway, ready to get downvoted into oblivion lol"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Why do people keep hiring Lily-Rose Depp?

How much is this costing her dad in influence and cash?"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Gonna be funny watching everyone slowly realize Sam Levinson is a total hack…
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Idk something tells me we will one day be talking about Sam Levinson the way we talk about J*ss Wh*d*n
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"This: 
>	Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Plus this:
>	It was like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better,”

Is super disconcerting."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I’m not a huge Euphoria fan, and I tend to agree that Zendaya’s arc is definitely the best (and maybe the only good) storyline, but I’m always a bit confused by Reddit’s disgust for the show. 

It’s definitely not a super realistic depiction of high school and it’s way over dramatized, but people do drugs and have sex in high school. I went to a tiny school and even there we had heroin addicts, meth addicts, etc. People had sex at parties. It was certainly way more awkward and not as glamorous as it is on Euphoria, but Euphoria is purposefully melodramatic.

The nudity can be too much, but all of the actors are in their mid-twenties. I don’t really agree that it’s pedophilic of the creator to depict high school sex.  All of Harmony Korine’s early movies had  more fucked up stuff involving kids and teens than Euphoria does."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Dude is a scumbag. Plain and simple.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Read the stuff that got cut and I think I'm going to skip this one.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,">There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Oh boy."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Its funny, I work in TV maeketing. Was watching a few trailers of The Idol today for work and said to my co workers “this is just softcore porn”."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I'm so fucking done with overly sexual shows and movies. I just want a good show/movie without having to see extremely graphic sex scenes for way too long or straight up pansexual orgies.

I want to be captivated, not shocked. It has nothing to do with my beliefs (atheist) and I'm not sexually frustrated, I just hate it because of how unnecessary it is. If I wanted to watch porn, the internet's full of it already. It's not art, it's just showing everyone you're a fucking pervert."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Sam Levinson is gonna be one of those guys you find out in twenty years was doing some mad creepy shit behind the scenes
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Euphoria sucked so I’m sure this will too.  At least it looks like the characters are supposed to be adults at least.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"The Weeknd deserves as much blame as Levinson imo, dude was a co-producer. Even some of his earlier music references taking advantage of young models, etc. Fucking creeps."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,More high school teens fuckin... I mean that's HBO's bread and butter
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,I just know Sydney Sweeney is going to expose Sam once *Euphoria* is done. Expecting the upcoming season to be its last tbh.👀
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"“The Idol, which is being billed as a **darker, crazier, and more risqué** version of Levinson’s smash-hit Euphoria.”

Wait, WHAT?"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"It's not porn, it's HBO.

Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Sam Levinson sounds like one of those guys in Hollywood who is going to become a major flash in the pan and done with.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Never seen Euphoria, is it good?"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Wasn’t interested in seeing it but now they’ve got at least 2 guaranteed episodes out of me.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I bet zaslav loves that shit, it combines the unscripted trash he became famous for with the high budget and audience HBO brings"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Every single reasonable Euphoria fan: ""Yeah, I could see Sam Levinson doing that"""
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Nepo Depp ""best director ever worked for""...in her long and storied career phhht"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Who want's to start a pool and bet on when Sam Levinson is going to get his first accusation of sexual misconduct? Maybe he hasn't yet, and he legit thinks he's just an artist, but people lie to themselves all the time and often times the harder they try and cover shit up, the more it pokes through. Either way, I'm leaving this here so I can link back to it when it becomes clear I was right."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,It does suck if hbo enocouraged seimetz to do her own take and bailed on her...But overall I dunno...its the weeknd's show basically.If he wants it changed I guess I don't see the problem.The main creative leads are him and levinson I think(?).
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I'd never heard of this show until just now. It sounds terrible and expensive. 


HBO is about to lose their asses on this train wreck if it ever actually comes out, I'm getting some 12 Miles of Bad Road vibes from this article."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Oh man is Hollywood a bad place
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Interesting marketing plan, HBO..."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Mark my words, this man's career will be hit with a sex crime scandal, most likely from him being a predator."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"That was a fucking trip to read, yikes, I loved Euphoria’s first season and haven’t watched the second yet, but this dude seems like trouble"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Nice try but I’m still not watching a show starring those fools. You could tell me they literally get tortured to actual death and I’d still refuse. 😂
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Never go full Ryan Murphy.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Wow you mean to tell me that a man who dated Bella Hadid since she was underage and visited all the Covid-unsafe parties in LA is self-centered and egotistical? That’s crazy, I would have never thought."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"I'm sure the production of the show has been bad. But this article, to me, seems like it's slanted in a weird way.

The article seems written to imply that something changed from the ""original"" show to ""the current show"" due to the involvement of Levison and The Weeknd. But Levinson and The Weeknd created the show.

I'm failing to understand how the show transforms from A to B when the creators are also the same people leading now. I would understand it if you said it went from A to B to A, but that's not what it says, nor does it say Seimetz rewrote the whole thing. The current version of the show sounds exactly like Levinson and The Weeknd, so how could it have been different in the beginning and why would they have wanted it to be different?"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Who exactly is surprised with those two involved?
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,This is such a load gossipy bullshite. How is rolling Stone even in publication still?
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"""Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.)""

How hard is it to shoot that? You shoot an angle of hand with egg going between her thighs, you cut to a reaction shot of her face. I mean, we've been simulating actresses being penetrated for decades without actually penetrating them, this cannot be difficult."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"What's missing from the story, because it's sourced by anonymous people who clearly wanted to publicize Amy Seimetz's perspective, is The Weeknd's vision of the show. They say it's about a guy's sexually abusive relationship with a woman but missing is his point. 

It could be wish fulfillment smut but there could be  something interesting he's wanting to land on that just wasn't what Amy was interested in doing. 

Messy production and sexual minefields aside, artists can connect with different aspects of a vision and end up running in opposite directions. I loved The Girlfriend Experience and find Amy Seimetz a great director but this may not have been the project for her. Also the Weeknd has never produced a TV series before and relied on Sam Levinson to execute his vision but Levinson was failing everyone

Either way I'll be watching, always down to see a beautiful mess of a series."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Nice marketing. When does it air? Sounds interesting.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Unpopular opinion; i can see theWeeknd and Levinsons point of view.  If you want to make a dark and disturbing noir tale about how easy people can be used and abused, you have to show that. Film it. You cant just have have characters say things are bad then turnit in to the triumphs of the independent woman.  Which it sounds like what was happening.  The original director was turning it in to something hopeful and uplifting how the female character perseveres over all obstacles- which is the opposite of the story youre trying to tell"
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"This comment section is weird. You can tell when people already have their mind made up about something based on what other people have said. It’s just a circle jerk here of people saying basically the same thing.

This is a tv show we are talking about right? They can do whatever they want as long as everyone involved is on board.

We’re getting to this point where sex and nudity in mainstream media has to be tasteful and meaningful and it’s bad if it’s it’s gratuitous. Gratuitous violence is ok though. But at the same time so many people are making a killing on onlyfans servicing that side of what people want. It’s like we’re trying to hide that part of what people are. But at the same time empower people to do whatever the fuck they want. So what if it’s torture porn? Don’t watch it if it sucks. Dude’s out there making what he wants and what some people want to see."

Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"So after hearing the first buzz about Euphoria I started watching it but was like ‘UGH, this nudity is TEW MUCH’ …so unnecessary! I won’t be watching this garbage 

I wouldn’t want my daughter starring in ANY of that shit."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Article is definitely worth a read, what a fucking shitshow. HBO just lets you make the most disgusting trash if you made them a popular show I guess."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,[deleted]
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Is Sam Levinson just Larry Clark with clout? Let's think about that for a moment...
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"The Weekend is not a good man. He’s got form, he even brags about it in his lyrics. He’s another R Kelly and the industry are just letting it happen….again."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,God Sam Levinson is so creepy. I really can’t enjoy Euphoria without thinking of how a grown man was writing these sex scenes between kids and adults.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,"Do we as a culture hate edgy things now? I like to feel uncomfortable watching SOME of the media I consume. Not everything had to be feel-good cartoons, remakes, or the next mediocre superhero crap. This puritanical nonsense is very frustrating and annoying."
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,Wild how HBO went from “can do no wrong” to “everything is fucked up and terrible” so quickly after Discovery took over. I hate them for what they’ve done to HBO and other stuff.
Cabins in the Wild with Dick Strawbridge,The only thing I've learnt from this thread is that reddit absolutely hates sex lmao
