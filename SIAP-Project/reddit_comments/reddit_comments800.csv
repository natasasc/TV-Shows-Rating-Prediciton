TV Show,Comment
The Graveyard Story,The looming threat of a WGA strike was also a motivation for getting scripts in early I'll bet.
The Graveyard Story,If only they had that foresight with the sequel trilogy. Can you imagine writing a script knowing that it had to relate to other projects? Crazy.
The Graveyard Story,I do not want to watch 4 other trash shows just to understand the one I kind of like
The Graveyard Story,"Question is does it ""fit perfectly"" without watching ahsoka and ""more star wars series""?"
The Graveyard Story,"Long time ago in a tiny galaxy far, far away..."
The Graveyard Story,"FFS why. The MCU model is absolutely exhausting, I don't want keeping up with characters and shows I like to be a full time fucking job."
The Graveyard Story,"Considering how heavily Favreau relies on improv, and how sparse I found any of the dialogue in Mando season 2 or Book of Boba Fett, I'm gonna take ""already written"" with a grain of salt"
The Graveyard Story,Is anyone pretending it is a particularly elaborate show to write. The show just repeats itself ...
The Graveyard Story,Please stop Marvel-izing Star Wars.
The Graveyard Story,Meaning it's going to be further bogged down by having to connect to the Skywalker storyline. I'm one of the few who did not enjoy the Luke revelation at the end of S2: Does every single piece of Star Wars have to be bound to the OG Story?
The Graveyard Story,">  So That Its Story Fits Perfectly With ‘Ahsoka’ and More ‘Star Wars’ Series

BWHAHA and by fits in, they mean works in an add for that other Disney shit thing."
The Graveyard Story,"I'm kinda annoyed because I only want to watch Mando. Didn't see Boba and now people say that is important for season 3, now they say I need to watch even mlre shows. Might drop it completely"
The Graveyard Story,"I guess that means we won't get back to the simple (in the best of meanings) and fun space western version of ""lone wolf and cub"" that was the first season."
The Graveyard Story,But will it entertain?
The Graveyard Story,"Unless the ""More"" is Andor, I don't care, I'm not watching other lazily produced shows just so I can understand what is going on in another.  I'd rather just read about the plot connections on a wiki or skip it entirely."
The Graveyard Story,I love this sub because of all the miserable people who watch these things and then claim to hate it or call it pedantic but then they keep watching it.
The Graveyard Story,Aha yes more product placement written into the show instead of you know telling a fucking story.
The Graveyard Story,The whole universe is an inconsistent mess at this point. Making this little piece fit makes little difference.
The Graveyard Story,So Ashoka will be another Book of Boba Fett and become Mandalorian season 4.5?
The Graveyard Story,"Instead of 1 great show,they'll milk this into 5 ok shows."
The Graveyard Story,imagine caring about this baby shit after Andor
The Graveyard Story,Just stop.
The Graveyard Story,Oh great more shows that connect together for no reason just because they're in the same franchise
The Graveyard Story,Star Warzzzzzzzzzz…
The Graveyard Story,"""Stop! Stop! He's already dead!"""
The Graveyard Story,Please just no more putting other shows randomly within others like they did with BoBF
The Graveyard Story,Already stopped watching Mandalorian when the Bobba Fett filler shit started. Why does everything need to be connected. its a story about a GALAXY far far away. give me more of the galaxy and less of the same ol shit
The Graveyard Story,"Am I the only one who is not a fan of having to watch other series so that the series that I am watching makes sense?

My wife and I used to watch The Flash and every season they'd do a crossover episode with the various other shows on that network. It was awful to have to watch those other shows to know what was up so we just started skipping the crossovers altogether. 

I like the Mandalorian but not interested in the other shows so I hope that while it will fit with other shows, I won't have to watch those others just to have an episode make sense."
The Graveyard Story,How about writing it so it fits with original series episodes 4-6?
The Graveyard Story,But Andor is still the only one worth watching…
The Graveyard Story,"No more Ahsoka, please..."
The Graveyard Story,"Fuck the haters, I’m excited. Mando is going to mandalore. There’s going to be a big conflict around the mandalore title since Bo wants it too. Ahsoka is going with Sabine to find Ezra and Thrawn. Thrawn is likely going to be the big villain, which should be awesome. Or will Ezra have turned him? Or will he have turned Ezra? Will the next mandalore reunite the Mando clans against Thrawn? Will Bo become mandalore and fail again, this time siding with Thrawn? Who knows, but I want to find out."
The Graveyard Story,This is such a miserable sub.
The Graveyard Story,This sucks
The Graveyard Story,So will we have to watch Ahsoka to understand season 4?
The Graveyard Story,"I have no hopes for Ahsoka. Dangling Thrawn in front of the old fans is not enough, and Ahsoka as a person is the most boring, straight-lacedm personality-free White-Hat Cowboy heroine in all of Star Wars. No sense of humor, no undercurrents. Leia had oceans more personality because she actually gets angry and is a good strategist."
The Graveyard Story,"That sounds like a lot of fucking Star Wars, maybe too much"
The Graveyard Story,They’re setting up Ezra to take over Grogus Jedi training.
The Graveyard Story,Too much stars wars content.  Burned me out
The Graveyard Story,I don’t know why they’re doing this. I liked the mandalorian but I’m never gonna watch season 3 because I can’t finish the Boba Fett show. Would likely be the same with Ashoka tbh.
The Graveyard Story,"Weird, it’s not like SW fans are anal about lore or anything…"
The Graveyard Story,"I feel like I’m the only person happy with everything so far, BOBF was the worst show, but I still enjoyed it, and I love how the shows come together. I also completely don’t understand how people think there are too many shows"
The Graveyard Story,The hype is utterly dead for this and anything else Star Wars related
The Graveyard Story,Why can’t Disney ever just a Star Wars series be it’s own separate thing. They always have to ruin it by mixing it with others or by bringing back the sky walkers. Really annoying tbh.
The Graveyard Story,I thought they were supposed to just make that shit up as they go along. Somehow Grogu returned….
The Graveyard Story,I don't want to watch anymore Starwars or Marvel and its sad as they used to be some of my fav universes.
The Graveyard Story,Too bad none of them even come close to being as good as Andor
The Graveyard Story,This should definitely be the way.
The Graveyard Story,Let's a go!
The Graveyard Story,Quality over quantity people Liam Neeson was right about the franchise being watered down
The Graveyard Story,Only a Sith Deals in Absolutes
The Graveyard Story,"It would be nice to see on the news

“The Mandalorian Season 5 is already written so that it’s story fits perfectly with the season Premier of ‘Luke Skywalker’ series” !"
The Graveyard Story,Ugh
The Graveyard Story,"Kind of wish they did a trilogy of movies or hell, even a single movie. Star Wars has always thrived with the spectacle of a theater experience. Avatar and others have seemed to fill in that gap in the theater and now Star Wars shows are designated to a Disney+ MCU knock off without the character development that you'd think a long form format would contain. Mandalorian is alright, but all the others have been subpar at best."
The Graveyard Story,"Here is hoping for time travel / dimensional shenanigans to reset the world ..lol.

Yes i know it wont happen they are going to another galaxy to build a new world/ story they control outside of all existing history ...."
The Graveyard Story,So they have a…plan.
The Graveyard Story,Something I had zero concerns about
The Graveyard Story,…so why didn’t you do this for the sequel trilogy?
The Graveyard Story,"Will probably go Mando 3 -> Ahsoka -> Boba Fett 2 -> Mando 4

A potential Obi Wan 2 would be mostly stand alone at this point. 

I for one am excited to watch all these."
The Graveyard Story,It would seemed they have learned something from the sequel trilogy
The Graveyard Story,This is the way.
The Graveyard Story,"This is the way. Not like the travesty the sequels were. Like them or hate them, no one can argue that they were well planned in advance."
The Graveyard Story,Just so long as I don't have to watch another show to get Din's story. I hate this tangled web of crisscrossing shows because some are good and some are garbage. They should stay separate.
The Graveyard Story,This is going to turn into a Star Wars Averngers two movie ending.
The Graveyard Story,But the fact that it didn’t fit perfectly with other shows is part of what made it great 😞
The Graveyard Story,Star Wars fatigue.
The Graveyard Story,What episodes of Boba Fett do I have to watch to understand Mando season 3?
The Graveyard Story,Star Wars should always have a fucking plan I’m not applauding them for starting to do what they’re suppose to do in the first place
The Graveyard Story,[Endless trash!](https://youtu.be/Ut5sk0RUlS4)
The Graveyard Story,Boooooo!
The Graveyard Story,Ok but I'd rather not watch those.
The Graveyard Story,I hope Andor S2 doesn't fit shit.
The Graveyard Story,This… is concerning.
The Graveyard Story,Just like how “Kenobi” fits perfectly by having Obi Wan hang around 10 year old Leia and then that’s never mentioned again in the movies? Gtfo here. Nothing is connected antmore
The Graveyard Story,I know people hate it but I love that The Book of Boba Fett and other 1-2 season short stories are baked into the storyline. It makes the system seem very dynamic with lots of these little things going on at the same time.
The Graveyard Story,They’re taking more care planning the Mandalorian/Star Wars TV verse than they did the damn sequel trilogy.
The Graveyard Story,Ron burgundy: “ I don’t believe you.”
The Graveyard Story,"Still processing GOT trauma, this head line soothes a tv loving soul."
The Graveyard Story,Oh my god who fucking cares. Can we please be done with valuing our entertainment by how well designed it is to suck us into a brand
The Graveyard Story,*sigh*
The Graveyard Story,"I have lost all hope entirely for disney and star wars.

Literally the only thing i enjoy besides the mandalorian is bad batch"
The Graveyard Story,"Please don't make Ahsoka be The Mandalorian season 3.5  

I like Mando and Ahsoka and it was cool they met a few times, but they don't have to have interlinked stories. Ahsoka's meant to be in the unknown regions with sabine finding Ezra and Thrawn, Mando's got his own stuff. The universe is huge.   

Have the Jedi academy be a kind of hub, characters from all shows might pop in or out but don't do serious plot progression like Grogu and Mando reuniting, or getting a new ship, in a different show and expect everyone to have watch the book of boba fett"
The Graveyard Story,"what is the problem? of course they should be connected, that's the whole reason why they are having so many shows in the same timeline. Would be weird if they would never met again."
The Graveyard Story,Is it going to be more or less boring ?
The Graveyard Story,Trying to connect all the properties just ends in a mess. Learn from marvel Phase one and quit while you're ahead.
The Graveyard Story,Another show where I have to watch a dozen hours of a different show to understand what's happening. Yay!
The Graveyard Story,retcon retcon retcon
The Graveyard Story,"The proliferation of all of these TV shows is how you deplete the hardcore fans. They can’t keep up, and because of it they lose interest. Their communities fall apart."
The Graveyard Story,"Oh good, I was losing sleep."
The Graveyard Story,"I do not care how any of this “connects”. That isn’t entertaining, it’s just a shallow way of placating viewers who care more about “consistency” than good storytelling. They are infantilizing their audience. 

The Mandalorian has never been an amazing show (it’s repetitive and stake-less), but the first season was a harmless distraction. Now it’s become the lynch pin for a bunch of other lazily made Star Wars “content”. This is all made more baffling if you’ve seen Andor which operates at a level of quality extremely far beyond the scope of the other shows.

Disney is so terrified of making any big moves with this thing that the stories now operate in this suffocating pressure chamber of bad “lore” it feels it has to adhere to and reinforce. It’s like sewing a seam but just keeps sticking the needle in and out of the same couple of centimetres of fabric and trying to see how many stitches it can fit in there."
The Graveyard Story,"I’m glad I don’t let Reddit dictate what I should like or not like. This comment section is hilarious, I swear none of you actually like anything, you just use things to shit on other things. This show was gods gift to star wars, wasn’t it? Or was it just because you liked it more than the last jedi? Is Andor garbage too? Because you guys are saying that it’s better than mandalorian."
The Graveyard Story,"man, the strike in 07 wreaked havoc on so many great shows."
The Graveyard Story,There's a strike about to happen?
The Graveyard Story,Considering that Jon Favreau just pretty much writes all the scripts by himself idk how much that would’ve even effected the Mandalorian lol.
The Graveyard Story,"I was 10 at that time, would you mind doing an ELI5 for me on what that strike was about?"
The Graveyard Story,"The honest truth is: I want everything to be part of a plan in a movie trilogy; and I want every show to be its own separate thing in a TV universe, with *maybe* the occasional character crossover but never critical to either show's plot

They're completely backwards on everything"
The Graveyard Story,Even an outline would have been helpful in that instance
The Graveyard Story,"It certainly would have helped. But the original trilogy was written without a definite plan as well, and it worked for the most part.

I think two bigger issues were:

1. Relying heavily on mysteries without having any answer to them. Who are Rey's parents? What happened to Luke? Who is Snoke? Who are the Knights of Ren? I believe the only mystery in the original trilogy that was thrown out without a plan was Yoda's ""there is another"" line.

2. No interest in following the story that came before it. Abrams just threw away everything from the original trilogy on an unexplained reset where we're somehow back to Empire vs. Rebels, the Empire is still being lead by an evil Sith lord, and the original characters are all split up. Johnson threw out what Abrams was building up to do his own thing, and then Abrams threw out what Johnson was building up to do something else.

The only one who actually seemed interested on following up on the story told by the previous films was Trevorrow. Whether or not people liked his script, it was the only one that seemed interested in turning the sequel trilogy into a coherent story."
The Graveyard Story,"You mean they should have spent a weekend writing an outline for a trilogy instead of just spending billions on the idea of a trilogy? 

Whaaaaat?!"
The Graveyard Story,That’s how the OT was written.

Three Days of Christmas,Just now realizing Kimmy Schmidt occurs in the 30 Rock universe.
Three Days of Christmas,Shame but at least I can still watch the Queen’s speech.
Three Days of Christmas,"In fairness, the UK Christmas charts has become even more of a farce in the last couple of years due to their refusal to play (or even acknowledge) anti-Boris Johnson songs charting in the Christmas top ten."
Three Days of Christmas,"Dunno about Britain, but in the US there is barely any “pops” left. It’s all cheaply made corporate owned crap pumped out by the one company that owns all the radio stations now."
Three Days of Christmas,"Watching this during Xmas dinner was a tradition in our house. I don't even follow and/or like most modern pop music, but it's still sad to hear this news."
Three Days of Christmas,*moves it to 10.40pm on BBC2
Three Days of Christmas,"As an American, I was so confused by the Christmas #1 song storyline the first time I saw Love Actually. We don't have anything even remotely similar. Even the idea of watching TV on Christmas at all (like the Downton Abbey Christmas special) is generally odd to us. Our TV shows usually show their Christmas themed episodes in early December and then it's repeats until after New Year's."
Three Days of Christmas,I have some bad news for you mate…
Three Days of Christmas,"They can't really play a song with the word ""cunt"" in the title on a primetime family TV show on Christmas Day."
Three Days of Christmas,"In the UK, the charts are a massive mess and corrupt beyond fixing. For instance, during the Queen's Royal Jubilee week, The Kunts single ""Prince Andrew is a Sweaty Nonce"" outsold Kate Bush's ""Running Up The Hill"" by 2 units to 1. 

Kate Bush was number 1, Kunts were number 20."
Three Days of Christmas,It's not the same thing. By the sounds of the description it seems to be just a clip-show from other BBC performances this year.
Three Days of Christmas,"What is it you don't get? No different to thanksgiving when you all watch tv as a family.  Also don't movies actually open on Christmas day? Now going to the cinema on Christmas day, that's weird."
Three Days of Christmas,I assume because you guys get less holiday and family’s can be spread so far apart that on holidays you guys actually want to see and speak to everyone while over here we are sick of our family by Christmas Day so tv is a nice distraction
Three Days of Christmas,I am in England and I don't remember ever watching anything other than kids stuff on Christmas day to keep them quiet. Too busy getting drunk and eating. Never in my life have I even seen the queens speech for example which is apparently a tradition for some
Three Days of Christmas,The BBC have axed that too? ffs
Three Days of Christmas,"Both songs had a radio friendly SFW edit called ""Boris Johnson is a Sausage Roll"", so they absolutely could've played those. Plenty of songs have swearing & also radio friendly versions."
Three Days of Christmas,"There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply.."
Three Days of Christmas,They cunt get approval from the regulators
Three Days of Christmas,And the sad thing is the ones with that in the title are the nicer ones!
Three Days of Christmas,"Sales aren't the only factor in the chart though, streaming is included too and The Kunts didn't make any impact there at all unfortunately."
Three Days of Christmas,"My understanding is that there's a few football games ""on"" during thanksgiving but no one sits down to watch it with rapt attention like it's the superbowl. You just kinda leave it on for light entertainment when you or your guests aren't cooking or attending to hosting."
Three Days of Christmas,">	No different to thanksgiving when you all watch tv as a family.

What? My family has never done this. If anything we’re less likely to watch a show together on thanksgiving than just any random day. I guess some people watch (American) football but that’s usually with extended family more than your kids I would imagine?"
Three Days of Christmas,"Yeah mate, they even had a week long announcement about the cancellation on the BBC. Sorry :("
Three Days of Christmas,Ladbaby would probably sue
Three Days of Christmas,"I get where you're coming from. Like, lots of people watch the parade, football, and maybe the dog show together - or by ""together"" we mean that like grandpa is watching while everyone else is cooking or feeling guilty about watching tv while someone is cooking - but I understand the confusion of the concept of people watching tv in general together on Thanksgiving."
Three Days of Christmas,"Well clearly lots of you do, I've seen the ratings."
Three Days of Christmas,This is one of the funniest shows around
Three Days of Christmas,Love me some Drew Tarver. Whenever he’s on Comedy Bang Bang it’s always gold
Three Days of Christmas, Molly Shannon is such a scene stealer in this show.
Three Days of Christmas,So hyped! This show deserves so much more attention!
Three Days of Christmas,this show is very underappreciated
Three Days of Christmas,In other news: Laura Dern fell today.
Three Days of Christmas,\#mydadfroze
Three Days of Christmas,Can't wait for this to be unceremoniously tossed out there with little to no marketing and shortly cancelled like South Side was
Three Days of Christmas,"Jesus fucking slays,  
He fucking slays all goddamned day,  
And you know it  

Jesus fucking slays,  
So we should party in his name,  
Do real dope shit"
Three Days of Christmas,"Gimme more songs like Stink, it’s a fucking banger"
Three Days of Christmas,"Everybody say it with me, “the grind never stops, but it can stop if you want it to and that’s what’s cool about the grind!”"
Three Days of Christmas,"I didn’t know this show existed until someone recently compared it to Difficult People. I checked it out and couldn’t believe how good it was. Legitimately funny and genuinely sweet at times without dissolving the cruelty and cynicism. Everybody on the show shines, and Ken Marino is a fucking icon"
Three Days of Christmas,"Nice, I loved the other two seasons"
Three Days of Christmas,Yay I'm glad this show was spared and will be back.
Three Days of Christmas,"Nice! Was cool to see Josh* Segarra pop up in Scream 6, kept waiting for him to say ""Oh Hell Yeah"" and dab"
Three Days of Christmas,Funny show. Perhaps a rewatch of S1&S2 is in order to rekindle the mood.
Three Days of Christmas,Gimme more Sykes.
Three Days of Christmas,"[whispers] 🎵 Patty cake, patty cake, baker’s man. Bake me a party as dope as you can.."
Three Days of Christmas,Hope they make a good final season!
Three Days of Christmas,LOVED this show. Molly Shannon is amazing.
Three Days of Christmas,"Started it. 

It’s fucking excellent"
Three Days of Christmas,"Nice, I was waiting impatiently for this news. Very funny show."
Three Days of Christmas,It’s pretty funny.  Glad it’s gonna have another season
Three Days of Christmas,Fuck ya
Three Days of Christmas,Mykonos how look
Three Days of Christmas,Thank you!
Three Days of Christmas,Fantastically funny show. Big laughs.
Three Days of Christmas,"Oh thank fuck.

With all the HBOMax shenanigans, I was legitimately worried for this show"
Three Days of Christmas,Anyone else notice how HBO Max is now being referred to as “The Max”? Just me?
Three Days of Christmas,We just got season 2 in Canada. Hope we're not waiting a year for this season as well.
Three Days of Christmas,yeeeeesasssssddYTGAFWQDYUTQWERGKUJghwdfkhlWSEFHKLJ;Sd
Three Days of Christmas,"I actually thought season two was pretty hacky, heres hoping they up their game for season 3."
Three Days of Christmas,Debatable
Three Days of Christmas,I wonder how ridiculous his voice will be this season
Three Days of Christmas,"Also, his appearances on *Off Book* (the improvised musical podcast). Episodes 3, 120, and 253, so far."
Three Days of Christmas,He’s great but don’t you dare talk to his granddaughter
Three Days of Christmas,"Last summer, I got to see Ben Schwartz and Friends and the Friends were Drew Tarver Ryan Gaul and Katie Dippold.  IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME!!!"
Three Days of Christmas,https://youtu.be/h9V-4CkDMso
Three Days of Christmas,"When I first watched this show I didn't pay attention to actor names and was like ""Hey, Quentin Coldwater from The Magicians is in this!  Cool!""  Was very surprised when I googled the cast and saw that Drew Tarver and Jason Ralph are two different people despite looking like identical twins."
Three Days of Christmas,Honk honk Truck’s birthdaaay
Three Days of Christmas,And teachers lounge
Three Days of Christmas,She does it in nearly everything. Especially her Will and Grace episodes back in the day.
Three Days of Christmas,Between this and *I Love That For You* she's kind of cornered the market on daytime television host parodies and I love it.
Three Days of Christmas,I watched it for the first time last summer and I was completely blown away by how good it was since I rarely see it mentioned. It’s so fucking funny but also has a ton of heart without ever becoming overly sappy or serious. So excited for s3
Three Days of Christmas,I wish gay news was a real thing
Three Days of Christmas,#chom
Three Days of Christmas,"We're kind of playing with house money imo. 

Sure it can still be cancelled, but the show started on Comedy Central in 2019, went through the pandemic and didn't cancelled, then moved to streaming in 2021 and now we've had another two years between seasons. Honestly not a bad run considering everything."
Three Days of Christmas,"Literally what I was thinking too. I’ll enjoy the hell out of this season, but I fully expect it to be canceled too."
Three Days of Christmas,"Considering how much of a struggle it was to get everyone around for filming this season due to busy schedules, and considering the fact that they started filming AFTER all the Zaslav-era axings began, if they didn't write this season in a way that could serve as a satisfactory wrap-up, that's on them.

I say this as someone who LOVES this show. I also assume the season was written BEFORE the aforementioned Zas cancellations, but they rewrote parts of season 2 during the pandemic after filming 4 episodes pre-COVID. They should be expecting the end."
Three Days of Christmas,What!   South Side is canceled??  I am sooo sad.
Three Days of Christmas,"Yeah feel the same. Hope for more but this is likely gonna be the last season. Honestly with the current streaming climate and the fact we haven’t heard anything about this show in ages, it’s half a miracle season 3 didn’t get un-renewed"
Three Days of Christmas,"Yeah I hope they wrote this as a satisfying conclusion because I don’t see it getting a fourth season, even though it fully deserves it."
Three Days of Christmas,Truly a lit track
Three Days of Christmas,Your audience remembers so much
Three Days of Christmas,I see what you did there
Three Days of Christmas,"*Josh Segarra

He was also in She-Hulk!"
Three Days of Christmas,"His character is so sweet and genuine that I had a hard time reconciling the fact that he was the overarching villain in *Arrow* season 5. Like, my brain couldn't accept that it was the same person."
Three Days of Christmas,Is this officially the final season?
Three Days of Christmas,"Anyone notice that they call it a 'Max Original', ignoring the fact that the show launched in 2019 on Comedy Central and HBOmax did not launch until 2020?"
Three Days of Christmas,Not debatable
Three Days of Christmas,if you’re stupid
Three Days of Christmas,That is how opinions work
Three Days of Christmas,oh fuCK OFF
Three Days of Christmas,Don't do it.
Three Days of Christmas,"Oh wow, I didn't know about this one - thanks!"
Three Days of Christmas,"Pound sign makes reddit enlarge and bold the following text. A preceding backslash will disable any subsequent markups on that line.

Three Days of Christmas,I watched the first season when it came out in 2019 i thought it had already been cancelled lol so this is great news to me
Three Days of Christmas,"Yuuup, a damn shame too, both it and The Other Two are absolutely two of the best comedies in recent memory."
Three Days of Christmas,It's not but we're playing with house money here. This is the exact sort of show Warner/Discovery has been cancelling.
Three Days of Christmas,I couldn't go past the third episode it was so childish.
Three Days of Christmas,Do you have beef that needs to stay where you put it?

Virgin River,So Netflix has morphed into Lifetime
Virgin River,"Virgin River took a turn into hyper-Christian nonsense last season, show started out decent but it’s now unbearable"
Virgin River,"Virgin River might be my favourite show of 2022.
I want to climb into the TV and spend an afternoon knitting at jacks bar"
Virgin River,even the best hbo shows dont get viewers
Virgin River,Always has been
Virgin River,can't believe that river hasn't been fucked yet
Virgin River,This news makes my mom very happy.
Virgin River,"Star **Ben Hollingsworth who plays Brady** on the show **posted some images on Instagram** that shows him with a motorcycle and says :

> Day 1 on Season 5. Lets gooooooooo! #VirginRiver #Netflix

**[Instagram Link](https://www.instagram.com/p/CgkjgQEv95q/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=)**"
Virgin River,Rare job security for actors working for Netflix.
Virgin River,Ahh the good ole “let me see if I can scoff the hardest at the Netflix headline” comment on a thread about Netflix. It’s getting predictable
Virgin River,"Well, it works every time so I don’t see why people won’t continue doing it.

Anyone who wants the slightest of karma can just bash Netflix in here and get what they want."
Virgin River,How is it pretentious?
Virgin River,"It's a soap opera. A non-confrontational saccharin romance story. For the most part women speak a different emotional language than men. Stories about relationships between siblings and parents and their children or friendship is very satisfying to them. My girlfriend also watches that 90 Day fiance stuff. Pretty sure she doesn't want me in the room when she's watching it because I can't stop making snarky remarks. I want spaceships, laser beams and explosions. That's emotionally satisfying. I'm sure she thinks my shit is boring too."
Virgin River,It’s a mom show.
Virgin River,Virgin River is a lot of things but pretentious is not one of them
Virgin River,My wife watches this show on her TV & I watch want I want on my TV. I could care less what see watches.
Virgin River,"It's like watching The Lifetime channel meets Hallmark. They should rename it ""First world problems"""
Virgin River,Bahahahahahahaha
Virgin River,"My wife loves it.

I haven’t seen it."
Virgin River,"I just watched the season 1 trailer because I had never heard of it. It looks pretty bad. Is it supposed to be a comedy? Because I'm high right now and everything is usually really funny but it didn't make me smile even. If you want something funny, and bad. Check out How to Build a Sex Room. It's the worst parts of every type of reality show, all rolled into one. And it can't decide what it wants to be. It's part This Old House, and one of those house flipping shows. But also tries to focus on the couples and their sex lives. And the lady is just a decorator but she acts like she's saving the world. And everything is just as cringy as possible. Like bringing a couple to a kink coach. And then when they ask the husband if he wants to try what they were showing him, he says in the interview portion that flogging his wife felt awkward at first but... Yada yada. And I was thinking, of course it was awkward. There's 3 strangers watching you. And why do you need a coach? People can figure this shit out."
Virgin River,"did she take away the remote? you have to watch your shows in the kitchen?

don't let her put a thumbs up on it.. all kinds of shit will show up ""recommended""

....go downvote right now as a matter of fact."
Virgin River,It knows the difference between drivel and dribble.
Virgin River,"Same, but FFS this show..."
Virgin River,This made me laugh because the only other time I've heard of this show is my mom telling me about watching it.
Virgin River,Bruh there's already 3 seasons what...
Virgin River,This is such a good show. I thought I was going to hate it but it’s the ultimate Sunday night glass of wine type show. S3 got a bit silly with all the ott stuff going on every episode so I hope S4 calms down a bit on that front.
Virgin River,Is this the show that middle age women finger themselves while watching?
Virgin River,People like things you don't / don't watch.
Virgin River,This and Sweet Magnolias are the Wine demo
Virgin River,"Ya must’ve hit a nerve, all those downvotes lol, it’s true tho."
Virgin River,nah that's Bridgerton
Virgin River,"Stupid, tacky show and I love it."
Virgin River,S3 was the weakest season but still fun. I’ll start this nonsense day 1 with a bottle of wine.
Virgin River,I'm still waiting to find out why Brick Breeland changed his name when he moved to Virgin River from Bluebell.
Virgin River,"I remember his AMA where every time someone asked him about Vampire Diaries and The Originals, he made no effort to hide the fact that he clearly didn't like the show."
Virgin River,oh i had no idea roku had the us rights to newsreader. been wanting to check it out.
Virgin River,Just watched the first episode of this - BBC2 have it here. Really quite good. Anna Torv in particular.
Virgin River,Dudes chin could be in the Illuminati
Virgin River,it's very watchable - enjoy.
Virgin River,Probably a cheap AF show that gets them a ton of views. Makes sense
Virgin River,Is this show actually good? Was thinking of watching because it looked easy to leave on
Virgin River,"It also makes it one of the rarer Netflix shows to get past Season 3 and even rarer to get a two-season renewal at that point. Good for the fans honestly.

That being said, I wouldn't be surprised if Season 5 was the last season and this was a deal to wrap things up."
Virgin River,If you don't read to much into some of the plots it's a really good show. Perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon
Virgin River,"I really enjoyed watching it, not the best show but far from the worst Netflix has to offer."
Virgin River,Yes. It’s not going to tax your brain but it’s an easy watch. S3 got a bit silly but it’s still a very enjoyable show.
Virgin River,It's like comfort food. Don't expect it to blow your mind but it sometimes hits those notes that make you feel fuzzy inside. I turn it on while browsing the internet or catching up on errands
Virgin River,"I liked the first two seasons, but could not get past the first couple of episodes of season three."
Virgin River,"Reddit likes going on about Netflix cancelling shows on their third season, but it's exaggerated. So many shows have 4+ seasons.

Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Ozark, Bojack, Big Mouth, Grace & Frankie, Dear White People, F is for Family, Elite, Money Heist, Queer Eye, Nailed It, World's Toughest Prisons, Terrace House and so on.. That's not including a bunch of others I would have missed, as well as kids shows, etc.

They cancel the shows that aren't popular enough, or cost too much (or both). In this age of streaming, I feel like it's really hard to argue against a show being cancelled, when these streaming platforms have exactly the figures they need to determine whether a show is popular. It no longer matters which channel, timeslot or day its on. Hell, with Netflix, even advertising isn't overly necessary."
Virgin River,"To me it sounds like the opposite, I think Season 5 is far from being the last.

I may be biased because I love the main characters, but I’m not blind to the obvious issues this show has, but is comfort tv and it’s just what it is, it’s also cheap and brings huge numbers, which is a winner in Netflix’s book.

I never in a million years expected a 2 season renewal for a series like this. Never."
Virgin River,I find it interesting that this is basically the same show as Hart of Dixie... and both involve Tim Matheson as a small country doctor.
Virgin River,You’re going to tell me that’s not Zac Efron on the left?… ok ok
Virgin River,"Similar premise, completely different tones however."
Virgin River,"im surprised i haven't considered watching this show yet, maybe eventually."
Virgin River,They actually have Redditors on staff to make sure the River stays a virgin one
Virgin River,Really liked this show. Not my usual thing but very easy to watch. The photography is stunning also.
Virgin River,I cannot wait!
Virgin River,[deleted]
Virgin River,The 2nd season was disappointing
Virgin River,Take it easy. I normally would never watch stuff like that but I enjoyed the two seasons so far.
Virgin River,I find it very chill. A little daytime soapy but generally chill.
Virgin River,I guess that's why I like it. I would say chill is what describes me.
Virgin River,Should’ve been Jonathan Majors. He was the best thing about that last episode. Magnetic performance.
Virgin River,"Liseys Story was bad bordering on terrible imo, but sure I guess Moore did her level best."
Virgin River,"It was a hell of an intro. However, [spoiler](#s ""given that this variant of Kang died and he was the ""devil you know,"" I wonder how Majors will switch up his performances when the other variants show up. I want this Kang. I am going to miss this Kang."")

Still, Hiddleston is no slouch. He is really good at making you cry. You are watching him give this heartbreaking performance and BOOM! Surprise tears! Like, *come on, I wasn't planning on crying.* Well, you should have because it's Hiddleston."
Virgin River,He was terrible.
Virgin River,You’re entitled to your opinion and I won’t downvote it but I would think you’re mostly on your own in that opinion.
Virgin River,I agree it felt all over the place and annoying.
Virgin River,"Keep in mind that he was playing a character who had been driven insane by old age  and having seen the same things over and over again.

 By bringing in the Loki's there, he essentially engaged in Russian Roulette seemingly hoping it would end his life."
Virgin River,"Yes! The timeline makes absolutely no sense but I love this cheesy-ass show. Wonder if they'll film the next two seasons back to back, since they're currently in production on season four."
Virgin River,"This show is my guilty pleasure so its nice that it got renewed. I love the scenery and the music choices for the show. 

That being said I thought season three was pretty bad. I hate charmaine and and some of these storylines are annoying. I will continue to watch though"
Virgin River,"So, a new twist on Hart of Dixie?"
Virgin River,Does every small town just have handsome bar men waiting for someone from the big city to fall in love with them?
Virgin River,"If you told me this show was made in 1997, I would believe you."
Virgin River,It looks like a Lifetime or Hallmark show.
Virgin River,is the doctors practice from this series actually the same one as in hart of dixie?
Virgin River,this is literally a fake version of hart of dixie wtf
Virgin River,oof that looks atrocious.
Virgin River,"Same story, some of the same actors playing some of the same parts, different town name. Watch Heart of Dixie 2: Dixie All Over AGAIN!!!!"
Virgin River,So maybe Hart of Dixie actually took its inspiration from the book?
Virgin River,[deleted]
Virgin River,I think my mom will probably like this
Virgin River,This is like the great value version of hart of Dixie. Can't believe they can even legally produce the same exact show with worse actors
Virgin River,"I just watched three and a half episodes of this show and this is all you need to know: They remind you it's a small town several times per episode (we get it.. it's a small town), Mel hangs up on her sister every episode, doctor is a cliche grumpy ""old school"" caricature, you see the ""mystery"" of Mel's trauma coming a mile away before the first episode even ends, the bartender is also a cliche, and he spends every episode making googly eyes at Mel who wears a wedding ring yet no one has even questioned it.. the show is awful. I can't continue watching."
Virgin River,So many cliches.
Virgin River,"Im sorry, did i wake up back in 2009?"
Virgin River,What is the song at 1:01 onwards? Anybody?
Virgin River,When I saw Brick I was just like wtf
Virgin River,"Same, as soon as I saw Tim Matheson, first thing that came to mind was Hart of Dixie."
Virgin River,Hart of dixie seemed more interesting than this
Virgin River,I also thought the same thing. Hart of Dixie remake.
Virgin River,Same actor
Virgin River,It looks like the same set! haha
Virgin River,Bring hart of Dixie back😭
Virgin River,Why?
Virgin River,This is based on a book not made up TV show like heart of dixie
Virgin River,Looks like it’s trailer meant for Instagram that ended up on YouTube. They usually have different ratios for different platforms.
Virgin River,"SPOILER 

Would you mind explaining Mel's trauma so I don't have to keep watching? What happened to the husband?"
Virgin River,"In the first episode? I think it's the Weepies' ""World Spins Madly On""."
Virgin River,"And the handsome bartender, like Wade."
Virgin River,And he seems to be playing the same character too
Triad Princess,Isn’t Us & Them a Netflix original? Flavors of Youth? I’ve seen Chinese products before on if.
Triad Princess,I thought ghosts were a big no no in China?
Triad Princess,Expect homophobia and zero LGBT representation.
Triad Princess,The Ghost Bride seems to have gotten some of its costume design wrong other then that it is good.
Triad Princess,Expect me to prolly not watch..
Triad Princess,[removed]
Triad Princess,Accidentally in Love is also Chinese
Triad Princess,"Prob targeting immigrant Chinese in america. Singapore, Malay, etc. Or Taiwan"
Triad Princess,"Nowhere Man has a major LGBT character, one of the better written characters in the show too."
Triad Princess,"Since there is rap music I was wondering if that was a concious choice!  Definitely felt different than mainland ""historical"" dramas"
Triad Princess,"Almost a sentence, A for effort"
Triad Princess,The Stranger Things Christmas Special sounds like a spectacularly bad idea.
Triad Princess,"Excited for Marriage Story, I've only read good things about it. Seems like Laura Dern might win a Oscar for it which she should because she's a national treasure"
Triad Princess,I’m excited/curious about Marriage Story.
Triad Princess,"YOU: Season 2 really excites me. I was absolutely blown away with how good the show was, and I'm hoping that it doesnt branch away from the vibe of the first season."
Triad Princess,"Really looking forward to season 2 of Lost In Space, the first season was pretty great."
Triad Princess,Is Locke and Key ever going to come out?
Triad Princess,[Let It Snow](https://youtu.be/pitxxQYZcug)
Triad Princess,[deleted]
Triad Princess,Hshs
Triad Princess,"I like Adam Driver too, but can we at least get a blurb that doesn't make me think that using a cheese grater on my junk would be more entertaining?"
Triad Princess,The Sabrina one wasn’t bad.
Triad Princess,"It's really brilliant. If it happens to be showing somewhere, check it out in cinemas."
Triad Princess,Agreed.   Just a fun show to watch that feels like the episodes fly by.
Triad Princess,Apparently filming finished in July.
Triad Princess,People like Christmas movies around Christmas?  Who knew?
Triad Princess,Is this the part where we kick you?
Triad Princess,"If you're saying everything else sounds generic, that just means you haven't watched them. Lost in Space sounded generic as fuck, but it was amazing. You shouldnt judge an entire tv show based on a one sentence description."
Triad Princess,">A stage director and his actor wife struggle through a gruelling, coast-to-coast divorce that pushes them to their personal and creative extremes."
Triad Princess,Interesting take...
Triad Princess,Oh really? For some reason I thought it was much longer than that. Thanks.
Triad Princess,yeah that sounds like a lifetime movie. gonna be a pass from  me. at least Girls had a gimmick.
Triad Princess,"Well you'd be missing out on a favourite for best picture and definitely one of the best movies of the year. It's a seriously brilliant film.

Also, blurbs aren't a good indicator of quality."
Triad Princess,"Some people just need ""gimmicks"" in their entertainment."
The Confession Killer,"Has anyone started this yet?  Any thoughts?  
  
I want to check it out but I'm wrapping up Reprisal on Hulu first."
The Confession Killer,It’s great and it will make you hate people
The Confession Killer,"I just love the music. I feel like it's way too 'funky' for some crime serial. I enjoyed the show and the interviews, they were great."
The Confession Killer,I binged it yesterday. No spoiler but that guy is an idiot.
The Confession Killer,I fucking hate Stuart Heritage
The Confession Killer,Absolutely worth watching! Binged it over the weekend. Couldn’t believe what I was seeing & hearing!
The Confession Killer,"Just finished this today. Mix between making a murderer and the Ted Bundy tapes. Good flow of information, not giving the complete story until the later half. Enjoyable enough."
The Confession Killer,"I started watching this but couldn't make it through the first episode and normally I love this type of stuff, was just a little unusually boring i thought"
The Confession Killer,"It will suck you in. It's pretty bonkers, like Abducted in Plain sight.   
You'll find yourself saying WTF a lot."
The Confession Killer,"It's very good. Knowing nothing of the story of this man going into it, I have to admit the first episode I kept thinking ""yep I know exactly where this is going"" and was constantly pretty wrong. Such a wave to ride."
The Confession Killer,"Tangent, but Reprisal is a trip, eh? Started watching based on Abigail Spencer and Hot Rods, watched it all because it is pretty damn engrossing (although there are a LOT of poor choices made by characters)"
The Confession Killer,Binged it all earlier today. It’s good. I couldn’t stop.
The Confession Killer,It’s pretty good. The American justice episode of it is pretty good too and it’s on YouTube.
The Confession Killer,"I just as disgusted with the Texas Rangers, they are almost the real villain. Disgusting behavior."
The Confession Killer,Is he jerk off the obvious pedophile level stupid?
The Confession Killer,"Out of all the idiots on the show, he’s pretty far down the list."
The Confession Killer,It gets pretty fuckin crazy after the first episode
The Confession Killer,"It's really unlike anything I've seen before.  It's like, half 50's rockabilly, half revenge noir.  Abigail Spencer is seriously fantastic in it.  And she looks so hot as a blonde.  Especially with how much of a badass she is in it.  
  
The overall story is a little weak and predictable but the performances and action carry it and make it worth watching."
The Confession Killer,Almost the real villain? Pretty sure they are completely terrible - the ones involved with this anyway.
The Confession Killer,First of all WUT
The Confession Killer,"Abducted in plain sight.

One of the weirdest things and most tragic things you'll ever see."
The Confession Killer,So there was this dude who was molesting this guys daughter and possibly sleeping with his wife. So they drove out to the lake to talk about it. The pedos defense was that he was just so damn horny all the time and he was sorry. and to prove he was so damn horny all the time he had the married father jerk him off so he could see what it was like. Said married Father then jerked off the pedo who was raping his daughter
The Confession Killer,"Seriously fuck that fat piece of shit ranger guy. 

He's only mad because he can't have fame for closing hundreds of cases. He is mad at the DA for finding faults? That sounds like some corrupt bullshit. 

""How dare you expose me. You just hate cops"" 

Of this whole doc, THAT was the thing that made my blood boil. The ol' blue wall of silence and ""how dare the DA go against the good old boys club"" 

Even that one old lady was like ""I don't like talkin bad about my brothers in uniform"" 

Why? Can you not see how that's just your uppity way of saying ""I aint no snitch""? If tjhey fucked up then what the hell is all this BS about not wanting to bad mouth. 

People wonder why trust in the police is declining. This is why. Every singe policeman that held those fraud rangers up despite the evidence are just as bad. 

And you could say that this was 20+ years ago, but their shitty mentality about it is still present in this doc current day. 

Great documentary."
The Confession Killer,"[The Last Podcast on The Left](https://soundcloud.com/lastpodcastontheleft/episode-182-henry-lee-lucas-part-one-from-the-womb-of-a-whore) do a great breakdown of this guy. Really interesting case. Also the movie [""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099763/) is surprisingly good."
The Confession Killer,Watching this trailer and reading a bit about the case -- looks pretty wild.
The Confession Killer,Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL895peZpqY)
The Confession Killer,/r/theconfessionkiller for anyone interested
The Confession Killer,I’m intrigued...
The Confession Killer,6th December on netflix btw
The Confession Killer,Fuck those Texas Rangers.
The Confession Killer,Fuck them for killing the DA's dog as well
The Confession Killer,"I made the comment before I saw that part. 

When that came up I actually had to turn of the documentary for a few days, I was so out of my mind angry. 

Every last one of those complicit bastards should suffer the same fate."
The Confession Killer,I watch the documentary the other day. It made the Texas Rangers look really bad.
The Confession Killer,He should of had a mental health advocate Cate from the start
The Confession Killer,"It is weird that the Texas Rangers have a good reputation. They’ve had dozens if not hundreds of cases where their misconduct led to wrongful death sentences or wrongful executions. 

If you even search for it, there are multiple cases that’ll probably result in multimillion dollar judgments for their blatant misconduct."
The Confession Killer,"Well they made some good trades this offseason, so they shouldn't be as bad next season."
The Confession Killer,Do they have any 'Mike Trout' type ridiculous contracts? Those are team *killers* IMO.
The Confession Killer,"What?! Trout is worth every penny and thensome of his contract. You've got an almost guaranteed MVP every single year. The Angels are burdened with Pujols/Upton/Cozart contracts, cause those have all been baaaaad. 

But their pitching is just hilariously bad."
The Confession Killer,Guys Ni'jah won 26 grammys.
The Confession Killer,"Damn, not that much a fan of her a music but Billie killed it as this weird cult leader figure in episode 4. I would totally watch an entire movie about her in that role"
The Confession Killer,"I've only watched the first two episodes so far but I'm enjoying it.  It definitely has a gritty, dark feel to it while balancing against the humor.  Some great up and coming stars in it too (it took me a minute to realize that Khalid was Franklin from Snowfall).    
  
I was curious, is the title cards in the beginning of each episode, 'This is a true story, any similarities to persons, living or dead is intentional'.  Is this more a tongue in cheek commentary about social media stalkers/stans or was there an actual case this is based on?"
The Confession Killer,"So dark! This show is wild AF but it's an entertaining take on stan culture. I definitely can't use stan anymore cause it's not that serious 😩😂

Can we talk about the dog being name Otis and the actor who played Marissa's dad in epi 5 who was in The Temptations movie 😂

'Aint nobody thinking bout you Otis!'"
The Confession Killer,Well this is bonkers. Obviously if you like Atlanta it's for you. I like it but can't binge it because I need to like...digest it and watch some light stuff to break it up.
The Confession Killer,The Show is twisted AF & I'm here for it. I've watched the first 4 episodes so far & really dig it.
The Confession Killer,Is Dre special needs? Flat out serious. I’m watching the first episode and I’m just trying to understand some of her actions/behavior.
The Confession Killer,"If Donald Glover is attached in any capacity I’m here for it, but the plot sounds good too. I’ll definitely give it a watch."
The Confession Killer,Stan culture getting dragged and I love it.
The Confession Killer,"Can anyone help with some observations/questions?? SPOILERS AHEAD

Did the parents ""really"" think Dre killed Marissa or were they just twisted? Did they think she actually murdered her or do they know she didn't return her calls for help? 

Do you think there's a possibility Dre did actually kill Marissa? She goes into fugue states and we've seen her send messages from Marissa's phone to herself. 

When Dre goes to Marissa's parents' house it's extremely grand and the parents are quite young. When we see it again in the crime documentary it's more humble (still nice though) and the mom is played by a different, older actor and the dad in the photos is a different, older actor too. Did she even go to the house? 

The singer is played by a different actor at the end, is she played by Chloe Bailey?"
The Confession Killer,Really enjoyed it but I'm not sure how I feel about that ending. Kept thinking >!it was a delusion Dre was having!< so that ending left me a bit puzzled. Wild show though. Nice to see Dominique Fishback again after The Deuce.
The Confession Killer,"Even though it's about a serial killer, because this is a Glover show, there are small instances of humor peppered in each episode. It's kind of like Barry, where you will be laughing at something absurd, and then someone gets gruesomely murdered right after it. The real life Beyonce references are all great, especially with the elevator fight, and the who but Beyonce mystery from years ago. The special guest actors have been good too."
The Confession Killer,The episode descriptions makes this come across as something that'd take place in the same universe as his Atlanta series and I'm all here for it.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention.  I'll likely order in a pizza and a bottle of Mariah Carey's Black Irish on drizly so I can sit down and watch this whole thing.
The Confession Killer,[deleted]
The Confession Killer,Episodes 6 and 7 confused me
The Confession Killer,"Gotta say it, Dre is pure Cringe."
The Confession Killer,Is this a miniseries or S1 of a longer story?
The Confession Killer,Can anyone share the real stories that were utilized in the show? Like any useful links?
The Confession Killer,Jfc just watched the first episode. I’m speechless. Wow.
The Confession Killer,[deleted]
The Confession Killer,"I just finished the fifth episode. This shit is wild. I find myself yelling at the screen at times, especially at the supporting characters. Someone should've since put Dre on the fucking floor. Loony psycho bitch."
The Confession Killer,Thank you Donald for getting Chloe Bailey to take buckshots in this show.
The Confession Killer,This show was such a great and gritty commentary on stans and fandoms-I think the murders really shed light on these tried stans. Gripping AF and I finished it in one sitting
The Confession Killer,I'm confused by the headline... Is his name in the show Stan? Or who is Stan?
The Confession Killer,I'm really confused about episodes 5 and 6. In 5 we see at presumably her former foster parents home and her foster dad chases her away with a gun. In episode 6 we get the police detective interviewing her former foster mother and it's a different actress and her husband is dead. Did I...miss something?
The Confession Killer,Passably entertaining but ultimately disappointing
The Confession Killer,What did you all think about Paris Jackson? I personally loved her as Halsey!
The Confession Killer,"Three different people are ""here for it""."
The Confession Killer,"I wish Dre had bangs the entire series, I know it messes with her character because she’s meant to have changed identities a bunch of times but it would funny if she had bangs with each new persona. It would also solidify her image as a serial killer, like with how so many killers in pop culture have iconic styles."
The Confession Killer,Can someone explain why they family didn’t want Dre at Marissas funeral in the first episode?
The Confession Killer,I hate Dre so much.
The Confession Killer,I really didn’t realize that “you know who” had won so many. And now I’m afraid to say anything publicly about “you know who.”
The Confession Killer,I'm just now realizing that was Billie Eilish 😳 . When I was watching the episode I kept thinking she looked familiar but I couldn't place her 😂
The Confession Killer,Billie Eilish really impressed me with her first acting debut.
The Confession Killer,That was my favorite episode. They were all strangely likable and then the ending had me rolling.
The Confession Killer,Not the same but there have been two documentaries about the NXIVM cult this strongly resembles with the branding but I haven’t watched either. There was also a male leader who had sex with everyone and blackmail via revealing photos and recordings and Hollywood d list stars and rich heiresses that make real life cult more fantastical than depicted here.
The Confession Killer,I thought it had more to do with Ni’Jah clearly being a stand in for Beyoncé.
The Confession Killer,In the 6th episode there is a true crime documentary type episode where it makes it seem like the show is based on a true story. It'll make sense when u get to that episode
The Confession Killer,"Janine Nabers answers this in an interview here 

https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/a43275160/swarm-janine-nabers/

“The pilot episode is based on a true event that existed on the internet. We started the story from there and kind of built off it with real events that happened in America between about 2016 and 2018. Obviously, because it’s TV, we’ve taken a little liberty. When I pitched the pilot story to [Glover], we knew that Dre, our lead character, was going to connect the dots to the rest of the story that we’re telling within this two-and-a-half-year time period.”"
The Confession Killer,"Can you (or anyone else) help me understand if this show is “scary”?  Like is it just creepy in a “Stranger Things” or “True Detective S1” way, or does it have legitimate horror elements?

Just trying to determine if I can watch this with my partner or not. Thanks!"
The Confession Killer,"> it took me a minute to realize that Khalid was Franklin from Snowfall

Yeah, I got a good chuckle out of seeing him, of all people, crying about how he's never seen a dead body before"
The Confession Killer,This show blurs the line between what’s real and fake nowadays. The disclaimer sets that tone.
The Confession Killer,Probably a Fargo reference too maybe?
The Confession Killer,OMG I forgot about this. This is the best comment right here.
The Confession Killer,I recognized him from real housewives of Atlanta lol he's the father of Cynthia Bailey's daughter
The Confession Killer,"""I'm David Ruffin"""
The Confession Killer,That's my guy Leon. He's played everyone from David Ruffin to MC Hammer. 5 Heartbeats is also a classic.
The Confession Killer,last episode is sad
The Confession Killer,It really keeps throwing curveballs at you in terms of how fucked up it can get. And I’m only on episode 2.
The Confession Killer,"I've only seen ep 1, but I noticed some autistic traits in her character."
The Confession Killer,She seems autistic for sure in the series
The Confession Killer,episode 6 heavily implies that >!she went through some traumatic episode when she was a kid.!<
The Confession Killer,Special needs? Idk but she's definitely not stable
The Confession Killer,"its good, i watched it today b4& after work. im a glover fan"
The Confession Killer,"Regarding the house and the parent actors: 

At the end of episode 6, >!the documentary, we see footage of Donald Glover on a red carpet talking about making the show Swarm. So the documentary that is episode 6 is from the ""real world,"" and the show Swarm we're watching is an adaptation of that ""true crime"" story. That's why the details/actors aren't exactly the same.!<"
The Confession Killer,">!I think the parents definitely think she had something to do with her death. Whether directly or indirectly. They didn't like her or care for her as a child and then they got rid of her. Then their blood daughter continues a relationship with her and ends up dead. They are definitely blaming Dre as either projection or they really think she killed her. And there is a definite possibility Dre did kill her, with all of Dre's hallucinations.!<"
The Confession Killer,"I think Dre was disappointed that Marissa put Khalid before Nijah, killed her and then went out clubbing. I also don’t think she could handle Marissa moving in with Khalid"
The Confession Killer,"The singer has Marissa's face on hers at the end to show that's not what happened in reality, only in Dre's imagination/hallucination. I think anyway. I'm not deep enough to fully get this show haha."
The Confession Killer,I also got the idea that she blacked out and killed Marissa when she tried to leave!
The Confession Killer,"My interpretation of the ending is that >!Dre was hallucinating that happy ending and that she actually was removed from the venue, arrested, and taken away in a police car. A similar hallucination to the biting scene, where she's biting into a plum (which to me looked like a piece of chocolate, but I'm pretty sure it was a plum).!<"
The Confession Killer,"Agreed. It doesn't seem like something that would really happen. It was like one of Dre's fantasies. I fully expected Ni'Ja to say ""Hey! That's the bitch who bit me!"""
The Confession Killer,Donald Glover said in an interview that they do in fact take place in the same universe
Glow Up,"I liked the first season, this should be nice."
Glow Up,"The first season was funny as fuck , you couldnt tell that from this promo"
Glow Up,I'm down for this. Such a shame that it was cancelled due to Covid.
Glow Up,"Good idea, that's what they did with Sense8 when Netflix cancelled them on a cliffhanger. Sure their movie was a bit of a rushed mess as they had to wrap up several seasons worth of plot in two and a half hours, but it gave the fans closure on all the characters."
Glow Up,Netflix is just building a library of unfinished originals that no one will want to watch. Its the reason I haven't started watching Santa Clara Diet.
Glow Up,Great idea. Hearing it was cancelled without a fair sendoff was a leglock to my heartstrings.
Glow Up,It really should and I hope it does. The season 2 finale felt like it could have been a show ender whereas the season 3 feels like a season finale rather than series finale. I hope they can work something out.
Glow Up,so should santa clarita diet and teenage bounty hunters. at least dead to me was announced as a final season so they can wrap things up. unless they cancel that one too after all.
Glow Up,Netflix should offer this to any series that makes it 3 or more seasons.  Having a film to wrap up the loose endings would make it a lot more likely that new viewers took up watching a series that had been cancelled.
Glow Up,"That should be their policy with all canceled Netflix series. It’s idiotic to can a show in order to have it in their catalogue. No one is going to start a series they know is unfinished.

And yes, I’m still a little salty they did that to Santa Clarita Diet. Go finish it!"
Glow Up,I'm seriously considering canceling my Netflix subscription because it's becoming a pain in the ass to get invested in shows only for them to be canceled.
Glow Up,#3seasonsandamovie
Glow Up,"I've been saying this about every Netflix series.  Do the Firefly/Serenity thing.  If you cancel a series before its completed, give it a movie to finish the story.  There have been plenty of shows on my list that I took off the list because they got abruptly canceled.  I still kinda want to watch those shows, but don't want to get into an unfinished story."
Glow Up,"I've suggested this to industry friends before and they look at me like I'm some sort of mutant, but I don't know why Eps/showrunners don't start putting ""series finale"" clauses into the deals that get their shows on the air.

I don't know how hard it would be to word something like ""If the show gets picked up for a third season, X million dollars goes into escrow to fund the production of a single or double length episode to wrap up the series, whenever that may be."" 

If the show gets canned like GLOW, fine. The money's already sitting in the bank and you just roll camera on the series finale.

If the show dies a natural death where the final season is announced well ahead of time, you still have that money sitting there and just deduct it from that final season's budget."
Glow Up,“Glow” was honestly one of Netflix’s best series. Easily in the top 5.
Glow Up,"That’s what I was saying just this morning. They did it for Sens8, and for that I’m extremely grateful. I wish when shows get cancelled that they would give it a closing movie. Wouldn’t be perfect, but it would give people closure."
Glow Up,"It’s a shame Netflix lost sight of the reason they started making their own shows, i.e., to have a catalogue of shows for people to watch so they don’t have to rely solely on other content providers.  They would have an awesome back catalogue if they let some of their shows run their course.  These shows would have enormous long-term value if they weren’t just axed in their prime."
Glow Up,Yes please.
Glow Up,Had no idea they cancelled it. That makes me sad. Enjoyed this show.
Glow Up,[removed]
Glow Up,"You fucking listen to Maron, God damn it, YOU FUCKING LISTEN TO HIM."
Glow Up,Netflix cancels all series way too early.   They’re brutal!!   I won’t even start watching a series now till it’s at least 3 seasons in.
Glow Up,Animated series with actors voicing their respective counterparts please
Glow Up,"Netflix either needs to stop cancelling shows so quickly, or get creators on board with making limited series.

I wasn’t really into Glow, but more of a general Netflix gripe."
Glow Up,"that wouldn't be an attractive prospect for Netflix for pretty-much the same reasons they've given for cancelling the show. the cast is large, which makes filming around covid complicated and expensive. if they wait, that means they release the film what, two years from now? by then the show will be a distant memory and there's no guarantee that it will get the views required to justify the expense. and the show is very physical, which means more time and money is spent on conditioning/training the actors and stunt performers, and there is always the possibility of an injury which is a massive liability for the production. 

it sucks, but i understand their logic."
Glow Up,"Netflix has surpassed Fox in terms of shows getting cancelled. I really really hate getting 3 or 4 seasons into a show and having it be cancelled. I stopped watching network TV because of it, I'm getting to the same point with Netflix"
Glow Up,They do need to properly end the series
Glow Up,I don't watch Netflix because they don't finish their fucking shows. Pure disrespect to the viewer and not worth my money when HBO exists.
Glow Up,"Lol forget his thoughts on GLOW, the best part is when he loses focus and starts talking to a squirrel."
Glow Up,"They just bring back 
Teenage bounty hunters or give us a movie, something"
Glow Up,This is what they should do for the Santa clarita diet
Glow Up,As should Santa Clarita Diet. Netflix will bankroll a shitty movie but won't give us movies to wrap up their shows that people loved.
Glow Up,"Fuck yeah it should, no excuse to cancel it outright."
Glow Up,"In this day and age of streaming service libraries, they should absolutely do this. This should become the norm for cancelled series that have a strong following (cause they're good) and left a bunch of storylines unfinished. Give the series closure so it can be recommended as part of the reason to sign up for Netflix/Amazon Prime/Hulu/HBOmax. Without the closure I (& I imagine most) don't recommend them as series to start watching. Or why you should sign up for a certain service in order to see the check out that series. 

The price/reward has to be worth it. I hate the cancelling of good series and never giving them closure. It creates diminishing returns which at a certain point causes us to stop giving new series a chance because we don't want another show we're into get cancelled."
Glow Up,"What’s the appeal in subscribing to Netflix? They don’t have nearly as much content as they used to. They have more originals, but most of them are terrible."
Glow Up,"This type of shit is why I cancelled my Netflix a while ago and haven't looked back.  Not one of their original series has been adequately wrapped up.  Everything is cancelled prematurely.  Yeah, no thanks.  I'll stick with HBO where at least their fuck ups fall on the showrunners."
Glow Up,Guy who has recently lost his job wants job to continue.
Glow Up,If they could film a finale movie they would be able to film a final season
Glow Up,You have to go 6 seasons before you get a movie.
Glow Up,Or.....OOOORRRR.....you could just finish the last season. This show didn't deserve to go out like this.
Glow Up,"*Actor says he wants to work some more*

Covering the important news, Collider."
Glow Up,Meeehhh. Season 3 was a huge downturn in quality as far as story telling goes. I don’t feel like the story needs much of a wrap up because the 3rd season barely had a story.
Glow Up,Marc!!! I agree.
Glow Up,At lease release the scripts so I can get some closure! Please. I’ll take a novel...a graphic novel?
Glow Up,"Netflix Execs: “sure!”

also Netflix Execs: “apparently we have a show called Glow”"
Glow Up,"Maron's girlfriend / GLOW director Lynn Shelton passed away a few months ago, and now they get canceled. This sucks."
Glow Up,"I've already been doing it, but this is just more justification to not watch Netflix shows until they are completed. They cancel shit with reckless abandon (Covid or no), even stuff which seems relatively popular."
Glow Up,The OA should get that as well.
Glow Up,"Too many of their shows lately are getting canned without any closure and it drives me nuts.  It’s My Name Is Earl all over again, and that one hurt."
Glow Up,this was a good show.   how dumb.  one of there better original programs.
Glow Up,Netflix: No. Instead we're going to make a film that sexualises \* spins  roulette \* ... grandmas.
Glow Up,GLOW should get a fucking Season 4 as was promised.  I'll settle for a movie.
Glow Up,They should do the same thing for Santa Clarita Diet.
Glow Up,Agreed
Glow Up,"There is motivation for them to do this sort of thing, (you know respect the audience, content and the people behind it) but it isn’t from the subscriber-revenue side. It is from the future-exclusives side. 

No one is likely to cancel their subscription over something like this, but when a new treatment is getting shopped around, the show runners will be less likely to sign with Netflix if they see a high likelihood of an early cancellation. 

If they want to stay top of mind as a supportive partner to developers of premium content, they should probably not be so cavalier about chopping their stories off mid way."
Glow Up,"Yes, 100x yes."
Glow Up,Who cares? Both season 2 and 3 sucked. Couldn’t even finish season 3
Glow Up,No it shouldn’t. The 3rd season fucking sucked.
Glow Up,No one cares about this show
Glow Up,I’m a big Marc Maron fan but didn’t really like the show. stilled watched it though.
Glow Up,"I loved this series, so wonderfully feminist, and a dose of Marc Marin to boot. 💝"
Glow Up,I disagree
Glow Up,"Fuckin’ A. Tell em’, Marc. 

He’s probably one of the very few people on Netflix that could take it or leave it (from a career/financial standpoint) and it’s nice when someone who has gotten to that position is willing to use it to speak up."
Glow Up,"He’s right! I’m furious that the show was canceled with such heavy cliff-hanger story threads! Or, damn, release the 4th season story as a graphic novel or something, I’m dying to know how the story was meant to play out!!!!"
Glow Up,"Nah. 

Season 1 was pretty good but the writing fell off, and the acting (mainly the supporting cast) was getting pretty awful....

Better go just end it."
Glow Up,Are we just listing off the things we think we deserve now? I think netflix should give me a million dollars.
Glow Up,Well that's a fuckin bummer
Glow Up,Yes
Glow Up,I agree. It was such a bummer to see it was canceled.
Glow Up,"Yes, please!"
Glow Up,I would even wait until this whole pandemic is over for them to start filming.
Glow Up,"I don't care how, just PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING!!!"
Glow Up,That’s a great idea! Come on Marc! Make them phone calls
Glow Up,I hope it happens
Glow Up,Adding encouragement in case show runners care about reddit - adding my name to the petition  - great show
Glow Up,80s cartoon style 4th season!
Glow Up,Yep.
Glow Up,Hopefully that does happen
Glow Up,Seems like a reasonable compromise.
Glow Up,He’s the man. I agree with him.
Glow Up,"I am truly going to miss the show and him, he was born to play the part. Would love to see an ending of it."
Glow Up,6 seasons and a mooooooovie!
Glow Up,It was canceled? I thought they were green for a 3rd season.
Glow Up,I would call it Glow: The Pay Per View.
Glow Up,"There is no upside to making a movie for Netflix. 
They won’t lose or gain more subscribers based off the decision."
Glow Up,He is right
Glow Up,He was my favorite part of Glow........in a show about women's wrestling lol.
Glow Up,Same thing with Santa Clarita Diet. I'd love to see that show get proper closure too.
Glow Up,3seasonsandamovie
Glow Up,"The Defenders(DD and JJ especially), Venture Bros, Community, and tbh I wouldn’t mind movies from The Office and Parks n Rec. But they all deserve movies"
Glow Up,Fucking. Agreed.
Glow Up,agree. waaaaay too many cliffhangers per character to leave it the way they did.
Glow Up,yes!
Glow Up,Of course he says that. He wants another paycheck.
Glow Up,"I dunno, when has that ever worked?! Deadwood was good but kind of its own thing from last season of show."
Glow Up,I agree
Glow Up,This was my first thought when I heard about the cancellation.
Glow Up,They could integrate some of the footage they already filmed
Glow Up,Make it happen
Glow Up,Screw that! Give us a finale season.
Home for Christmas,I’m literally googling about season 3 now and found your thread. I saw someone on TikTok that said it got cancelled but I can’t find any articles to back up that claim.
Home for Christmas,[deleted]
Home for Christmas,"It’s forever since I watched it so I don’t remember which scene you are referring to. But there’s a big age gap between the two love interests. So it may have been a joke about that? In real life, there’s a 11 year age gap."
Home for Christmas,"I always loved this version of Justice League. The writer's captured the essence of the comic and the characters. They realized that the battles were just one facet of the story, whereas the relationships were another great part.

DCAU is probably one of their greatest accomplishments."
Home for Christmas,[The rest of Martian Manhunter's first Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcT_A0H_SFc)
Home for Christmas,This is the kind of wholesome shit I wish more superhero media had.
Home for Christmas,“You mean Santa wrapped them?” 😂
Home for Christmas,"This Superman is so much more enjoyable than ""What if Superman but bad?"" that lots of media lately seems to go for."
Home for Christmas,J'onn J'onzz was always my favorite.
Home for Christmas,This subplot was one of my favorite parts of a great show
Home for Christmas,"Moments like this are why I absolutely love this show (and Supes in general although he's not a fav of mine). 

I love when they save the Flash from being lost in the speed force as well in Unlimited. It's just a great moment for the show.Same with the Justice Lord Batman episode(s?), it showed that Batman really cared about the Flash even if it seemed like he didn't."
Home for Christmas,"And he said, he didn't bring a gift"
Home for Christmas,"I don't know why, but I always imagine that the Kents are so nice and wholesome, Superman never tells them about some of the less than pleasant aspects of his friends. [Like when Ma Kent made a comment about Batman's parents](https://external-preview.redd.it/tA2CvfGHVo1tmY8hXvIFz87e9aCXhaV1S32YMsvVzkg.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ec20f04dc3267f1608c756a9a42609d7b50897a5). The look on his face is priceless."
Home for Christmas,"I always loved J'onn. He's a lot like Superman in that he's an alien fitting in with Earth, but his story is much more tragic. Superman lost his planet as a baby, so his Earth family is all he ever knew. J'onn was a full-grown adult who lost everything. Despite that, he is still a gentle, soft-spoken individual who chooses to be a hero. He's a fun character."
Home for Christmas,Do they have Jesus on Mars?
Home for Christmas,This is my type of wholesome viewing!  I miss cartoons like this.
Home for Christmas,The the justice league is one if not the best superhero show ever created. I recently rewatched it again and I still cant believe how good it is.
Home for Christmas,This is so lovely. I wish this was in the new Superman movies.
Home for Christmas,"I don't understand why Hollywood studios stopped making good looking cartoons, everything now looks like Simpsons or family guy. Meanwhile anime's have awards worthy animation and art styles"
Home for Christmas,Where is supergirl? Didn't superman invite her?
Home for Christmas,"The Superman in the DCAU is such a mixed bag. 

He is insultingly nerfed for most of it's run. It was so blatantly bad that even Bruce Timm acknowledged this and gave him a power boost for Justice League Unlimited. Timm and Dini were huge Bat-fans so the early seasons of Justice League (with the original 7 members) were very fan-servicey towards Bats, even to the detriment of other members like Supes, GL John Stewart, and MM J'onn J'onzz. It was infuriating to watch as a huge Supes and Bats fan.

But in terms of character, they absolutely nailed the humanity and essential goodness of Kal-El. At his core, he is just a farm boy from Kansas who wants to do some good in the world. He is supposed to represent hope and hope is supposed to be uplifting. He doesn't have baggage that makes him act Emo half the time. Batman is Emo enough for the both of them."
Home for Christmas,"I wonder if they'll ever want to ""soft reboot"" the DCAU continuity considering that a lot has happened and changed in DC Comics since this show was on. Barry Allen became the Flash again, Supes became a dad, Harley Quinn separated from the Joker to be an antihero, and so on. Although, I think it'd be best to just let it be, and try to build this live-action multiverse that they are establishing."
Home for Christmas,Seeing his disguise made me realize how silly his base outfit is after all these years.  Still an excellent show.
Home for Christmas,Thanks for showing me that the cat warms up to him.
Home for Christmas,Dude broke into someone's house to steal chocos
Home for Christmas,Were those oreos? Dude started singing because he was high as fuck.
Home for Christmas,Comics do. There was a whole book where Spidey kept Wolverine company on his birthday.
Home for Christmas,"It's actually pretty common. I've started reading comics the last year and a half or so and they tend to shy more to the feeling side of things than action in my experience(I mostly read Marvel), and heroes are often supposed to be role models so being a nice, wholesome person is par for the course. Spider-Man, like /u/KindlyOlPornographer said below, is especially so because he's such a home-town oriented hero."
Home for Christmas,"I still get a little teary thinking about this one scene between Deadpool and Spider-Man from the comics.

They had teamed up for an issue and Peter was really getting annoyed at Wade by the end of it. Just before he tells him off, Wade interrupts him. He tells Peter he wishes he could be the kind of hero that Peter is, but he is what he is despite his best efforts. He apologizes for having such a similar costume, but he secretly relishes the times he is mistaken for being Spider-Man because he feels people actually respect him for once and he can actually feel like a real Hero. The kind of Hero that Peter inspires him to be."
Home for Christmas,"What's especially wholesome is Ma and Pa Kent are voiced by an actual married couple, Shelley Fabares and Mike Farrell."
Home for Christmas,His face right before he said that was pure wholesome comedic gold!
Home for Christmas,Because very rarely do people understand especially today how to write Supes well.
Home for Christmas,"People get tripped up on his power level and tend to forget he was raised as a human; to a degree he's just a more powerful Captain America.

There's a reason why his greatest villain isn't a superpowered alien like Darkseid but merely the smart scientist/businessman Lex Luthor, who's antagonism is based on his view of worth and rarely actually about hating aliens."
Home for Christmas,"At least MoS was trying something new with an actual Supes origin story.  Unlike a certain Bat, it had never really been done in the movies.  The Reeves movies jumped straight from farm boy to fully formed Big Blue Boy Scout.  The problem is that they did not highlight the inherent goodness of the character despite initial hesitance to be a hero.  Do something like expand the Louis searching for him montage with him trying to hide a hero was helping a bunch of people but not being able to stop himself from helping.  That and dad dies of a heart attack as is traditional."
Home for Christmas,"A character with so much potential, but no one knows how or what to write for him. That's why he spends most of his episodes on Tower duty before getting written out of the show entirely. Same thing happens in the comics."
Home for Christmas,[Seems like Superman or Wonder Woman would've made more sense as the anchor](https://youtu.be/_a0pwb9NvFE?t=252)
Home for Christmas,"Whoo, that's dark."
Home for Christmas,"They had their own pantheon.

H'ronmeer (God of Fire and Death), C'eridyall (Matron of Life), L'zoril (better known as Dream of the Endless), and the Unnameable One."
Home for Christmas,They have J'esus C'hrist
Home for Christmas,Agreed. It's excellent.
Home for Christmas,"Ma Kent says she's skiing with Barbara (Gordon, Batgirl) and that she will be there for new years. The kara they mention is Supergirl"
Home for Christmas,I think the “team building” event was one of the best episodes. Where supes goes all in but neglects the fact that MM can coordinate for the team.
Home for Christmas,"If I remember right, either Timm or Dini did an interview where they said their work on Superman TAS actually hurt their portrayal of Superman in Justice League. They were so used to writing episodes where Superman starts out getting hosed by the villain that they kept it up in JL. The difference was that in his own series, Superman always came back and won at the end himself, redeeming his earlier failure; in JL, the problem was often resolved by another member of the team, making Superman look both dumb and weak."
Home for Christmas,"Just finished a rewatch last week and I gotta say, stealth favorite was Hawkgirl. I love how she just goes in gung-ho at literally everything, [like this,](https://youtu.be/Ry6f801Tsl0) and how her people used to worship Cthulhu but later decided against it, choosing secularism + freedom. Though that might just be because I really like the character archetype of ""female warrior who is kind of bloodthirsty but not evil,"" like Hawkgirl  (or Rachel if you've read Animorphs).I felt the superman nerf was honestly a good choice because otherwise it would trivialize a lot of villains, though it was weird how often superman gets electrocuted in the show.

Generally, I thought Justice League was the definitive versions of these characters, since everyone got such in depth motivations and character interactions. I felt the same about Young Justice, but for the side kick characters. I'm not a comic fan, and I haven't really been a fan of DCU movies, but the DCAU is fantastic, and far superior to any cartoon content by Marvel thus far."
Home for Christmas,"He was only nerfed in the first season of JL mate. In the second season, McDuffie was brought in and he turned Superman into a badass again. Are you really saying that a single season of the entire DCAU (which included Superman's own amazing series), turned him into a mixbag character? Really?"
Home for Christmas,"The main problem I see is that they don't have a comprehensive universe. The DCAU is different from the Arrowverse which is different from the DCCU. At least with the MCU, they attempted to ""soft merge"" the TV & Movies into something that didn't directly conflict. They were worlds that overlapped and ""could"" exist simultaenously."
Home for Christmas,"Technically HBO Max is streaming a new JL animated show that could be considered a soft reboot. It's more comical, but no where near Batman B&B or Teen Titans GO"
Home for Christmas,I'm pretty sure the current DCAU has been rebooted several times over. The Justice League Dark Apokalips War movie is the end of the current continuity and the next movies will be in a new timeline.
Home for Christmas,"What's funny is he based his get-up on Bats and Superman's, after first meeting them so as to help the two trust him."
Home for Christmas,[In case anyone wants to see it](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/KiW7W)
Home for Christmas,Kal-El believing in Santa as adult is some cute ass shit and I will not have anyone say otherwise.

Home for Christmas,Because Superman fills the powerful alien role better.
Home for Christmas,Haha yeah you're right there!
Home for Christmas,Yes but can Martian grandmothers tell if you're actually full or just shape shifting?
Home for Christmas,I hope that we get another good Justice League show
Home for Christmas,Shame she's mostly contained to that show.

Home for Christmas,"That was... Jesus, that was depressing."
Home for Christmas,What a great read. Thank you
Home for Christmas,"I was about to ask ""Is this legal?"" But it seems the page is unavailable so that answers my question lol."
Home for Christmas,"That's because in the DC Universe, Santa Claus *is* real. Every year he braves the armies of Apokolips just to deliver a lump of coal to Darkseid. Also Lobo beat him up once and stole his sleigh because Lobo's gonna Lobo."
Home for Christmas,"You're half-right. I think Watchmen has proved there is a good audience for more ""realistic"" superheroes, but Disney is more interested in two-dimensional characters who don't need to branch out much. They make movies for teenagers, which is why literally every Disney-Marvel movie has been PG-13 except for Deadpool, and even then they still made a PG-13 movie for him. And teenagers usually don't know much about what makes movies good or not and will eat anything up with explosions and sassy one-liners. Which is fine sometimes, but to me it feels like the ""junk food"" version of movies, and too much of it gets old fast."
Home for Christmas,That’s cause like flash he’s super op/broken he’s basically superman plus telepathy and shapeshifting
Home for Christmas,"Lol I can hear his screams in my brain. Every. Single. Episode. 

“DUHHHHHHHH!!!!!”"
Home for Christmas,"And as Highlander taught us, there can be only one, right?"
Home for Christmas,They have telepathy.
Home for Christmas,"Young justice certainly fills that void for me: even though it sorta revolves around the younger heroes, they eventually mature into their adult (mid 20s) roles very nicely, and the overarching plots for each season are IMO better than Justice League, at least in terms of interconnectedness. The show also has IMO the best superhero action animation, and it handles power levels a lot better than Justice League did. I do miss some of Justice League's villains, but they have improved on several IMO, like vandal savage. I love that he has a grand goal beyond ""rule everything himself,"" he wants humanity to evolve into a super-powered race, strong enough to rule large sections of space, and ultimately defeat Darkseid

If you haven't seen it, I can't recommend it enough."
Home for Christmas,Justice League Action was a little more light hearted but still really good
Home for Christmas,"Yeah, I'm convinced that you can sell the audience pretty much any kind of ""superhero"" as long as they have 

1) A magic weapon

2) Anything else

Like it's just a very simple combo that has such a wide range of utility, since a magic weapon can be scaled to almost any threat, as long as it can be hit. Flying + Cool Mace was a great combo."
Home for Christmas,"I'm sorry, I was unclear. The universes are not thematically similar is the issue is what I mean.

Spider-man in consistent across the MCU. There might be different adaptations of him, but we generally get the same SM, at least in tone. This doesn't necessarily hold true for DC.

The DCAU is tonally consistent with the comics, especially with the their one shot movies, but even the series like JLU or YJ do a great job of capturing the feel. Arrowverse is an adaptation that leans towards the soap-opera-esque (I personally enjoy it) in a monster of the week format. But the tone is definitely not the same as DCAU. When you add in the movies, we see another stark contrast, and a completely separate iteration, all running concurrently..."

Home for Christmas,For JLA? I thought it was because his creative team were stingy back then?
Home for Christmas,I stand corrected.
Home for Christmas,Is that the one where he’s the last person on earth and he’s a pretty well adjusted guy with a bunch of hobbies because he has nothing but time?
Home for Christmas,"I did very much love Harley Quinn as well, but for entirely different reasons. From what I saw on reddit, a lot of people don't like the style of humor, but honestly the jokes hit me so hard that it often feels like I ghost-wrote the dialogue, while hallucinating. Like I've consumed so many stories, narratives, ect at this point that I actively crave irony, and trope subversions in general. I love that clayface is now portrayed as a washed up bad actor, with shapeshifting powers. IMO it's hilarious that he never actually changes his voice, and over-pronounces everything. King shark being their ""hackerman"" but still being a giant bipedal shark monster that occasionally eats people. Every scene with Kite-Man (Hell yeah!), and as an ecologist, I love that Poison Ivy isn't evil for once; callous, misanthropic? Yes, understandably, but her goal is to protect the environment, which is necessary, not white-bread kind of cartoon evil.

Also, there now exists a 1080p full 16:9 remaster of the Teen Titans cartoon (literally, redid every frame from the original show) that is worth buying/torrenting if you have an itch for Teen Titans content."

Home for Christmas,"Hilarous enough, he was overexposed. He had four books, plus Adventure comics too. In the end, I don't believe it. I think the creative team didn't want to share Superman. It's very known that back then, each editor had their own ""fiefs""."

Home for Christmas,This sucks. I love that show.
Home for Christmas,"I feel like streaming services have become what they were once fighting against. 

Originally, Netflix in particular was good at finding niche shows and elevating them to the right audience, Arrested Development in particular was a case of a show becoming successful in a second light because people could watch it at their own pace without missing an episode.

Now all of the streaming services expect an immediate hit, if N number of eyeballs hadn't seen it in Y amount of time, shows are axed indiscriminately. *Reboot* was the second case (*Archive 81* was the first) where I was midway through the season only to find out it had already been cancelled.

At this point, I just feel like we have a network situation all over again, with the expectation that you have to have some major immediate returns or otherwise a show is a failure. Life just doesn't work like that, a lot of time it's a case of word-of-mouth or just plain curiosity that brings new viewers to become fans. There is no longer those same organic paths anymore in the streaming ecosystem.

V Wars,Always a bummer when Shows get canceled and end on a cliffhanger. I thought October Faction was decent.
V Wars,"Think I only watched an episode or two of V-Wars. I expected way better since Ian was in it... holy fuck it was worse than what I could handle. Sorry Ian, your looks couldn’t save that terrible show"
V Wars,"Two incredibly crap shows that some of us invested time in and nearly died of boredom.

Watching them one after the other was like watching Twilight in slow motion except Bella had joined the Furry club instead of the Necrophilia one."
V Wars,I tried watching October Faction.  Couldn't make it past episode one.
V Wars,[deleted]
V Wars,Makes sense. They were both terrible
V Wars,"I was worried it was going to be cancelled, but I enjoyed V-Wars :("
V Wars,"Not surprised. Both trailers looked bad.

I think ""Medical Police"" & ""Wu Assassins"" are on the way to be cancelled too."
V Wars,maybe not a bad idea considering I've never even heard of them.
V Wars,"So sad to see October Faction suffer so much from review bombing, its a major issue with any show that even tries to broach racism or sexism."
V Wars,"Oh dear. I haven't watched either series, but Netflix used to famously give nearly everything a second season, just as a one-last-chance kind of deal..."
V Wars,They really should have included Locke & Key on this list. All three of them were garbage.
V Wars,"October faction was too woke, really didn't serve any favors."
V Wars,[deleted]
V Wars,"It's honestly a problem with most shows that try to use demons, vampires, werewolves or zombies as stand-ins for minorities.

Last I checked, Jews don't typically eat people's brains."
V Wars,"Yeah I got through a couple episodes, then just didn’t feel motivated to go back to it"
V Wars,">  ""tangle with family drama.""

That's what did it for me. I've watched enough CW shows in my past. I'm good."
V Wars,"The family drama wasn't even the problem, the problem is the horrific writing. When i tell you it was bad, it was really fucking bad. It felt like a badly written wattpad story. Locke and key was good though, you should check that out"
V Wars,Honestly feels like they were trying to trick people into thinking it's a Vampire Diaries spin off with that title.
V Wars,Watched the pilot out of boredom then proceeded to hate.-watch the whole season. I have many regrets
V Wars,"How could you not watch some kind of war between virgins, I'm assuming, knowing nothing about the show?"
V Wars,Yes especially since Ian Somerhalder is in both
V Wars,"> I'm not sure how V-Wars ever got OK'd in the first place.

\*answers phone* [Netflix, you're greenlit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuPfCuga5NE)"
V Wars,[deleted]
V Wars,The dad was some of the worst acting I've seen
V Wars,It wasnt that bad tbh at least if you compare it to stuff like I-Land
V Wars,Try Zoo. Stick with it and thank me later.
V Wars,Z nation is great
V Wars,"Wu Assassins was fun and had the good sense to end the season completing the story it told while leaving the door open for more stuff. Of course, I'll watch just about anything with Iko Uwais (how I ended up watching edited by a cokehead Mile 22)"
V Wars,"That was years ago, before they put out a new supernatural teen drama every week."
V Wars,"Locke and key was really good imo, a thousand times better than October faction for sure"
V Wars,"At least you are being honest about what made you dislike the show. Really pathetic to see so many people review bombing it because its at all progressive, and hide behind the thinnest veil of plausible deniability."
V Wars,"How does that logic track?

""Only people who haven't seen or heard about it may complain that it's gone"""
V Wars,"Hahahahaha i think the chick from iZombie was jewish.

But V-Wars was 'extremely low budget canadian crap'.

They couldn't even make the vampires sexy, which is my one requirement for vampire tv shows/movies, having their face look like it got squeezed when they go to murder people. So I stopped watching it."
V Wars,Also the problem with the Marvel comics trying to use the X-men as an oppressed minority (While people with identical powers get along in society just fine.)
V Wars,"It's like how in True Blood, we're supposed to feel bad for the vampires when they're gruesomely killing people every week."
V Wars,"The first 3 realistically becoming the elites over humans as humans become their employees and servants in a realistic scenario that is more in line with how power abd privilege truly works in real life.



The oppressed mages trope( the trope this show falls into but replacing mages with vampires) is one of the most harmful tropes in fantasy...more so than the chosen one and damsel in distress tropes.


This would be society in a setting of vamps, wolves, zombies, mages and humans


mages and vampires--->werewolf enforcers--->human middle class--->zombie underclass


the humans would view zombies as rivals for resources and the cause of all their misfortune(scapegoating) and discouraging solidarity between humans and zombies who vastly outnumber the vampires, werewolves and mages that oppress both classes."
V Wars,That’s the title of the books it’s based on.
V Wars,I could not finish the pilot. I thought about it cause I was laughing hysterically at how dumb it had gotten and then told myself to stop it as there are actually good things to watch and I wasn't going to watch anymore anyways.
V Wars,"I walked in on my dad watching that, the virtual prison shit? Yeah I immediately walked out."
V Wars,another life was pretty terrible too
V Wars,I-Land was awesome.  It was a masterclass in dumb shit we haven't seen since Zoo and I'm desperate for a second season.
V Wars,I've seen only the first 5 minutes of October Faction but it has the potential.
V Wars,I tried watching the I-Land when it first was released. I got like 4-5 episodes in and just couldn’t. I immediately forgot about the whole show until right now.
V Wars,"I had to stop watching because every kid on that show deserved a swift ring hand to the back of the head.

I couldn't make it through the house party episode because it was so kid focused.  That was the last 1/4 on an episode I bothered to watch."
V Wars,Ho boy - sometimes I'm left wondering where all of 2019 went!
V Wars,"Confession time: I made it all the way through October Faction. It had an interesting premise and I was rooting for it to get better, but it never did. (And the main character was either horribly miscast or just couldn't be bothered to do any acting.)"
V Wars,"Locke and Key had the same problem as October Faction, main characters just doing stupid things to advance the plot. It was miles away from the quality of the comics."
V Wars,"Because thata all you needed to see to tell it was trash, I would say."
V Wars,IZombie was at least good. It was done on the lighter side. Had an interesting premise with the main character. The second to last season is where it started to downfall which seemed inevitable
V Wars,"Speaking of, I take issue when they start saying stuff like ""Call me Mystique. Raven was my slave name"". Like, fuck you.

That's just wrong on so many levels.

And the whole allegory falls short when most of the main X-Men are all a bunch of pretty white people in an upper class Manchester neighborhood."
V Wars,The government in the comics was purposely oppressing Mutants because they were born with powers. That's why society feared them.
V Wars,"because metahumans are humans who obtained powers through unusual means (like gamma radiation) and are few in numbers. Mutants are far more numerous and represent the next evolutionary step, a replacement for the old. The mutants, in a sense, symbolize an existential threat to those that see them as existing along side humanity separately rather than being the next link on the chain."
V Wars,Guess you missed the concept of “true blood”. Or never watched an episode.
V Wars,I need to steal your idea!
V Wars,">The first 3 realistically becoming the elites over humans as humans become their employees and servants in a realistic scenario that is more in line with how power and privilege truly works in real life.

AlternateHistoryHub did a good youtube video about what would actually happen if mutants from the x men actually existed, and it's exactly like you said, the more powerful minority rules over the less powerful majority:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jZsbuVQx4"
V Wars,"I would keep complaining about how stupid it was to my husband anytime he passed by the living room. All he could say was ""then stop watching it"" and all I could say was ""well, now I have to see where this dumb shit goes."" Plus I really have enjoyed Khandyse McClure since her days as Dualla on BSG. Should have just stopped when she died (really should have stopped once that stupid quarantine montage started)."
V Wars,"Well, there are (arguably) worse things you could have walked in on your dad doing."
V Wars,[deleted]
V Wars,"At least that was an original scifi non-prequel story. It was a trainwreck, but I'm overall still interested in the worldbuilding and where it goes next."
V Wars,"Was that that show with Katie Sackhoff and  Selma Blair?

Also, am I the only one who thought Maniac was a complete waste of time? Like, there's a reason nobody is talking about that show now that it's over."
V Wars,"Yay someone else like me! I liked how cheesey it was. Yes it is a terrible show but weirdly good terrible, in my opinion."
V Wars,It had potential but their writers are 13 year old girls and they fucking ruined it
V Wars,And yet....
V Wars,"I just finished October Faction, definitely the bones of a good story there. But the teen drama aspect was all over the place. ""Ok I just came out to my parents, but we can't be together right now?!"" Then the brother is storming off and getting upset, then he's in love again, then mad...it was just a mess."
V Wars,"Plus, unsurprisingly, was based on a comic book series printed under one of DC Comics' banners."
V Wars,Have you tried NOT being a mutant?
V Wars,"...Is that what makes the allegory fall short or is that what makes it more relatable to the white people whose minds they wanted to open? 

I mean, if you’re marketing a racial allegory and trying to change people’s minds, especially in that time, you have to make it “relatable” meaning that making majority of them upper class white people with superpowers would make it easier for those young white kids to make that connection. 

If it’s just a bunch of minorities complaining about how they’re being treated differently those kids are going to be turned off because “that’s what they do in real life anyway”

At least that’s my two cents, Unasked for I know. I do agree though about the Raven/Mystique thing. Especially bc they never outright said if she was a slave of some sort or not..."
V Wars,"It worked better in the 60s and 70s, when you couldn't put black people in things for fear it wouldn't play in the South."
V Wars,Well that's what morlocks and Genoa / Krakoa were all about.
V Wars,"But how does John Q. Everyman know who's a mutant or who's just a metahuman? How does he know Bruce Banner was irradiated in a secret experiment and not born with his powers? Or Wolverine wasn't bitten by a radioactive wolverine?

The whole thing...list most concepts in Marvel comics...falls apart when you analyze it with a modicum of detail. 

It's such shitty worldbuilding."
V Wars,"I never watched True Blood. But I did like the bit from ""What We Do In the Shadows."" 

""They hate us because of the color of our skin."" ""Also because we brutally murder them."" ""OK, mostly the brutal murders."""
V Wars,"I did. In fact I watched several, smart ass."
V Wars,[deleted]
V Wars,Like watching *Another Life*?
V Wars,"Among the last few shows I watched are 'Unorthodox', 'Kingdom' S2 (what an improvement!) and 'Castlevania' S3. Really really strong stuff released even just in the last few weeks on Netflix.  
  
But yeah, from what I have checked out, the shows declared terrible in this thread are in fact pretty terrible. 'Locke & Key' S1 had disappointing writing too although that one at least seems to have potential still."
V Wars,"Yep, same here. At least it has an over-arching premise even if the show is pretty much CW levels of acting."
V Wars,"I wanted to like that show with Katee Sackoff.    (Another Life) I love a good cliffhanger, but that show was really just edited so that the resolution to be problem-of-the-week was resolved at the beginning of next episode and then a new story started.

I am sure that I would watch more if more were made.  ("
V Wars,"Maniac was one of those shows that people think is really good because of its retro futuristic setting (which, admittedly, was amazing). It's actually a really stupid storyline with even dumber writing. That ""I'm a bird"" shit that Jonah hill went on was my cue to stop watching."
V Wars,"It's really, really hard to produce a show that is so willfully stupid without being campy OR overwrought.  Shows like Zoo and I-Land manage to drive the plot forwards relentlessly by *completely ignoring* consistency or logic and replacing it with action and novel developments.  It's a hell of a balancing act and I respect that."
V Wars,I’m not surprised. LOL. That actual makes sense as it totally had that feel.
V Wars,That line was in X3. Fucking Brett Ratner...
V Wars,[deleted]
V Wars,"I like the fact that they at least acknowledge that normal-looking, conventionally attractive mutants like Colossus and Jean Grey tend to be a little more accepted than mutants with outwardly different appearances like Nightcrawler and Beast.

It's like how DC acknowledges that people are more accepting of the humanoid, Caucasian looking Superman than they are of Martian Manhunter, whose outright alien in appearance. I think its interesting when comics do that.

Also, have there ever been any mini series about the Morlocks."
V Wars,Then how did you miss the parts where the humans were also gruesomely killing people every week?
V Wars,Fisting a midget dressed like Hitler?
V Wars,"YOUR MOM




I know it’s low hanging fruit but goddamn it had to be said."
V Wars,That show was hilariously insufferable. I didn't make it to episode two.
V Wars,"Hm... I found it really entertaining, but it was a really weird story. I thought both the leads were great, and it was just weird enough to reel me in and keep me watching. 

The ending was a bit odd, and it had kind of a weird melancholy vibe, but overall I liked it..."
V Wars,It didn't really have a whole lot to do with the comic other than the basic concept of zombie girl can eat brains and get flashes of memories. The whole coroner/police procedural element was only in the tv show and they chopped out other supernatural elements like her best friends who were a ghost from the 1950's and a wereterrier.
V Wars,Now you know how all of those old fat poor racist white people see themselves.
V Wars,I'd say humans have a distinct disadvantage in that scenario. Though everyone in that show was awful to be honest.
The Road to Love,"I'm a Lindelof superfan but I must say every new detail in this story makes me more excited to see it. Sounds like it will have similar vibes to Watchmen and the ""International Assassin"" episode of The Leftovers."
The Road to Love,New Lindelof-involved show? I'm in
The Road to Love,Betty Gilpin as a nun is truly pushing the boundaries of sci fi
The Road to Love,"First time hearing of this, thanks for sharing!"
The Road to Love,"Haven't kept up with this show but very hyped for it. Lindelof is probably my favourite show runner easy. Made 3 of my favourite shows. 

Not interested in his Star Wars movie(hope its good though) until we get reviews for that :). But show wise this is definitely one I'm looking forward to. Guess it will be Peacocoks's 2nd worthwhile show.

Didn't realise this was a Warner tv show.Surprised it didnt got to hbo max back then tbh.Also didnt realise this was coming out soon."
The Road to Love,I can't get the article. Can someone share a rundown of it?
The Road to Love,"> Lindelof

*barf*"
The Road to Love,"Can't wait for the unresolved mysteries, daddy issues and hallucinations !"
The Road to Love,"I'm with you, Lindelof is a genius in my opinion and I'll watch literally anything he is in charge of."
The Road to Love,"Warner TV makes a lot of stuff for every network, similar to Sony Pictures Television. 

Since 2022, they’ve made shows for Apple TV+, Fox, HBO Max, NBC, The CW, Starz, OWN, Netflix, CBS, Amazon and have deals with Disney+, Peacock, ABC, Showtime, MGM+ in the future"
The Road to Love,I don't know which other peacock show you're referring to as worthwhile but Poke Face and Paul T. Goldman are both recent examples of good programming on peacock
The Road to Love,"What evolved from these conversations is **Mrs. Davis**, *a Peacock series debuting April 20* about a nun named Simone (Betty Gilpin) who, based on her beliefs and a distrust of cheap magic, decides to take down a seemingly benevolent algorithm that has won over the entire world. It is a sci-fi romp about faith and computers and a love story about God and gamification, and it’s somehow also a wacky fetch-quest narrative about death, mid-tier Reno magicians, and the Holy Grail. Much of Mrs. Davis is difficult to discuss without ruining several of its best surprises, but its underlying preoccupations are most apparent in its many divergent influences — and what it clearly is not."
The Road to Love,"Ih yea I know they are behind stuff flike Ted lasso, abbot elementary but figured after leftovers and watchmen they would keep lindelof on hbo"
The Road to Love,Lindelof might be my favorite writer-producer working right now. This seems right up his alley.
The Road to Love,Is the nun’s name being Simone a reference to the film *Simone* (which had Sim-One — the singer Simulation One)?
The Road to Love,"Huh. Apparently WBTV is an independent studio, but of course they still make their fair share of stuff for HBO 

>	Re-signing Lindelof comes as a coup for WBTV. As an independent studio, keeping top producers in-house remains a high priority as broadcast, cable and streaming outlets alike increasingly focus on ownership and have been producing content in-house. Lindelof joins producers such as Chuck Lorre, Greg Berlanti, Westworld‘s J.J. Abrams, Jonah Nolan and Lisa Joy, among others, at the studio."
The Road to Love,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
The Road to Love,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
The Road to Love,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
The Road to Love,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
The Road to Love,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
The Road to Love,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
The Road to Love,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
The Road to Love,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
The Road to Love,[deleted]
The Road to Love,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
The Road to Love,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
The Road to Love,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
The Road to Love,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
The Road to Love,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
The Road to Love,Travelers is a good time travel show
The Road to Love,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
The Road to Love,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
The Road to Love,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
The Road to Love,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
The Road to Love,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
The Road to Love,Love this show so much.
The Road to Love,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
The Road to Love,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
The Road to Love,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
The Road to Love,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
The Road to Love,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
The Road to Love,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
The Road to Love,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
The Road to Love,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
The Road to Love,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
The Road to Love,"great show
always recommend it"
The Road to Love,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
The Road to Love,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
The Road to Love,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
The Road to Love,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
The Road to Love,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
The Road to Love,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
The Road to Love,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
The Road to Love,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
The Road to Love,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
The Road to Love,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
The Road to Love,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
The Road to Love,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
The Road to Love,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
The Road to Love,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
The Road to Love,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
The Road to Love,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
The Road to Love,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
The Road to Love,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
The Road to Love,Someone must have never seen futurama
The Road to Love,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
The Road to Love,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
The Road to Love,I think Dark has something to say about this
The Road to Love,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
The Road to Love,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
The Road to Love,Good summer binge show
The Road to Love,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
The Road to Love,[deleted]
The Road to Love,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
The Road to Love,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
The Road to Love,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
The Road to Love,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
The Road to Love,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
The Road to Love,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
The Road to Love,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
The Road to Love,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
The Road to Love,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
The Road to Love,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
The Road to Love,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
The Road to Love,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
The Road to Love,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
The Road to Love,Very nice
The Road to Love,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
The Road to Love,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
The Road to Love,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
The Road to Love,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
The Road to Love,Dude spoiler!
The Road to Love,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
The Road to Love,Upgrade!
The Road to Love,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
The Road to Love,Shame about *The Rig*.
The Road to Love,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
The Road to Love,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
The Road to Love,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Pat the Dog,I always knew Pat Sajak would be the purveyor of the endtimes.
Pat the Dog,"You shrug, but Sajak only lacks the final piece of the Algorithm."
Pat the Dog,oh god which horseman of the apocalypse is Sajak?
Pat the Dog,They’ve been pushing his daughter hard. I assume she’s next in line

Pat the Dog,[never gets old](https://youtube.com/shorts/9SOjaLuxZvM?feature=share)
Pat the Dog,"I'm surprised he didn't go crazy hosting this show.

It's the anti-Jeopardy. The contestants are freakin' morons."
Pat the Dog,"If ya watch Wheel, he seems not so subtly over it / done with the show - the boredom or scorn is apparent. Retire and let someone who wants to be there host."
Pat the Dog,His patience for bullshit has evaporated. He fucking HATES his job at this point.
Pat the Dog,"Do you think they’ll try and reinvent the wheel?

Of fortune?"
Pat the Dog,"The wheel has been spun by the hands of innocents for many years. It nears it final collection of power. We watch in horror as dear Jessica spins and lands on 100,000; her eyes roll back into her skull and the wheel changes into a pentagram, the 100,000 now 666, Sajak now a horned beast. 

Tune in for part 2 of “slay my insides Pat”, a new fanfic about demonic wheel of fortune."
Pat the Dog,"I have noticed that in the new season, I don't see Jim Thornton featured anymore. Did they nix that part of his deal?"
Pat the Dog,Remember The Pat Sajak Show? Me neither.
Pat the Dog,Can’t wait for Mayim Bialik to take over!
Pat the Dog,"White and Sajak are under contract for this season 2022-23 and next (2023-24).  It wouldn't surprise me if that's it for both of them. 

Let's see if Sony can not screw up a transition this time."
Pat the Dog,"Yes, but is there going to be new seasons of Wheel of Fortune?"
Pat the Dog,As his final act he steals all of the vowels
Pat the Dog,I can't imagine liking something enough to want to stick with it for 40 years.
Pat the Dog,"The quintessential trump guy: rich for basically no reason, long history of bizarre comments, frequently appeared drunk at work."
Pat the Dog,Dude looks great for being 75 years old.  He's worth over $50M.  I would definitely retire.
Pat the Dog,I remember watching it my grandma’s when I was a teen…about 40 years ago. Insane.
Pat the Dog,Didn't he once try to leave way back in the 80s or 90s and then they hauled him back after the old people complained?
Pat the Dog,"He can go now, actually."
Pat the Dog,40 years is a good run.
Pat the Dog,"Pat Sajak and Vanna White have been one of the only constants on TV for me my entire life - in addition to CTV weekend news anchor Sandie Rinaldo and a couple local news reporters back home in Ontario.

Bob Barker retired, Alex Trebek passed away - but Pat and Vanna have always been on TV every night at 7:00, wherever I’ve lived."
Pat the Dog,"He now knows every letter of the alphabet by heart.

Good for him."
Pat the Dog,"I met him once around Annapolis MD at a baby store. I say with shock ‘you’re Pat Sajak’. He says, ‘While, yes I am.’"
Pat the Dog,Why does Pat look like Donald Duck? 😂
Pat the Dog,Everyone loved Trebek. Do people like Pat?
Pat the Dog,Retire Pat!   It's nice!
Pat the Dog,It will be sad to see the Wheel go off air but at least they won’t pull a jeopardy.
Pat the Dog,R S T L N End game.
Pat the Dog,And now the Horsemen have seen the final letter turned and will henceforth begin their onslaught at Sâjak’s command!
Pat the Dog,"Good riddance , right wing nutjob."
Pat the Dog,Pat Sajak is actually a pretty shitty guy so yeah replace him who cares
Pat the Dog,Not at all fun fact: Pat Sajak is a right-wing lunatic.
Pat the Dog,I want to see Sajak get into R-Rated action movies the way Neeson did.
Pat the Dog,Time for another terrible talk show?
Pat the Dog,His minibar finally ran out.
Pat the Dog,Looks like a character from Team America.
Pat the Dog,Ken Jennings for replacement.
Pat the Dog,Good.
Pat the Dog,BYE
Pat the Dog,Good. Fuck that guy.
Pat the Dog,Dude is sexist and misogynistic as hell. Don’t care.
Pat the Dog,Wow I had no idea this was still on. Good for him. Time to take a beak and chill.
Pat the Dog,They’ve been featuring his daughter on the show in promos. Probably lining her up to replace Vanna.
Pat the Dog,I hate Pat Sajak.
Pat the Dog,He always reminded me of Qwark from DS9.
Pat the Dog,"What goes around eventually comes around, I guess"
Pat the Dog,"He seems like he really doesn’t enjoy doing the show. 

My wife can’t stand watching, because she thinks he acts like a jerk to some contestants."
Pat the Dog,"Wow, he looks like crap for 40."
Pat the Dog,Yes thank pat ! You both look like a rotten pumpkin 🎃 at thanksgiving time.. bye 👋
Pat the Dog,Right wing weirdo
Pat the Dog,About time
Pat the Dog,"this dude is a fucking asshat

he is conservative as hell

and he only works 7 weeks PER YEAR

fuck him"
Pat the Dog,Oh no! Anyway….
Pat the Dog,Thank goodness.
Pat the Dog,"This is like the Queen dying!  Except, I actually care about Pat."
Pat the Dog,"Last Puzzle:

People that annoy you.

N \_ G G E R S

(Those who know, know)"
Pat the Dog,I'd kill all of you for that job. Losing anonymity would suck but my gate would be sturdy.
Pat the Dog,Does Wheel of Fortune have good enough ratings to stay on TV?  I would think their primary demographic is getting very elderly.
Pat the Dog,"Easy money, shocking how much people get paid for these type of low effort jobs."
Pat the Dog,see ya!
Pat the Dog,"""End is near?"". 
Agreed. 
But you've passed it already."
Pat the Dog,"He will always be the ""fng"" to me"
Pat the Dog,He hasn't seemed to enjoy being the host for the last 20 years.
Pat the Dog,Must be watching right sided news. The world is burning for them but they are the ones creating chaos.
Pat the Dog,omg Levar Burton for his replacement!! The guy's LiTerALly bEen trAiNIng hIS EnTiRe lifE fOr thIs. He read wOrdS and LeTtERs to us as kids!11 It makes soooooOoo much sense
Pat the Dog,Can you imagine doing the same low energy bullshit for 40 years?  No self-respect in that except at least he pulled in the paycheck.
Pat the Dog,He’s still alive?
Pat the Dog,"Good Lord, is that still on?"
Pat the Dog,I wonder what the final puzzle will be? Can’t believe people still watch this garbage.
Pat the Dog,He should of left 20 years ago
Pat the Dog,"Lol, shows been on for 41 years and he’s already doom fearing. Okay try another language and syndicate the series into another territory.... or is that hard? There’s a billion things to do, and he’s not even on par with Larry King. 

Mel Brooks is over 90s and he’s still doing musicals, books, movies and animation. It’s not doom."
Pat the Dog,"Thank fucking God. I fucking hate wheel of fortune. Every second of wheel of fortune that I accidentally watch after jeopardy ends is a point off of my iq (and it wasn't particularly high to start with). Look I may not be the smartest man but anybody who legitimately enjoys watching wheel of fortune is too stupid to make it through the world. I believe they do not have a complex mental life. If you sometimes stop on wheel of fortune while scrolling through the channels I'll give you a pass, but if you tune in every fucking night to watch this stupid ass fucking show then you are beyond saving (you're probably almost dead anyway because you're elderly)."
Pat the Dog,For his stint on TV and society in general. Timing might be perfect! Ha ha ha!
Pat the Dog,"'Tis the end.

'Tis the end."
Pat the Dog,Ed Grimley will not be happy.
Pat the Dog,The end for the world or his career because he’s going to retire? Lol
Pat the Dog,"If Wheel of Fortune ends after Sajak leaves, they can always start airing Wheel of Money: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0oAYikhfJE"
Pat the Dog,He’s a ripe 149 year old
Pat the Dog,"The world finally spun and landed on Bankrupt, huh?"
Pat the Dog,Hopefully he can bring back Love Connection
Pat the Dog,"""Once I find the last Horcrux, I will bring about the end times, and you will all rue the day you every crossed the Sajak, and me and Vanna will fly away on Hale Bopp"""
Pat the Dog,"Sajak says the end is near, he’ll see Armageddon soon"
Pat the Dog,"Most of us weren’t so dramatic, we just referred to it as “retirement “"
Pat the Dog,Ominous
Pat the Dog,"Jeez, I still remember the Martin Short Ed Grimley sketches on SNL where he hero worships Sajak. And that was mid-80's I believe. Pat's been there so long."
Pat the Dog,Little known fact. Pat is a reasonablist. Just waiting on Zorp the Surveyor to destroy the world on May 19th or 20th depending on whether we're free on the 19th or not.
Pat the Dog,Also where is that name originating
Pat the Dog,"We'll miss you, Pat."
Pat the Dog,"Damn that’s dark, also despite seeing this on the TV nearly every day I never knew his name"
Pat the Dog,My boyfriend tints windows and apparently pat Sajak wanted him to his house for free or discounted for exposure or something. He said no lol
Pat the Dog,He looks like Tim heidecker
Pat the Dog,"People are debating over Rings of Power vs House of Dragons, the real battle of the ages will be over the mythical Wheel of Fortune and who will control the Wheel next."
Pat the Dog,"Please let the final puzzle be ""I quit"" or sayanora I'm out."
Pat the Dog,It is time!
The Repair Shop,Still so weird to see him referred to as King rather than Prince

The Repair Shop,"The picture is misleading, they mean a spaniel."
The Repair Shop,Was it shot before the death?
The Repair Shop,[deleted]
The Repair Shop,how does it take 12 months for a reality show with no CGI to get to air? Holy shit.
The Repair Shop,"Definitely the same for me  seeing ""The King"" on a modern news article."
The Repair Shop,It’s weird that he’s either in this day and age. And I say this as a Brit.
The Repair Shop,Prince King Charles
The Repair Shop,I think he’s bringing in Andrew for the show to fix the pedo/rapist.
The Repair Shop,"Per the article: 

""During the episode, the show's host Jay Blades and his team meet the then Prince of Wales at Dumfries House - owned by the King's charitable foundation - in Ayrshire, Scotland."""

The Repair Shop,I've been evangelizing The Repair Shop for ages now. Just heartfelt and sweet and full of love. And it's the love that people infuse into the items that their loved ones left behind that lifts the show over most everything else. If you want eye bleach for the soul then watch The Repair Shop.
The Repair Shop,"The Repair Shop is awesome. The skills that the people have who work on it are amazing.

The finished items quite often look new. Not nearly new but you can see the repair, just new.

However the emotional side is the thing that really wins the show.
Check out some of the back stories of the people that work on the show, even those are pretty heart wrenching."
The Repair Shop,"If you like the Repair Shop, I highly recommend James May’s The Reassembler. There are several full episodes on YouTube and it’s fantastic. Just wish there was more of it."
The Repair Shop,Lucky for us in the uk the repair shop is on the bbc and a few other cable channels.
The Repair Shop,I wish I had 1/2 their talents.
The Repair Shop,I binged this show earlier this year it's great. It's so nice to find such a wonderful wholesome show to watch when the world's got you down.
The Repair Shop,Not to forget that it was initially narrated by Craster.
The Repair Shop,Sounds like a good thanksgiving background show?
The Repair Shop,That show makes me happy.
The Repair Shop,"It's just good, wholesome, comfort food TV.  I'm excited for season 3!"
The Repair Shop,LPT- Netflix is removing season 1 at least at the end of today.  Don't know about season 2.  I got the warning yesterday.
The Repair Shop,"I must be watching a different show. The one I am watching hides all the interesting bits that might be of use to DIYers, does shameful half repairs and occasional dangerous repairs (think rocking horse with peeling paint and NO ONE says ""Woah! Might lead be an issue here?""). And the main repair guy seems to have just stopped doing any real work himself. 
Really, what show are you all seeing?"
The Repair Shop,It's a great show. I watched it all in almost one sitting. Apparently season 3 is coming on the 1st!
The Repair Shop,"Wife and I enjoy the repair shop but would also like to add for feelgood TV we can also recommend Making It with Nick Offerman and Amy Poehler as well as The Great Pottery Showdown.  Just real nice, feelgood shows featuring very talented and/or funny hosts.  Not sure where you watch them in the USA, sorry."
The Repair Shop,The repair shop is now on discovery channel every morning. I love this show. Restoring the best memories. Just beautiful
The Repair Shop,"True.  When someone's father hung out with an famous artist and all she has is a piece of pottery for memory, then street work with jackhammer's vibrates it off a shelf, it's really cool to see it put back together."
The Repair Shop,Will check it out.
The Repair Shop,Anyone know where they will be available now in the US?  I just discovered it this last week and didn’t get through them all before they disappeared.
The Repair Shop,I just started watching this show yesterday and now I can only watch season 3! Such a bummer that they removed it.
The Repair Shop,"I've seen two variants of this show.  One is effectively full length (an hour) where there's only minimal cuts to accommodate US commercials.  The other is some cut down 30 minute version that's been hacked with a cleaver and doesn't show very much.  

I've seen cases where they check for lead so it's probably just a matter of whether or not it was worthy of making the episode edit for that item."
The Repair Shop,Highly recommended!
The Repair Shop,"I'm on season two right now, great show."
The Repair Shop,"Crazy wholesome! Really dig this, and I love how the craftspeople loving poke at one another, while also helping each other out. Beautiful work."
The Repair Shop,"It's beautiful, a perfect rainy day show for me."
The Repair Shop,I hope noone tells those hack frauds over at Lighting Fast VCR.
The Repair Shop,"Thanks. I rummaged this up online and have watched a couple of episodes. Not sure about emotionally moving, but I enjoy a nice before and after. 

There was a spate of restoration shows several years ago in the U.S. but the genre seems to have died down here except for cars and motorcycles."
The Repair Shop,isn't this story about.. 3 years and 4 months late? guess someone needed some ~content~ to push out and was all out of other ideas
The Repair Shop,It’s only $4 billion in PR when your marketing staff get paid an exorbitant amount. What a ridiculous number.
The Repair Shop,I can't *not* read that logo as STD

The Repair Shop,"Snooki on Supernatural

Paris Hilton on My Name is Earl"
The Repair Shop,Larry David randomly appearing on *Hannah Montana*.
The Repair Shop,"Prince in that episode of New Girl. Apparently he wanted to be on the show because he was a fan. The episode’s plot was already absurd, but when he actually shows up it’s a very pleasant surprise.

And, of course, Brad Pitt in a Friends Thanksgiving episode. Less of a cameo since he’s a pretty major part of the episode, but still hilarious and completely unexpected. I imagine the audience must have lost their minds when he walked on set."
The Repair Shop,"Werner Klemperer in character as Colonel Klink, leaning out of a window and conversing with Batman and Robin as they scaled a building."
The Repair Shop,Werner Herzog in Parks and Recreation.
The Repair Shop,Ed Sheeran on GoT
The Repair Shop,Chris Martin on When the Whistle Blows

The Repair Shop,Katie Perry's boobs on Sesame Street
The Repair Shop,"In a series chock-full of cameos, Gary Busey’s one-line appearance in Scrubs stands out to me as the most unexpected, even though it’s paying off a couple throwaway jokes about Elliot’s resemblance to him"
The Repair Shop,Paris Hilton on Veronica Mars Season 1.
The Repair Shop,"Jack Black and Cloris Leachman in the office, one of the best office episodes but that part is really weird and doesn’t fit in."

The Repair Shop,"Andy Dick on Community, encouraging one of the lead characters to abuse drugs.

The Repair Shop,"George Santos says he was on Hannah Montana. 


Oh Mary, you so. crazy. Your fat ass was not on H.M."
The Repair Shop,Robin Williams and Billy Crystal in Friends. From what I've heard they were there anyway so they let them riff and go but it feels forced. I love both of them and Friends but it always feels a little cringe.
The Repair Shop,"There's this Irish soap opera called Ros na Rún which has two good examples of this.

You see, the show airs on the Irish TV channel TG4, which is... entirely in Irish Gaelic. Some shows do have English subs, but for the most part, it's just the Irish channel. And Ros na Rún is one of their flagship shows.

Well, one episode had a cameo by English actor Stephen Fry of all people. He's an English tourist who is passing through the Gaeltacht (a town where Irish is the main language) and two of the regular main characters decide to fuck with him when they realise he's not fluent... only he is and turns it right back on them.

The other wasn't a cameo, but a commercial. You see, TG4 also did air some shows in English, usually imported shows from America, like The Golden Girls or New Girl.

Well, one of the shows they aired was Cold Case and they did a cross promotion tied to the fact that Ros Na Run had a murder-mystery storyline going on at the time, by having the main suspect being interrogated by the lead detectives on that show... and he's refusing to speak to them under the pretext that he doesn't speak English, only Irish. So they start interrogating him in Irish instead.

And this wasn't dubbing over clips from Cold Case - they sent an actor from the Irish show to the US to film the bit on the Cold Case set with Kathryn Morris and John Finn (Lilly Rush and John Stillman on the show) who spoke the Irish lines themselves.

It's actually a well-known advert in Ireland, even winning a major award for it's creativity and execution.

The Repair Shop,"By far and away the weirdest cameo of all was [Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys turning up on Neighbours](https://youtube.com/watch?v=-JWScLDoLe8). 

By all accounts, he was a fan and was in the area, so they let him be in it. Briefly."
The Repair Shop,"Liam Neeson in Atlanta.

Like, wait, they get Liam Neeson in this show? And out of nowhere he talked about his controversial past with the black people??? Then he said they are his mortal enemies?????"

I know that they reference them so much in the show but I didn't expect them both to show up."
The Repair Shop,"Star Trek has some odd ones; Tom Morello, the Rock, the King of Jordan, etc"
The Repair Shop,Scooby Doo and Steve Urkel doesn't sound that wild until you realise it's from 2021
The Repair Shop,"This doesn’t meet the prompt as it’s not a cameo, but I feel it’s right at home in this thread:

When iCarly did the “how’s my hair look?” scene from The Wire before Sam shoots Gibby in the head with an ink gun.

The Repair Shop,"Geri Horner (Ginger Spice) in Sex and the City.  She's English, but tries to do a posh English accent that isnt anything like her natural voice.  Her ""acting"" is terrible.

Weird scene all around."
The Repair Shop,Werner Herzog on Parks and Rec. It was weird and random and fabulous at the same time.
The Repair Shop,"Vince Gilligan was on one episode of Comedy Bang! Bang! as his take on Commissioner Gordon from the Adam West Batman series. A Commissioner Gordon who really likes hot dogs, for some reason. It’s wonderful, and ever so slightly surpasses his VHS cameo in Community for me."
The Repair Shop,George Lucas as himself on The O.C.
The Repair Shop,"Back when Jackass was in its second or third season they did a skit where they skated in big, unwieldy monkey outfits causing shit in the streets at night. Somebody takes a fall causing his mask to fall off and yeah, it's Brad Pitt.

 Jackals wasn't as fuckhuge as it became at this point so it was pretty jarring to see at the time."
The Repair Shop,"Mr. T and First Lady Nancy Reagan showing up on Different Strokes and telling kids to “Just Say No”.

The Repair Shop,Betty White showed up as a forensic scientist on Bones.
The Repair Shop,"Annette Benning's cameo in The Sopranos was random and bizarre, but it was a dream sequence so it's OK that it didn't make much sense."

O Grande Gonzalez,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
O Grande Gonzalez,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
O Grande Gonzalez,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
O Grande Gonzalez,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

O Grande Gonzalez,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
O Grande Gonzalez,Severance show
O Grande Gonzalez,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
O Grande Gonzalez,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
O Grande Gonzalez,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
O Grande Gonzalez,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
O Grande Gonzalez,"I don’t care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn’t have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it’s fine of course. That was just my opinion."
O Grande Gonzalez,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
O Grande Gonzalez,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
O Grande Gonzalez,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
O Grande Gonzalez,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? 😩

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
O Grande Gonzalez,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
O Grande Gonzalez,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. 😅 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."

Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,Time to be freaked out again
Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"It was, most of the people there would have likely grown up listening to the wiggles."
Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"Of course there are adult fans of The Wiggles. They have been around for over 20 years. Many of their original fans are now adults. I listened to them as a kid and I'm now 29.

How could it be ""Peter Pan syndrome""? These are just adults enjoying a charity event put on by a group of performers. 

I think it's important to note that The Wiggles are a huge thing in Australia. You don't grow up in Australia without being exposed to them. They are the music that is put on in kindergarten and primary school . They are the easy to access TV shows that most parents can afford. I guarantee that more than half the population of under 30s knows all or most of the words to Fruit Salad, Big Red Car and Wake Up Jeff. They know who Dorothy the Dinosaur, Wags the Dog and Henry the Octopus are."

Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"My friend messaged me after seeing him being admitted into hospital - not going to be giving away details just in case it threatens their job - but apparently he’s doing well after they stented his arteries, and spend the night in angio. 

So hopefully he continues to make a full recovery."
Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"They did not. It is actually a very generic name. I think they just used it to hit a lot of kids. I had nothing to do with it. They just used a random name, my son just thought it was for him. Like all the other kids with his name thought."
Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"So many people grew up listening to them that they have huge numbers of adult fans. Lots of adults would love a chance to relive a bit of their childhood.  Also, so many never saw them live as kids but wanted too, so this is their only chance."

Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"Just in case you really think this: no. No one says this. What we do say, is that he singlehandedly prevented climate measures being put in place, actively campaigned for anti-climate causes, and and completely denies the scientific consensus.

I’m 36 and my brother is 34. Neither of us had the Wiggles. Our cousins did but we just missed it.

Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"He retired just months after I was first diagnosed with POTS. At first I was afraid for my future because of my heart condition.

Let's run this condition over with a big red car!"

Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle!,"Erm, no.

It would be odd for an adult to go to a Barney concert.

It is NOT odd for an adult, especially an Australian adult, to go to a Wiggles concert. Even when going to the kids' concerts, there are usually some number of 20-somethngs in attendance, often with vintage t-shirts or hats or Dorothy ""tails"".

They're pop culture icons here."

The newest Yu-Gi-Oh has moved to Hulu, but is still releasing, while new Pokemon episodes release on Netflix. 

There's a new Sonic series, Sonic Prime, coming soon, while there was another Sonic series, Sonic Boom, a few years ago. 

For superhero, you've got Teen Titans Go, and coming up are Batman: The Caped Crusader, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, Baymax!, X-Men '97, a literal continuation of the 90s X-Men. 

From Nickelodeon/Paramount Plus, you've still got Spongebob, along with Kamp Koral, The Patrick Star Show, Middlemost Post, Big Nate, the Rugrats reboot, and Star Trek: Prodigy. 

Disney Channel/Disney plus have The Owl House, The Ghost and Molly McGee, Monsters at Work, Big City Greens, and the forthcoming Hamster and Gretal. Amphibia, Ducktales, Tangled: The Series, and Big Hero 6: The Series all just wrapped up in the pasr couple years. 

Cartoon Network/HBO Max has Summer Camp Island, Craig of the Creek, We Baby Bears, Victor and Valentino, Mao Mao: Heroes of Pure Heart, and likely the forthcoming Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake. 

Netflix has The Dragon Prince, Hilda, Green Eggs and Ham, Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous, He Man and the Masters of the Universe, The Boss Baby series, along with the upcoming Kung Fu Panda series. 

Just because you're not watching them, doesn't mean they don't exist."
Sonic X,"Kids don't watch as much ""regular programming"". 

YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, video games and subscription services are much more likely."
Sonic X,No one here is going to be able to give you the answer you want. People are offering answers and solutions but you just dismiss them for a new complaint. Welcome to the future we’ve been here with streaming for years and everybody here is aware of the amount of services out there. This post is really just you needing to vent and disagree.
Sonic X,They just watch YouTube
Sonic X,Subscription apps and YouTube probably
Sonic X,"Dragon Prince on Netflix is great for that age range, as is, of course, Avatar: The Last Airbender, which should still be available. And Disney has a bunch of Star Wars animated shows that apply."
Sonic X,I'm not really sure how you could possibly think this unless you've barely been paying attention to TV at all and did no research before asking; there have been more great shows in that group over the last several years than ever. Someone else in the comments here already listed several of them.
Sonic X,Streaming is what happened. It's all there.
Sonic X,"First of all teen titans go is aimed at that demographic exactly

Secondly what youre thinking of is shows like Adventure Time, Regular Show, The Owl House, Amphibia, Steven Universe, She-ra and the Princesses of Power, Voltron, Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts...

The sad part is, of these shows, only Owl House is ongoing. 

If you're looking for that more grounded DC style then the netflix shows (She-ra, Voltron, Kipo) may be more your thing. They were heavily inspired by cartoons from that era, specifically Teen Titans and Avatar the Last Airbender.  

Young Justice is also a thing but I think Young Justice was never that appealing to 7 year olds to begin with and I can't argue the current iteration of the show is anything other than Young Adult material but with no gratuitous swearing or sexuality. That's specifically a DC show."
Sonic X,"You re picking cartoons from about a ten year period. In the last ten years we have had among the best selection or cartoons for that age range ever. Just off my head you have

Ronya the Robber's Daughter

Hilda

Kippo and the Age of Wonder beasts

Centaur world

The Hollow

The Dragon Prince

We Bare Bears

Adventure Time

Stephan Universe

Infinity Train

My Little Pony Friendship is Magic

Gravity Falls

Big City Greens

Amphibia

The Owl House

Over the Garden Wall

Star vs the Forces of Evil

The Bad Batch

Brand New Animal

Im probably forgetting a few but if you were making a list of all time great cartoons for kids you might have a hard time picking shows not on that list"
Sonic X,Miraculous: Tales of Lady Bug and Cat Noir need to be on this list
Sonic X,"the whole trollhunters universe on netflix is also so fucking good. 

i watched them at 14 through 17 like i honestly found them really endearing and good stories"
Sonic X,"There's too much subscription fragmentation, we have none of the subscriptions you mentioned"
Sonic X,"Yeah, but there isn't much good 20Min+ scripted programming on Youtube, Twitch or TikTok. Not everybody can afford a console or PC and what do they watch on subscription services that fits that demographic I mentioned?"
Sonic X,"> Welcome to the future we’ve been here with streaming for years 

That's not the future I wanted, I wanted HVD Recorders to be just as common as VCRs were in the 80's. Sounds like a dystopian being enslaved to your landlord and never buying a home kind of future."
Sonic X,So they don't watch scripted children's action or adventure dramas?
Sonic X,"What's on the subscription apps for that demographic that isn't just archives of ""legacy content""?"
Sonic X,"> Avatar: The Last Airbender

Next Saturday will be the 14th anniversary of the series finale"
Sonic X,"I did research, I looked at the Saturday TV Line up for OTA broadcasting, a lot of it is age 6 and under. I even looked at the lineup for Nick Toons, nothing but TMNT all day, not much variety in that age range."
Sonic X,"You could add Hilda and The Dragon Prince as ongoing shows that fit with those others that you listed. And if the OP just wants shows for that demographic in general, then literally every current cartoon on Disney Channel/Cartoon Network/Nickelodeon that doesn't fall into Disney Junior/Cartoonito/Nick Jr. fits."
Sonic X,"I'm looking for that kind of Y7-FV kind of cheesy stuff that the 80's-00's was famous for, can have drama, but be light heated most of the time, but aims for more realistic proportions, square jawline heroes, not a fan of the ""bean face"" style.


The only time they go for realistic proportions today, the rating is like PG13+ with the DC direct to Video animated movies like Flashpoint or even an R with stuff like Invincible or to satirize he grimdark extreme in Teen Titans Go."
Sonic X,"Now you're just changing the problem. You said: 

>It seems to be an under represented demographic today... It's like there's Peppa Pig/Paw Patrol, Teen Titans Go and then it jumps to Family Guy.

I provided an entire list of series that fit between Peppa Pig/Paw Patrol and Family Guy. Just because you don't have any of the subscriptions doesn't mean it's an underrepresented demo. 

The same could be said for people growing up when you did, if they didn't have cable and were limited to only the basic local channels- they would've been missing out on Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel. 

Even now, with just cable, you'd have access to The Loud house, The Casagrandes, Spongebob, The Patrick Star Show, Big Nate, Middlemost Post, The Owl House, The Ghost and Molly McGee, Big City Greens, Hamster and Gretal, Craig of the Creek, Victor and Valentino, Mao Mao.

Plenty of kids programming exists out there now."
Sonic X,"You don’t have cable, Netflix, Disney+, hbomax, nor paramount+? Are you living life with peacock and discovery+?"
Sonic X,I had a friend as a kid who only got three tv channels. It didnt make cartoons not on those channels not exist.
Sonic X,Kids in that age range do not care. They watch what is relevant to them now not what was relevant to grandpa 50 years ago! If that is gaming streamers and TikTok vids then so be it. Times change.
Sonic X,"Netflix has an entire kids section...Disney +, I think Paramount has all the old Nickelodeon stuff. 
But like the other guy said...kids don't watch as much 20+ minute scripted shows either. 
Then there's crunchy roll for anime...a growing viewership including the US."
Sonic X,Bummer. Welcome to the real world.
Sonic X,"Dragon Prince, She Ra, Voltron"
Sonic X,"> I did research, I looked at the Saturday TV Line up for OTA broadcasting

We're no longer in the 90's. Most TV shows, including kids' shows, are on streaming services these days. Netflix alone has some amazing kid shows like She-Ra, Kipo, Dogs in Space, Voltron, Centaurworld, and The Dragon Prince."
Sonic X,Saturday morning cartoons haven't been a thing in over a decade
Sonic X,But what current cartoons are there? I think most of them are ending or over. The networks are moving towards a younger demographic.
Sonic X,Why would you expect 80's styles shows in 202X? Styles change. Drop the nostalgia and get used to it.
Sonic X,Dude is just complaining to complain.
Sonic X,"You say that as if you have insider information because that's exactly what I have.I also have Fios TV, bundled with gigabit plan)"
Sonic X,They didn't exist as far as the kid was concerned.
Sonic X,"Anime isn't meant for western kids. I should know, I remember when they cut dialogue though I like the cuts they used to do, hearing Vegeta say ""Next dimension"" sounded darker in my head than if he actually said the K-Word."
Sonic X,I have a couple of nieces and nephews who are growing up exclusively on Disney+/Netflix and when they tried to watch normal TV at a party the commercials made them lose their little minds
Sonic X,"That's not ""nostalgia"", it's an alienated demographic."
Sonic X,"Dude, you cannot subscribe to a few niche services then complain about a lack of options. Your lack of options is a personal choice."
Sonic X,No. He know they existed.
Sonic X,"I hate commercials too, when I recorded programs onto a tape, I always hit the stop button when a commercial started and hit record when the commercial was over.


I've heard of people that pioneered that with a Windows media center based DVR in like the mid 00's, he was like ""My kids don't know what commercials are""."
Sonic X,"I'm just broke, I already have the bundled TV, paying for that much more on top of that feels like ""paying for cable twice"". I would downgrade to 100 up/down and just pay subscriptions on top of that, but I'm stuck living 1/3rd of a lifestyle I don't want. ""I gotta watch monday night raw when it comes out, I can't wait a week"", ""I gotta watch the latest episode of [Insert shit TLC Show here], I can't wait a month"", ""I like the convenience of the adult swim block"".


That's not even my lifestyle choice either, mine is ripping blu-rays and setting up a Plex server. I'm the kind of person where I can live without internet for half a year and save up $600, I just don't because of the same reason why some fat people lose weight as soon as they live alone. I feel anchored into a lifestyle I don't like because the alternative I want isn't viable."
Sonic X,"idk you’re just on some real shitty services lmao. 

trash peacok and get HBOmax and netflix, im pretty sure it will be like 30$ a month, and will have quality programming for both you and your spouse, and your younger kids. 

i honestly cannot explain how many classic DC cartoons are on HBOmax+ new ones (young justice is some quality shit if your kid is 10+). 

netflix also is stacked with content for younger kids and 10+. stuff like boss baby aims lower, other stuff like trollhunters i honestly enjoyed at 16 so"
Sonic X,Bro you do not sound ok. The good news is that Moving Subscriptions around (you should probably stick to one subscription for the kids or just DVR or on-demand hard) and TV habits are much easier to change than losing weight. Even better news is that with the Discovery+/Warner merger you’ll probably get HBOmax/Warner eventually.
Sonic X,"Well, I live with somebody that watches wrestling and I wanted to show the other person I live with that Discovery+ is better than cable and they're like ""I can't wait a month for the latest episode of my TLC show"". The intent was to have cord cutting becoming the new normal, but the new normal was Cable+ those 2 subscriptions.

The household is unwilling to pay for one more subscription an is unwilling to give up traditional TV. They're not willing to spend $50 less per month to get 90% of what they like and live with an inconvenience of waiting a week for raw and smackdown or waiting a month for 1,000 pound sisters. I hate being stuck with people this unflexable."
Sonic X,"My viewing habits are easy to change, just not those of the people I live with. They're so damn picky."
Sonic X,"so just pirate stuff, a lot of great kids stuff is older anyways"
Sonic X,They can’t split another $9 subscription with you? ($3 each?) or are you paying the whole thing?
Sonic X,"I've talked and I'm looking into the ACP program, $0 per month 300 up/down, I was told ""we're probably too rich to qualify, we got denied for foodstamps"" and I said ""I looked into it, to be eligible, we have to live at 1.99x the poverty line or less and we live below the poverty line"".


I'm just going to pay the ridiculous $150 telecom bill one more time."
Sonic X,"The problem isn't the $9, the problem is one more subscription in conjunction with the $150 telecom bill.

But in looking for it, we qualify for a Lifeline and can pay $0 per month for 300 up and 300 down instead of gigabit. I was told ""If the shoe was on the other foot, you wouldn't wait a month for your favorite show"" and I said ""BS, I've been waiting years for the Mandalorian to make it on blu-ray so I don't have to be locked into renting Disney+, but I doubt that will ever happen"" (I might sign up for a trial and just binge the trial, I really hate services with no buy-out option like Adobe moving to SAAS)

Come hell or high water, we're saving money, my name is on the damn telecom bill afterall."
Sonic X,"Because American (and British, to a lesser extent) media being popular worldwide is pretty much a given, media from literally any other country being popular worldwide is not."
Sonic X,Johnny Bravo was so loved in India that there was a movie created just for that market
Sonic X,"It isn't. American Animation is still very much at the top of the echelon. None other Animation production in any other country has come close to toppling the US from that industry.

Particularly Disney.

Disney Animations aren't just targeted for kids, but they are admired in the Profession since their first animated film, which was partly Rotoscoped, and genuinely amazing too.

It should be noted that Animations have had a dip in Quality. Not just the quality of the animations themselves, but quality in story telling, beat boards, Voice Acting, expressions, and marketing, among many other elements that help an Animation Studio to stand out.

Anime does well, because of quite a few reasons that people may not want to read, which I am about to type.

It's simple. Anime uses a lot of tricks to minimize the work and pump out their stories quickly, with the rare occasion of an Episode or a Scene in a movie that looks outstanding.

Studio Ghibli is one of few Japanese Animation studio's whose films are consistently gorgeous. In comparison, Naruto Shippuden has a lot of badly animated episodes and scenes, with few moments of gorgeous Counts of 1's instead of the typical 3's.

For instance; 

[Pinocchio(1940)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_POK-52yvM) was animated in 1's and 2's. So 1 or 2 unique frames per second, out of 24 frames. So some scenes have 12 unique images per second, or 24 unique images per second.

The closest Anime comparison, is the revolutionary Animation; 

[Akira(1988)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_MONOV1_sc) which is also created with the 1's and 2's method.

Typical Anime would normally run on 3's, with some Action scenes depicting 2's animation. Examples being Naruto, One Piece especially, but they hide it very well, and infamously, Dragon Ball Z.

The same method used by some American studios for Animation series, like He-man and the Masters of the Universe, Transformers, and Justice League Unlimited are this way too using 2's and 3's. Transformers may have also used 4's resulting in some awkward movements.

>So I am curious why America's impact on animation world wide is so overlooked esp on the internet? 

It isn't. America's impact in Animation is long standing as among the top. Unfortunately, many American Cartoons are outsourced to Korean and Indian animation companies. You may notice similar Designs with other Cartoons and Anime."
Sonic X,"Did we really need two impossibly long wall of texts that no one is going to read about anime versus western animation in less than half an hour?  Just watch what you wanna watch.  If a McDonalds Double Cheeseburger is your favorite food it's your favorite food, who cares what other people have to say about what *should* be your favorite?"
Sonic X,"The main thing is that Japan released cartoons that are aimed at slightly older audiences, which are things that the geeky guys who use the internet a lot are more likely to care about. Yes, American cartoons are HUGE internationally with kids. But Japan makes cartoons that people will talk about online, since they are aimed at older audiences, and that skews results."
Sonic X,"Most of the anime mentioned aren't actually main stream though. Sailor Moon is one of the most popular anime up there that you mentioned, but outside its own fanbase and animation fans in general the show never really made a massive splash outside of Japan. Today One Piece and My Hero Academia and Dragon Ball Super are among the most popular anime outside Japan, each of them releasing theatrical movies... theatrical movies with incredibly limited and short stints in theatres."
Sonic X,"People are pretty confused about the Japanese anime outside of Japan market.  There are a couple worldwide properties, that are known (but may not even be popular, they just may be know, it its really two, Sailor Moon and DBZ) but otherwise is pretty much dead outside of Japan (and east asia) and super niche audiences in the west.

Western animation is pretty much the go-to animation worldwide that isn't east asia.

Japanese anime has some die-hard non-Japanese fans, but simply isn't on the level of western animation (which really means US/UK).

Its hard to argue with fanboys though, and they'll say <anime program> is the biggest thing ever...

Pokemon though whether we consider this ""anime"" would be the exception to everthing though"
Sonic X,[deleted]
Sonic X,"Well, for one, most American animation is now actually Korean animation."
Sonic X,"Is it really overlooked?

We had both American and Japanese animated TV shows airing near each other in my country."
Sonic X,"You do realize that Anime in France, Germany and Italy is hugely popular probably even more so than in the US. France for instance has 3 tv channels dedicated to Anime and Manga ([Game One](https://www.gameone.net/), [J-One](https://www.j-one.com/) and [Mangas](https://www.mangas.fr/)),"
Sonic X,"Disney was a major influence on Japanese comic and animation legend Osamu Tezuka, and his style had a lot of Disney influence in it. Over time, other Japanese creators built on his style and evolved differently than American animation did."
Sonic X,"The story is that Astro Boy's creator was inspired by Disney animation, and since basically all anime evolved from Astro Boy, everything is kind of inspired by Disney.

Ususually it's used as an excuse for why I shouldn't just *assume* that the blonde haired blue eyed characters with no epicanthic fold on their eyes are white.  They're not actually white, they're just drawn like white people cause a dude like Disney animation once, but we're supposed to read ""Japanese."""
Sonic X,"Mickey Mouse. Astro Boys design is partly inspired by Mickey Mouse.

Edit: And Superman(1940)."
Sonic X,"Anime is still niche even though its on TV. I know the market for it fairly well. Its one of those things its hard to argue with fanboys about to tell them its not as popular as you think it is. Anime in the west is often very very cheap to buy (especially in europe) and brings in decent ratings (especially late night), so its a bit of a value play, not a play on popularity.

Traditional western animation instead completely dumps on it for ratings, viewership, and ad relevance."
Suits,I wonder if he will encounter the C1A in this movie.
Suits,"I guess the copy editor is on vacation. It's MI6, not M16. The article gets it right only in a quote, which I assume was copied and pasted instead of retyped.

Suits,It and I not a 1. M16 HAHAHAH
Suits,"Nice to see him getting work outside of Daredevil, wouldn't want him to never play literally any other role again!"
Suits,Why does he look blind
Suits,"
What is this fucking headline. Took me a couple minutes because I was like, wait, what does Treason have to do with Born Again and why is Daredevil pretending to be an M16 agent?"
Suits,"That’s M I 6, ( Em Eye Six ) and the lack of serifs on the Apple Font is a curse on all mankind."
Suits,"Finally, I desperately needed some more cox in my life."
Suits,M I 6.  Not m16
Suits,"Will this be his audition for the new 007? Anytime there is going to be a new Bond and I see a ""young"" British actor take on a spy/action role, it feels like an audition."
Suits,So is he a M16A1 or an M16A2?
Suits,When do we get to see him as the next Casanova in a Casanova sequel?
Suits,I hope he remembers to look at the other actors instead of past them. Apparently that’s why he didn’t get the role of young Han Solo when he auditioned for it. He had trained himself to play blind for Daredevil and forgot to stop.
Suits,Well now we know op is a paid shiller because he copied M16 lol. And how dumb are collider authors to not know what they are talking about? there's like hundred of spy films/show and it's always mi6 not m16
Suits,"After starting Daredevil, he really didn’t do much else."
Suits,Wuff!
Suits,MI6 not M16
Suits,What is M16?
Suits,He is costumed as a rifle? Transformers?
Suits,I’m down for anything Charlie Cox is in. Fantastic actor.
Suits,"I swear for like 2 seconds I was thinking ""but that sounds hard to do considering he's blind"""
Suits,Where are his sunglasses?
Suits,That suit jacket is too tight. The dreaded X at the button
Suits,Going to have to check it out but the plot sounds generic af
Suits,He should play a brother to Robert Pattinson in something. That would be a cool dynamic.
Suits,Charlie cox and ciaran hinds in another project together is nice to see.
Suits,No it's the Russian KFC
Suits,And FB1
Suits,Maybe he's an M16 assault rifle agent
Suits,Capital I’s and 1’s are hard!
Suits,What color is the outhouse at Hereford?
Suits,They're actually talking about his rating in the movie. He plays an agent meant for Mature audiences (16+).

Suits,"I’d say he was one of the luckier Daredevil cast, in that he has been somewhat busy since the hiatus. His other show “Kin” has been renewed, and he did Westend and Broadway."

If he was making that much for only a recurring guest stint, how much does the main cast make? 

I feel bad for the actor who played his husband because he ultimately lost his job too over this as both characters left town."
Suits,"Whittled down? Is that a legal term, or is Hollywood Reporter just being weird?"
Suits,"So an ""injection"" of a ""man made substance"" doesn't apply to tattoo ink then?

DUNBAR: I have 12. I have one that is an ancient character meaning power and strength in every situation. I did my research so I know it doesn’t say pork fried rice or something like that. There has to be something halfway sadistic about being an artist and there is a part of me that enjoys the pain of getting tattoos. There’s something somewhat orgasmic about it. It’s like excruciating ecstasy. The first tattoo I got was with my girlfriend in junior high. Since then it’s become like an addiction that I will keep quiet."
Suits,"Shame.

always liked this dude in The mentalist and Prison Break.

Is ""Church of Universal Wisdom"" even protected as a religion?

> ""The Congregation of Universal Wisdom asserts that injection of any medication or other man-made substance would violate the sanctity of the body. ""

Also there is no fucking way those members dont take any injections, like do they just die if they happen to need surgery of some kind?

unless there is a loophole for them somewhere, dont really care to look for it tho."
Suits,"> Church of Universal Wisdom

Suits,[deleted]
Suits,"I'm catholic. The pope came out out and said there is no restriction on getting the covid vaccine. Yet right wing biships and priests in certain areas of the US were giving people written eeligious exemptions to take to their employers. Locally a group of nurses, who are supposed to based in science, were let go from tbe local hospital because they refused to get vaccinated. I have no sympathy for these nurses. And while I like Mr. Dunbar as an actor, I have no sympathy for him either  It's so apparent, that many of the people who ran out to get a religious exemption, weren't getting them for an actual religious belief, but for political reasons"
Suits,"You would think that ""universal wisdom"" would be a synonym for ""common sense,"" but apparently not."
Suits,">A federal judge has trimmed a lawsuit from Rockmond Dunbar, a former actor on *911*, over his dismissal from the hit drama series for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

>Disney and 20th Television no longer face a disparate impact claim, which accused them of advancing a vaccination policy discriminating against followers of the Church of Universal Wisdom.

>They still face 10 other claims, ranging from religious and racial discrimination to retaliation and breach of contract.

>Dunbar sued in February 2022 after his requests for both a religious exemption and medical exemption based on an undisclosed disability were denied. His contract had over $1.3 million left to be paid out.

>Dunbar claims he’s been placed on a “do not hire” list over his refusal to get the vaccine.

Antivaxxers love a “medical exemption based on an undisclosed disability.” And they want the right to refuse a vaccination, but deny anyone else’s right to not want to hire them."
Suits,"Anyone wanna join my new church, the church of really smart? We plan on suing the IRS because the Holy Spirit told us that only everyone not a member of our church should pay taxes, but we are the chosen should receive the benefits of said taxes.

Val Kilmer is a Christian scientist, and he's been dying for awhile. That is his choice.

You can't refuse a vaccine, then sue because your employer doesn't want you to spread a virus to other people."
Suits,Golly. Where else will they find other actors to fill those roles?
Suits,Him and Emilio Estevez. Torching their own careers because of vax scares.
Suits,Flat Earther’s kinda crowd. Now that’s diversity no one is talking about!
StoryZoo,Quarry should have been more entertaining than it was.
StoryZoo,"Yeah I loved the idea, and the people involved and their previous projects, but for some reason Quarry just didn't stick with me. Watched it all but hardly remember it."
StoryZoo,"Definitely my favourite anime of the year, even though the ending seems a bit rushed"
StoryZoo,"I love the soundtrack, but hate the opening and ending songs."
StoryZoo,this isn't your blog
StoryZoo,"i kno. but instead of being all negative n shit, check out the show tho."
StoryZoo,You are on a sub for television. OP writes a review about a tv show. This is absolutely what the sub is designed for.
StoryZoo,"Next time you rewatch, pay more attention to Lucretia.  I get that she's not in the fight scenes, but from Gods of the Arena to Vengence her arc is fucking outstanding.  She's the best villain in the series, imo.

Her arc with Illythia was anything but a waste of time."
StoryZoo,"That first season of Spartacus was so special.  I'll never forget it.  There was one scene in particular where the elites have Spartacus kill his own friend for sport.  That scene has stuck with me for a very long time.  Whitfield was a fantastic actor.  I never looked at the later seasons because I saw Whitfield as Spartacus.  Based on some of the comments, it sounds like McIntyre has did well in the role so I may reconsider taking a look at the later seasons."
StoryZoo,Yet again the Gods spread cheek and ram COCK IN ASS!
StoryZoo,I love Kill them all episode (S1 Finale)
StoryZoo,"As a New Zealander, it was so cool to see so many Kiwis in the show, and also seeing half the cast from Shortland Street getting tits and dicks out."
StoryZoo,"I'm on my fourth or 5th burn though, wish went on to continue Ceasar and Crassus story at the end bit I'm pretty sure there's a show called Rome that pretty much does that. 

I want the team that made this show to tackle other historical events or do a Mortal Kombat series."
StoryZoo,"Seen this twice, such a great show."
StoryZoo,Quintus Lentulus Batiatus is one of my top all time favorite TV Characters
StoryZoo,"Awesome show. I was so skeptical of someone stepping into Andy's shoes. It was a little awkward for a few min, but Liam McIntyre nailed it once he got a groove."
StoryZoo,"Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?"
StoryZoo,Spartacus is the GOAT but what is OPs post?  It's too organized; I'm skeptical and confused.
StoryZoo,I came for the gladiator fights but stayed for the full frontal male nudity.
StoryZoo,YET AGAIN THE GODS SPREAD CHEECKS TO PUT COCK IN FUCKING ARSE!
StoryZoo,"Huge fan of the first two series, less of the third and fourth ones.

I think what I like most about these is that the emotions just feel so raw.  The passion.  The hatred.  The naked ambition.  Combined with the visceral visuals the shows packs quite a wallop, and is way, way more effective and entertaining than it has any right to be.

To me the biggest revelation was how effectively vicious John Hannah could be."
StoryZoo,Definitely one of my favorite shows. Andy and Liam both do an equally amazing job and the supporting cast is also awesome. It’s a yearly watch for me.
StoryZoo,"ASHER, FUCKING VICTOR!!"
StoryZoo,And what of good Solonius?
StoryZoo,Binge watched Spartacus this year for the first time and I love it.. great show.
StoryZoo,I remember being very iffy on the pilot (the violence was super cartoony). So glad I stuck it out - incredible show.
StoryZoo,"> Spartacus: War of the Damned is the most beautiful season of the series. From the new costumes, to the well choreographed battle scenes, to the color grading and slight tweaks to its visual style, favoring more slow-motion shots and glare... it is the peak of Spartacus'

Lost me here. Third and fourth season were painful to watch compared to the first two. The battles in particular were just random slow motion bullshit which never lived up to the more visceral gladiator duels from the first two seasons."
StoryZoo,"The best

Hoping Starz makes another show like Spartacus"
StoryZoo,JUPITER'S COCK! What a fun show. RIP Andy.
StoryZoo,"Dayum I only just finished my re-watch a month or so ago, so would have loved to take part in this discussion. But may as well throw my thoughts into there.

*Spartacus: Blood & Sand* on paper seems like it should be a relic from the early 2010s trend of 'rudie nudie' TV like *Vikings, Camelot, Game of Thrones* etc. Having never watched *Vikings* but the latter two, I can say that *Spartacus* has aged infinitely better than them. Especially in terms of female, race and queer representation.

I mean, *GOT*'s most prominent non-white characters were Khal Drogo (leader of a barbaric warrior race who starts out regularly raping a delicate white female and then dies anticlimactically), Missandei (token Black friend to a white female mistress, and has no role in the plot outside of being nice and translating, later getting disposed of to motivate Dany and Grey Worm), Grey Worm himself (not a bad rep but by the end of the series is happily slaughtering innocents) and Talisa Maegyr (also not as bad but killed off when her white book counterpart lived). *Spartacus* had actual characters and not just tokens. And on my re-watch, I really was struck by the characterization of Naevia.

It's extremely rare for the most prominent non-white woman in the cast to be portrayed as this complete innocent, defined by her kindness and empathy towards others. We've all seen the Token Black Friend trope - where the character is super smart, gifted at everything, supportive and rarely there to serve her own story. And while there's nothing 'wrong' with a positive Black character, it has a result that Black girls are often seen as less innocent because they're perceived as being older and smarter than they are (check out a video essay ""The Day Rue Became Black"", highlighting how some *Hunger Games* fans assumed Rue was a white girl because the personification of childhood innocence was rarely never white). 

Naevia meanwhile is that Silk Hiding Steel character - like a Desdemona or Juliet whose rebellion comes out in ways beyond physical aggression. The way Naevia realises she doesn't care what she takes from Lucretia anymore and taunts her with *""Crixus never loved you. He did only as commanded""* and then tells Oenomaus about Barca's death is how that character's strength is defined. And when Lucretia is torturing her, the scene keeps cutting back to Mira making a shocked face; highlighting that seeing *this* person being attacked is one of the worst things she's ever witnessed. And a white woman taking revenge on a brown girl for being more desirable than her? The fact that torturing Naevia is seen as the moment Lucretia really crosses the line is very powerful. And the plot being driven by the need to rescue her - Kerry Washington took a generic damsel in distress role for *Django Unchained* and said it was because films were rarely about the need to save a Black woman's life.

Sadly they completely fucked that character over. The recasting was a problem too, and it didn't need to happen. Lesley Ann Brandt had joined the first season for a seven-episode arc that got expanded when they liked her performance. She was a 'local hire' at that point, meaning she wasn't paid very much. In between *Gods of the Arena* and *Vengeance*, she moved to America now that she had her ticket out of the small New Zealand industry. Once in LA, she discovered she was getting paid more for a single guest spot on *NCIS* than *Spartacus* was offering. As Naevia was now a regular who'd be appearing in multiple seasons, she negotiated for a SAG contract, which would mean more pay. Unfortunately a manager botched the deal, and she fired him shortly after. 

The new actress had her work cut out for her, because Lesley Ann Brandt got how that character was supposed to work. But the writing dropped the ball with Naevia too. Naevia was not a rebel fighter. If she had to get physical, it would only be if she absolutely had to; like maybe becoming an archer at best. She was not bloodthirsty or out for revenge. She's someone who took care of birds she didn't need to in order to honour a poor boy who killed himself believing his lover deserted him (when she knew the truth and couldn't give him that relief). She's someone who went out of her way to help her traumatized friend escape the ludus to stop her from killing herself. And when she's about to be separated from Crixus, she tries to reassure him and get justice for Barca's murder. *Vengeance* decided to go with the whole 'mad trauma survivor' storyline and it just didn't work with the previously established character. It's basically like how they fucked Sansa over in *Game of Thrones*, where her compassion is framed as childish naivety she has to outgrow, and thus feeding Ramsay to his own dogs or trash talking Daenerys is seen as 'empowering'.

Illithyia's character got done dirty too. I'm not sure what was up with *Vengeance* trying to twist things around so that Lucretia becomes the more sympathetic of the two. Lucretia was always worse than Illithyia; she poisoned her father-in-law for revenge. She spent six years raping one of her slaves. She tricked a woman into sleeping with a man she hates solely out of jealousy. She approved of the murders of innocent civilians and children if it served their agenda. And everything she does in the final two episodes of *Blood & Sand* were in service of showing how awful a person she was, climaxing in the comeuppance where Crixus stabs her in the womb to kill her and their child by rape. Now here comes another between seasons problem.

With Andy Whitfield's passing meaning they'd be getting a new Spartacus, and Cynthia Addai-Robinson taking over as Naevia, the show runners were already worried that the transition would be alienating enough with the storylines veering out of the familiar setting of the ludus. So hoping to keep as many familiar faces around as possible to help with the change, and Lucy Lawless loving the character so much and being so fun to work with, they retcon Lucretia's death and keep her in the game. I'm sure the intent was to build on the twisted frenemy thing between her and Illithyia...but the problem is how keeping Lucretia in the story affected her arc.

Illithyia was a villain yes, but a stupid one. She did nastier things yes - trying to get Segovax to kill Spartacus, convincing Numerius to have Varro killed - but the narrative also framed Illithyia as another victim of Quintus and Lucretia. Illithyia's flaw was not that she was malicious, but ignorant and impulsive. She was horrified that she beat Licinia to death and had nightmares over it, and she gets hit by her husband and humiliated repeatedly by Lucretia. The direction of the season put her not necessarily on Spartacus's side but sympathetic to his motives. It's significant that she has the doors locked when the slaves rebel rather than be killed in the massacre herself.

The *Vengeance* season even highlights things like her being forced to crucify an innocent slave by her husband, and she's revealed to be pregnant with Spartacus's baby. She's even stunned when Spartacus spares her life and reveals that Glaber does not love her. Add that to how karma keeps coming down on her, and showing how she is in a prison of her own, and you have an arc that's setting her up to properly turn on the Romans. Maybe not joining the rebellion but being sympathetic to the rebels. Her and Spartacus wouldn't have become friends or lovers, but maybe she'd get a sacrifice where she helps them at her own personal risk or does something selfless in the hopes of saving her child. The twist of her killing Seppia was just bad writing, and the kind of unexpected swerve that GOT would be criticised for overusing. Her death scene was so poorly done I didn't even realise she was supposed to be dead until she didn't appear in the *War of the Damned* premiere.

Despite all my issues with the *Vengeance* season (Mira and Aurelia were killed off far too soon just for shock value as well), I think *Spartacus* should be recognised as an important series. People talk about its violence, nudity and stylism as though it's a guilty pleasure or 'so bad it's good'. But it's one of those shows that managed to have both style and substance. I even did a video detailing how good it actually was in its first season, and why it should be talked about more."
StoryZoo,"Nice post(s). Have you watched Twin Peaks? Also, you gave season 1 of Misfits a 7.8!? The last episode and ending, tho. It is one of the most well-rounded seasons of a tv show, IMO. I do agree that S2E2 is probably the best of the series tho."
StoryZoo,They didnt have flat tops in ancient Rome!!
StoryZoo,What about that episode where Spartacus had a Piper Cub?
StoryZoo,Got the Blu-rays primed for a rewatch. Does anyone know if there's a 4k version? I've seen it mentioned there is on some streaming but is that just upscaled?
StoryZoo,My #1 favorite show.
StoryZoo,My fav tv show ever
StoryZoo,The best I ever watched. They need to shoot more seasons.
StoryZoo,also my fav show ever with some of the best action and dialogue I've ever seen.
StoryZoo,I just watched Gods of the Arena. Should blood and sand be next chronologically? And then vengeance and War of the dammed last?
StoryZoo,"This show will forever have a special place in my heart. It helped me desensitize myself to blood and violence. At least I was suicidal at the time.

Honestly, I am getting triggered just thinking about this but I know I’m heaps better than I was before watching it."
StoryZoo,"I only watched season 1 as a kid

I didn't want to watch the rest because I got used to the Spartacus actor

Noe that you reminded me of it, I'm thinking of finally watching the whole show"
StoryZoo,First season was awesome.  Prequel was ok.  I didn't like the sequel season.  Shame the Spartacus guy died of cancer.  He was the reason the first season was so good.
StoryZoo,"The dialogue in this show is ""Deadwood for people with debilitating brain injuries."""
StoryZoo,For me it's person of interest watched it like 7 times now.
StoryZoo,"You would side with Spartacus?
No, I stand the man himself!

Classic, I love this show"
StoryZoo,"Does the death of the main actor affected the quality of the series? I wanted to get back on this years ago but when i learned that Whitefield died and he was replaced by his brother iirc I've loss interest. Maybe my mind just can't accept no one can replace Andy coz s1 is so epic.
If it is epic as fuck as it used to be ill binge watch it rn."
StoryZoo,"I feel you man, i was legit sad for atleast a week when Andy Whitfield passed away..."
StoryZoo,"I remember watching this show for the first time as a 16 year old, and it was the coolest show ever made in my mind. Still love Spartacus. The news of Andy's passing was truly really sad at the time, and still is.

This is the type of show you just have to take at face value. Either you enjoy it or you don't. The dialogue is still just as stupid but funny. But the show has great tempo, although repetitive as the seasons go by."
StoryZoo,"I would not call it the best, but I fucking loved it, and the it's pretty much perfect for the story it told without needing to pretend to be more than that."
StoryZoo,Such an attractive main cast
StoryZoo,Again the Gods spread cheeks and ram cock in ass...and I rejoice. I shall lay eyes upon this tale once more. Jupiter's cock!
StoryZoo,"I really liked the show, but if you've seen one fighting sequence you've mostly see them all. So it got to the point where I would just FF past them."
StoryZoo,"I started watching the first season itn a whim while traveling.  Right off it kicked in with the slow motion, blood splattering the screen, Heavy metal-ish soundtrack, and I thought oh okay we're getting kind of a low rent ""300"" here.

Andy Whitfield just didn't fit the roll for me.  All the other gladiators were big beasts of men, and he just seemed average sized and moderately fit.

By the end of episode 2 or 3 I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role, it was just immediately one of the best things I'd ever seen on TV... Not that it's the greatest TV show ever, but it was the TV show I wanted to see.

When Andy got sick I was just crushed, but his treatment went well and the production company went out of their way to keep the show alive while still maintaining his his place.

When Andy died it just sucked everything out of me, I never watched another episode of the show.  I'm not opposed to watching the recast seasons, and I fully intend to eventually, but damn it just still feels too soon,"
StoryZoo,"Do you own a blog? Can u check it out?

I love your writing!"
StoryZoo,"So, I'm going to assume that your cock continues to rage on."
StoryZoo,All seasons except for vengeance are 10/10
StoryZoo,"My only annoyance - They botched the ending.
Spartacus should have killed crasus before being speared in the back.

Caesar wipes out 3 of the heroes. Not a fan of navea but the blonde girl deserved better. 
At least have a 1 on 1 with Gannicus - of which Gannicus would win & then have a Roman spear or get him with an arrow."
StoryZoo,Lucy Lawless was fucking flawless in that role. She stole every single scene she was in and was easily one of my favorite parts of the series. How they ended her arc was nothing short of spectacular.
StoryZoo,"Every time someone says Jai Courtney can't act, I point them to Spartacus. He was excellent in the show, and wish he had been around longer. Being hit with shit roles doesn't mean someone has shit acting skills."
StoryZoo,"Words fall from your mouth like shit from errant hole.

Lol on a serious note, the prequel they did after S1, Gods of the Arena, is phenomenal. Season 2, Vengeance, takes some warming up to the new lead, and takes a bit to find it's footing, even though the quality of everything is still stellar. 

Season 3, War of the Damned, is among the best seasons of television ever created. McIntyre absolutely BECOMES Spartacus and delivers big time."
StoryZoo,The prequel season coming out gave me time to digest him being replaced.
StoryZoo,"I’m with you on this- Andy was perfect. Watch the 6 episode prequel to meet Gannicus. Then start season 2, Gannicus and Crixus will keep you going until you warm up to the Spartacus replacement."
StoryZoo,His name was Varro :(
StoryZoo,"McIntyre struggled in season two but was great in three! Especially the finale, you can totally see the beast he can be. Definetly watch it through, you won't regret it."
StoryZoo,"Even if a Daniel Day Lewis quality actor replaced Whitfield it still wouldn’t have been the same. Whitfield WAS Spartacus to me, and I still haven’t been able to watch the rest of the show. Also, if you want a good cry, watch the documentary about his last few months, Be Here Now. heartbreaking."
StoryZoo,holy crap ive watched through all of spartacus like half a year+ ago and want to rewatch it that's y I found this thread but I literally didn't notice the actor change
StoryZoo,The roman dialogue in this show was top notch.
StoryZoo,I still love how often Batiatus complained about the gods fucking home in the ass
StoryZoo,"Watching this and then watching him in the mummy is hard to get used to, I keep expecting those lines lol"
StoryZoo,You expect me to spread cheek and accept deeper ramming
StoryZoo,"The one episode that always gets to me the most is The Thing in the Pit.  So full of desperation and despair, and then a turn of honour even from Batiatus."
StoryZoo,"Felt very cathartic after a season's worth of the casual cruelty and inhumanity from Batiatus and co. to see Crixus yelling ""Kill them all!"" as he leads the charging slaves."
StoryZoo,"I was so invested in the politics of the gladiators and the colosseums and such that when that episode ended, I was all ""But wait...who's gonna be the next winner in the ring?"" before realising that was not the main formula of the show."
StoryZoo,"Mmm, Manu Bennett's kiwi fruits."
StoryZoo,"Rome starts after Caesar and Crassus parted ways. At the start of the series, the First Triumvirate has already fractured. It would be so cool to get a Roman show portraying the First Triumvirate though"
StoryZoo,"Sadly Steven S DeKnight had years worth of storylines planned, but they told him before *War of the Damned* that he had just one more season to wrap everything up. There were even some films planned, but they weren't sure if they'd be able to get away with their explicitness as they could on Starz."
StoryZoo,Liam was good but always missed Andy and thought he filled the roll much better.
StoryZoo,"Andy was the better gladiator, Liam the better commander.

They both embody the dual aspects of Spartacus."
StoryZoo,"Have you ever seen a grown man...  eh, never mind I don't need that in my post history."
StoryZoo,Prod value was really high!
StoryZoo,"Yeah, that fucking Syrian!  Nick E. Tarabay"
StoryZoo,"His death was originally going to be much different. But then they saw how good shape the actor was in, so they changed it to have him put up a decent fight in the arena."
StoryZoo,"Here just do say your opinion is shit, seasons 3 and 4 have some of the best battles in the show, you are the minority here.  Also, blocked. Bye."
StoryZoo,Wonder what setting/story they could use to make a similar show.
StoryZoo,"> Have you watched Twin Peaks?

Of course. Twice! One of my favorites. Unfortunately I haven't seen it since I started doing these posts so I haven't had the chance to write about it. 

> Misfits a 7.8!?

Because production values really. I'm also rating on visuals, efx etc. and those things were quite poor at the start of Misfits. 

> I do agree that S2E2 is probably the best of the series tho.

Yup. Glad we at least agree on something here. 😊"
StoryZoo,"Chronologically yes, but the actual viewing order is blood and sand first, *then* gods."
StoryZoo,What do you mean
StoryZoo,"Retarded comment, the is some cheesy dialogue but overral is great, don't be a smartass. Blocked"
StoryZoo,"I think having spartacus kill Crassus would be an odd deviation from actual history, I mean they took some liberties but the events of the show theoretically could have happened in real life.
Agree Naevia sucked as a character and honestly actress in s3 and 4. The blonde girl had a really sad ending yeah overall good character.
Gannicus got kinda shafted yeah but Caesar didnt actually beat him 1v1"
StoryZoo,They don't call her Flawless Lawless for nothing!
StoryZoo,"u/i_love_anachronisms yep, as was Viva Bianca."
StoryZoo,"Right after this he became Hollywoods it guy and shoved him in turd after turd.

Its interesting how good his little role in the new suicide squad movie was. Amazing what a competent director can do with jais talents. 

In 15 years hes going to finally get a breakout role."
StoryZoo,Holy shit I never realised that was Jai Courtney. I've watched season 1 over 5 times and didn't recognize him.
StoryZoo,"Mate, I honestly don't think I could handle watching that documentary.  Like you, Whitfield was Spartacus and for me it felt like the show ended with is passing.  However, it has been years and a lot of other comments talk about how good the other actor did so I might give it a shot."
StoryZoo,Jupiter's Cock!
StoryZoo,That's the turning point for the season too. After that episode the story basically kicks into high gear. It's a great episode.
StoryZoo,"Whitfield was better at showing emotional vulnerability, which was needed in that first season."
StoryZoo,Have you ever been to a Turkish prison?
StoryZoo,"I know right, dude was old guy ripped!   Spartacus gives him a little compliment ""You're not without skill"", and then reveals that Batiatus will join him presently, his laugh, his death, it was fucking a great send off for a character that the other characters always spoke down to."
StoryZoo,"I hope for

Space 

Cyberpunk

Fantasy

Post-Apocalypse 

What else is there to be honest?

I guess gangster/mafia could work as well but there is already Peaky Blinders.

Space would be a good one. Very hard to pull off.

They could have different races.

Another good one would be pirates or space pirates. I know there is Black Sails. There are not many Space Pirate shows ongoing right now.

I guess there is Cowboy Bepop but the live action is more along the lines of comedy.

Star Wars is making many shows so would be a difficult move.

Starz could surprise us and go the anime route. Isekai! People transported to another world. There are many dark anime out there that I am a fan of. By this I mean live action adaptation."

Chocolate,Mash is fantastic.
Chocolate,"Love this scene. These kind of scenes are important for a character like Winchester, or any character that's intended as some form of opposite to the main characters. You can have scenes of him being insanely pompous and up his own ass, but you need scenes of him like this one or the scene where he defends a soldier with a stammer. To not have them be capable of growth, or showing a different side to them results in a Frank Burns, who isn't a terrible character but is bound to run out of steam when you just focus on the one side of them.

This scene also reminds me of that scene from Star Trek: TNG when Data was acting as Captain and Worf was his First Officer. Worf was openly showing annoyance or impatience and Data pulled him aside and criticized this. Worf took the criticism and even apologized for it. Very easy to have had that be a nexus of tension for the rest of the episode but I love when they show professionalism and maturity in characters. Winchester recognizes instantly that the choice the pastor made was a good one, apologized and shook his hand. We need more of this."
Chocolate,"Scenes like this is why Charles was a better character than Frank.  Charles felt like a real human being, while Frank was nothing more than a punchline."
Chocolate,"For MASH fans who might be pirates, I learned a while ago that you can get this show as it aired in Britain, which got rid of the laugh track. So much better."
Chocolate,"It doesn't get enough love, but one of my favourite scenes for Charles was his first Christmas at the 4077th.  He was miserable until Radar gave him a gift.  He knew Charles wasn't happy there and wrote to Charles' mother to ask her to send something to cheer him up, and she sent Charles' old toboggan hat.  Charles was so happy he started crying and when Radar confessed that it was Father Mulchahey's idea, Charles gave him what looked like all the money he had (which looked to be a few hundred dollars) for the Orphan's Christmas fund."
Chocolate,"Charles was such a great character.  My favorite character within my favorite ensemble cast.

Also, all three MASH Christmas episodes were great (""'Twas the Day After Christmas"" was good as well if you count it, although I'd probably put that below the other three.)"
Chocolate,"They should have called this episode ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factor."""
Chocolate,It got a little weird towards the end but I can still watch it over and over!
Chocolate,"I absolutely detested Charles the first time I watched MASH. I thought Frank's exit from the show was weak and that the character deserved better.

It didn't take long however, until Charles became my favourite character after Hawkeye.

He was a pompous ass, but he was OUR pompous ass."
Chocolate,"Yup.   Frank couldn't show growth, or the jokes would have been mean and cruel.  

Charles,  otoh, was so very human,  and grew steadily throughout the series."
Chocolate,"While technically my least favorite character, I've grown to appreciate Frank in his own way over the years.  A fun antagonist, well played by Larry Linville.

That being said, as I mentioned in my own post, Charles is my favorite character on the show, so I definitely agree with you.  The difference is like night and day for me.  Such a wonderfully well-rounded character, and David Ogden Stiers nailed every part of the character IMO.  Especially the unexpectedly human moments like this."
Chocolate,"all the character replacements were for the better, but yeah, ESPECIALLY this one. Frank just dragged the show down."
Chocolate,"I would say all the replacements were better characters. My dad is a fan of the orifycast especially Blake but for my money Winchester, Potter, and Honeycutt felt more fleshed out and real. Still love it all though."
Chocolate,"Likewise for DVD owners, which gives the option for both audio tracks.  It really is a great way to experience the show."
Chocolate,"Well, I for one consider that one of the best moments from my favorite MASH character.

""Here, give the orphans everything they need.""  Reaches back into pocket.  ""Here, give them everything they Don't need."""
Chocolate,"""You saved me, Father. You lowered a bucket into the well of my despair and you raised me up to the light of day.""

Within a great Father Mulcahy episode, he stole the show with that one moment."
Chocolate,"They wrote themselves into a corner with Frank.

As you said, he couldn't show growth without the jokes becoming cruel. But if he can't grow, well, why hang around doing the same thing every year?

And that was because he was around when the show started out and was totally sitcom. The character just didn't lend itself to what MASH became. Frank had to go. And Larry Linville knew that. Frank couldn't hold up in the Dramedy era. They needed a Charles, a character who could be both the asshole to rub up against, but could grow, and give as good as he got."
Chocolate,"Chaaahles… Emehson… Winchestah…. The Theud. 

Gentlemahhhhhn."
Chocolate,The only one that I am somewhat mixed on is Blake vs Potter.  I just really loved the Blake/Radar dynamic.
Chocolate,"My favourite bit of trivia about BCS is that Rhea, Bob Odenkirk and Patrick Fabian all lived in a rented house together. It was Bob's idea because they all got along and, as he said, ""Do you really want to spend six months of the year living in a hotel room?""

Vince would swing by from time to time because, as he said, ""They always had really good ice cream."""
Chocolate,"It's a secret second Breaking Bad movie

""Purple Car: A Breaking Bad Movie"" follows the Thelma-&-Louise style adventures of Kim Wexler and Marie Shrader, who has finally successfully stolen something after her Season 1/Season 4/Season 5 failures."
Chocolate,Her acting is phenomenal in BCS. So many scenes where she doesn't speak and conveys so many emotional changes with her face
Chocolate,"Anything she's a part of I will be excited to see, then throw in Vince and you've just got me hyped as heck for this!"
Chocolate,Sometimes a Reddit thread comes along and reminds you that you’re often commenting alongside a load of kids.
Chocolate,"Vince Gilligan has earned my trust, I'll watch anything he makes hoping he doesn't somehow devolve"
Chocolate,"Her character was so great.  I feel like it's not a type of character you see often in tv.  


She gave off that introverted, slightly awkward vibe while still very good at standing up for herself and doing a kickass job as a lawyer. I don't think I'm describing it well but whatever it is she felt pretty unique."
Chocolate,"What's funny is the first show I saw Seehorn in, was Whitney Cummings sitcom and my lasting memory of that show is if they killed the star of the show off, the show would have been decent"
Chocolate,"Looks like they killed ""Linoleum"" before it had a chance - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linoleum_(film)?useskin=vector :

""Filming wrapped in New York City in November 2020.""

""It premiered at the 2022 South by Southwest festival""

""It was released in select theaters in the United States on February 24, 2023""

""Box office: $26,987"""

...Hot Pocket?"
Chocolate,more power to Rhea‼️ 💕
Chocolate,I saw Anna Gunn on a flight I was on last week and she was reading a script with her name watermarked big on all the pages. Not sure what it was for and I didn’t ask but I was thinking maybe something BrBa related.
Chocolate,I’d watch a show where she and Betsy Kettleman compare paint chips
Chocolate,She’s hot.
Chocolate,She’s amazing
Chocolate,I’m in!
Chocolate,"Can’t wait for the Twilight Zone-esque show, I hope they reveal more info soon."
Chocolate,‘Better Semme Emmy’s’
Chocolate,The Hollywood reporter on making all actress photos as sexy as possible.
Chocolate,I have no idea who she is and don’t watch the show but she is gorgeous
Chocolate,"I must say that I thought Rhea Seehorn as the ‘wonderful’ Kim in BCS seemed the ideal American woman! Yes, yes, I know it’s damn acting...but sometimes you get a glimpse of the person beneath the facade. I say this as an Englishman. Only lots of American actresses seem to be too mouthy, and have an over inflated opinion of their beauty. But she seemed or is really rather fine."
Chocolate,"Old news, but hyped for this."
Chocolate,It will be the first television show to be 100% close up shots of feet.
Chocolate, Z ze
Chocolate,Gah she’s so gorgeous
Chocolate,[removed]
Chocolate,Is it really a reunion if it’s been less than 5 years?
Chocolate,"For those who don't know:

As they were reuniting with Vince Gilligan, they decided it would be better to call Saul Star her real name Rhea Seehorn, to not offend anyone.

(clearly, people are not able to detect sarcasm anymore)"
Chocolate,Did anyone notice that in her real life she looks really beautiful?
Chocolate,Forcing the 💉is fascism. When was the last time a black person was denied entree to a restaurant? Cause it happened to my white ass  last year.
Chocolate,"She stole the show with better call Saul, I’m for it"
Chocolate,Phew. That picture is spicy
Chocolate,this is the cutest thing
Chocolate,"Actually, the ice cream store is closed today.  You didn’t know this? When it’s too cold outside, all the ice cream stores close, because the ice cream machines freeze up and they don’t work anymore."
Chocolate,That is a very Vince Gilligan thing to say.
Chocolate,Damn if I ever worked on a Gilligan show I'd be chasing that for the rest of my career. It really comes across how decent and dedicated the people both behind and in front of the cameras are.
Chocolate,I wonder if the actor that played Lalo ever dropped by unexpectedly..
Chocolate,"I wonder who would stop by to cook, seeing as some characters competed in [Breaking Kitchen with Gordon Ramsey](https://youtu.be/j3FzkEoIQBw)"
Chocolate,Was it blue bell mint chocolate chip?
Chocolate,Oh to have been a bug on the wall in that house
Chocolate,Blue Bell ice cream?
Chocolate,“Did anyone order Pollos Hermanos?”
Chocolate,And Bob got up to make everyone smoothies every morning
Chocolate,I ran into the three of them out to dinner in Albuquerque last year.  They were all nice and let us snap a picture as they were walking to the parking lot….
Chocolate,Initially misread this as they were living in a haunted house.
Chocolate,Thats awesome. Def smashed
Chocolate,Was it bluebell mint chocolate chip every Friday?
Chocolate,Now I'm mad because I would legitimately watch this and know it will never exist.
Chocolate,"The only reason she wasn’t successful before was because Hank was alive so he could easily bail her out. 

Now she’s going to legitimately break bad and become a master thief."
Chocolate,Actually it's a psychedelic thriller about Kim being chased by the hat man while she was unconsciously dreaming after she was >!knocked out after crashing her car!<.
Chocolate,"The scene on the bus. Holy shit that was top tier acting.

https://youtu.be/fm0tKZs-XCk"
Chocolate,Wexler brushing her teeth is the best.
Chocolate,"Yer darn tootin yer heckin hyped!  Gosh dang it, its gonna be absolutely fudgin phenomenal!"
Chocolate,The great tragedy of the Internet is there's no age-gating.
Chocolate,Sometimes?
Chocolate,Been noticing that a lot more lately
Chocolate,Even if he never makes anything good ever again he’ll still go down as one of the greats
Chocolate,[deleted]
Chocolate,"Lol I know exactly what you mean, she’s like competent and bold but also has the anxieties of a regular person"
Chocolate,My memory of that show is NBC trying to kill *Community* so that that show could exist...
Chocolate,"Yeah, that was a very confusing article. 

>Five weeks after Saul ended, Seehorn and Gilligan announced they were reuniting for a new series on Apple TV+, as the streamer ordered two seasons and outbid at least a half-dozen other networks and platforms in the process. Little is known about their new drama, except that it veers away from the antihero, a staple of Gilligan’s work the last 15 years.

and then:

>Linoleum is now playing in select theaters."
Chocolate,When you have ChatGPT write your articles
Chocolate,"Have you heard about the Chicken Pot Pie Hot Pocket? Now they’re just messin’ with us. “Have you tried the Hah’ Pocket Hah’ Pocket? Tastes just like a Hah’ Pocket filled with a Hah’ Pocket” …*HOT
POCKETS*"
Chocolate,Dunk it in a toilet
Chocolate,That’s the movie she’s in. Not the new show.
Chocolate,"I hope not honestly. They have three great projects already. Skyler is perhaps the character I'd like to see again the least. Not because I hate her or anything, her story just seemed complete and if there was a time for an appearance it would have been during BCS. She's a wonderful actor and deserves to spread her wings in non BB repeated projects, hopefully projects where her ""fans"" treat her as an actual human."
Chocolate,She got a recurring role in an upcoming Apple TV show called “Sugar” with Colin Farrell so maybe that script is from that show.
Chocolate,"goddesses: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/w9khfq/better_call_betsy_kim/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
Chocolate,She's looking very good for being 50. Good for her.
Chocolate,I swear  I had an instant crush when I saw her in Better Call Saul.
Chocolate,She has an unbelievable smile.
Chocolate,reddit moment
Chocolate,"As are her feet, apparently.

(Edit: Downvoted by... embarrassed foot fetishists? It's not ***me*** that made it a thing you animals! Lol)"
Chocolate,Even Gus would smash
Chocolate,Do yourself a favor and watch it.
Chocolate,Least horny chicanery
Chocolate,When i haven't seen someone for several years i absolutely consider that a reunion when i see them again.
Chocolate,What?
Chocolate,"> (clearly, people are not able to detect sarcasm anymore)    

Sarcasm conveys *irony*, I don't think anyone even understands what point you're trying to make therefore the irony lost.   

TL;DR: Bad sarcasm is bad."
Chocolate,are you having a stroke?
Sugar Rush Christmas,"bruh, i almost thought this was a revival season for the Sugar Rush (UK) series from early 2000s. I almost lost my shit. lol."
Sugar Rush Christmas,A cross over with Nailed would be really fun
Sugar Rush Christmas,July 31
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Finally! It's about bloody time! Jeez. We've been waiting to hear if Netflix was going to renew ""Sugar Rush"" for a third season. They confirmed it a couple of months ago but didn't give us a date of when they would drop it. I'm looking forward to it! Although, I'm confused that the prize money has gone from $10,000 down to $1,500. What's up with that?"
Sugar Rush Christmas,A cross over with Nailed It would be really fun
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I really like the show, but one complaint is they they are tweaking the rules every season when the first season model was fine"
Sugar Rush Christmas,"You're not going to top The Great British Bake Off, no matter how many variants of the baking show you throw at the wall, so please stop and just give us more of The Great British Bake Off."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Glad I wasn’t the only one
Sugar Rush Christmas,Same
Sugar Rush Christmas,"They didn't lower the prize money. They added an ""extra sweet"" twist to the winners of Round 1 and Round 2. They can either get 15 extra minutes or $1500. The winner still gets $10000."
Sugar Rush Christmas,[deleted]
Sugar Rush Christmas,There was a UK LGBT series called Sugar Rush from the 00's. I  thought this might have been an American remake... 
Sugar Rush Christmas,I wonder how many confused Wreck-It-Ralph fans will watch this while waiting for the sequel?
Sugar Rush Christmas,Yes but it's also good and thoroughly watchable. Personally I love no-frills cooking competitions like this. It has a small twist in terms of mechanics but ultimately it's just people cooking neat stuff. There isn't any random ingredients like Chopped or insane drama like Hell's Kitchen. Netflix could produce a ton more of this low budget stuff and I'd keep watching it. 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Loved that show so much. Was gutted it got cancelled, along with so many more. Netflix don't get my money anymore."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"yes... yes... a million times, yes. loved insatiable."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I enjoyed the first season but never completed the second one.

It got a lot of hate for fat shaming which missed the point imo."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Loved Insatiable it was so campy and over the top. Maybe I'll start a rewatch tonight
Sugar Rush Christmas,I just watched it. Wow. That was a wild ride! Absolutely want more. Any hope??
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Sadly, it got cancelled. We won't see any more of it."
Sugar Rush Christmas,I'm open to there being a hallway fight scene in every show ever from now on 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Was that Remy Danton?! Also, Marvel do love their hallway fights."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Commissioner Burrell giving good advice. The Wire Hype.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Luke Cage, Defenders, and DareDevil Season 3 news? Is it my birthday or something?"
Sugar Rush Christmas,A bulletproof black guy? This show is gonna be nightmare fuel for police officers all over America.
Sugar Rush Christmas,[deleted]
Sugar Rush Christmas,"September 30th! I had no idea the release date had been announced.

Fuck yeah."
Sugar Rush Christmas,This looks way fucking cooler than I imagined it would.
Sugar Rush Christmas,Sweet Christmas! 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I'm loving the slight yellow tint I'm seeing, like how JJ had the purple tint."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Looks great, although I wonder who/what in the Marvel Netflix-verse can challenge this guy? Seems like he'd stomp everyone Daredevil has faced... "
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Ol' Dirty Bastard-Shimmy Shimmy Ya https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ITLNzPoEqs
"
Sugar Rush Christmas,Setting the tone out of the gate with some ODB. Love it.
Sugar Rush Christmas,Really Liking their soundtrack and music choices for the bits we've seen so far. Looks completely different than JJ and DD.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Let the entire soundtrack be 80s and 90s rap.  

"
Sugar Rush Christmas,I appreciate the use of ODB.
Sugar Rush Christmas,This was a welcome distraction from the RNC
Sugar Rush Christmas,"He doored them!

But...why'd he need a door?  He's bulletproof!  It's just deadweight he has to carry around."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Lotsa doors getting kicked down.
Sugar Rush Christmas,I love me some Franke Faison. That man could read me Twilight and i'd cherish every word.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I just finished re-watching The Wire again for the billionth time and the thought of Luke Cage emulating that same visceral and raw tone that the Wire brought (which I know will never happen) would make me the happiest little fat kid on the planet.

Not to mention, a bullet proof black guy running around is definitely going to do wonders in squashing the beef between BLM and cops."
Sugar Rush Christmas,What a fight scene
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Damn, Agent Locke doesn't even need the armor anymore."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"""Marvel's The wire."""
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Jessica Jones had terrible fight scenes. This looks better.

Edit: the fight scenes in Jessica Jones were laughable. It's ok to truthfully criticize a Marvel product."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Awesome!
Sugar Rush Christmas,This looks hilarious and badass at the same time.
Sugar Rush Christmas,damn that looks dooope.  get it power man.
Sugar Rush Christmas,I love that Come At Me Bro before he ruins everyone's night.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Fun fact, car doors can't do shit against bullets...oh, well I guess with this guy it does not matter anyway."
Sugar Rush Christmas,[removed]
Sugar Rush Christmas,I worked on this show. Did some work on those hallway scenes too. This show's going to be pretty good from what I've seen. Lots of good action and the story looks good. Can't say much obviously but I'm giving it a shot for sure.
Sugar Rush Christmas,This show is blacker than Wesley Snipes' asshole. I love it! 
Sugar Rush Christmas,Well that was erection inducing. 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Eh, it doesnt look like any of the depth shown in jessica jones or daredevils first trailer..."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Old Dirty saved that promo 
Sugar Rush Christmas,That song selection 
Sugar Rush Christmas," Luke Cage!

Been waiting for this! :D"
Sugar Rush Christmas,Fuckin-A-Right hero for hire!
Sugar Rush Christmas,I'm surprised they didn't cast Freddie Prinze Jr. 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Do we know who the villain will be yet?

Do I even want to know? Oh God. I don't know if I do."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Sweet Christmas
Sugar Rush Christmas,Fuck yes that looked awesome as fuck.
Sugar Rush Christmas,Are they doing this in place of Jessica Jones Season 2?
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I really liked this trailer, good to see Luke Cage getting his chance to shine"
Sugar Rush Christmas,netflix is killin it
Sugar Rush Christmas,My body is ready
Sugar Rush Christmas,"You know it's a Marvel Netflix show when a Car door is used to beat people, a fight in the hallway, and it's night time for the majority of the show."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I really need to add more wu-tang songs to my Playlist, I enjoy quite a few songs from 10+ years ago. 

And this show looks badass. "
Sugar Rush Christmas,"What about his partner? 
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/Immortalironfist.jpg"
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Of all the teasers, this is the one that's got me hyped the most.  BRING IT ON POWER MAN!"
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I don't really care for Daredevil, but I can definitely get behind some Luke Cage"
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Yessssssssss, I've been super excited for this since I saw it listed on IMDB!"
Sugar Rush Christmas,Are they going to evolve him into Power Man? In the comics he is Luke Cage: Hero for Hire...then turns into Power Man.  The comic books were failures..so i am curious as to how they will make the shows a success. 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"*What's playing at the movie theatre?*

Super heroes

*What's playing on cable?*

Super heroes

*What's on Netflix?*

Super heroes

**Talk about a flooded market.**"
Sugar Rush Christmas,I was sold the second I heard Ol' Dirty. 
Sugar Rush Christmas,I want to know how he got such a great bourbon selection at his bar. Stuff was legit in Jessica Jones.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Wot, No Tiara?

Insider Joke the Production Title is ""Tiara"""
Sugar Rush Christmas,Well that was fun to watch. Looking forward to the show. Marvel Netflix has been really good.
Sugar Rush Christmas,ODB? I thought Luke Cage was more of a [Run the Jewels](http://imgur.com/a/jSBdm) guy.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Yep, I'm in.  This is gonna be good."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Oh shit.  Fucking hype!  Looks damn good 
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Antithesis of a daredevil fight.. no stakes, tension or struggle. Still, it *looks good* and was well shot, but maybe lose the hallways for your highlight trailer."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I know hes Luke Cage: Hero For Hire, But Luke Cage: Harlems Hero sounds pretty nice."
Sugar Rush Christmas,"My only issue with Luke Cage is that he's superman lite.  He virtually can't be hurt.  Whatever happened to him in Jessica Jones that knocked him out for a day was stupid, he made a full recovery.  "
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Ah man, this is fucking *awesome*.  The ODB was the icing on the cake too.  I'm stoked!

Netflix is doing it right.  Why do some people feel the need to turn already established characters into people of color, or non-cis/whatever (like Iron Man being turned into a little black girl) when we already have awesome black super heroes like this?  Just promote the ones you already have, or make new awesome ones."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Just give me punisher
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Sweet Christmas! A bullet proof black guy, every cop nightmare scenario. "
Sugar Rush Christmas,His hallway scene is not impressive as Daredevil's.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Why would he take a car door and use it as a shield if billets don't do shit to him?


Why would be not just storm in instead of using that car door to break down another door? Also the dude in the cage... Why did he not just run? He just stood there and accepted a beating.


Also how are we supposed to worry about the protagonist and his struggles if he can't die? Seems weird 


Comic book shit is just corny as fuck now "
Sugar Rush Christmas,I'm liking the Duke Nukem logo.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"looks really dumb.. just like Jessica Jones :/

at least we still got Daredevil"
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I just cn not stand the way hes not affected by physics. He should at least look like he got a little pushback from a bullet, right? Okay unbreakable skin, sure but that bullet has alotta speed hitting you in very concentrated form."
Sugar Rush Christmas,Really clunky editing in that scene.
Sugar Rush Christmas,"I thought it was...Im sick of powers that are done without CGI.  It seems lazy to have a show with powers as complex as the cameras shaking and people falling over when the enterprise bridge was attacked on TNG. With shows like GOT on the air, I want more than breaking fake walls and people pulled around on cables. Do War Machine, hes black AND interesting. Do Bishop or Storm, so much material there. It strikes me as a huge coincidence that Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage are all without powers needing CGI. Theyre cushioning their budgets and its lazy. Yawn. "
Sugar Rush Christmas,"but Flash from DC has non boring powers. I watched lower budget tv like Buffy and the effects are hokey and its still awesome. My bf works in visual effects and I know from him that energy waves are cheap while articulating dragons are expensive. Flash is not high budget. Marvel - Theyre bringing up obscure characters with lame powers to make cheap shows with social justice characters. I get the SJ thing, but geez mind control was the big thing in Jessica Jones and thats mostly just extras acting in the background. "
Sugar Rush Christmas,His powers are boring. I get they want a black superhero but surely theres one thats more interesting. super strength and unbreakable skin...yawn
Sugar Rush Christmas,I thought he was only going to beat white people
Sugar Rush Christmas,"Having seen s1 of Jessica Jones and both seasons of Daredevil so far, this looks like it could be the first DC live action tv show that I like.

Daredevil just made me hate him more and more as the show went on.

As much as I like David Tennant (He's AMAZING in Broadchurch), his powers were ridiculously OP, and he's not right for a super strength hero.  You want some sort of fantastic battle between the two to the death.  But, he's just a pussy.

I don't think I even need any examples of Arrow and Smallville to convey how lousy they both are.

I just have no time for anything on the CW.  They cater mainly to teenage girls, and that type of show isn't for me."
Sugar Rush Christmas,The Wu-Tang song made it so much cooler 
The Movies That Made Us,"Watched the gump one last night and thought it was pretty good. I heard the book is awful but i never knew how much turmoil they went through to get the movie made

Looking forward to checking the rest out"
The Movies That Made Us,I hate the Wacky Voiceover.
The Movies That Made Us,"Watched the Jurassic Park one Saturday.  Watched Jurassic Park again Sunday. 

That is a great Netflix series."
The Movies That Made Us,Just started watching Back to the Future one and it’s so unwatchable with all the never ending cut scenes and the narrator jumping in with corny jokes all the time in between. Such a shame cause BTF is one of my favourite movies ever!
The Movies That Made Us,"I like the toys and the video game versions, but the movies that made us seems pointless. Why would I want to watch a Forrest Gump documentary that couldn’t talk to the star of the damn movie? The Die Hard one couldn’t get Bruce Willis and Netflix over the last few years has proven that Bruce Willis will show up for any bullshit as long as you pay him enough and don’t make him to go a second set."
The Movies That Made Us,I love this style of editing/voiceover.
The Movies That Made Us,ITS FINALLY BACK!  OMG!  BTTF and JP?  :O  Im gonna binge the living fuck out of this tonight.
The Movies That Made Us,"I don't think the book is awful, but it is a very different tone. Kind of like the Roger Rabbit book. In the book Roger is a comic character, so speaks in word balloons. Both movies take the core concepts of the books, but go in different directions."
The Movies That Made Us,"Book is trash, there's not one but TWO scenes about how big his penis is lol"
The Movies That Made Us,[deleted]
The Movies That Made Us,They've changed the voice over guy to Danny Wallace but it still has the same tone.
The Movies That Made Us,"Is it a Forrest Gump documentary, though?  And what do the *actors* add even if it was?"
The Movies That Made Us,"I would like to point out that some people are interested in hearing from the directors, writers, artists, and producers of movies and not just the stars. To them, the show is not pointless."
The Movies That Made Us,Probably because those guys want a million for an interview and thats prob the entire budget for the show.
The Movies That Made Us,I love the toys one too. Yeah the movie ones aren't a  deep dive into these movies but I thought they were informative. They take more of a how it came to be than just having an actor talk about acting.
The Movies That Made Us,I think it ruins the program.
The Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, the book was certainly different. I seem to recall he ends up going into space, crash lands and has to survive up against cannibals or something."
The Movies That Made Us,The cuts are so fast with repeated one liners from the movies I can’t tell if a genuine interview took place or they’re creating a narrative
The Movies That Made Us,"The episode about Forrest Gump is. And clearly the actor’s perspective is an important part when talking about the making and the cultural impact of a movie.  Even if you don’t agree the people who make the show agree, or else why would they get the biggest actors they *can* afford?"
The Movies That Made Us,"Correct. This is a series about filmmaking, so better to get the viewpoint of the crew"
The Movies That Made Us,And don't forget the orangutan who speaks sign language.
The Movies That Made Us,This is Forrest Gump?
The Movies That Made Us,Yep. He also becomes a chess player and a wrestler at different points.
The Movies That Made Us,"Probably around when tv shows (mostly streaming and HBO) started to have budgets big enough to afford those actors.

You’ll notice the old system like what you’re talking about (distinction of tv and film actors) is still pretty distinct in network tv, where the only exception I can think of is Viola Davis doing How to Get Away With Murder."
The Movies That Made Us,Glenn Close in The Shield was one of the first I noticed
The Movies That Made Us,The West Wing helped - Sheen and Lowe.
The Movies That Made Us,"George Clooney stayed on er for a few years, even after he was Batman."
The Movies That Made Us,24?
The Movies That Made Us,"1st season of True Detective. Don't know exactly why, but it felt like there was a shift after this where tv shows became more prestigious for movie actors."
The Movies That Made Us,The advent of streaming services has blurred if not outright obliterated that line.
The Movies That Made Us,"I wouldn’t say there’s one clear answer but tv as a whole got taken a lot more serious in the mid-late 00s. With stuff like mad men and breaking bad, it became more appealing to do tv for high quality performances. But going back earlier id say west wing and sopranos are two that paved the way for how tv evolved. But shows like mad men and breaking bad didn’t have movie stars leading the way. Bryan Cranston was a tv guy at the time and has now become a versatile character actor across film, tv and theatre.

Alec Baldwin doing 30 rock gave it a lot of gravitas and he was one of the first to do tv and still be considered a big star in the modern era. 

People like Kate winslet often did miniseries around 2010/11 era and would usually get high acclaim and Emmy’s which would’ve made it more appealing to others.

Maggie smith in Downton abbey would’ve been a big one. Jeff Daniels in the newsroom. Matthew McConaughey in true detectives.

Veep as well, even though Julia Louis Dreyfus is more successful on tv, the quality of performance she was giving on tv would make big film stars realise that tv could be creatively fulfilling too.

I think ultimately streaming really played a big part. It offered immense creative control, shorter seasons and lots of money. House of cards was an early streamer and it had the movie star prestige from stars and fincher behind the scenes"
The Movies That Made Us,"1979's *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy*, arguably. Sir Alec Guiness (and we don't hand out knighthoods to that many actors, usually one or two an honours list), who was financially secure off his percentage of the huge gross of *Star Wars*, does a miniseries adapting a spy novel and wins a BAFTA. Then he does *Smiley's People* in 1982 and wins another one."
The Movies That Made Us,I think 24 was one of the firsts that I remember.  Kiefer Sutherland was a pretty big movie star in the 90s
The Movies That Made Us,"Movie actors have been transitioning to tv for decades.

Barbara Stanwyck moved to tv in 1965 with the western show The Big Valley

Burt Reynolds who went from TV (Gunsmoke) to movies and back to TV with the show Evening Shade in the 90s.

Martin Sheen went to tv in 1999 with The West Wing.

Alec Baldwin went to tv with 30 Rock.

Michael J Fox also went from TV to movies and back to TV with Spin City

One of the earliest being Lucille Ball. She started off in movies and then did a string of tv shows starting with I Love Lucy.

Michael Keaton currently has the show Dopesick.

Angela Lansbury with Murder, She Wrote in the 80s and 90s"
The Movies That Made Us,You could argue that the Sopranos paved the way with it's hour long almost cinematic style episodes heralding serious TV closely followed by trailblazing programs like the Shield and West Wing in the US. They paved the way for House of Cards and then Game of thrones amongst many.
The Movies That Made Us,"It was a combination of many factors, like the quality and prestige of television shows going up and fewer opportunities to do mature storytelling that doesn’t involve wearing a superhero costume in film. Breaking Bad didn’t have any movie stars, but the success of Breaking Bad made a lot of people aware of what kind of stories could be done on television and they could look first rate.

The money dynamics also changed. TV checks began to go up for stars as movie checks were beginning to go down for people who weren’t gigantic names."
The Movies That Made Us, Now it’s commonplace used to usually signal a dying career for an actor
The Movies That Made Us,"Kiefer Sutherland on 24 is the actual answer. It started for him out of necessity, but boy did it inspire others to do the same"
The Movies That Made Us,"The correct answer is House of Cards. Kevin Spacey was one of the greatest actors of his generation (no matter what his personal morals are) and a multi acting Oscar winner.

If *he* could work on TV then everyone could. At least that’s how it felt at the time."
The Movies That Made Us,HBO True Detective for sure helped in this narrative
The Movies That Made Us,"The business changed behind the scenes. You didn’t have “TV actors” and “movie actors.” You had studio talent stables. Actors in movies had multi picture deals and first look opportunities that were constantly spinning plates. Actors in the television circuit worked an annualized industry that had very specific periods where everyone did the same thing (ie: pilot season). You were in the production flow of one or the other and there wasn’t much crossover from a professional situation. Different people in charge of TV and movies, different groups to get “in” with. And movie actors approached their craft aiming to make 2 perfect hours over months with take after take, not 24 “best you can do in a week” stories getting good at moving quickly. Different skills and working preferences. Also, movies mean temporary work and a tv show is a steady gig.

Then streaming happened, and the annualized TV model broke apart. Netflix spent big to contract movie stars to TV shows to bring the box office draw to their service, and it worked. Kevin Spacey (pervert) was the biggest named star and success with House of Cards, but it was relays happening behind the scenes. Suddenly Netflix could offer both worlds: the chance to craft your perfect hours, without the annualized scheduling. And the same people at the top whether it’s a movie or a tv show. Granted, lots of other headaches, but they removed the business barriers that kept people in tv/movie silos.

It wasnt any one actor that changed things. The business shifted and this was an inevitability."
The Movies That Made Us,"Robert Mitchum, a huge Hollywood star, did Winds of War in 1983. From what I've read, he admitted it was just for the paycheck."
The Movies That Made Us,"To me the explosion of it started with House of Cards.

Of course there have always been downgraded stars from Movie to tv or a tv star becoming a movie star from the beginning, but streaming, production deals with the stars, higher quality, and fewer episode make it appealing for stars.

I think Friends started the notion that movie stars and tv can go hand in hand with their frequent guest stars. I temper Julia Roberts was in an arc with her then boyfriend Benjamin Bratt on Law and Order."
The Movies That Made Us,True Detective. Was probably the biggest catalyst to Matthew McConaughey’s Oscar win.
The Movies That Made Us,"Jimmy Stewart had a sitcom for a year, c. 1970. Shirley MacLaine likewise. Henry Fonda likewise, except it was more of a dramedy. Anthony Quinn, too, except it was an hour drama. Donna Reed was a movie star, went on to a sitcom for almost a decade. Likewise Miss Barbara Stanwyck, except it was a Western. Doris Day and Rock Hudson were the biggest box office stars in America, she did about five years on a sitcom, and he on a detective show. James Garner became a TV detective, too. Bing Crosby had a sitcom. Robert Wagner was a minor movie star before becoming a TV spy - Fred Astaire recurred as his father."
The Movies That Made Us,"I think there has (almost) always been crossover; I recall Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, Bette Davis, and Katherine Hepburn doing TV in the 60s/70s."
The Movies That Made Us,"While it doesn't necessarily involve big actors dropping down from film careers to TV (though there's plenty of names appearing in the show), I'd say Sopranos was one of the first to show ""Hollywood"" actors that TV was becoming the place to go for a good role."
The Movies That Made Us,"Michael J Fox was in Family Ties, but he might've been the exception back then.


I would say that one of the big ones might've been Clooney staying on ER after going into movies."
The Movies That Made Us,"The recent trend was definitely started by Big Little Lies. Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman being co-leads in a show was huge, while also being surrounded by other actors mostly known for film. Afrer it being both incredibly successful critically and commercially is when we really started seeing more and more movie stars try to get their own TV project. Even Meryl Streep joined this particular show for its second season. In the years after we suddenly got people like Amy Adams and Cate Blanchett also leading their own limited series."
The Movies That Made Us,"I feel like it was more that the movie going industry is slowly dying combined with the explosion of the streaming age and the hunt for content is what led to more ""movie stars"" in TV shows. There was just more demand and money in TV. Will be interesting to see what happens since it's looking like the TV streaming bubble is bursting a bit."
The Movies That Made Us,"Everything the others have said, plus the quality of the picture and sound in TV sets has made a difference. That and soaring theater prices. Throw in Covid and movies were almost DOA. More TV channels to compete for an audience leads to improvement in product."
The Movies That Made Us,"It was less about any specific show and more about the rise of cable television shows, which were shorter and thus less of a time commitment for actors who worked mostly in film.

In the 00s it was mostly actors who weren't big stars, in the 10s the move to bigger stars happened, I think the most crucial one was probably True Detective since it was so successful.

It should be said that HBO, who made True Detective, already made ""prestige"" miniseries with big actors, so the jump from that to ""limited series"" (which is what True Detective was initially pitched as) wasn't so big."
The Movies That Made Us,"Cate Blanchett did Mrs. America and her performance went a bit unnoticed because the show didn't get a lot of traction. She had done TV before but all in Australia. 

She'll be doing another series streaming on Apple TV later this year.

And Nicole Kidman doing BLL... she continued to do several more limited series."
The Movies That Made Us,The Shield had Glenn Close and Forest Whitaker
The Movies That Made Us,10 episode seasons.  Then they could still do films.
The Movies That Made Us,Michael B Jordan minor character in The Wire
The Movies That Made Us,I think the popularity of shorter seasons or miniseries have definitely gotten movie stars to join tv. Alot of well-written shows that don't require you signing years long contracts.
The Movies That Made Us,[deleted]
The Movies That Made Us,Good call. Forest Whitaker surprised me as well. What a tremendous show.
The Movies That Made Us,And in Damages
The Movies That Made Us,"This is it, it was a really big deal at the time and actually changed the industry."
The Movies That Made Us,"100%

Between The Shield and the Sopranos, movie actors began doing TV. Glenn Close, Forest Whitaker, Steve Buscemi, Joe Pantoliano, etc."
The Movies That Made Us,her character was so good
The Movies That Made Us,Rob Lowe was doing west wing for a bit of a comeback wasn’t he? He wasn’t as big in the 90s after his scandal
The Movies That Made Us,this is probably the most correct answer.
The Movies That Made Us,"He was contractually bound to the show, but he certainly isn’t a good answer to the prompt since he was mostly a nobody when ER began."
The Movies That Made Us,"This can’t possibly be true


Edit: you’re right. That’s insane."
The Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, it kind of went '89 Quantum Leap,  '90 Dream On, '93 NYPD Blue, '94 ER, '99 Sopranos & West Wing, '01 24, '02 The Wire, everything everywhere.

The commercial tv vs cable premium was kind of a thing, but serialized tv that showed big budget television could be profitable kept pushing the budget higher with breakthrough shows. 

24 was one of the first serialized commercial tv shows with a movie actor lead that seemed like every episode could have been in a movie theater, and the buzz around it was massive."
The Movies That Made Us,"That same year you had Billy Bob Thornton doing *Fargo*, and we were fresh off of Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright doing the first season of *House of Cards* and Netflix pulling Kyle Chandler back to TV for *Bloodline*."
The Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, I definitely think True Detective sort of paved the way for this shift. This obviously wasn't the first time it happened, but I do feel like it was when TV shows became more appealing for movie actors."
The Movies That Made Us,"It certainly wasn't the first, but I do agree that it felt like a turning point that led to the floodgates opening."
The Movies That Made Us,the change OP is referring to happened before streaming reshaped the landscape
The Movies That Made Us,That did not impact Hollywood though
The Movies That Made Us,"I think the difference was the career arcs for actors transitioning basically boiled down to:

 - Up and coming actors made a name on TV, then moved to the movies.

 - Actors with fading or stalling film careers transition to TV 

We didn't usually see things like Matthew McConaughey doing *Dallas Buyers Club*, moving to TV for *True Detective*, and coming out with *Intersteller* the same year. Or Dwayne Johnson doing Fast and Furious movies, then multiple seasons of *Ballers* while still headlining action-comedy movies."
The Movies That Made Us,"I call stuff like *Game of Thrones* ""cinematic television"" - shows with the budget and scope of movies."
The Movies That Made Us,And it turned out to be one his most celebrated roles.
The Movies That Made Us,"I agree too. Before everything broke about him being a pedophile, Spacey was like A+ list level. He was at the top of the game really. Then he starred in a TV series that was exclusively online & that really caused big names to reconsider TV shows."
The Movies That Made Us,"Your answer is the closest to being correct on here.

It was actually in the 1950s.  

There was originally a lot of hesitation and scorn of the TV medium by the Hollywood stars.  But they gradually warmed up to it and then a flood of big movie stars crossed over to TV in the 50s and 60s."
The Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, it was right around 24 and The Sopranos that the budget, scope, and prestige started to really shift in a noticeable way"
The Movies That Made Us,"He didn’t stay on ER, he left as soon as he could. If he could have gotten out of his contract after the second season, he would have."
The Movies That Made Us,Three years before that *True Detective* had mid-McConaunaissance Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson a decade removed from his last TV appearance in the middle of the Hunger Games series and *Fargo* had Billy Bob Thornton in lead. That was the year I felt like TV started shifting from the 30 Rock joke that Alec Baldwin makes about actors doing TV and never going back to A-list again.
The Movies That Made Us,"He wasn't a movie star, he was like 14 and it was one of his first roles. 

Great performance and character though, it's easy to see why he was able to find success."
The Movies That Made Us,"Eh, I’d consider Samberg a tv actor that does the occasional movie between seasons, which is kind of the classic tv actor career."
The Movies That Made Us,"He was, and considering he's pretty much only done TV and TV Movies since he falls under the regular historic transition of ""stalled and fading movie actors move to TV"""
The Movies That Made Us,Excuse me he was a handy man on facts of life.
The Movies That Made Us,True Detective and House of Cards were definitely the first two shows I thought of.
The Movies That Made Us,"Considering that a lot of Hollywood is made of Brits and actors talk to each other, it arguably had some impact."
The Movies That Made Us,"FYI, films and TV are made outside of Hollywood."
The Movies That Made Us,"Yeah, this is the sea change. TV is seen as an equally viable medium to the movies, not just the space for rookies and has-beens."
The Movies That Made Us,"> shows with the budget and scope of movies.

That's somewhat insulting to those shows IMO, the scope is much bigger.  
It's the reason why I prefer shows over movies, a movie could never tell a story of that scope."
The Movies That Made Us,"I'm not saying there weren't instances of it happening before, but both those shows in 2014 didn't start a trend that then followed with years of many high-profile film actors doing TV. Ryan Murphy was one of the only few consistently getting them in his projects, and HBO had the occasional series starring one or two. It didn't happen much that they crossed over other places. Even when Fargo and True Detective were onto their second seasons, looking back their only competition in terms of movie stars was still... Ryan Murphy (ACS/AHS) and HBO themselves (Show Me A Hero). Outside of that you had limited series like American Crime, Roots, Flesh & Bone, War and Peace, The Missing, Texas Rising, Wolf Hall, a 24 mini-series.... hardly a crop full of movie stars. Even against Big Little Lies and the year after the most shows were still things like The Looming Tower, Godless, Howards End, Patrick Melrose, American Vandal, Gilmore Girls. Not that many movie stars leading anything in sight. True Detective and Fargo were among shows that helped to destimigatize, but it is not when every movie star decided to get their own TV project.

Fast forward two/three years and we're getting George Clooney making the jump back to TV and also Cate Blanchett on Hulu, Emma Stone, Renée Zellweger and Octavia Spencer on Netflix, Michelle Williams on FX, Benicio del Toro and Russell Crowe on Showtime, Chris Evans on Apple... Al Pacino on Amazon? This was the moment where not just HBO and Ryan Murphy were getting movie stars. Now suddenly they started popping up everywhere. Constantly. And this is all besides HBO and Ryan Murphy continuing to do their thing. And it has only intensified ever since. Big Little Lies was hardly the first show to ever do it, but that show and *especially* Meryl fucking Streep jumping on the bandwagon with a second season was easily a turning point for the industry. It's about the show that started the trend. The one that made it look even more feasible for movie stars to make the jump. It wasn't the only show to contribute to it, but it's **the** one to point at if you really want to narrow it down to where a switch happened."
The Movies That Made Us,[deleted]
The Movies That Made Us,Boss on Roseanne too
The Movies That Made Us,"Same here. All 4 are pretty big hitters, Spacey and McConaughey being most notable. Hell, McConaughey won an Oscar the same year True Detective came out. 

House or Cards was the big one though IMO. Kevin Spacey was basically A+ list if you ask me; before the scandal & all that, he was probably my favorite actor. His inclusion to House of Cards immediately legitimized Netflix as a heavy hitter for prestige TV, but also really got the ball rolling for movie stars to join TV series."
The Movies That Made Us,I absolutely think it would have had an impact. If you have an actor of Guiness' stature on TV it would have definitely been noticed in Hollywood.
The Movies That Made Us,"The shift really starts in the mid to late 1990s with Glenn Close doing The Shield.

Before that point when a TV star had a movie that did well they stopped doing TV eg Bruce Willis"
The Movies That Made Us,What impact did it have? How did Alec Guinness influence in the US with his decision?
The Movies That Made Us,Yes but the division between TV and movies was a US thing and it persisted for decades after Guinness.
The Movies That Made Us,"I feel like **the** show to point to would be *House of Cards* with Fincher behind the scenes and Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright carrying things - True Detective and Fargo were signs it wouldn't just be a streaming service throwing money at those sorts of things. After 2014 HBO tapped Dwayne Johnson (in the midst of high level movie success) for multiple seasons of *Ballers* starting in 2015, then in 2016 Winona Rider started in *Stranger Things* and Ed Harris joined *Westworld*. Big Little Lies was continuing an ongoing trend."
The Movies That Made Us,"There’s a difference between being in movies and being a film actor in this concept. It’s more so about where the body of their work and what they’re known for. 

Nicole Kidman is a film actor that does tv

Reese Witherspoon is a film actor that does tv

Tom Cruise is a film actor (doesn’t do tv)

Nathan Fillion is a tv actor that does movies

Ellen Pompeo is a tv actor (doesn’t do movies)

Jennifer Aniston is a tv actor that does movies

In regards to Samberg, he’s mostly known for tv (B99 and SNL). He’s not a movie star to the point where he’s plastered across all the advertisements and is a major box office draw.

I mean, it’s kind of a pedantic concept, but I hope you get what I mean."
Merry Happy Whatever,Joy and Todd are the best couple in this thing and they're not even dating.
Merry Happy Whatever,Why does this have a laugh track? Like. What?
Merry Happy Whatever,Joy and Todd are by far the best characters in this
Merry Happy Whatever,"Whenever I catch reruns of older shows the laugh track doesn't bother me quite as much, but any show that gets made with it nowadays I have to skip."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Has an Undateable vibe to it, obviously because of Bridgit Mendler and Brent Morin, but also because it’s a fun, dumb sitcom that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Really enjoying it."
Merry Happy Whatever,I wish I had more hands so I could give this awful show 4 thumbs down.
Merry Happy Whatever,"To Netflix: Get rid of the laugh tracks!!!! 

This show could have been good with a bit of different writing (because some of it was good) but it was absolutely ruined by the laugh tracks."
Merry Happy Whatever,"I can’t stand Emmy or Don. I can’t even begin to understand who thought that in 2019 it would be a great idea to do a sitcom with laugh tracks about an awful, controlling and stuck up father-in-law. 

And Emmy, why is she with Matt? She seems to hate everything about who he is and thinks he has no future.

I was gonna say Matt should run away from all of them. But tbh the rest of the family was kind of sweet and funny. If there is a season 2 I would love to see Emmy was run over by a bus and Don having a heart attack :) and then the show can actually be funny."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Put this on while working from home to get into the Christmas spirit (got 2 pieces of bad news this week so feeling down). I actually chuckled a few times. I didn’t hate it, good for having in the background I think or if you’re sick and just wanna relax and watch something easy."
Merry Happy Whatever,"I started to watch it to make fun of it, but then I kinda enjoyed the episodes I saw.  Still am imagining Dennis Quaid as his character in that racist murdering dude in that movie that came out earlier this year."
Merry Happy Whatever,Didn’t hate it.
Merry Happy Whatever,I honestly really liked it. it was corny but cute & it had its funny moments but the way dennis quiad talked really killed it for me. kind of looks like he was on something the whole time. does anyone know why?
Merry Happy Whatever,Its the same couple from undateable
Merry Happy Whatever,"Very cute traditional wholesome family  sitcom vibe with nice modern twists (the group chats, the gay daughter, a daughter moving to LA and getting together with a musician, etc). Enjoyable & easy to watch, but not AMAZING. I’d recommend it!"
Merry Happy Whatever,I think people who have been coddled and sheltered their entire life would really enjoy this show. I would recommend to them because they are the only people that might understand the watered down cheesy humor.
Merry Happy Whatever,I really liked it
Merry Happy Whatever,Really corny. Occasionally atrocious writing. I enjoyed it! Perfect show to watch with my girlfriend and her family around the holidays.
Merry Happy Whatever,"Is that a laugh track in the trailer?  On Netflix?  Jesus, what have they done."
Merry Happy Whatever,"As much as I love Brent Morin's standup, I'm maybe 10 minutes in and I'm changing it.

&#x200B;

edit: I was 3:34 in."
Merry Happy Whatever,[deleted]
Merry Happy Whatever,I was hate watching this show at first in the background while doing chores but by the last episodes I was genuinely enjoying it. Emmy was a flat character but everyone else grew on me. Dennis Quaid’s skin looks painful.
Merry Happy Whatever,Watched the first episode to use it as a time filler as it was only 30 minutes. Mentally checked out after 10 minutes. Won’t watch the rest of the season. Everything seems really forced and awkward. There was no real flow between the characters and the comedic timing was worse than the writing. I love some Dennis Quaid but this was bad. A lot is being mentioned about his skin and face which is understandable. I also struggle with his voice throwing me off too. The only way I can describe Its like a poor version of John Wayne.
Merry Happy Whatever,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/MerryHappyWhateverTV/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MerryHappyWhateverTV/) 

Come join the subreddit for the show!!!"
Merry Happy Whatever,"Maybe if you've watched every other sitcom on the planet - then MAYBE this show would be worth your time.  You literally need to be out of options for this to be worth putting on.  Is it horrible? Borderline.  Does it have its moments? Yes.  Are those moments enough? No.  The laugh track, the filming, the stage, the acting, the corny family interactions.  This feels like it was produced for an audience in the 50s.  Everything about it is....ugh."
Merry Happy Whatever,"I really relate to Allen, this family is full of snarky, nit picky assholes and I want out."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Is bullying still considered funny? Cause that's what I felt they re doing to Matt. I like dark, offensive humor. But this was jus lame show. And laughing track. And no chemistry. It doesn't hold attention."
Merry Happy Whatever,"A lot Christmas shows airing now, and I am neutral on this one. Here’s a quick review of Merry Happy Whatever! https://youtu.be/zKWqhEYs8jc"
Merry Happy Whatever,This should would be OK if it weren't for Matt. Why is he so awkward? Even just looking at him throws me off.
Merry Happy Whatever,Lol I thought the same thing watching. My favorite dynamic
Merry Happy Whatever,Head canon its a sequel to Undateable
Merry Happy Whatever,"I'm surprised he would do something like this; he's still very telegenic and is starring or supporting in theatrical releases, seems like a lot of charisma and intensity that is just weirdly misapplied."
Merry Happy Whatever,"I didn't notice with the girl because I still miss the Briga Heelan Bianca Kajlich smokeshow, but yeah.

I'm too old to know Ashley Tisdale but she looks like a girl robot from a late '80s teen film.

This show feels a like a trip to Kohls on your day off."
Merry Happy Whatever,It's a sitcom.
Merry Happy Whatever,I think I lasted about as long
Merry Happy Whatever,"That is exactly what I thought. The main dad character is basically the dad from Last Man Standing. Even the storylines are similar, like the dad doesn't like the guy her daughter is dating."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Just finished it,, and that’s exactly how I feel about it."
Merry Happy Whatever,This is what I'm going with in my head too!
Merry Happy Whatever,I assumed you’ve watched Great News with Briga? It’s actually pretty funny!
Merry Happy Whatever,"Several popular network sitcoms don't use laugh tracks. I find the Goldberg's, Modern Family, Black-ish, and Mixed-ish very entertaining and funny without laugh tracks. Netflix should quit using them... Unless their writers aren't up to the challenge. We don't need to be told when to laugh unless the joke isnt funny. #dadjokes"
Merry Happy Whatever,[deleted]
Merry Happy Whatever,"I really don’t want to shit on it but we’ve seen the “angry dad hates boyfriend/fiancé/etc trope a billion times, and shoving a Star Wars joke in the first minute was way too forced for me. 

Again, love me some
Morin and Quiad, but not in this setting sadly :/"
Merry Happy Whatever,"Yes, watched that and first saw her on Ground Floor with Rory Scovel and John McGinley, where I believe she met her husband. I believe the lead on that show married Anna Camp, who guest starred a couple of times."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Great News is so funny and had great potential. A very similar humor to 30 Rock, with jokes on top of jokes. I’m so mad it only got two seasons"
Merry Happy Whatever,Those are single camera shows.
Merry Happy Whatever,"Multicam shows use them because they're written as filmed theatre, not as film. There's a completely different sense of rhythm and of style to writing a stage comedy versus a screen comedy. Even great stage-based material, if delivered as written without a laugh track, would be brittle and awkward because it relies on the give and take of audience dynamics."
Merry Happy Whatever,Multicam sitcoms tend to have them.
Merry Happy Whatever,Good.  Was trying to find some Bridgit Mendler content. 
Merry Happy Whatever,"Bridgit Mendler and Ashley Tisdale?! 

Gonna have to watch! "
Merry Happy Whatever,This is a straight up undateable reunion so leads should have good chemistry
Merry Happy Whatever,Brent Morin is hilarious.  Hope this is a good show 
Merry Happy Whatever,I’m so hyped. Hope this’ll be successful.
Merry Happy Whatever,"I really liked ""Undateable"". It wasn't anything special, but the cast had good chemistry, I give it credit for making Detroit look young and sexy and it had a really feel good vibe to it. I wish NBC just kept it around as a filler show destined for late night syndication like ""Rules of Engagement"". I would of liked to watch it in rerurns."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Bridgit got cast because of her chemistry with Brent in Undateable.
>Mendler and Morin’s background of portraying a couple on NBC’s multi-camera comedy series Undateable played a role in their casting as a couple on Merry Happy Whatever. It was a scene of the two of them from the NBC sitcom submitted by Morin that led to the Netflix series producers also reaching out to Mendler, who had been working on a graduate degree from MIT and was not pursuing acting work at the moment."
Merry Happy Whatever,The cast is absolutely what made it. Especially when you could really tell they were ad libbing. I really wish they'd release undateable on DVD. 
Merry Happy Whatever,Ron funches was a fucking delight.  I’m a Bianca fan from rules of engagement and ofc leads were great at improv.
Merry Happy Whatever,I also would buy a DVD it was a fun show. It used to be on the NBC website but I looked yesterday after reading this thread and it's gone. 
Merry Happy Whatever,"You can buy digital episodes for season 1 and most of 3, but nothing for 2. I'd love to have all episodes. Even the east and west coast versions of the live ones. "
Merry Happy Whatever,I guess it's better than no episodes. Is this Amazon or Itunes?  
Merry Happy Whatever,Looks like Google play and YouTube.
Merry Happy Whatever,"In 2015, Netflix was more like HBO than NBC. They used to take time and only release shows that passed whatever quality checks they had. Now it seems they pretty much buy any  show they can get their hands on, and hope something sticks"
Merry Happy Whatever,Where’s “You” ? It’s one of their biggest hits.
Merry Happy Whatever,Still can't believe they cancelled Tuca & Bertie & Sense8
Merry Happy Whatever,"I remember when I started watching OITNB, the fucking sensation it was, even in my very-conservative country. It had the raunchiest sex scenes that somehow surpassed GOT's, it was nominated for just about every award show in every category. Then the show itself started to fade in season 4 (which is coincidentally the same time Netflix started putting out hundreds of shows). 

Their prestige shows started losing the acclamation, and they began green-lighting a lot of bad projects. 

I'll forever be grateful that it housed Bojack Horseman, Dark, and a few others, but damn, what a fall."
Merry Happy Whatever,[deleted]
Merry Happy Whatever,"You left out dark, elite, la casa de papel, and other foreign shows that are extremely popular on netflix"
Merry Happy Whatever,Grace and Frankie is still the best Netflix original
Merry Happy Whatever,"Netflix shows have been on a downward trend for a long time. Even the 2015 list is mostly mediocre tv shows with low budgets, cheap sets and bad lighting. They gained buzz early on by making a small amount of high quality tv shows, but as they expanded the amount of shows they've been making, the quality has been dropping off. They dont care anymore as they have enough people to watch their mediocre shows. 

Even more shows like The Witcher, which I did really like, they messed up by rushing through the storylines and having poor writing. They could have been great, but as other services start to compete, they will start losing subscriptions. Netflix's strength is in the shows that they license."
Merry Happy Whatever,"Lot easier to have a lot more buzz when there were less shows in general. 

In 2019 they are competing with themselves, with other platforms. 

There's a new show every other week now, you can't maintain high buzz levels on everything. And not all shows are designed to get high buzz."
Merry Happy Whatever,"One word: fatigue.

Be it netflix, be it the viewer. Somewhere fatigue is showing up."
Merry Happy Whatever,[deleted]
Merry Happy Whatever,You was originally a Lifetime show
Merry Happy Whatever,What does being a conservative have to do with it?
Merry Happy Whatever,"Looking at his lists, his definition can’t be very accurate. Also, if something getting buzz doesn’t really say anything. I’m not sure why you would use that as a factor."
Merry Happy Whatever,[deleted]
Merry Happy Whatever,yeah wasn't sure what comparison to make for a network that has a lot of shows but some gems in the dust. Was thinking USA or AMC
Merry Happy Whatever,"Here in Brazil it means being against things that are feminist, LGBT, etc. We're mistaken as a sex-positive, progressive country because of carnival but we're really not."

It's not a happy story. He is *alleged* to have seduced (to use a very euphemistic term) several underaged boys, many of whom he gave film roles.  


Like Harvey Weinstein, it was one of those ""open secrets"" in Hollywood that nobody did anything about for a long time due to leverage and the unfortunate realities of the system."
Merry Happy Whatever,Any up-and-coming hot guy on a Ryan Murphy show.
Merry Happy Whatever,I’m not gonna say that Sheri Moon-Zombie had preferential treatment but she is married to the director
Merry Happy Whatever,"Movie instead of television, but they changed the entire race of the Waterbenders in Avatar: The Last Airbender just so Nicola Peltz could play Katara. Peltz is the daughter of a billionaire investment banker-type and likely he had a hand in funding the film.

And besides that, there was also the weird fact that the whole ""Romeo and Juliet law"" scene was put in that Transformers film that Nicola Peltz was in because the son of a producer had had the same situation happen to him."
Merry Happy Whatever,"RE: Tommen, tons and tons of actors have had small supporting roles in a show and then gotten a different lead role in the same show. It's not that unusual."

Merry Happy Whatever,"Can you name an actor the same age as Dean-Charles Chapman who *wasn't* a ""seemingly nobody actor"" in 2014 (other than the ones already playing major GoT roles)?"
Merry Happy Whatever,"The most obvious answer is Sofia Coppola in Godfather III, but rumor is that she filled in for Wynona Ryder. She was also a baby in one of the earlier Godfather films"
Merry Happy Whatever,The billionaires daughter in the 4th (?) Transformers
Merry Happy Whatever,Maria Sofia was a dubious choice.
Merry Happy Whatever,"OH! The perfect example of this just came to mind. I used to watch '7th Heaven' in reruns (hey, I crushed on Jessica Biel when I was younger, and it's an ok show). Early on in the series, the middle daughter Lucy has a boyfriend, and in a few eps he also brings along a friend. Cannot recall the actors name, but he was a chubby kid that Lucy even calls sexy at the end of one ep (Very cringe.)  Total dog shit child actor, and obvious doing a favor for someone.

The ""actor"" actually died a few years back from a drug over dose. He was nicknamed Gummy Bear and was the brother of that socialite douche who called Lindsay Lohan a fire-crotch.

Edit: Jason ""Gummy Bear"" Davis, brother of Brandon Davis and grandson of some oil dude named Marvin. Guy actually owned 20th Century Fox at some point, so he must have been close to Aaron Spelling."

Merry Happy Whatever,Vikings creator Michael Hirst casting his daughters and having nude scenes.
Merry Happy Whatever,"Not to answer your posted question, but rather the example...

GoT reused a lot of actors, and recast a lot of parts. It isn't unusual for actors to audition for one part and be given another. They recast that particular role because they needed a more mature actor, and he no doubt got the part because a) the character he had played was dead and b) he was already a known quantity. It saved them having to audition another actor."
Merry Happy Whatever,"James Corden, in anything. Who felt he’d be good in these things"
Merry Happy Whatever,"The kids on Mad Men were a real bore. Sally Draper was fine but they had absolutely no idea what to do with Bobby Draper. If I remember correctly, I think he was recast like 3 times. An infant, a toddler and finally a young kid with lines. It was a mess. Then there was Glenn who was played by the show creators son and has to be one of the worst kid/child actors I’ve ever seen. They kept him around the entire show but luckily he only showed up maybe once or twice a year"
Merry Happy Whatever,"Ron Howard put his brother in many movies.

Luc Besson is famous for having cast whomever he slept with in his movies (I'm surprised to this day he's been mostly spared by the metoo movement, because he's notoriously fucked up).

Levius,I hope other streaming services develop traditional anime instead of these pseudo anime from Netflix.
Levius,But with worse animation and a moody pop band protagonist. 
Levius,Megalo Box starring Yuri Plisetsky
Levius,"I am really hoping we start seeing anime on par with some of the animation used for the League of Legends World music videos.

[Rise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB8TyLTD7EE)"
Levius,I think CGI in anime has its place but rarely as a sole medium. More in a supporting role.
Levius,"I just googled Love, Death, and Robots. From looking at the studios listed on the Wikipedia, ít seem to be entirely Western studios. I am not sure if any of the studios involved are from Japan but I know Sun Creature Studio have a anime influence."
Levius,Yeah but that would take time and money to make. 
Levius,"A lot of them come from Polygon Pictures, which established a relationship with Netflix. A lot of their early work come from doing the animation for animated series for Star Wars, Tron, and Transformers. They used the money from that to produce their own anime series. You could say American appetite for cgi animated series led to this. The cgi animation was not really popular in Japan, so during their early days they had to look toward America for work."
Levius,that's just megalo box.
Levius,What is that? An ad for competitive league of legends or something?
Levius,"I believe they use it for the world tournament as the opening. There is one released each year with a different song and animation. This one was in the thread when this year's hit the front page of /r/videos.

This was this years which was on the front page.

Levius,"I just want a traditional anime, can we get a traditional anime without this CGI crap? I mean these plots look great on these new shows coming out but I just can't watch it without feeling like I'm watching the intro to Windwaker or something."
Levius,"So this *looks* like a rip-off of Megalo Box, but I went ahead and looked up the premise. 

It’s a *steampunk* boxing series. It takes place in the 19th-century, and their mechanical rigs are apparently powered by literally turning their blood into steam. 

So...a bit different."
Levius,Megalo Box the shitty version. No thanks.
Levius,Netflix has an exclusive deal with the production company behind the CGI anime iirc. You're not alone I'm so butthurt by Kengan ashura adaptation.
Levius,Every anime is made in CGI. What are you referring is 3D. There are good and bad 3D or 2D anime. Most anime will have three dimensional elements these days with digital 2D. Traditional anime is hand-drawn and not made in computers.
Legal High,"I think we have 3 genres now. Movies, broadcast TV and streaming. Movies are hit or miss. 
Broadcast TV is largely garbage. 
Streaming services have offered some great content. 

I just think it's important to not confuse Ozark for Big Bang Theory."
Legal High,"Fun fact: Every decade except the sixties has been called ""The golden age of television"".
Also fun fact: Golden ages are usually apparent thanks to hindsight.
So I tend to raise an eyebrow at every ""We're living in the golden age of TV"" statements.
Read [this 9 years old article](https://www.avclub.com/the-golden-age-of-tv-is-dead-long-live-the-golden-age-1798240704) for a more detailed argument."
Legal High,"You're not old enough to have witnessed the golden age of television, which arguably ended with NBC's must-see TV ended in the 90s.


What made it Golden?  It (mostly) came over the air and everyone had it whether you were rich or poor.  It was one of the things that brought us all together, a shared experience that doesn't exist anymore, except perhaps in some sporting events. When there was serious news, which _wasn't_ 24x7, networks all interrupted the regularly scheduled programming to bring it to you.  

At the same time, we actually demanded certain things from the companies that we allowed to use our airways in return for being allowed to use them.

If you don't believe me, ask a boomer ""who shot JR?"". Guaranteed they will know what you're talking about."
Legal High,"I think this current golden age is ending. 

We had the cable age with HBO, the original CNN, MTV, TLC and the History channel. All but HBO have lost their mission statements at this point and are saturated with ads, reality programming, and infomercials. 

We had the last broadcast resurgence around the time Lost came out. Now the broadcast networks are a wasteland, saturated with ads and cheap news and game show programming. NBC is talking about throwing in the towel at the 9 pm hour. 

We had the streaming age with great programming from Netflix and HBO. Those days seem to be over with Zazlev cutting corners and a glut of cheap reality trash flooding Netflix. Many services are adding ad-supported tiers like broadcast and cable. 

It will be interesting to see what the next wave is, and how long it takes to get here."
Legal High,Every era of television has been called the golden age since I've been alive lol.
Legal High,57 streaming services and so much on.
Legal High,Who gives a shit. TV is really good now. It’s been good awhile. “Golden age.” Not “Golden age.”  Who fucking cares.
Legal High,"every generation loves to call their own ""the best era of television"", it's a profoundly ignorant concept"
Legal High,"I wouldn't use the term the ""Golden Age of TV"" but I certainly enjoyed television more during the 80s and 90s than I do viewing content in the modern era."
Legal High,Big Bang Theory but Sheldon has someone killed every episode and is completing quantum formulas for the Mexican cartel.
Legal High,"By ""golden age"" I mean specifically ""It's better than it was, in many ways, than the 00s""

But otherwise, sure, I take your point."
Legal High,"That's a specific loaded definition of 'golden age' that doesn't really address the points I made in my OP. What if you didn't like the relatively limited dramatic content from the networks?

My point was based in content diversity (both in genre and origin) and general quality (hundreds of highly regard shows have emerged just in the last 5 years) not the amount of cultural phenomenons almost dictated to a captive audience of TV watchers."
Legal High,">We had the streaming age with great programming from Netflix and HBO. Those days seem to be over with Zazlev cutting corners and a glut of cheap reality trash flooding Netflix. Many services are adding ad-supported tiers like broadcast and cable.

Apple TV and Amazon remain poised though. And Disney still does what it does. It's not gone if HBO and Netflix shit the bed."
Legal High,Zazlev has not touched HBO proper.
Legal High,"To be fair, I noted objective trends in TV that can't be dismissed. Each decade in TV builds upon the former."
Legal High,"I actually really like the quirkiness of Sheldon's character and with the right writing and rating, you could make a pretty compelling show. I.E. Joker-esque if done right. 

But it's gonna need an MA rating and a darker plot."
Legal High,And the article I linked argued you could say that of almost every era of TV.
Legal High,"I pointed out many aspects present from, say, 2015 onwards that simply did not exist in the 00s.

Obviously the 00s was likely better than the 90s and the 90s better than the 80s in many ways etc. I'm saying that trend is continuing."
Legal High,"You mean ""Every decade was better than what came before"", while in reality a more accurate statement would be ""each era has its strengths but none was great at everything""."
Legal High,"To some degree, although I'd argue that generally TV has seen a wider improvement every decade due to technology, more money going into it etc. The consensus is that the art of the sitcom is dead, which seems true from what I can tell. And if you liked procedurals then you'd have to go back to that era for a lot.

And the points I made in my OP are very relevant for post 2010 content (especially 2015 onwards)"
Legal High,"Crazy that you can do a write up about that era and not mention the term Blue Sky. 

Listen, I agree with you 1000%, I think binging and streaming has ripped away so much of what makes the TV viewing experience great. But that's the reality and that's why these channels has to move away from certain types of broadcasting. I hope streaming and binging is an over-correction and we move back towards this model soon but until then we're not likely to see much of this style for a while."
Legal High,"It’s like THE DEAD ZONE never existed to you. Wow. 

Premiered a month before Monk and lasted 6 seasons and often in the “characters welcome” motto."
Legal High,"USA's sister network Siffy also had their own successful Blue Sky shows at the time, like Eureka and Warehouse 13."
Legal High,"There was a philosophy behind the shows and success that I understood from director commentary as “Blue Sky procedural”, especially with Monk and Pysch, where USA found a sweet spot between network procedurals with graphics and explosions, and HBO procedurals with darkness and heavy storylines. Monk and Pysch found a sweet spot with light hearted blue sky backdrops (although the Vancouver skies became more and more incorporated), a not too heavy plot, driven by relationships, really cheap costs, and a small but steady fan base"
Legal High,"All I remember about In Plain Sight was that they really played up the horny level with Mary McCormack, I feel like every ad included her in the process of having sex with someone 

The 2000’s usa era was a whole vibe but it was mainly built around them re-airing Law and Order SVU and House episodes"
Legal High,"I don't get how nbc can't seem to make good sitcoms anymore   
Cheers.   
Frasier.   
Friends.   
Seinfeld.   
30 rock.   
The Office.   
Golden Girls.   
Will and Grace.   
Scrubs.   
Community.   
My Name is Earl.   
More than half them are at the top of the all time best lists (MASH would be the only big one it's missing) the rest hold solid cult status."
Legal High,Sarah Shahi had a great vehicle in Person Of Interest.
Legal High,"You’re mainly overlooking tastes change over time.  I love the fun procedural format but less people want to watch that now.  You mention TNT, they moved away from that format too like USA.  The librarians wasn’t much of a success ratings wise and that was the last one"
Legal High,"TNT had at least one (though technically 2) long running crime of the week show with “The Closer/Major Crimes”.

Though they haven’t had a lot of success with other original shows - they got it right with that one."
Legal High,No love for Dead Zone?
Legal High,Republic of Doyle is a great show.
Legal High,"They moved away from the format because the ratings steadily dipped and then cratered as the landscape rapidly became more fragmented. There’s still no shortage of average shows with interchangeable stock characters and pleasantly bland leads, they are just more options to watch and stream them."
Legal High,"I really don't blame streaming for moving away from the Blue Sky type shows (or just plain old episodic shows. Like the X-Files, or TNG, etc...) . Their were shows like BSG that got high praise and everyone wanted to recreate it, but on their own terms."
Legal High,[deleted]
Legal High,"I don't feel the need to use any terminology. I'm not here to make a participant feel like they need to know something from the outset.

The streaming model is clearly not working and has not left much of an impact outside of one or two inconsistent shows, and those shows release so infrequently (or had subsequent releases that failed to make an impact) that even that is difficult to argue. The main shows I think of are Stranger Things and 13 Reasons Why. I would put Orange is the New Black in there as it fulfills basically every requirement, it's at 91 episodes and it was quite popular - but did it make an impact? Do people still talk about it? Is it even something people want to rewatch like The Wire? I think you're seeing the limitations clearly with OitNB - it's not rewatchable. It doesn't capture your audience's attention after it goes off the air. 

Just because it's happening doesn't mean it's a good decision. We're seeing Hollywood at its most creatively bankrupt. Every company is chasing a trend instead of setting out on its own. We're getting a Wednesday Adams show now to create an ""Addams Family Universe"" of shows. A great idea individually, but a template following idea that will need to show immediate success to even be considered to continue. 

I do not think it is sustainable for TV. There's a lack of sitcoms hitting syndication as well, which I am very curious how it will be handled. I am hopeful that CBS will renew United States of Al and B Positive though. There's been a number of sitcoms that have been cut down too early, and there's a vacuum that will need to be filled. The current Television trends just aren't sustainable for the long term market TV has created.

Speaking of USA - does anyone even talk about Mr. Robot anymore? Its only real success story for the entire 2010s and..."
Legal High,Those pesky Dead Zone fanatics got me again!
Legal High,"The Dead Zone, that's a 00's deep cut. great show"
Legal High,It WAS the characters welcome motto they used a lot lmao and then they started using House and stuff
Legal High,Man did that show really stretch out their main plot.  I enjoyed the crime of the week episodes but they had a solid Stillson plot and would advance in the smallest of increments each season.  Then the show ran out of clock and it went unresolved.
Legal High,"I loved the crossover commercial with Anthony Michael Hall? James Rhoday, and Tony Shalloub"
Legal High,Blue sky shows were amazing then and especially now. At the height of the pandemic they were so comforting to watch.
Legal High,Characters Welcome.
Legal High,"That's why it's on the Lesser Tier. 

Covert Affairs had Coyote Ugly's Piper Perabo so the hornyness level was much higher. Every ad had her mouth in minor O face. But honestly I just think that's her resting face."
Legal High,"The Office and 30 Rock broke NBC sitcoms. Both shows had amazing talent (30 Rock taking some of the best SNL writers of the era and The Office having great writers and Steve Carrell's abilities) and made the handheld camera look or lack of studio audience. Michael Schur's other projects had good success (Parks and Rec, The Good Place), but P & R definitely excelled off the talking head format from The Office. Both 30 Rock and Office ended in 2013 and since then there have been virtually no shows to mirror their success. 

I think the main issue is that streaming, especially streaming of The Office on Netflix, changed the whole game. NBC is now trying to create that scenario again. A show that you can flip on and binge that *feels* like The Office, but unfortunately isn't. 

The list of short lived NBC sitcoms over the past 10 years is long and sad."
Legal High,"NBC farms out The Office's concept for almost all of its new comedies. Parks & Recs, Superstore, American Auto, Grand Crew. Is Mr. Mayor like it? I don't really watch any of them, but it's clear their workplace single camera comedy style is hereditary.

Given the vast popularity, both in terms of reruns, in terms of cultural impact, and in terms of longevity, that a multi-cam audience sitcom show has, you'd think NBC would try more than 1 a year, if they even get to that 1. Was their last attempt Undateable? They went to an all-live episode format and then canned the show. But it's not like NBC understands the appeal of live programming given how much of SNL is pre-recorded nowadays.

Also, side note, My Name is Earl will never get the appreciation it deserves."
Legal High,Community doesn’t belong on that list with those other titles
Legal High,"To really be a vehicle show for someone, it needs to be a show made to show them off. Sarah Shahi didn't come in to Person of Interest until Taraji P. Henson had to leave because she got too big for the show (going on to star in another vehicle for her, Empire). You could argue much stronger that Person of Interest was a vehicle for her.

The other example is when a show is retooled around a new character. Take Ziva on NCIS. She comes in for Season 3 and the show revolves around her until she leaves (because... the show is not revolving around her enough?).

While she is great on Person of Interest, as she is in everything, it wasn't a vehicle for her like it was for the three main leads. And by the time she came on, the show had other recurring characters it was focusing, and while her character did get some focus, I can't consider near enough for it to be a Vehicle for her. Not when there's so much else going on and other main characters. It was a very big show for Michael Emerson. He is just chilling on Evil."
Legal High,"I don't think tastes change over time. I think TV executives are chasing Prestige TV trends. Given the shows that find success in reruns on streaming, I think the fun procedural format would have immense success. And the shows I mentioned in that format made after USA stopped trying - Republic of Doyle, Private Eyes, Almost Paradise, Magnum PI, etc - they're all very good shows. And given the ratings Magnum PI gets (averaging from 7.5 to 9 million viewers), it seems the format can still find immense success. But if no one is making them, we won't find out."
Legal High,"Yes those were big hits for TNT. I was always confused why TNT didn't try to capitalize on that genre fanbase more. Or, like, pick a genre and work towards it. Remember their show Monday Mornings? I don't know who that was aimed at. Wiki says it was paired with Dallas - that is an insane pairing!! CW put Riverdale with Dynasty. That is a natural pairing."
Legal High,"Leverage is the first ""blue skies"" like show I remember from TNT."
Legal High,I'm sorry!!!
Legal High,"It's terrific!!

Allan Hawco has not had such a rewatchable show since. I would have loved to see it still on the air alongside Murdoch Mysteries.   


Still waiting on Allan Hawco to be the Alan Wake as well."
Legal High,"Decreased viewership definitely killed the blue skies era but I disagree that there's a lot of shows like the ones that came out in that era. The appeal of those shows were they balanced light-hearted fun, cases of the week, and overarching plots well.

If there are, I'd welcome a list."
Legal High,I do not agree with anything you've written.
Legal High,"No, it's that they're all light and breezy."
Legal High,I agree with most of your points but I do have to add that Mr Robot is not widely dicussed because it was critically praised but due to the subject matter and they way in which they told the story it became a very niche show but it still is a show that had a amazing run/
Legal High,"I mean, cmon. It aired at the same time, and maybe even the same night but my memory is fuzzy on that one."
Legal High,"Yeah, I remember  that. IIRC, USA wanted the show to be more “…of the week” and less serialized so a lot of that plot was dropped. The final season was very low budget with cast exists as well."
Legal High,"I missed them. Also did you hear how the cast of Eureka found out how they got cancelled? It was a shitty way, and n my opinion."
Legal High,"I don’t think Superstore or Mr. Mayor break the 4th wall, which is the defining aspect of Office/P&R"
Legal High,Cinema verite existed before the office lol
Legal High,Did you watch Life with her and Damian Lewis?
Legal High,"> To really be a vehicle show for someone, it needs to be a show made to show them off. Sarah Shahi didn't come in to Person of Interest until Taraji P. Henson had to leave because she got too big for the show (going on to star in another vehicle for her, Empire). You could argue much stronger that Person of Interest was a vehicle for her.

The part about Henson just simply isn't accurate. Nolan wrote her out because he wanted to shift the series away from the cops / HR plot and onto Samaritan. He has said in interviews he told Henson about her character's death in early 2013 and her last episode aired in November of 2013 (aside from the flashback episode she returned for). She wasn't cast on Empire until February of 2014. So Empire had nothing to do with her exit on POI, it was a creative decision."
Legal High,"Well agree to disagree.  Private eyes was pretty good but like some of the other shows you listed was broadcast in Canada, that’s just a different market. I watch magnum pi however and it’s something I only put on as background noise and it’s not that comedic(the CBS procedurals mostly aren’t).  Also it only does 5mil viewers now.  CBS shows all have nice overall numbers but do poorly with the 18-49 demo which is what advertisers care about, mostly old people watch their shows.  Magnum pi does a .4 this season in the demo and can’t even beat smackdown.  https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/friday-tv-ratings-charmed-blue-bloods-the-blacklist-shark-tank-friday-night-smackdown/

I’m a huge fan of the comedy procedural genre so tried a lot of the recent new ones and they mostly don’t get ratings and this is network tv too where they’re not looking for prestige dramas.  Stuff like whiskey cavalier, limitless(such a good show), take two(basically castle 2.0), Lucifer etc.  there’s a reason there’s not 1 comedy procedural on network tv now.  

Kind of have to accept it was a combination of era and well written and cast tv with some luck too that lead to the USA era.  A lot of those creators have tried making new shows in a similar style but it’s just hard making a successful show."
Legal High,"Well you can look for yourself. Covert Affairs would have done under a million viewers an episode if it got renewed for a fifth season., that’s the trajectory it was on."
Legal High,"I'm not denying it its amazing run, I'm only saying that it's not a show you can build your network on. They've tried to recreate its success and failed. It's something you mix in to a varied network, and the critical praise draws eyes to other shows. 

TV needs shows like Mr. Robot. But one successful show in this new format does not a network make."
Legal High,"No, how did they hear?"
Legal High,"interesting thought, is it really ""breaking the 4th wall"" if the characters know they're being filmed documentary style?"
Legal High,Mr Mayor is more like a 30-rock
Legal High,Superstore was created by an Office writer tho
Legal High,"I think ""Breaking the 4th Wall"" has been hereditarily breeded out from the concept as it becomes difficult over time to explain why there is a camera guy filming these people in different settings. Parks & Recs began to struggle with it as quickly as its format change in the third season.

I believe the defining aspect is the single camera, toned down, workplace comedy setting. (Even though all anyone wants is a Dr. Johnny Fever.)"
Legal High,What? When did I say that it didn't? Why is this the reply to me when I just said I don't think the documentary aspect is even the defining feature of The Office?
Legal High,Doesn't ring a bell but what a cast it must have been starring those two!
Legal High,"Thank you for correcting me. It's been a while since this event. I do remember lots of anger.

(But the show was still a vehicle for her.)"
Legal High,But Whiskey Cavalier was a fun premise but a bad show. It is hard making a successful show. But just because there's failures in a certain show type doesn't mean that genre is a failure. There's numerous failures in every type of show repeatedly. I think America wants more of these types of shows than are currently being made. That's my point.
Legal High,"I am utterly baffled how your first comment has anything to do with this second comment. Covert Affairs was not even a show I praised. Covert Affairs projecting to do under a million viewers an episode for a fifth season has nothing to do with anything. And given the trends in television, that would be one of the top shows on cable today if it was hitting under a million an episode. 

But yeah, I don't have a Covert Affairs argument, so I don't know what you are saying. And I will certainly not take an argument that you cancel your successful show genre because of a fracturing landscape. I don't understand how you can say ""the ratings are going down because of an industry wide expansion which saw every show decrease in ratings flatly"" as evidence a show should be cancelled. But I don't know what you are trying to say."
Legal High,"Long story short, they were at first renewed for a short Season 6 and then NBC reverse that descion and cancelled the series without telling them. The the cast didn't find out until they read their Twitter feed. Where the fans were upset that they were cancelled."
Legal High,Good call
Legal High,"tbf, workplace comedy goes back pretty damn long.  It's just that the multi-camera 'filmed in front of an audience' feel got extremely dated feeling.  CBS kept with with it though.  Scrubs and Arrested Development were the starting gun for the change (I'd love to include Andy Richter Controls the Universe but not many people watched it)."
Legal High,"I second the recommendation of Life.  It started in 2007 and unfortunately the first season was interrupted by the writers' strike.  It did get another season and the last episode was written as a series finale, and that's pretty remarkable considering how many series at the time were cancelled and ended on cliffhangers.

My one gripe is that the episodes available on streaming services don't include the original music choices and instead substitute cheaper, filler music.  Still, the series is well worth watching."
Legal High,"Yea I would say the fact that it’s hard finding one of those types of shows take off on network tv is evidence not necessarily that the genre is a failure but it’s less popular now and may not be what people want.  Different generations may different things.  Whiskey may have been mediocre(though I liked it) but what about the others I listed.  Limitless got praise even on Reddit and Lucifer got a lot more love when it leaned into the supernatural aspect for the Netflix seasons.

Like it may not be our favorite type of show but I feel like HBO and other successes is decent evidence people want more prestige dramas"
Legal High,You’re taking this way too seriously while also not understanding conversation lol
Legal High,You called Covert affairs a “lesser but still successful” show. It got cancelled because it wasn’t successful anymore. You seem befuddled that USA gave up on the formula. I’m trying to tell you they gave up the formula because it stopped working.
Legal High,Woooooow
Legal High,"I don't think people want Prestige Dramas, I think that's just the only thing that is being created. Did anyone know they wanted Peacemaker before it came out? Did anyone even think to watch Doom Patrol? 

It's all about marketing. I just think TV is marketing the wrong shows. For every successful Prestige Drama, there's tons more failures out there. 

I don't think viewers affect what gets cancelled and what gets renewed. The Baby Sitters Club was just canned and it met all the metrics needed to be renewed."
Legal High,You aren't even the same person how can you tell me I'm not understanding the conversation?
Legal High,"Do we measure a show's success by if it was cancelled or not? What kind of logic is this?

You can't say the formula stopped working with Covert Affairs as your example. You can clearly see a shift in USA's strategy, and they took an existing airing successful show in the same vein as Monk in Suits and retooled it. If Suits was left unchanged, I am sure it would have continued on as a successful show. So how can you argue it was a format change because of a lack of success? And given how unsuccessful USA has been since making this change, how can you argue they make any decisions based on success? Because we've had a decade of unsuccessful shows from them."
Legal High,"Well yes other factors go into a shows cancellation but ratings is one large factor.  No people didn’t specifically want peacemaker or doom patrol but they were open to superhero content for sure and ofc it was well made too which meant audiences would stick with it.   

Also I would ask have you seen Reddit granted it’s a small portion of people, people want prestige dramas here at least lol.  Also they are far from the only thing being created, as I said in last comment network tv doesn’t have them basically.  Finally, the same applies for comedy procedural.  For every monk or bones or psych, there are a bunch of failures.  Most tv shows fail.

I don’t think you can just blame marketing, the big 4 networks are decent with advertising all their shows to some extent and have tried some comedy procedurals.  Ik because I tried most of them lol"
Legal High,"Buddy, we're not talking about prestige tv here. Yes, the measure of whether Covert Affairs is successful or not is if it gets enough people to tune in and watch. You're living in 2006 and acting like everything they did was pulling in Monk numbers. They had a lot of success with Monk and White Collar and Psych and Suits, but those shows aged and got too expensive to continue on with and the replacement shows like Covert Affairs and Necessary Roughness and Common Law didn't capture the public's attention. It's not easy to keep a formula going and god knows USA tried, but it just stopped working because Monks and Psychs don't fall off trees."
Legal High,I don't think it's nearly enough comedy procedurals or comedies in general. The Comedy film has disappeared from Hollywood as well over the past decade. The world needs laughter.
Legal High,"Considering Suits was the last show in the format, and White Collar was relatively late, and Burn Notice is between Psych and White Collar, I'd say it was a very successful run of ideas. 

So what do you do with that? You keep making more shows. My entire point is they did not continue to make more shows. And your reasoning is - it's not easy to keep going? It's not easy to make shows? What the heck kind of logic is that? And what ""captured the public's attention"" after it? So you have two shows that did okay but not great so you scrap a working formula?

Maybe you are in charge of USA, because your ideas are absolutely awful and have been a proven failure."
Legal High,Well 3/4 of the networks still have a good portion of schedule for sitcoms.  Also you have comedies on hbo and fx
Legal High,"No one disputes that it was successful for a good stretch of time.

""So what do you do with that? You keep making more shows.""

They did. Covert Affairs, Fairly Legal, Necessary Roughness, Common Law, Rush and Graceland were set up to be the next generation of shows to take over the Characters Welcome mantle and all of them ended up crashing because the public was getting tired of the formula. So they went in the new direction. And it's obviously less successful than the heyday, but the heyday couldn't happen again because it's a different world. The problem with formulas is there are diminishing returns the longer you use them and USA ran headfirst into that problem."
Legal High,"I don't consider a show like Atlanta a ""comedy"". Most comedies today are ""Dramadies"", which are dramas."
Legal High,"I don't agree. Given there are still successful shows in that formula, I can't accept the idea that no one wants to watch these shows. I also believe the issue is not that the formula stopped working but that USA tried to become edgier in 2012. Their unsuccessful shows begin in 2012 as does the Suits retool. Fairly Legal is from 2011 and lands on the cusp. Necessary Roughness not a show that was going to have much comedy in it from its outset and was appealing to a more dramatic market. Rush is from 2014, outside the era, and it clearly shows in its concept. Plus 2014 is when they began advertising for their big powerhouse show DIG, which fizzled fast. It's clear USA began trying to make a new formula as early as 2012, and in doing so these new shows ended up being a bust, and in response USA went harder at the new formula and resulted in a decade with nothing to show for it but more time for NCIS (which, coincidentally, means it had a lot more of the lesser NCIS seasons to air, reductions all around.)

In summary, I can't use shows like Fairly Legal or Necessary Roughness or Common Law (another show with more edge to it than comedy) to show that the idea wasn't working. But I can use them to show USA already changed their formula, and it's been clear from the start that formula wasn't working."
Legal High,I would say some are definitely comedies.  Something like you’re the worst was a dramedy.  IASIP or Veep were not
Legal High,[removed]
Legal High,"But IASIP is not a dramady lol, it's a comedy. It's also from 2005. It's older than Psych!!"
Legal High,"I believe we should judge a television show based on the content of the show and not based on what the current ad campaign was. 

It's clear USA was changing their format up."
Legal High,Cedric Bixler Zavala from At the Drive In and Mars Volta has been exposing this asshole forever because he assaulted his wife. Scientologist killed his dogs. Sad shit. Hopefully this guy sees repercussions.
Moment of Eighteen,Buffy the vampire slayer
Moment of Eighteen,"My mad fat diary should be WAY higher on the list, and while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

There are also some good ones you missed, My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education, or as odd as it sounds on the surface... Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

Moment of Eighteen,"Probably not the same tone or era, but Anne with an e is pretty good."
Moment of Eighteen,Thanks for the list but your taste is wayyyyyy off from the type of teen dramas I like
Moment of Eighteen,Me & my fam likes [Atypical](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=ATYPICAL&jbv=80117540&jbp=0&jbr=0) which is a comedy with angsty moments.

How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

^(I might finally watch Skins. Not my typical kind of show. Haven't considered watching it since I worked at Blockbuster.)"
Moment of Eighteen,why everyone ignore sex education
Moment of Eighteen,Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Best tv series of all time. A must-watch for everyone who loves supernatural romance teen dramas.
Moment of Eighteen,"> while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

I assume you mean Skins?? Loud and wrong. 2nd Gen > 1s Gen, at least for me. I've seen a few persons who've prefered the 3rd. The whole thing is great. Each gen is like a different TV show. They're similar of course but at the same time unique in their own different ways. 

> My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education

I considered them all. If the list was Top 20 they'd definately be there, along with Veronica Mars.

Never seen Buffy but I kinda get the impression it's a supernatural series with teen drama elements as opposed to being a teen-drama at heart."
Moment of Eighteen,exactly!!! I just finished rewatching and it's definitely I'm the same league as skins and skam. three of these are quite possibly the best in their genre. like ever. I'm so passionate about this trust me
Moment of Eighteen,"Degrassi was the shit


I watched pretty much the whole thing on youtube a few months qgo, from junior high to season 10 of next generation. A lot of it was bad, but i enjoyed the majority of it"
Moment of Eighteen,"You're mistaken if you believe I've seen every teen drama ever made lol. 

I've only seen My So-called Life from those you listed."
Moment of Eighteen,never seen em.
Moment of Eighteen,yea ive seen it.
Moment of Eighteen,nope.
Moment of Eighteen,"Skins is really good actually, give it a go."
Moment of Eighteen,"> How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

why, what did i do? 😶😕"
Moment of Eighteen,Oh no Buffy is absolutely a teen drama. All of the supernatural and horror elements work to service the teen drama stories in some way or another. I implore you to watch it OP.
Moment of Eighteen,lol elite makes the list but not sex education. Elite season 1 was good but damn it got chessy so fast.
Moment of Eighteen,Just stop after the first generation
Moment of Eighteen,Just trying to help you avoid crucifixion with some sarcasm. :)
Moment of Eighteen,"Naw, Buffy is definitely a supernatural series first and foremost."
Moment of Eighteen,can't. too long. don't have the time.
Moment of Eighteen,Elite season 2 is far better than season 1. Sex Education is also very cheesy. Élite is a soap.
Moment of Eighteen,The second gen is good too. The third is not
Moment of Eighteen,We can agree to disagree on that one.
Moment of Eighteen,"Generation 1 is brisket from Terry Black's in Austin, TX... 2 is dumpster diving at Arby's on Sunday night... Generation 3 is a raw sewage leak"
Moment of Eighteen,"Ha, this is reddit, sir.  We need to disagree viciously!

Anyways,  I'd say only the first three seasons have a concentration on coming of age stories and even then many of the stories don't really map well to that experience (for example, most of Angel's season 2 arc)"
Moment of Eighteen,"Bahahahahahahaha 😂😂

I guess I do see where you’re coming from - but the arc where Angel/Buffy sleep together and all of a sudden he’s uninterested and also literally evil....sounds like every boy I dated in high school."
Moment of Eighteen,"That's sounds rough. Sorry!

I think the seed of the idea is applicable but the actual specifics don't track well.  I.E.  needing to kill you're murderous boyfriend or having your gypsy friend research cures."
Moment of Eighteen,"lmao no it’s ok it’s quirky.

Okay yeah no I get that!! I should add that I haven’t rewatched it in full for a little while so I’m arguing based off memory and my brain thing is more like a bowl of spaghetti hoops at this point than a functioning organ but I guess the show was more fluid than I remember!!"
Moment of Eighteen,"> People noticed in the first episode that Joel and Sarah avoided eating foods with flour in them, like the birthday cake, pancakes and the neighbor’s biscuits. Jakarta also has one of the world’s largest flour mills, which seems to connect the fungus spread with the contaminated flour. Is that theory correct?

>Mazin: I think it’s pretty explicit.

I missed this entirely. 🤦🏾‍♂️"
Moment of Eighteen,"The relevant excerpt for those interested:

>“Why are infected people violent? If the point is to spread the fungus, why do they need to be violent?” We landed on that they don’t. They’re violent because we resist, but what if you don’t? What does it look like if you just stand perfectly still and let them do this to you?"
Moment of Eighteen,"To my mind she stood perfectly still because she wanted to keep trying the lighter. If she’d fought or resisted, the Infected would’ve attacked her and she couldn’t have tried turning on the lighter. A necessary sacrifice to get the flame going. 

Although she could have just crouched and lit the fire with the spark."
Moment of Eighteen,That moment was soooo gross
Moment of Eighteen,"I attributed it at the time of watching to maybe 'infected-recognizing-infected' as this episode really spent time on the 'they're a hive/collective/connected' explanation

Figured if you're late-stage infected or completely infected, the parasite starts altering the brain and connects you to the collective. 

Hence why >!she went from panic to was calm-accepting + slowing down/pausing to not light up the struggling lighter... I like my explanation better than tendril mouth fungi french kissing sexual assault on my eyes!<"
Moment of Eighteen,Pianooooo Frogggggg is da MVP!!!
Moment of Eighteen,The behind the scenes commentary at the end of each episode is gold. Definitely recommend. He talked about the changes he made compared to the video game for episode 2.
Moment of Eighteen,"From the article:

\> Where did that >!clicker kiss!< come from?

Nitpick: That was not a >!clicker!<."
Moment of Eighteen,">Were you expecting a such a spores backlash from fans?  
>  
>Druckmann: I think it speaks to the kind of fans that we have, who are so protective and love the world and these characters so much that *anything they see as a deviation, without the full context of what it means, they assume the worst and push back on it.*

Such a great point and mostly why I avoid episode discussions on adaptations."
Moment of Eighteen,"I loved this moment - it was some real body horror shit. Like the Alien slowly creeping up on Lambert, or basically any Cronenberg movie you can think of. 

But I also knew the second I saw it happening that it was going to become a whole *thing* online, LOL. 

I feel like this adaptation is 100% improving on the game, and I don't see how it doesn't continue to do so. This episode (directed by one of the game's co-directors) is the most ""gamey"" thing we've seen so far. It was literally setting up and paying off *game mechanics* in the narrative. And it's STILL an improvement on the storytelling, what with the Jakarta opening, the solidification of why the switch to physical growth/vines/tendrils from spores is a great call."

Moment of Eighteen,"This has nothing to do with The Last of Us, but I feel the need to pass it on: Craig Mazin's freshmen year college roommate was Ted Cruz. [They did not get along.](https://www.newsweek.com/ted-cruz-college-roommate-craig-mazin-twitter-1510850)"
Moment of Eighteen,"On a side note, did the game mention anything about the mycelium networks underground connecting the infected? I thought that was pretty cool, didn't remember it from the game"
Moment of Eighteen,Fun on a bun.
Moment of Eighteen,"Just in case you guys aren't hanging out in r/Screenwriting... Craig Mazin (CHERNOBYL, IDENTITY THIEF, and SCARY MOVIE) has been doing a podcast on screenwriting for approximately 10 years with John August (CHARILIE'S ANGELS, FRANKENWEENIE, and BIG FISH) called ScriptNotes.

Super informative and entertaining. 

Trivia: Craig Mazin was Ted Cruz's roommate at Princeton and confirmed he was a giant douchebag even back then."
Moment of Eighteen,personally i dont think the kissing scene was disturbing enough. so all the people freaking out might be more squeamish than me. i still liked the attempt at body horror.
Moment of Eighteen,Why didn’t she use a grenade
Moment of Eighteen,"Any complaint I see about Last Of Us, just tells me someone hasn’t read Annihilation! (Or seen it!) 

Not that I wanna be turned into a mycelial colony and slowly taken over, but like, Annihilation was so beautiful and breathtaking, while also being kinda scary, and amazing? Like at the end of that book, I definitely felt like becoming one with the mycelial network is the only choice!"
Moment of Eighteen,"Im not reading that article , what got people upset? The bombing suggestion?"
Moment of Eighteen,I just wanted to know how they were all bone dry thirty seconds after wading through waist high water
Moment of Eighteen,"I have to say it: the ""tense"" lighter moment is stupid. If your lighter won't light that many times, you're out of fluid. It won't just start lighting. However, she just spilled tons of flammable liquid all over the floor and the vapors should be flammable at that point. She can't crouch and use the spark on the floor because the kiss scene was written first, but it would be easy to illustrate the vapors rising from the floor to reach her lighter as she's just striking the flint wheel."
Moment of Eighteen,"Really liking the show so far. Only part I hated is when the guy was blocked by two cars and was looking for a way around. Like, just climb over it even if one of them is burning. Similar to video games though."
Moment of Eighteen,"I like the idea, but I'm not really a fan of the execution. I feel like the way they shot it sacrificed realism for shock value. 

The way the infection resembles a romantic kiss just feels unrealistic. I'm completely on board with mouth to mouth infection through tendrils... but I don't think that it would realistically look so much like a kiss when it happened. Why would a creature whose only goal is to infect others to move their mouth muscles like that? It's not like puckering would make the tendrils more effective...

I feel like they just wanted this scene. And to get it they twisted the logic to make it work rather than making a scene that fits the logic.

Edit: If you're going to downvote me, please answer my question. Why did the infected need to pucker in order infect her through his tendrils?

Otherwise I'll just assume that you know it was unrealistic shock value but are unable to take criticism of the show."
Moment of Eighteen,"Honestly, that was the only moment I have had any issues with the show.  Just felt like gratuitous shock value to me."
Moment of Eighteen,Scourge vibes from Warcraft and the Culling of Stratholme

Moment of Eighteen,[removed]
Moment of Eighteen,[deleted]
Moment of Eighteen,The show is pretty damn good so far but the director is sooooo full of himself and downplays the amount of direct copying he's doing from the already mind blowing source material.
Moment of Eighteen,A weekly release show in 2023? Gross.
Moment of Eighteen,The omission of spores and the change in what happened with Tess told me this was not the show for me.  I prefer the game but I love that the show is doing well and capturing a far larger audience than the game ever could.
Moment of Eighteen,Did this show come out because the Walking Dead finally finished and someone decided we needed another zombie show?
Moment of Eighteen,"Of course, they had to find some way to sexualize the woman. Hoping it ends with her and they don't do similar shit to the girl."
Moment of Eighteen,Thought Craig would blame Ted Cruz
Moment of Eighteen,"I'm really surprised that the Infected didn't just ignore Tess, knowing that she's infected.  
  
Sure, you don't get the ""Money Shot"" but it would have been way more interesting, story wise."
Moment of Eighteen,"Question: baked goods are placed in the oven, why weren't the fungus killed that way? Unless they are implying the fungus is immune to heat.. which is a far reach."
Moment of Eighteen,"I liked the added scene, it wasn’t in the game but it immediately felt like a Craig Mazin scene and explained a lot even to us gamers who played both games, he’s done a great job writing this series because he understands what a lot of people don’t when they adapt existing IP and that’s the fact people don’t want you to put your own twist on a thing they already love, they just want you to make it good"
Moment of Eighteen,">the fungus spread with the contaminated flour

Fun but totally coincidentally:

- Joel's surname is *Miller*

- Joel's actor in the game is Troy *Baker*"
Moment of Eighteen,"They also mention that the fungus (pre mutation) can't live inside creatures with a body temperature above 94F.  Strange that the fungus would be able to survive the 350F or higher oven temperature required for baking cakes or biscuits.  Pancakes might be easier, though."
Moment of Eighteen,"Wait, how did Joel and Sarah know to avoid the foods with flour?

Or are they just saying they happened to avoid the fungus by not eating the foods with flour?"
Moment of Eighteen,"This theory doesn't \*totally\* make sense to me though. The neighbor likely had flour sitting in her house for months before making the biscuits and cookies on the day of the outbreak. Episode 2 showed the flour becoming contaminated 2 days before the outbreak, confirming this all happened quickly. So a package of flour went from Jakarata to the neighbor's house in just a few days?

The concept makes sense but the execution and timing doesn't, unless there is something I'm missing."
Moment of Eighteen,lol yeah I think they had a little too high expectations of the audience to know about the industrial plants in Indonesia
Moment of Eighteen,Craig Mazin straight up just called you and me dumb
Moment of Eighteen,Haven't watched the 2nd episode but I didn't notice this at all
Moment of Eighteen,The professor of mycology says “it’s the perfect substrate”
Moment of Eighteen,"That's it. I've had enough of this woke anti-gluten BS!

Moment of Eighteen,slight annoyance on this plot point: If it's spread through flour don't you think a natural reaction would be to stop consuming flour?  Yet later in that episode Ellie is eating a sandwich.
Moment of Eighteen,I also missed it completely and have played both games more than once
Moment of Eighteen,Didn't he drink whiskey? It's made out of wheat and other grains.
Moment of Eighteen,New fear unlocked. Flour fungus.
Moment of Eighteen,It does make a lot of sense
Moment of Eighteen,Did you watch episode 2?  They explain that the first people infected worked at a facility that makes flour.  I missed it in the first episode but they make it pretty clear in the second.
Moment of Eighteen,"You didn't hang out in /r/TheLastOfUsHBOSeries

You gotta be cool like us."
Moment of Eighteen,"Some of the stuff they talk about in the podcast seemed incidental to me on first viewing, too."
Moment of Eighteen,"You are my saviour for today-I was envisioning my usual tactic of scrolling down the rabbit hole, but no, there you are :)"
Moment of Eighteen,"This is the only thing I don't like about this show -- showrunners are CLEARLY pushing a sleazy keto/low-carb diet agenda! Screw that, CARBS ARE LIFE!!!

/s"
Moment of Eighteen,"Exactly.

When the collective is doing is trying to spread the infection. The natural and automatic response (even internally in our own body) to infection is resistance. How is resistance met? With force.

Tess either by choice or coercion putting up minimal resistance gets you this, a less violent response."
Moment of Eighteen,"Yeah they said as much on the podcast with the show producers/ writers. They want the ""kiss"" to mimic a darker aspect of love."
Moment of Eighteen,"idk, those MF in museum looked quite violent."
Moment of Eighteen,I assumed it was because she had already been infected
Moment of Eighteen,"I would have thought that the people they killed would just grow mushrooms and produce spores, which infect living people who kill more people, and that's the life cycle of the cordyceps. 

The issue I have with their explanation is that it makes the fungus have a will of its own. The point isn't to spread the fungus- there is no point at all. Spreading the fungus is a convenient byproduct. The whole thing came to be entirely by accident. But if it can make decisions, or communicate over a network, it starts becoming more magic than science."
Be Melodramatic,"Grey's Anatomy - I know many people who love this show, but all I see every time I try to give it a chance is actors crying to popular music."
Be Melodramatic,"Mrs Brown's boys.

A truly terrible show that I cannot stand.  I can't even call it a comedy because its just not funny. 

I simply do not understand its appeal."
Be Melodramatic,"> It feels like every character considers themselves the most important person in the room, and integral to the functioning of the United States, a particular state, or whatever it is they do.

FWIW, that was the most realistic part of House of Cards.  It really isn't possible to overstate how insufferable the political class in DC really is, on a personal level."
Be Melodramatic,"To some extent: Sherlock. Seasons 1-2 were some of the best British tv but I absolutely despised season 4.

I’ve been watching Elementary recently. The show that was derided as trying to leech off the popularity of Sherlock yet I enjoy it more."
Be Melodramatic,Modern Family ... It stopped being funny years ago!
Be Melodramatic,"I want to add This Is Us. I’d heard so many people talk about it and how good it was, how I needed to watch it so we could discuss the episodes, etc.

So I sat down and watched several of the first season’s episodes and I just. didn’t. get it.

I couldn’t understand what everyone was sobbing over every week and what made the show so great. I couldn’t stand the triplet characters except (oddly enough) the adopted one because it felt like everything that came out of their mouths was nonstop whining.

I don’t remember how many episodes I finished but I don’t think I made it past the first season (I don’t think?). So maybe I’m not qualified to give my opinion on whether or not this show is overrated, but based on what I’ve seen and the fact that I didn’t enjoy a single episode, couldn’t get into it, and still roll my eyes every time I see a promo for a new episode that will “BLOW YOUR MIND”, I can’t help but think This Is Us is completely overrated. 🙄"

Be Melodramatic,"Any ""reality"" tv show but particularly The Bachelor and the Kardashians.

I get that they are addictive and popular but I hate the idea of supporting trashy and talentless people with attention and ratings. Pick your worst sitcom or drama, at least there's a modicum of creativity and effort involved. These reality shows can just keep phoning it in and appeal to the lowest common denominator, yet stay on the air when some of the best, most innovative shows get cancelled after half a season."
Be Melodramatic,"I'll get hate for this, but I'd personally say Mad Men

Be Melodramatic,"Recently, *Umbrella Academy*.

It had a great aesthetic going but boy was it a predictable collection of tropes all wrapped up with some clunky dialogue, dreadful acting, and really awful action scenes.

Be Melodramatic,"Agree about HoC. I don't understand why people started crying about later seasons being trash. It's always been trash, in my opinion. Sleek, well-shot and well-acted, highly entertaining trash that I watched from beginning to end, fully knowing how ridiculous it was at times. The UK version has much better and tighter writing but it's still a bit silly (you shouldn't be able to blame *everything* on the IRA...)"

Now American Idol being number one as long as it was is a solid example... Ya'll dumbasses were watching karaoke for like 5 years..."
Be Melodramatic,Mad Men. I still love some of the characters and the style of the show; it was shot beautifully. But Jon Hamm's character Don Draper is fucking insufferable. The amount of self loathing and deep stares out of windows and his treating people like shit got old after the first couple of episodes. His character stayed a morose ass throughout all 7 seasons and it made watching the show a frustrating experience.

FWIW my favourite ever TV show is The Wire. That is my idea of a masterpiece."
Be Melodramatic,"Letterkenny. I’m not sure how it does with critics, but all my friends and family love it. I feel like most of my issues with the show stem  from the writers’ beliefs that they are really smart. The dialogue is hilarious in the first two seasons, but then it goes on and on with the same humor and same exact setups and punchlines in subsequent seasons. I ended up turning it off for good when for the millionth time, we are sitting with the boys in the hockey locker room and they round the room by announcing each others’ names and saying the exact same thing. I feel like reducing this schtick to once every few episodes would make the show vastly better."
Be Melodramatic,"Friends.  
That shit is just not funny.  
Big Bang Theory is even worse."
Be Melodramatic,"Honestly, I'd have to say the first two seasons of Twin Peaks. There are amazing episodes in there [basically the episodes directed by David Lynch], but almost everything else ranges from decent to downright bad [James leaving town in season 2 is the absolute low point, but even fans admit that it sucks].

The only reason I finished the first two seasons of Twin Peaks was so I could watch The Return, which thankfully was as amazing as everyone said it was. It's probably one of the best shows I've ever seen."
Be Melodramatic,"MASH. The first few seasons were funny, but after Alan Alda took complete control it quit being like the movie. Klinger didn't dress up anymore, Burns, Trapper and Henry were gone, and Hot Lips quit being a slutty nurse. And it lasted another eight or so seasons like that."
Be Melodramatic,"I’m gonna go back in time with this one, but I never understood why MASH was so popular. I just didn’t get it."
Be Melodramatic,Letterkenny has become so overrated. No one fucking talks like that in real life. Once the novelty wears off it becomes boring and repetitive.

Gave up during the second season, it seemed like an exercise for Damon Lindelof to fully unleash his obsession with hollow mystery and ""but it's the characters who really matter, not the elaborately peculiar scenario we've put them in!"".

Let me start by saying that I like and enjoy the office, it’s definitely a solid show and I would miss it if it didn’t exist. However, in terms of it being the pinnacle of television comedy or sitcoms, I just don’t see it.

If you're talking about the American version, I agree. It's a solid show and I enjoyed the episodes I saw, but it's nowhere near the quality of the original."
Be Melodramatic,Stranger Things.
Be Melodramatic,Friends. I just don't get how it's funny.
Be Melodramatic,"Bojack Horseman.

I don't even understand what the show is trying to accomplish. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Does it have a plot? I really don't get it."
Be Melodramatic,Turns out subjective thing is subjective...
Be Melodramatic,"IDK, but it's definitely NOT Doom Patrol."
Be Melodramatic,ITT all the most popular shows on TV at some point that some people didn’t like...
Be Melodramatic,Singing / talent competitions.  Just cringe bullshit
Be Melodramatic,"Personally, I never got the love for Seinfeld. I watched a few episode when it was on, and have occasionally tried again over the years, but I honestly don't get it! It always felt that the characters were yelling all the time, and I really didn't ever really find any of it funny. As always, my opinion, applicable to the volume of space I inhabit."
Be Melodramatic,"How I Met your mother. The male actors are unlikeable and wimps. And the premise is as boring as friends. If you try watching these shows nowadays and only focus on them and dont write on your phone or pc or talk to someone while watching, then its a snorefest."
Be Melodramatic,Trailer park boys
Be Melodramatic,Big Bang Theory
Be Melodramatic,"Always Sunny.

&#x200B;

I know it's a Reddit favorite, but I watched a bunch of episodes expecting it to finally get better and finally just gave up on it.  Every time someone calls it the successor to Seinfeld, I question whether they've ever watched Seinfeld.  Also, they've certainly never watched Curb, the true heir."

Be Melodramatic,"I always get murdered for this, but The Sopranos. Hear me out, it’s not a bad show by any means, but consistently being ranked as one of the best shows ever blows my fucking mind. The first two seasons are really really good... and then it completely falls off a cliff. Here’s what I think is wrong with it:

1. Tony is an incredibly boring and stagnant protagonist. He never changes, learns anything, or faces any obstacle he can’t just easily overcome by the fact that he’s the boss and can kill whoever he wants. Early on they set up interesting plot lines and conflicts with his mommy issues and beef with Junior, but once these were resolved the show was just spinning its wheels

2. Going off this, the villains are so fucking boring after Tony’s mom dies. Ralph is a fucking cartoon character. Never do I get the feeling that Tony is actually threatened

3. There are way too many unresolved plot lines. The “interior decorator” in the woods, Chris wanting to be a movie writer, meeting those gangsta rappers... where did all of these go?? But no, I found out Ralph likes getting a dildo in the ass, thanks. 

4. The whole therapy thing was great in the beginning, but after Olivia died it became completely pointless. Tony even mentions it himself, they didn’t end up doing anything new they just sat there and shot the shit every few episodes when nothing else was happening. And don’t even get me started on Melfi’s rape... 

5. Tony’s love interests are as bland and one dimensional as they are stereotypical and obnoxious. Tony meets girl, she’s cool, she wants him to be her husband basically, he says no, she goes crazy. Rinse and repeat. 

6. Meadow and Anthony Jr. are the most insufferable characters ever seen on TV. I never got past season 5, so I’m not sure if Meadow ever becomes a decent human being or even a decent character, at least she had a tiny amount of depth. Anthony Jr. literally only exists to roll his eyes and sigh at every single thing anyone says

7. Carmela literally sounds like Lois Griffin and it drives me crazy (this isn’t an actual gripe but it’s worth mentioning)

That’s just the stuff off the top of my head, when I was actually watching the show I had more that I just can’t remember right now. I appreciate the place in TV history that The Sopranos holds because it paved the way for other gritty series like The Wire and Breaking Bad, but it is honestly just not that good"
Be Melodramatic,Will and Grace. The only person I find funny is Karen. Everyone else just annoys me.
Be Melodramatic,"Monty Python's Flying Circus.

It's really not aged well. There are some amazing sketches but they're the exception not the rule.

Of course it was groundbreaking in its day, but that's the point it hasn't been it's day for a long time.

My advice would be to just watch And now for something completely different which is the highlights of Flying Circus and leave it at that."
Be Melodramatic,"Everywhere I turn in a television discussion people keep exclaiming how amazing The Leftovers was.

I watch the first season and a couple episodes of the second. I didn’t get it. It was alright but far from the greatest show ever put to tv."
Be Melodramatic,DAE think the Big Bang theory is a direct personal affront to their exceptional intelligence?
Be Melodramatic,I wouldn't call House of Cards overrated because the first three seasons were incredible. If it ended after three seasons it would be remembered as an incredible show. But the last few seasons were just awful and made no sense. It's a shame.
Be Melodramatic,"True Blood - Im pretty sure this was regarded as a good show, but i thought it was gratuitous and lame. I saw one of the episodes late in the series that was laughably bad.

Sons of Anarchy- i really liked this show, but it went on too long and meandered all over the place towards the latter seasons. And I wont even mention the disastrous last episode.

I dont really agree with your issues with HoC or the Office but I wont downvote you because of that!"
Be Melodramatic,Friends
Be Melodramatic,"Better Call Saul. The episodes could be thirty minutes each and it still would drag on. They really should’ve decided to just finish it in three seasons so they could speed things up. It’s like the opposite of how GoT was rushed through at the end.

Even so, it’s best moments are still just callbacks to BB. “Hey, I remember that guy!” I still immensely enjoy it."
Be Melodramatic,Seinfeld....I just can't watch it. So cringey.
Be Melodramatic,Big Bang theory. Seriously fuck that show. It’s the rectal cancer of television.
Be Melodramatic,"Doctor Who. Also, Daredevil."
Be Melodramatic,Big Bang theory...
Be Melodramatic,Firefly joking :) **Fringe** its like  Groundhog  day over and over
Be Melodramatic,Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld is unwatchable. He’s absolutely awful.
Be Melodramatic,Friends
Be Melodramatic,The Simpsons
Be Melodramatic,Seinfeld
Be Melodramatic,"Game of thrones. I'd have been better off reading the books, show had everything going for it. Literally was written already. I refused to watch the show until Jeoffrey died and the show goes drastically down hill after that."
Be Melodramatic,LOST
Be Melodramatic,Brooklyn 99.
Be Melodramatic,"Stranger Things. I tried to watch it many times and I just can't. It's boring, I don't like the cast."
Be Melodramatic,Big Bang Theory... and Two and a half men... blergh
Be Melodramatic,"Agents of SHIELD. I would say is a, totally overrated TV show for sure, that some people try to pass off as the next Netflix Daredevil and/or Breaking Bad. The writing is terrible and lazy (in my opinion, it's as bad as Season 8 GoT level of terribleness) and so some fans try to pass off the writing of characters to fit a plot as ""character development"". Also, in my opinion, it messes around the MCU canon because it wants to insert itself into everything that is important (every MCU movie) but it totally screwed the pooch at the end of Season 5 by not showing the Snap and now they are just ignoring it hoping that it's current ""space arch"" will distract people from that conclusion.

Edit:

Also, some fans will try to come out to defend this show like crazy and will also try to push others into watching it."
Be Melodramatic,"The Office (U.S.)- I’ve tried so many time to watch it. But each time I end up skipping 3 or 4 episodes at a time because they are just not funny. All the characters are overly annoying, and the whole Jim and Pam thing is drawn out way to long."
Be Melodramatic,The Bing Bang Theory. Just dumb and flat jokes over laugh tracks. It's cringe and just plain bad.
Be Melodramatic,walking dead
Be Melodramatic,"Friends. 

Out of every 100 gags, two will be funny. And one of those will be ruined by bad acting."
Be Melodramatic,Obviously Game of thrones anyone?

Winds of Winter

One day it got real cold all over Westeros. Winter had come. It got so cold that everybody died at the same time, from that weird paralyzed kid all the way up to the lady with the dragons. And that real badass girl that went around killing everybody all the time. And that fat guy. Was there like a fat guy? Anyway, he fuckin’ died too.

The Wind Blows,"Pretty sure this guy wrote himself into a corner and had zero idea how to write himself out of it. HBO chose a path based on what he thought he might do, fans hated it, and now he’s frantically trying to salvage it. 

I don’t think there’s a way to do that. Killing off your interesting characters people identify with is a neat trick that subverts expectations once. He did it until he had no real plot left and he’s still struggling for one that doesn’t have a typical fantasy ending.

The trick is that not all reader expectations need to be subverted. People read fantasy partially for a hero’s journey. Give them one."

The Wind Blows,RIGHT. Because HBO actually finished something
The Wind Blows,"Tell him ""shut up"" for me."
The Wind Blows,"Who’s this guy kidding we all know he ain’t ever releasing it and even if he does he’ll never finish the series. This guy while a good writer is a bad author. Hell never deliver on his promises of a complete AOIAF. He just needs to stop and acknowledge that he won’t finish.

This guy, always coming out with an update on winds of winter. Might as well be talking about Duke Duke em forever in that if he does release it is likely to be dog shot; or The next chapter of half life because it’ll never come out."
The Wind Blows,"You know what. I am not even mad at this point. He’s fucked off so long I respect it. There’s some sort of zen teaching here about want, desire, action and inaction. 

I hope he release a book that just a list of everything he spent his HBO money on and it ends with ‘git reked’ but one special copy out there gets a 5” floppy disk taped to the back cover. Floppy has three out of sync chapters on it, but you need WordStar 4.0 to read it."
The Wind Blows,Quite different….like it will never exist.
The Wind Blows,Are people still buying this guys BS? He was a former tv writer who turned to writing novels and had his series of novels turned into the most successful tv show of all time. He has no motivation to write anymore books.
The Wind Blows,Well that’s good to hear
The Wind Blows,Thank god.
The Wind Blows,*A Dance with Dragons* was published 11 years ago.
The Wind Blows,The main difference is that the show released and the book probably won't.
The Wind Blows,"“Quite different,” in that the HBO show was actually finished."
The Wind Blows,The only way I would have been happy is if the Nightking wins…and everyone’s stupid drama was deemed fruitless. Also would’ve been a badass metaphor for climate change. Would’ve been dark and perfect.
The Wind Blows,Forthcoming. That's a bold word.
The Wind Blows,"Meaning it will be riddled with subplots and extra characters that will amount to nothing. 

Looking at you, Dorne.

I'm afraid it's just his way to garner some interest, after the show pretty much killed any that was left."
The Wind Blows,The major difference is that one actually exists and the other is theoretical.
The Wind Blows,"Until he actually finishes writing the books, the HBO storyline is effectively canon as far as I'm concerned. If he wants people to get away from the HBO ending he needs to get cracking."
The Wind Blows,"It’s taken so long that I’ve completely
Lost interest in the series. I don’t even care any more."
The Wind Blows,One can hope
The Wind Blows,"At this point. Just pay a ghost writer to do it. 

Or fuck it let Stephen King finish them. He’d have both of them done by August."
The Wind Blows,"Less talky about book, more writey actual book."
The Wind Blows,The main difference being  that the HBO series was completed and released to the public.  I have more faith that Dre will release the Detox album
The Wind Blows,Either release it or just tell everyone to get fucked. I am sick to death of seeing this man discuss what this book will be for the last decade. Enough is enough. Nobody cares anymore.
The Wind Blows,"Read Game of Thrones in 1998. 

Gave up hope of ever seeing an end to this series long ago. I've accepted the tv show as the closest thing to closure I'll ever receive. GRRM can eat a weiner."
The Wind Blows,If he just did his job the show might have ended on a better note. He allowed amateurs to fill in the details of his outline and they got cold feet and rushed the ending out the door.
The Wind Blows,"There was a fan-posted video that concluded that since he published Dance, until COVID started GRRM wrote at best 200 pages of Winds, lol (based on his blogposts, updates etc.)"
The Wind Blows,I wish he’d shut up about it until it’s done.
The Wind Blows,Bc he rewrote the book after the reception of the final season I guarantee it
The Wind Blows,Sure. I read dance of dragons 11 years ago.
The Wind Blows,Probably different in the fact that the HBO version at least exists.
The Wind Blows,"“Oh, shit, my storyline failed in the show?  Rewrite!”  No wonder it’s taking forever."
The Wind Blows,"Stop writing articles about this “upcoming” book. It’s either out, or I don’t want to hear about it."
The Wind Blows,I suspect dude was using the HBO series as a temperature gauge and saw shit go cold pretty quickly.
The Wind Blows,I don't even remember the plot tbh.....
The Wind Blows,It’s probably taking him so long because he rewrote every time the show did something stupid
The Wind Blows,"“Different” as in, the HBO storyline exists, whereas his book doesn’t seem like it will?"
The Wind Blows,They could not be more different. The fact that one of them actually exists is the main thing.
The Wind Blows,"Eh, I'm over it. Any interest I had in reading his next book died years ago."
The Wind Blows,"Yeah, in that it doesn’t exist."
The Wind Blows,"Spoilers...

The winds of winter will be vastly different to the series because the series was actually written and finished even if it was garbage"
The Wind Blows,Quite different because it won’t actually materialize.
The Light in Your Eyes,That man did not even TRY to cover baby Ellie's ears.
The Light in Your Eyes,It was so weird listening to Ashley talk in the beginning. Couldn't unhear Ellie lol. Good scene though.
The Light in Your Eyes,Finally a ladder and boost sequence!
The Light in Your Eyes,"Man, that attack on the hospital was something else. I read a long time ago that a lot of times when people are about to do something awful like a terrorist attack or a shooting, they will mentally check out and kind of go into auto mode. I got that vibe from Joel during this episode and Pedro did an amazing job in this show."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I’m so curious to hear from you folks who haven’t played the game and/or didn’t know the story going in, what was your reaction to the hospital sequence and how do you feel about Joel as a character?"
The Light in Your Eyes,"Joel isn't concerned with being a good man or doing the ""right thing"", he's a father who won't go through losing a daughter again, the world be damned.

This is great television."
The Light in Your Eyes,Damn he cleared that level fast.
The Light in Your Eyes,"So much stuff in this episode hits hard, but weirdly hearing Ashley Johnson's voice and seeing how closely she resembles Bella Ramsey got me the most choked up. Ellie is one of my favorite characters from any medium, and seeing how well this series was able to tell her story was amazing."
The Light in Your Eyes,The sound editor was having a laugh when joel opened that fence gate.
The Light in Your Eyes,"lmao i heard the grunt/scream in the beginning and thought “wow, bella really sounds like ashley johnson there.” imagine my surprise 15 seconds later"
The Light in Your Eyes,"Ashley Johnson and Bella Ramsey actually look super similar, great choice and way to use her!"
The Light in Your Eyes,Omg Ellie lost her pack and her book from Riley 😢
The Light in Your Eyes,"Man, hbo has been in love with distressing child birth scenes lately"
The Light in Your Eyes,They nailed the Joel rampage scene. The scene where he kills the head doctor too. Absolutely perfect inbetween of game and tv show.
The Light in Your Eyes,The scoundtrack for these scenes has me on edge. exceptional.
The Light in Your Eyes,So Ellie has the same origin as Blade?
The Light in Your Eyes,Joel having that gun on auto aim really helped
The Light in Your Eyes,"Spock: The needs of the many outweigh the need...


Joel *shoots Spock in the God damn face*"
The Light in Your Eyes,The giraffe scene was everything I hoped for.
The Light in Your Eyes,Bella Ramsey fucking NAILED that last shot
The Light in Your Eyes,"I know so much of the musical cues the show has used are pulled directly from the game, and I don’t know that was was used in the episode are the same recording used in the game, or new recordings of the same compositions. 

But nevertheless, a huge round of applause for Gustavo Santaolalla this season.   The giraffe scene works as well as it does because how how that moment registers musically, and it translated fantastically for the show.   Same goes for the end….

….The question Ellie asks Joel (fast acoustic strumming faintly begins)…

…. Joel lies to Ellie (rapid strumming grows louder)…

….Ellie considers for several moments (strumming reaches it’s climax, and cuts out entirely into silence)….

“Okay”

(Acoustic riff and outro, with somber un-distorted electric guitar lead)"
The Light in Your Eyes,“It wasn’t time that did it”
The Light in Your Eyes,"It's wild seeing Ashley Johnson talking to her daughter Ellie, a character that she had a huge part in creating. 

That had to be a really interesting headspace as an actor"
The Light in Your Eyes,"It’s kinda interesting tidbit, they cut part of Bella’s discussion in the post discussion, but didn’t cut the subtitles. She says “the trauma Ellie faced in 109”. It means they filmed all the post credit stuff before HBO cut in and made the decision to merge episode 1 and 2 together. 109 references episode 108, which was supposed to be 109."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Zero brick kills. 

0/10 adaptation, completely unfaithful /s"
The Light in Your Eyes,They had the giraffe scene. That's all that matters
The Light in Your Eyes,My one critique is that nobody ever got killed by a brick.
The Light in Your Eyes,Didn't get any Jesus Joel or holy shit Joel out of ellie all season haha. At least they stuck with the puns and joke book. Good job HBO. Set the standard for video game adaptations in Hollywood.
The Light in Your Eyes,"Great Episode.  That was probably the fastest 40 mins of TV I have ever experienced. 

Would have liked another clicker scene (tunnel scene) but still fucking great.  Can't wait for season 2."
The Light in Your Eyes,I can't be the only one who thinks it is absolutely ridiculous they were leaping all the way to brain surgery less than six hours after they found her.  There's only one of her.  You kill her she's dead.  Run some tests on her for weeks at the very least.  Learn the biology while she is living.  If surgery is the prudent path after all that then so be it.
The Light in Your Eyes,Lol that one Firefly who legged it out of the hospital got so lucky.
The Light in Your Eyes,"Cant believe its over.I assume like HOTD, Andor and ROP this will be back in like 2 years at the earliest...Hope quality remains."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Nice to see Ashley Johnson (voice of Ellie in the games for people that don't know it) as Ellie's mother and a very important scene (if I'm not mistaken, we never knew why Ellie was really immune). Also I actually knew both of them but never made the link of how much Ashley Johnson (which doesn't look like her game counterpart) and Bella Ramsey look like each other. Totally credible for them to be daughter and mother.

Also they did put a ladder scene! 

And I thought Marlene died in Boston actually lol."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I'm so glad Ashley Johnson got a role in this. It was crazy to hear ellies voice giving birth to ellie, but she did a great job. Episode was very faithful to the game and to this day I'm still not sure how I feel about it haha."
The Light in Your Eyes,Bad adaptation. Joel didn't kill all the doctors in the room like he did when I played.
The Light in Your Eyes,"bella was a god damn rockstar this entire season. mazin and druckmann were really, really smart to center this series around her; she is absolutely capable of carrying this thing on through the next part of the narrative (which is going to be INTENSE)"
The Light in Your Eyes,"Giraffe 🦒 is there!!!! 🤗
Let’s see what else happens…"
The Light in Your Eyes,This show set the new bar for video game adaptations. And it's fucking high as shit now.
The Light in Your Eyes,"Joel’s rampage through the hospital was special. In different hands it would have come off as heroic, but here it felt tragic. It was watching a man turn into a force of nature ready to end the world to save his daughter. Amazing and haunting at the same time."
The Light in Your Eyes,First two secs I hadn’t looked up and thought “Oh Ellie starts the ep.” Then realized it was Ashley lol. Old habits die hard I guess
The Light in Your Eyes,Be interested to see what tv viewers who have never played the game think of the ending (namely Joel's decision and lying to Ellie).
The Light in Your Eyes,"When Joel said “It wasn’t time that did it.” And looked at Ellie, I started sobbing. 😭"
The Light in Your Eyes,"Good job Marlene. Don't welcome them with open arms, get them fed and warm and having a few days R&R in relative safety before having a conversation about the potential benefits, the risks and what they'll do to mitigate them. Instead rush one of them straight from a flashbang to the face into surgery in some dingy 20 year old operating theatre and tell the other one, who has crossed a fuckin continent filled with infected who want to kill him and people who want to kill him even more so you know he's got some serious dog in him, that you're doing all that seconds after he wakes from the flashing to the face and a nasty concussion. Superb leadership."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I'm surprised by how good that was. As someone who played the game, I finished the last episode in awe of how great ep 8 was but was concerned because I didn't think they'd be able to wrap it all up in just one episode, especially considering that the last episode is only 45 minutes. However, they wrapped it up beautifully.

As a whole, I think season 1 is great. The best parts are the first 3 episodes and the last 2. The middle 4 aren't quite as good as those five but even at its worst (ep 7), it's still not bad. I'd give s1 a 9/10. Can't wait for s2, which hopefully will be 2024 rather than 2025."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I would have sympathized more with Marlene if they had asked Ellie before killing her. 

Just like Joel said, he was ready to kill himself until he flinched....maybe Ellie would have been ready to sacrifice herself until she made it to the operation room."
The Light in Your Eyes,Seems like there should be more bike riding in this post apocalypse.
The Light in Your Eyes,stupid long horses
The Light in Your Eyes,[removed]
The Light in Your Eyes,"Not sure what the consensus is but I liked the hospital part more here than in the game for narrative purposes. In the game, you had to fight for survival and get back at those shooting at you. They showed Joel’s ruthlessness in the show more which displayed how he made this decision and basically murdered anyone trying to stop him. If they showed him struggling and being in trouble, you’d sympathize more with him but the fact that he just breezed past the fireflies without any remorse showed his dark side which makes the ending really more ambiguous."
The Light in Your Eyes,Can’t believe we hit the over on giraffes
The Light in Your Eyes,So Ellie's immunity was straight up like Blade's? Mother gets infected close to childbirth.
The Light in Your Eyes,"They absolutely crushed this episode (and season.) I was a little worried going into the finale that Joel was too ""likable hero guy"", but this episode did a lot to change that. Interested in hearing what non game fans think about him as a character going into next season."
The Light in Your Eyes,that douchebag didn't even attempt to cover her ears!
The Light in Your Eyes,"Didn't hold back at all from Joel murdering the entire goddamn Firefly org chart. Awesome.

Still rushed, but still the holy grail video game adaptation."
The Light in Your Eyes,I mean I loved this show but I can’t help but feel the whole thing was just *so* rushed. the first three episodes were paced perfectly and everything since then felt like constant whiplash and I don’t think the ending was nearly as earned as it was in the game.
The Light in Your Eyes,Ashley being Ellie's mom is absolutely perfect.
The Light in Your Eyes,"As a fan of the game, this episode was phenomenal, practically perfect in my eyes! Pretty much nailed the Salt Lake level, I’m so happy! What a fantastic adaption of one of my favorite games of all time!"
The Light in Your Eyes,"Joel killing the doctor with one single shot to the head just made no sense.

I always roasted his ass with the flamethrower like he was a marshmallow."
The Light in Your Eyes,"My only complaint is the trope that ""step 1 - scientist needs to kill patient to find a cure"". Even if that proved correct, a surgery that's gonna kill the patient should be the last resort. There should have been months of different tests performed on Ellie before reaching for the lethal surgery option. It's dumb for the fireflies to kill their only hope on the first try, and it's dumb of Joel not to advocate other tests first."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I’ll only say this about the episode. It’s a quote from a certain other Mazin production:

“*Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid*”"
The Light in Your Eyes,[deleted]
The Light in Your Eyes,"You know if I had to nitpick on something they didn't show in the show that was in the game that would be Joel and Sarah's picture together. You see it in Sarah's room at the beginning iirc, then Tommy says he went back to Texas and tries to give it back to him but Joel refuses. So Ellie takes it without him knowing and then gives it back to him in the moment Joel reveals he tried to commit suicide in the show, only then he accepts it.

I mean they did it differently here letting Joel tell directly to Ellie that she's the one that cured him, but the photo was a nice subtle touch. Him taking it signified that he made peace with his past and could finally allow the memory of his lost daughter to be with him without hiding it in the back of his head, but it is what it is. Not seeing it once more will make Part II hurt a little less"
The Light in Your Eyes,unreal this is airing during the Oscars
The Light in Your Eyes,"Holy fucking shit, is Ellie immune because her mother got bit just before she cut the cord? It might have meant the cordyceps transferred to her but only a tiny amount or something, giving her some kind of genetic predisposition to immunity. I know Ellie’s mom says she cut the cord beforehand, but she only noticed the bite after the birth, there’s no way she could have known for sure and she’d say anything to protect her child. Maybe I’m looking too much into it though, but if that’s true that’s a wild revelation for both the game and the series."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I've never played the game but I'm curious - do they do the same thing with ""ok let's cut her brain out""?

I feel like that was a really stupid choice and I'm not sure if I should blame the writers or the characters. You have someone who is immune and instead of starting with things like blood tests/transfusions they just go right to cutting out her brain?

No extracting of cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, plasma, nothing. Just carve up her brain?

This is the most important and valuable person the planet. Their body holds the key to everything. I don't understand how you go right to killing her which means if anything gets fucked up you've now ruined your one shot. I'm talking from a pragmatic standpoint - it makes zero sense."
The Light in Your Eyes,"The behind the scenes addition to the episode is amazing. The conundrum Joel feels about having to save humanity or save Ellie, and the moral consequences of both"
The Light in Your Eyes,Can’t believe Joel didn’t beat someone’s head in with a brick. Brick cameo would have made this 10/10
The Light in Your Eyes,"Anyone else feel like they kind of rushed that ending? 

Can’t help but feel like the pacing of every scene felt better in the game, and I’m talking even a cutscenes only version"
The Light in Your Eyes,"Looking back, I do think the lack of zombies in the show makes it seem like perhaps a cure wasn't even super necessary. would have been a bit more impactful if you had a clear idea of how fucking bad things still are without one"
The Light in Your Eyes,"12-13 episodes would have been perfect for this show

building their relationship more as well as giving more time to david and jackson would have elevated this show"
The Light in Your Eyes,"I wanna point out the scene where they're talking and Joel says ""it wasn't time that healed it"". They followed the rule of not insulting the audience by not stating the obvious ""it was Ellie"", and I really appreciated that."
The Light in Your Eyes,The actress who played Ellie's mom looks so much like Bella I thought we had flashed forward for a moment to a pregnant Ellie.
The Light in Your Eyes,"Maybe I missed something but what's not clear to me was whether or not they knew for sure operating on Ellie was going to lead to the cure... 

The way it was presented it seemed like they thought or had a theory and was going into Ellie's brain to test that theory out.... which if that's the case seems like a very risky thing to do on a hunch! 

If you have this very rare thing like a cure in the only human you know where it exists you might want to only kill her when you have more info than a theory... maybe the game fleshed it out more but thought this part was rushed through and the ending fell a bit flat as a result.."
The Light in Your Eyes,"So I haven't played the game, for what that's worth on how it affects my thoughts on the show.

I'm gonna go a little against the grain here and say that, while I definitely appreciate what they were going for, the ending didn't quite land with me. It just felt like things moved a little too fast, the bombshells of the episode were a little too abrupt. Like I barely had time to process and have things sink in before the show was moving onto the next thing.

Not to say it was bad; like I said, I appreciate what it was going for. And I applaud the commitment to having the main ""hero"" go on a chilling massacre like that at the end, but I felt oddly... detached from it, in a way?

I dunno. Overall, I'd rank the show as pretty good, with moments of greatness here and there (pretty much anything pre-outbreak, the acting in general, Sam & Henry).

It'll be interesting watching the upvotes/downvotes on this comment for the next day or so lol."
The Light in Your Eyes,Holy shit Joel
The Light in Your Eyes,Marlene had so many opportunities to kill Joel. This is her fault as much as his.
The Light in Your Eyes,"Something tells me Ellie isn't buying Joel's massive lie........welp gotta wait a year or two before seeing that catch up to him.

Do wish it wasn't just 45 mins though, it was quick!"
The Light in Your Eyes,"I was worried this would end flat given how short the episode is for a finale, but they make great use of the time."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Ellie got her autonomy taken by both Marlene and Joel. Oof. I get why he did it but dang. I have conflicting feelings. I love Joel but....him lying to Ellie really broke my heart.

I'm sure there's other doctors out there...."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Haven't played or read anything about the game but liked the show a lot. Great start and ending, middle episodes kinda forgettable. 

Needed another ep or 2 to transition Joel from stoic guy doing a task to becoming this super father figure all of a sudden. A lot of it happens offscreen because of the long timeskips during travel.

Ep 8 was the best imo. 

Needed to show a bit more mushroom people to drive home the threat. 

Hospital fight seemed quite rushed, would have liked to see Joel pull some tricks out of the bag to get through there alive. As it is it looks like he shoulda taken a few bullets at least. 

Hospital shooting is also a little less dark because the fireflies handled it terribly. If they were super accomodating and tried everything before chopping into her brain (with her consent) the shootout would have been proper dark. Even more so if we'd had a full episode of the fireflies being kind and upbeat about the possibility of a cure, trying everything, then Joel going on a rampage after all that."
The Light in Your Eyes,"I really enjoyed the show, but I was left wanting more of everything.  They should've split the first game into two seasons, or at the very least given us a longer season to tell the story.  If we had more time with Joel and Ellie traveling together, fighting infected and raiders, and just generally bonding with one another, the payoff in the finale would've been way more effective.  And I'm not saying Joel needs to be killing people on-screen every few minutes, but there honestly wasn't enough of him being this unrelenting killer with the sole focus of keeping Ellie safe.

Also, I was disappointed Joel only killed the doctor in the operating room.  In the game, I killed everyone in the room just to make extra sure no one could come after Ellie and carry on the doctor's work.

It was nice to see Ashley Johnson cameo as Ellie's mom, especially after Troy Baker made an appearance last week."
The Light in Your Eyes,Joel Wick
The Light in Your Eyes,"As great as this episode was, i cant help but feel like they rushed it a bit, and the season in general has had some weird pacing issues, theres just too much compressed into too short a period of time, could have really done with another episode."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Overall, I enjoyed the show. I don't ever expect adaptations to be page for page or direct translations because each medium is different. A TV show isn't going to be a video game. With that said though, I don't think the show was nearly as good or as succinct in telling its story as the game was.

The major issue is that Joel and Ellie's journey felt both shorter and easier in the show. They're fighting fucking tooth and nail in the game, and having to see them experience all of that brutality really hits home how much they had to endure by the time you reach the Fireflies. There's also such a clear contrast in how Joel goes from being completely walled off to treating Ellie like a daughter, whereas in the show he always seems to just kind of get along with her.

I really think the show could have done with being 12 episodes so that it could have included not only more action, but more opportunity to let some of these moments breathe. I'm looking forward to season 2, but I feel like the story in TLOU2 is an even harder story to adapt than the first game. Hopefully they'll do it justice."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Things happened so fast. As someone who hasn't played the game, we see Joel and Ellie looking for the hospital and in a matter of like >5 minutes: Fireflies capture Joel and Ellie, Joel is laid up in a hospital bed and presented with sacrificing Ellie for a cure to potentially ""save"" the world, and Joel has already begun murdering people. It's such a massive decision and it wasn't given nearly enough time to let Joel/the audience weigh the moral ramifications or fully process the dilemma before the decision was set in motion. The pacing has been a problem all season. The show presented several ""payoff"" moments this season that felt hollow and unearned because they weren't given enough time to build. It's a shame because the show does a lot of other things right: The leads are great and well casted, the sets and scenery are beautifully shot, and the Frank episode was masterclass. That said, after watching the first season, It's a good show, but it could be great and I just can't help but feel a little underwhelmed."
The Light in Your Eyes,Joel went buck nasty
The Light in Your Eyes,"I liked the episode, but did anyone else find baby Ellie just unexpectedly being on the floor fully delivered in .5 seconds when her mother looks away extremely goofy lmao?"
The Light in Your Eyes,I LOVE how offhandedly Joel kills the Doctor despite how heavy the implication of that action is.
The Light in Your Eyes,"I love the game, and have really enjoyed the first season of the show, but these last two episodes have felt so fast, too fast, for me. The chapter of the story in last week's episode could have been told over two episodes, and this week's finale being the shortest episode of the season so far feels a little egregious in terms of the pacing.

I didn't think it was in any way a bad episode of television, but after the flashback intro, it was basically about 20-25 minutes between Joel and Ellie arriving and the end of Joel's rampage. I don't really understand why they couldn't have made this first season 12 episodes and taken just a few hours more to tell the story, it's such a well made, written and acted show that it's hard to believe it would have damaged the overall quality of it to do that.

They now have the choice to either jump into the events of Part II in season 2 or create an original season of episodes that bridges the gap to it, but if they do go straight into adapting Part II, I hope they take more time to tell that story."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Joel made the right choice. 

The Fireflies had no clue what they were doing. Why would you kill the only known person immune to the fungus? You don't want to do blood tests or observations first? 

Their whole plan was stupid."
The Light in Your Eyes,Great casting for the actress who played Ellie’s mother. They look so much alike that I wasn’t sure if it was a flash forward or flash back at first.
The Light in Your Eyes,"It’s hard to remove my knowledge of the games from this but I definitely feel like they didn’t capture the love Joel has for her as well. So I’m curious how people who just watched the show thought of that. 

It could also be my knowledge of part 2 that builds on their relationship and I’m ultimately being unfair."
The Light in Your Eyes,"Episode 7 should've been cut and released at a later time as a TV Special (it was DLC for a reason). I think it would've made the reveal of Ellie's first kill much more impactful in the finale, and it would've somewhat improved the pacing of the show."
The Light in Your Eyes,"This is not me complaining, I love the discourse, I'm just putting in my rambling, disjointed 2 cents:

Just like back in 2013, far, far too many people talking about how the fireflies weren't competent enough, or wouldn't have been able to synthesize a cure, or the cure didn't seem essential because the show had only a few infected, therefore Joel would've been justified in his ""decision"".

It's all post hoc, ergo proptor hoc reasoning. I believe it's mostly for people to excuse or rationalize what Joel did because they can't accept the creator's intent that what Joel did was monstrous, and was wrong from many points of view. It was the only thing he could do as someone who has been through what he's been through. There was no ""decision"" to be made. Joel did the only thing a father could. Protect his world. All else be damned.

Unconditional love is a scary, ruthless, primal, SELFISH thing - that's the message of that finale. The point isn't anywhere in the same postal code as the logistics of making a cure, or whether or not the fireflies were ""right"" - It doesn't matter if they should've, could've, did, or didn't do a biopsy or MRI or whatever. **All of that should be as meaningless to the audience as it is to Joel.**

Because at the end of it all, his relationship with Ellie is the focal point of the series - a relationship that is now tarnished by a massive lie. To borrow a relevant line from another Mazin masterpiece:

""Every lie we tell incurs debt to the truth. Sooner or later this debt is paid.""

That's the emotional thrust that punctuates the end of this season."
The Light in Your Eyes,Wow. Ashley killed it and god damn if I don’t buy they are mother and daughter
The Light in Your Eyes,That guy throwing the flash grenade scared the shit out of me lol
The Light in Your Eyes,"This episode was perfect, the giraffe scene made me feel very emotional. Would not have wanted it to end any other way then cutting to black at the end."
The Light in Your Eyes,I mean they went straight to her brain?  Not even some blood tests first lol?
The Light in Your Eyes,in my opinion they tried to show the numbness of the hospital scene that almost a knee jerk reaction to how Joel's daughter was ripped from his arm that he feel so helpless. I think he projected a lot of his anger for not doing everything he can and entrusting his fate and of his daughter at the hand of another (army man) .

**Aunt Wu** (the fortuneteller) = maybe similar to [Kate Bush eg Running Up That Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM) 

But I became very unsure about the pattern!)

***

I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a band focuses on.
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each band tells you something about some layer of the situation.
 
You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns in a single global ""spectrum"":

- *Scooter < I Like Trains < Assemblage 23 < Ashbury Heights < Elvis Presley* **(in the middle)** < *Coldplay and google-translated Kukryniksy & Kurt Vile < Electric Six*

- *< AWOLNATION and The Rolling Stones and Florence + The Machine and LMFAO < google-translated Mujuice and Aria and and google-translated Piknik and Queen and Hurts*

- *< John Lennon < P!nk and Phil Collins and Monoral and Eurythmics and Bondage Fairies and google-translated Nautilus Pompilius and Philip Kirkorov and Kate Bush < google-translated 7B < ""Weird Al"" Yankovic*

The farther you go, the more a band focuses on a single fact... or the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets.

That's just my intuition! (And I don't know how to order some and where to put some)

***

Another version of ""Post Scriptum"": (I apologize for bothering you)
 
All people for me are like heroes (or brilliant characters/ cool people!), no less. I know this is very improbable that I will be able to help anybody with this ""pattern language"", but there's a chance no matter how small and miniscule and absurd sounding **(and it's better than nothing, better than to do nothing at all)**
 
Maybe you can test this theory about speaking patterns with modern day technology such as [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)#Applications) or [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#GPT-3)"
Flower Crew:Joseon Marriage,"I believe you can apply those patterns to music bands, and the fun part is that you can apply the pattern to any piece of any song of the band (it's like a fractal: every piece looks alike)

Bonus with *inane* music band analogies ->

I will quote 

- *P!nk, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, John Lennon, LMFAO, Eurythmics, Ashbury Heights* **(6)**
- *Florence + The Machine, AWOLNATION, The Rolling Stones* **(9)**
- *Bondage Fairies, google-translated Piknik, google-translated Kukryniksy & Kurt Vile, I Like Trains, Assemblage 23, google-translated 7B* **(16)**
- *Aria, Scooter, Philip Kirkorov, google-translated Mujuice, Monoral, google-translated Nautilus Pompilius, Queen* **(23)**

(-) is a wild card, it means no connection or any connection. (>) means just expanding on the thing you already said.

(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...

(.) is a bunch of standalone facts/events that don't need any context to be understood, every bit of (.)-speech is a self-sustained point... you can split such speech into pieces without losing any context...

- *I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went* (-)(>) *So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)* (-)(>) *I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight*

on high level (situation): P!nk describes something that causes continous implications for example ""I'm gonna drink my money"" or ""I got a brand new attitude"" or ""I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight"" or just a bunch of standalone facts

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Beautiful World,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Beautiful World,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Beautiful World,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Beautiful World,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Beautiful World,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Beautiful World,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Beautiful World,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Beautiful World,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Beautiful World,🙂💕
Beautiful World,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Beautiful World,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Beautiful World,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Beautiful World,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Beautiful World,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Beautiful World,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Beautiful World,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Beautiful World,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Beautiful World,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Beautiful World,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Beautiful World,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Beautiful World,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Beautiful World,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Beautiful World,"I think HotD's first season was really hampered by the fact that they were trying to cover, like, 20 years of history in 10 episodes. The actual Dance Of The Dragons only takes place over 2-5 years, IIRC, so the next seasons will have plenty of time to breathe."
Beautiful World,"In some ways House of the Dragon was always going to be a harder show to get into than Game of Thrones, especially early on. Game of Thrones has a lot more relatable characters at the start. The Stark family was (generally speaking) humble and kind, easy to connect with, and a good way to on-board the audience since several characters are leaving their isolated home in the north to experience the wider world. There were also a lot more characters to hop around to, so if you weren't super into one of the storylines, there was always something new a few minutes away.

House of the Dragon starts off with a cast of much grayer characters. I've heard a lot of people criticize the fact that they didn't feel that they had anyone to root for. And it's much more focused on a smaller group of people with interconnected storylines, so you don't get the wider spread of experiences and settings that GoT offered almost right from the start.

I really enjoyed it though. They managed to pack a lot into that first season, and I liked how complex many of the characters were. I felt a connection to some of them despite their often considerable flaws, and I thought it did a good job of ramping up the stakes and tension as the season went on.

I agree that the show could use a bit more of the kind of wit that GoT had, particularly in its early seasons. It's certainly not completely humorless, but there aren't really any ""funny"" characters the way that GoT had people like Varys, Tyrion, and Bronn who you could usually count on for some levity.

Still had a great time watching it and I'm excited to see where things go in Season 2, especially since we are past the big time jumps at this point, which were necessary but a bit awkward at times."
Beautiful World,"People say the later seasons will be better, but I'm more cautious. Season 1 is where all the political intrigue happens. They'll be some good set pieces but from this point in the lore, it's a lot of battles."
Beautiful World,"Just finished up a rewatch of GOT + HOTD

I gotta be honest, as compared to GOT, HOTD is kinda dull. Even the 'bad seasons' of GOT were more entertaining to me than HOTD."
Beautiful World,"I found it kind of tricky to stay invested in. There was this shift in focus from Rhaenyra to the kids, some time jumps, casting changes, etc. Sort of felt rushed and maybe disorganized. I dunno-- something.

There was this emotional investment with the Starks in GoT that kind of glued the whole show together. Not sure I'm seeing what's holding this one together so much."
Beautiful World,"Yeah I think I agree with your opinion overall.

If I really feel like it, I can finish watching S1 and I know I'll enjoy it. I kinda drifted off at E7 or whatever.

I just have no obsession with it. It's something well made that somewhat engages me and is familiar. It's a nice achievement that it managed to revive many peoples' interest in the franchise. The CGI was really impressive.

It'll be on top of my list for comfort shows to continue one day. But I got nothing I wanna talk about with HotD itself. Stylistically and tonally it is a retread of something I already spent near 80 hours watching last decade."
Beautiful World,"It ramped up pretty well and was fun with good story. 

Season 1 of game of thrones was like this and then it really really took off in the following seasons."
Beautiful World,"I enjoyed HotD just as much as one of the first six seasons of Game of Thrones, and *far* more than the last two seasons."
Beautiful World,"I really hate prequels.  Sure you can make good stories to get from point a to point b, but knowing the longstanding effects of an entire series/movie in advance is so shitty."
Beautiful World,"HotD is overly self-serious and sorely lacks a Tyrion character. GoT had some levity and self-awareness that helped ground and humanize that world.

The showrunners are also not making common sense adaptation changes that helped GoT accessible to audiences in the first place. Not sure if it's being comfortable with the franchise's success, or learning the wrong lessons from fandom backlash.

And not for nothing, there's a big difference in source material. GoT is based on a sprawling story with numerous character POVs, while HotD is based on a concise ""history"" with a more distanced perspective. This really comes across with how each show approaches its supporting cast."
Beautiful World,"I liked it, but GOT season one was way less rushed and with far more relatable characters, Ned being the primary one; you get hooked right away by the very clear good vs bad scenario: Starks vs Lannisters. In HOTD you have a much harder time to warm up to these characters, the only one I would consider universally beloved is Viserys, the girls will have to be written in a far more appealing and sympathetic way if show wants people to actually give a damn about their endeavours because none of them has the natural charisma of a Matt Smith, who has hordes of fans despite being an arsehole"
Beautiful World,"So far, you have literally only watched a prologue."
Beautiful World,Give it time.   It will suck eventually.
Beautiful World,I agree that Rings of Power was a better show.
Beautiful World,"I don’t think the timeline for the first season hampered it at all I think it was just an irregular form of story telling that hasn’t been done in modern television history as often.

I think such experimental forms of storytelling will always have people who don’t quite enjoy it because it’s out of the norm and therefore isn’t as entertaining."
Beautiful World,"It's weird how aggressively defend it.  Like yeah there are plenty of shows without a ""good guy,"" but that isn't really an excuse to make a show almost devoid of likable characters."
Beautiful World,I had a hard time sticking with it.  I just finished it 2 or 3 weeks ago and I already couldn’t tell you more than a couple of the character’s names.  Then the scene of Club-foot Guy >!masturbating to Alicent’s feet!< made me question why I had stuck with it that long.
Beautiful World,"It's an entire season of television and 10 hours long. ""It's the prologue,"" while true from a certain POV, doesn't totally invalidate any and all criticism against it."
Beautiful World,"Even so, you can still evaluate the merits of a prologue."
Beautiful World,"sad that you're getting downvoted by people who haven't read F&B to understand this

GoT had a few flashbacks, such as Tower of Joy, Rhaeger's Wedding and Cersei getting her prophecy. 

HotD took what would have been flashbacks and expanded them into half a season of accelerated storyline by aging characters quickly"
Beautiful World,"It did hamper it, though, because everything had to be rushed and not much ever really got to breathe. I'd rather have had 2 seasons with young Rhaenyra that covered the same length of time."
Beautiful World,"while it may not totally invalidate criticism, it's a relevant factor to keep in mind. It's important enough for the comment to deserve positive karma at least.

Would you stop by a construction site which has only built a foundation and criticize the work because it hasn't created a building you can live in?

HotD isn't the type of show that needed to have a great first season in order to earn renewal. It isn't an anthology like True Detective whose great first season was supported by being able to complete its whole story arc right away. It went in with a longterm plan, but had a great first season anyway."
Beautiful World,"It's that people don't give a shit.  If the showrunners decided to spend 10 hours on prologue that's their call and not some deflection of criticisms of the show.  ""It's just the prologue"" so far has been less of a discussion point and more of a deflection for superfans to use against any criticisms of the show. 


The idea that people just don't ""understand"" is the annoying and condescending tone of people who read the book."
Beautiful World,I thought they covered it pretty well. I do not need two seasons of young Rhaenyra lol
Beautiful World,"> 
> Would you stop by a construction site which has only built a foundation and criticize the work because it hasn't created a building you can live in?


No, but I would criticize a season of television.  Because that's how seasons and television work.  Maybe when it's done people will just look back on S1 as the prologue and forgive it some of its flaws, but no one is waiting years to have opinions about a show they watched 10 hours of."
Beautiful World,I did. Milly Alcock is fucking awesome
Beautiful World,"Would you also say the same things about the first 5 episodes of a season that is written with 10? What about the first half of a movie?

Where is it ok to draw the line for how much of an unfinished product needs to be viewed before you can start making conclusions?"
Beautiful World,"I totally agree about her performance, she rocked."
Beautiful World,"> 
Would you also say the same things about the first 5 episodes of a season that is written with 10? What about the first half of a movie?


Possibly, but this is a disingenuous comparison.  Seasons are designed to stand alone more than the first half of a movie.  That's why they exist, and great shows make them satisfying in their own right.  I don't get how you can think ""judging the first season of a show is like judging half the season of a show.""


And you know what?  Sometimes people *do* evaluate a show after 5 episodes.  Watching every second of released content isn't a prerequisite to have an opinion.  If a show isn't good 5 episodes in it isn't your responsibility to watch the whole season so you can say it's bad. 


> 
Where is it ok to draw the line for how much of an unfinished product needs to be viewed before you can start making conclusions?


Easy, in the distinct divisions that are established by the creator.  It's kinda silly to judge an episode by the first 20 minutes, but you can absolutely judge a whole episode.  How many seasons of television are people required to watch before they're allowed to form an opinion?"
Beautiful World,"Seinfeld also got Richards onto Letterman's show very quickly after the event:

https://youtu.be/IwBoVZh1ruQ"
Beautiful World,I hear he’s a great tipper too.
Beautiful World,I never figured him as a master chess player.
Beautiful World,Great episode.
Beautiful World,"Despite everything, I never had the impression that Michael Richards was racist. He was someone who was unskilled in stand-up comedy and panicked when he was getting heckled and said some truly shitty things"
Beautiful World,"I think what he said came from a place of racist intent. You can have a fit of rage without going to that place.

NOW... that's not to say you can't change. Michael Richards and anyone like him is capable of looking inwards at their demons and coming out a better person.

I hope he did and I hope he is a better person for it."
Beautiful World,"Hardcore Seinfeld nerd here: i couldn’t watch the show for many years after the heckling incident. I didn’t buy the letterman song and dance. 

It wasn’t just the n word — which in itself is bizarre that he would go to that — it was the “hanging from a tree with a fork up your ass” flourish. 

I understand saying hurtful things in the moment we don’t mean. I’ve done it more times than i can count. The n word and the imagery, though. 

I’m back on the show, and can look at Kramer’s face now without thinking of it. 

But judging from his spontaneous racist lynching insult fantasy, that guy can get bent."
Beautiful World,I love this episode cause of Richards’ moment of senility where he thinks Sugar Ray still lives in the same house lol.
Beautiful World,"Jerry looked like a complete idiot by bringing Richards on Lettermen. It was a masterclass in victimizing an unhinged racist. Rather than making the moment about the people he hurt, Jerry decided to throw a big pity party for poor ol' Michael. Jerry is a fucking loser that only defended his friend because of his own demons (having sex with teenagers)."
Beautiful World,He should have done an episode with Shoshanna
Beautiful World,"If he had stopped in his outburst right around the time when he said ""You see?  Those words scare you."", he could have turned it into a monologue about how words can hurt, but they are just words, then made fun of racists.

But he went the other way.  Waaayyyy the other way."
Beautiful World,"you're a rube. it might be a masterclass in loyalty, but it's also a masterclass in helping avoid responsibility. saying words of apology don't absolve you or rectify the harm you've caused. michael richards should be shunned in public with a ruined reputation, and any time he's seen publicly should be doing work to rectify the harm he caused/perpetuated."
Beautiful World,"I think Seinfeld sticking by his side is a moral failling on his part. Whitewashing extreme unhinged racism just because the racist is his friend.

&#x200B;

Richards is not owed a platform or celebrity"
Beautiful World,Well they did live across the hall from each other for many years.
Beautiful World,"I think that Michael Richards' true redemption came when he left that $10,000 tip at Joe K's Deli."
Beautiful World,"I remember. And Jerry told the crowd not to laugh.
Whew. The cringe was real"
Beautiful World,"Thanks for reminding me of this. He is clearly introverted, and these are some hard-to-deliver statements he gives. 

Celebrities addressing fuckups with effectively ""I'm doing this because I got caught"" seems to be pervasive, but this example seems genuine."
Beautiful World,"$10,000 at Joe K's Deli!"
Beautiful World,"I love the whole depiction of the savant, it's such a perfect snapshot of that character. You just 'get it'."
Beautiful World,"The thing is, he’s claimed that he got worked up and “said some things” or whatever, the usual “it’s not who I am” thing. But if you actually listen to the recording, he doesn’t just say the n word or something like that, he literally opens by telling them that “fifty years ago we’d have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass!”, calling him the n word over and over, literally mocking the audience for being shocked by “what’s buried beneath” (his exact wording). This wasn’t just him “going too far”, this was a fucking dam breaking. Everything I’ve seen with him talking about it has tried to make it sound like some too off-color lines he said on a particularly bad night as opposed to a racially-charged meltdown. Obviously I don’t fucking know the man, but I can’t assume that he’s “learned” since then if he doesn’t even seem to recognize the root problem."
Beautiful World,"Mate, if your response when a black person heckles you is to say this;

""You can talk, you can talk, you're brave now motherfucker. Throw his ass out. He's a (n-word)! He's a (n-word)! He's a (n-word)! A (n-word), look, there's a (n-word)!""

And

""Fifty years ago we'd have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass.""

Then you're a racist.

EDIT: Or at least you were at the time. I'm not going to pretend to know Richard's views now, and I don't necessarily think he should still be a pariah. But trying to argue he wasn't racist at the time is ... well it's a bit odd."
Beautiful World,"Ah, I'd say that it was a great example of how racism is pretty much omnipresent in American culture, if not all cultures. Why did he say those things when he panicked? Why did he go that way? Because he had thought patterns that can only be described as racist. He might not have said those things because he has a fundamental belief in white supremacy, but he was definitely willing to ""go there"" in the moment because he felt it advantaged him. Being willing to use the white supremacist culture to your advantage while not being a true believer doesn't really make you better than a true believer."
Beautiful World,"> He was someone who was unskilled in stand-up comedy

He started working as a stand-up comic in 1975.

He was outed as a racist in 2006.

31 years is a long time."
Beautiful World,Didn't he threaten to lynch some black dudes?
Beautiful World,Ya my anxiety always makes me drop N bombs.
Beautiful World,Richards unskilled at stand up? He only had 30 years of stand up experience. The dumbest excuse ever.
Beautiful World,"Agreed. I think humans are predisposed to potentially say racist things as, from an early age, we naturally classify the world around us differently than other beings. As adults I believe we should be held accountable, but we should also be offered the opportunity to redeem ourselves."
Beautiful World,"I could be as mad as hell at a Black person and never use that kind of language because I don't use that kind of language. It doesn't just come out when you're mad unless it was already in you to begin with, which means you are a racist."
Beautiful World,"Wait… what? How can you honestly look at Kramer’s face without thinking about it? 

Asking for a friend. A friend who had Seinfeld (the show) ruined forever by this event… :/"
Beautiful World,Nope...Jay Mohr haha
Beautiful World,"This is the wrong outlook. People deserve second chances. By your logic everyone in jail should be executed or thrown in prison locked away forever.

He said bad things over a decade ago.  He apologized. He's not marching with nazis or joining the kkk."
Beautiful World,"Jerry telling me ""stop laughing it's not funny"" was one of the funniest things he's ever said"
Beautiful World,"Yeah, at the time I remember thinking, ""You'd better be glad those people are inclined to laugh for Michael Richards against all reason; that's the only thing that may save him."""
Beautiful World,I think they laughed at how he said Afro-Americans
Dino Girl Gauko,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Dino Girl Gauko,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Dino Girl Gauko,This was a great read.
Dino Girl Gauko,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Dino Girl Gauko,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Dino Girl Gauko,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Dino Girl Gauko,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Dino Girl Gauko,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Dino Girl Gauko,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Dino Girl Gauko,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Dino Girl Gauko,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Dino Girl Gauko,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Dino Girl Gauko,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Dino Girl Gauko,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Dino Girl Gauko,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Dino Girl Gauko,Delta state was the shit!
Dino Girl Gauko,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Dino Girl Gauko,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Dino Girl Gauko,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Dino Girl Gauko,It was on both actually
Dino Girl Gauko,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Dino Girl Gauko,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Dino Girl Gauko,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Dino Girl Gauko,A girl and a dino
Dino Girl Gauko,"Executive Produced by Laurence Fishburne who's also voicing Beyonder? I don't care if its a kids show, I'm in."
Dino Girl Gauko,"> Fred Tatasciore as Devil Dinosaur

I'm so weirdly excited by this piece of casting"
Dino Girl Gauko,"Was it moon boy and devil dinosaur or am I remembering the old, like really old  comics wrong?"
Dino Girl Gauko,Yay! This comic is so good! It's a fantastic comic to adapt for animation.
Dino Girl Gauko,"Ooo the styles nice, poppy and colorful. I'd watch this on an acid trip."
Dino Girl Gauko,Yes! I am so psyched for this! Moongirl and Devil Dinosaur is such an awesome comic!
Dino Girl Gauko,"I'm slightly more hyped for The Ghost and Molly McGee, but looking forward to this too."
Dino Girl Gauko,yeah!
Dino Girl Gauko,"It was, but a few years ago they rebooted the comic."
Dino Girl Gauko,"Cool, thanks"
Dino Girl Gauko,"Space ghost coast to coast was a god send

Edit: Ooh, mama, am I nervous. Sweatin' like a Trekkie. I smell like oil of Olestra. "
Dino Girl Gauko,So basically 15 years ago today was the most important day for adult cartoons in history.
Dino Girl Gauko,[deleted]
Dino Girl Gauko,The Eric Andre show could exist nowhere else  
Dino Girl Gauko,"Great write-up! 

Also, for anyone who's interested, Home Movies is back on Adult Swim starting next week."
Dino Girl Gauko,"Damn, I really miss Metalocalypse. We need to bring brutality back to TV."
Dino Girl Gauko,TL; DR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkup4zo97E0
Dino Girl Gauko,"""The medium amount of reefer smoked by 18-34 year olds during the program was considerable."" Best quote of the article. "
Dino Girl Gauko,"as a 26 year old, I always thought of adult swim as way pavers. I remember falling asleep on the living room couch of a 4 room, 700 sq ft apartment instead of in my bed so I could watch some samurai champloo before bed at 11 at night as a 14 year old. I even vaguely remember flcl and even after all these years, the one thing that stood out was the fu-ri-ku-ri television robot. 

are millenials the generation of nostalgia? have we progressed to quickly? "
Dino Girl Gauko,"I'll never forget that fucking April Fool's Day. 4 years ago.

Midnight, seeing what Adult Swim had in store for this April Fool's. Steve Blum apparently made a vague random tweet earlier that day. But I didn't see it.

Soon The Room played. Again, like last year. but then suddenly *boom*. Motherfucking TOM. Then Bleach started playing. Thought it was a good joke. Then the bumpers played. ""No way."", I thought. Then I was watching the end of the Cell Saga. Holy **SHIT.** Then it was Gundam, then Trigun. Goddamn. 

Ironically it was one of the highest ratings Adult Swim got in years. A month later, Toonami was back. It went through a bit of rollercoaster of ratings. A few duds(Casshern, Samurai 7) but also a few golds(Kill la Kill, Space Dandy, One Punch Man).

Now, Toonami is going to give us a new season of Samurai Jack, and new season of FLCL, a new Production IG series(people who made IGPX), and (next month) Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
"
Dino Girl Gauko,"I am privileged to have been born at a time when I was old enough to be able to stay up and watch [as] and, also, young enough to be able to stay up and watch [as].  :)"
Dino Girl Gauko,I was in a really bad place 15 years ago and this late night spot gave me smiles as a preteen. Lots of laughs and some great anime. It really brightened up my life till college. I actually met my husband on the adult swim message boards. He still watches some of the shows :) 
Dino Girl Gauko,You didn't mention Robot Chicken. The Star Wars specials are some of the most priceless stop-motion gems ever.
Dino Girl Gauko,"Awesome post.

I tried to think of why they would cancel ATHF, and I now believe that it has to do with the fact that Adult Swim is stronger than ever. That makes me feel confident that they will bring back ATHF when they need a boost in ratings. The show needs to recharge for a few years.

Master Shake and Carl are two of the greatest characters in the entire Adult Swim lineup."
Dino Girl Gauko,Wow this is incredible. I didn't realize I witnessed the birth of Adult Swim. What a ride it's been. Thanks for this fucking amazing post. 
Dino Girl Gauko,"No mention of ""Venture Brothers"". For Shame."
Dino Girl Gauko,">(The Critic has been off for 6 but who cares?)

I care."
Dino Girl Gauko,I used to stay up till 2 just to watch Gundam Wing uncensored. It was such a happy jolt to my 16-year-old self when the characters would swear. I also had a huge lady boner over Quatre.
Dino Girl Gauko,"I'd point out that season 3 or Moral Orel was quite serious, but I guess it wasn't really serialized that much. Still one of my favorite shows."
Dino Girl Gauko,"I remember when it first started. I was a teenager, and was just wowed by the abject absurdity of shows like Space Ghost, Sealab 2021, and Aqua Teen. It also introduced me to anime through Cowboy Bebop. The downside, at the time, was that it only aired on Thursdays and Sundays at midnight. I'd not yet accepted my night owl tendencies, so I didn't get to catch it every week. But it was definitely a reason to stay up late. I was particularly obsessed with Space Ghost and Brak. It was the Napster era, and I made an entire playlist of Brakisms. Over an hour of nonstop Brak. It was a good time to be young and weird."
Dino Girl Gauko,Holy fuck I miss Mission Hill
Dino Girl Gauko,"Wasn't Lucy, Daughter of the Devil on adult swim too?  That show was awesome."
Dino Girl Gauko,And yet Korgoth was never picked up :(
Dino Girl Gauko,"I got the honor to meet and chat with C. Martin Croker, voice of Zorak and Moltar on Space Ghost. He said originally that Lazzo wanted to create new Hannah Barbara serials from old animation reels of A-List characters like Yogi Bear. They were told no and instead could purchase the animation reels, and rights, to D-List characters like Space Ghost and Sealab 2020. 

Of those reels was the Wacky Races, which Lazzo wanted to take and create something called ""Wacky Races Coast-to-Cost"" which would take all the previous episode animation reels and make one big event out of it. And, as Croker said, Lazzo had a fever dream the night before of production of the prototype in '93 and instead told the team they'd be creating a new adult themed cartoon talk show. Long story short, the prototype is presented, green lit, and aired as Space Ghost Coast-to-Coast. "
Dino Girl Gauko,"adult swim bumps basically created my current day taste in music

also, adult swim has saved many shows. why wont they bring back wonder showzen?  why was that on MTV2 and not adult swim?  best show ive ever seen"
Dino Girl Gauko,"I knew it began before 9/11. I think I actually caught it on its first night too because I saw Space Ghost, which was a favorite of mine when it was on TBS. "
Dino Girl Gauko,"Space Ghost, ATHF, Home Movies, SL2021...Period and in that order
"
Dino Girl Gauko,And 15 years later. I still try sneaking off at night to watch. Except now I'm sneaking by my girlfriend instead of my parents. 
Dino Girl Gauko,"http://toonamiaftermath.com/
For those who wish to reminisce on the old CN and includes Adult Swim. Plays out like you're actually watching tv back then. First timers should check out the schedule to see what it's all about.

Also check out http://nreboot.com/watch#cnr"
Dino Girl Gauko,"Space Ghost Coast to Coast, pre-Adult Swin days, were just amazing. I don't even remember how I stumbled upon it, but I remember watching it at my grandparents house when I was about 8--- and my mother walking in to see why I was up so late and what I was watching--- and laughing significantly harder than I was. 

The entire thing was bizarre.

I also remember those old Hana Barbara Space Ghost + Bird Man + Herculoid episodes that were airing late at night with laugh tracks that my father found both nostalgic and hysterical.

I loved it, because my parents would watch cartoons with me, even though I didn't really understand half the jokes."
Dino Girl Gauko,"I don't even watch TV. Never really did. But I've always kept up at least a little with Adult Swim. These days I like getting stoned and watching Off The Air. Superjail satisfies my twisted side. I want Brak back.

Brak 4 President"
Dino Girl Gauko,"This is a great write up.  I was in college when it started, we had a fun group meeting up to watch that insanity when it was on. Sealab was my favorite.  When Venture Bros. hit, though, wow. 

It's also where I first saw Cowboy Bebop, unreal.  "
Dino Girl Gauko,"Man...I remember staying up late to watch FLCL when it first aired. I was 13, and wasn't supposed to be up that late, so I had to turn the volume almost all the way down where I couldn't even understand the dialogue. All I heard was mumbling and the (amazingly done) soundtrack behind the crazy visuals, and together it made for such a surreal experience, it was amazing. I remember craving the feeling it gave me and I'd scour the internet for anything related to FLCL. This was long before youtube so the best I got was a fanmade page with some sparse info and I must have read it over 20 times just waiting for Sunday night to come again.

 The whole thing had such a profound effect on 13 year old me and I attribute so much of my taste in movies/TV/music to sneaking episodes of FLCL on adult swim. 
"
Dino Girl Gauko,[deleted]
Dino Girl Gauko,"Great write up, Adult Swim revitalized the animation industry in some aspects, leading to more animation jobs within the country, and given entertainment the ability to ""be weird"" again. I don't think we'd have Bob's Burgers, Archer, Bojack Horseman, and more without it."
Dino Girl Gauko,"Alan Resnick is just by favorite person in the world, and I follow all of his writings, and took part in the ARG, and I can't wait to see what's coming next"
Dino Girl Gauko,"Most importantly. It gave us Rick and Morty.

In all seriousness, I remember watching adult swim as a child and being engulfed. I would stay up late to watch these not so child appropriate shows and giggle my ass off. Thank you Adult Swim for bringing joy to all us TV addicted kids around the world. "
Dino Girl Gauko,">It boosted the careers of Killer Mike, Flying Lotus, Odd Future, MF Doom, Danger Mouse, and completely made the career of MC Chris. It introduced Killer Mike and El-P

Funny thing, I barely knew about Adult Swim and never watched before I started listening to MF Doom, Madlib and Dangermouse. Those guys legitimized the channel for me. The first time I watched it there was a commercial or promo that used ""Accordian"" and I was sold. "
Dino Girl Gauko,"Frisky Dingo was everything. I love how you can see and hear the roots of so many Archer memes, while still having a show that stood on its own and was honestly edgier in many ways. Although no bus driver ever knows how to respond when I ask if they go to all pet stores."
Dino Girl Gauko,And now Adult Swim has turned into a game where you try and find the Adult Swim sign hidden in pictures

Dino Girl Gauko,"""Natatorium, what's a natatorium?""  Not even google spell check knows, that's funny.

As a college student during 2001, Adult Swim came out and was amazing.  It was perfect background noise and perfect comedy.  I loved every moment.  My favorite moment you didn't mention.

[Aquaman Dance Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpopXL2h33U)

Everytime an ADP came on I fell in love with Adult Swim more and more.  There was never and reason given why he was dancing, no background, just dance.

Little shameless promotion, but it inspired me years later to recreate it.  

So I [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WE-_SJCq-0) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3435-lYmX4) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD_yOJMBWYk) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfwHycU65aU) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD5wPODXUcg) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLji2OXVlDA) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEJDum4vdGc) and [did](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zYyzgvbAzr8/hqdefault.jpg?custom=true&w=336&h=188&stc=true&jpg444=true&jpgq=90&sp=68&sigh=6UKk9iy3uQSVjUamlXqGLKMAwbA) and [did](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9juG_YLWBZQ).

Dino Girl Gauko,The comedy has fallen flat. It's like a competition to be weird and random now.
Dino Girl Gauko,"Does anyone else remember before adult swim was on the air, the time between Rocky & Bullwinkle ending at midnight and Jetsons on boomerang at 5(?)am was filled with hours of the cartoon network logo sitting in a desert scene.

Dino Girl Gauko,"i've been living with major depression and other mental health issues since i was ten, drug addiction since fourteen. i'm twenty nine now and the gifts of hilarity, amazement and inspiration provided by [adult swim] shows during some of those dark nights has very likely played a part in my decisions to refrain from suicide. thanks [adult swim], i owe ya several."
Dino Girl Gauko,"I remember the birth of our little Adult Swim like it was yesterday. Lazzo and the crew gathered the whole network into the photo studio studio deep inside of the Turner Mansion to explain that we were no longer just fighting against Disney and Nickelodeon for eyeballs. The Internet and the PlayStation were the new threat. And we had a new plan, thus Adult Swim was born.  

Super secret Easter egg!!! Pickup your ATHF Season One DVD set and look on the back cover. There's a graffiti tag on the brick wall that says ""Rx"" short for Ryan.

Dino Girl Gauko,"Probably the most epic Adult Swim moments for me:

Delocated, Season 3 finale and Series finale

Aizen's finger, his fucking finger! (Bleach Soul Society finale)

Aqua Teen series finale (honorable mention- the fake finale getting unconfirmed)

Harvey Birdman's finale

FullMetal Alchemist's penultimate episode (the first anime)

Rick and Morty when the alternate Ricks get revealed

Code Geass R1 finale

Venture Bros pre-season-6-special

Hellsing Ultimate premiere

Robot Chicken, where the chicken fights everybody

Frisky Dingo, when the annhilatrix goes off


It is a demographic I'm proud to have been in."
Dino Girl Gauko,Couldn't live without rick and Morty. Also pretty sad that they didn't give hellbenders their TV show but its still impressive what adult swim has done
Dino Girl Gauko,"Ah the days of rushing home from school so I could watch Sailor Moon, DBZ, Outlaw Star, Ronin Warriors, and Gundam Wing.

Then as I grew older, so did the network, introducing me to adult swim and Chrono Crusade, FMA, Evangelion, etc.

Here's to you guys for making late nights later and better!"
Dino Girl Gauko,Not a single mention of Robot Chicken? I am *disgusted*...
Dino Girl Gauko,"This is unrelated but I figured this is where you I could be helped.

29 here. Grew up loving SuperDaves and Adam Wests. Grew up with YTV.  Rugrats, Street Sharks, Mummies Alive, Biker Mice From Mars, Reboot, Beast Wars etc etc the list goes on.

You know what type of kid I am now.

Late night telethon.   Bondage puppets having sex during commercials. Some crippled head and his crippled buddies rich. I need names of these shows late at night..

Most importantly.. Some drab, dry humour from what I remember space cartoon.  A super famous StarShip Captain trapped on a planet with a weird day night cycle or something.  Anyone know the name?"
Dino Girl Gauko,"So I was watching the first night, in my parent's basement. I was 13. I recorded it and kept the tape for a long time - it might still be at my mom's house. 

SGC2C is 100% responsible for Adult Swim existing, no matter what the execs say. Dave Willis et al were responsible for the aesthetic of fucking with the audience. SGC2C did this for 2-3 seasons before Adult Swim existed. This informs an entire generation's idea of what comedy is. 

Without SG2C2 there would be no Tim and Eric. And no matter how you feel about Awesome Show or TGTTM, you cannot deny that those dudes have had an enormous impact on comedy in the 21st century. 

And let's not forget The Eric Andre Show, directly influenced by SGC2C and produced by Tim and Eric's production company, which has been huge during this election cycle. 

AND - perhaps the biggest Adult Swim-related ""political"" guy of all - Vic Berger, a former editor for Awesome Show. 

Somewhat unrelated but just as influential are dudes like Jon Benjamin and Brendan Small. Both have continued to make a huge impact on modern comedy since Adult Swim started. 

There's also David Wain/Paul Scheer's crew - NTSF:SD:SUV, Children's Hospital, Newsreaders, etc. All those guys were successful before, but Adult Swim gave them the freedom to do their own shows. 

And of course, there's Morel Orel which is the reason Rick and Morty exists. 

(Also it ""saved"" Family Guy but who gives a shit, we're talking about comedy) 

TL;dr: Adult Swim is most likely why you are laughing today"

Singapore Social,Zerozerozero gets my vote.
Singapore Social,"I agree! I can't think of anything noteworthy in domestic - was keen on The Undoing but it's not good at all. 

I May Destroy You is a close second! I haven't watched My Brilliant Friend or Patria though"
Singapore Social,"Industry, fam. Industry.

Nothing like working yourself to the bone for venture and investment capitalists, in Present Day, England."
Singapore Social,"Yeah I’ve actually enjoyed some of the domestic series like Perry Mason, Lovecraft Country, and A Plot Against America but they weren’t really great series like their international series were. The New Pope and I Know This Much Is True were also great imo. HBO just spoiled us last year with Chernobyl, Watchmen, and Succession all those series were excellent."
Singapore Social,Watched the first episode Monday and I’m absolutely in on it. Hopefully the rest of the season is as good as that first episode.
Singapore Social,I really liked the first episode but why is it rated so poorly? Also I can't understand the technical aspect of it and wonder if it's just gibberish a la House
Nobodys Looking,It's really good. I really enjoyed the premise.
Nobodys Looking,I generally recommend it to folks who need a methadone show to recover from *The Good Place* addiction. :)  I'm just sad they only had the one season.
Nobodys Looking,Anecdotally it seems Portuguese fits in more words per minute than the average language. The subtitles are flying by far faster than I’m accustomed to. Great show though! Hopefully it comes back for a season two so the cliffhanger is resolved.

Nobodys Looking,I know this is unrelated but is nobody's looking cancelled or not?? Online keeps giving me conflicting information and I can't seem to find a reliable source
Nobodys Looking,"It's like the Good Place, Good Omens, and Better off Ted had an inexplicably cherry-haired love child.
Found it randomly last night and gave it a go on a whim. Ended up watching it all in one sitting and barely noticed the time pass. Even though it was like 4 am when I finished. This thing MOVES.

ETA: special shout out to the lead actor. I was expecting a standard issue goofy/ditzy manchild but was pleasantly surprised with a streak of smooth, chaotic good trickster."
Nobodys Looking,Might give it a watch. Thanks for the recommendation.
Nobodys Looking,Definitely going to give this a shot.
Nobodys Looking,"Just binged this, would have loved to see another season!"
Nobodys Looking,Just finished watching. I am hooked.
Nobodys Looking,"I just found it and Loved it! 

I thought they’re were going to carry on with the whole the angels are gone and the world is chaos thing for a whole season but it’s pretty fast paced."
Nobodys Looking,"Me too. It premiered, at least on US Netflix, a few months before the pandemic hit so it never stood a chance. So many great shows were cancelled with a knee jerk reaction throughout the beginning of 2020."
Nobodys Looking,Seriously this thing MOVES.
Nobodys Looking,"I got to watch that series as it aired back in the day, and it was far and away my favorite shows at the time, for its entire run. It was incredibly well-written, directed, and filmed. It even had one of my favorite theme songs of all time.  I'm glad you managed to stumble across it and are enjoying it as well."
Nobodys Looking,"Mick Belker ruthlessly grilling some random scumbag ... phone rings ... ""Hi Mom"""
Nobodys Looking,"If you liked *Hill Street Blues*, you should look up *Homicide: Life on the Street* (1993-1999).  Similar premise, a little newer, and set in Baltimore.  Huge cast of characters, so many familiar faces... highly recommended."
Nobodys Looking,"NPR did a nice piece on this [about ten years ago](https://www.npr.org/2014/05/08/310742743/lets-be-careful-out-there-the-legacy-of-hill-street-blues).

Let's be careful out there."
Nobodys Looking,One of the first non-soaps to have storylines carry from episode to episode
Nobodys Looking,Animal influenced me greatly.
Nobodys Looking,"I'll just address two things about the show. First, I think it was the funniest show on American TV from the time it came on until Cheers arrived about 18 months later. Part of that is that sitcoms were dominated by the dying years of the 70s classics, but it was a darned funny show that could delay a payoff through several episodes.

Second, this show is the rock that established NBC for quality combined with ratings for the next 20 years. It sat with no help at all around it, earning respectable ratings then providing some cover for Cheers. By the time The Cosby Show came, NBC Thursday nights was holding its own, and Hill Street was the destination show.

Best drama Emmy, four straight years."
Nobodys Looking,The theme is definitely comfy. I'm very happy to hear that it continues being good.
Nobodys Looking,I lol'd at that. I'm really impressed by the humor... Mark of a good drama when it can balance heavy stuff with funny moments.
Nobodys Looking,I'm going to legit check that out when I'm done with HSB. Thanks.
Nobodys Looking,"Wow, seeing writers/creators also being involved with Deadwood and Twin Peaks blows my mind."
Nobodys Looking,"Whew, this is gonna be a ride then. Seven seasons with a traditional episode count would normally have me feeling overwhelmed but the positive posts here have me excited."
Nobodys Looking,I'm a fan of many of those writers and didn't realize they were involved. It was like a crime fiction training ground for a whole generation.
Nobodys Looking,Everyone knows that Euphoria has top tier visuals and cinematography but shit storylines
Nobodys Looking,I'm not saying it's a great show. But its an entertaining show.
Nobodys Looking,"> the dialogue half the time is simply embarrassing. Cringe-worthy even when these people talk like they’re in a sex comedy like Superbad or something.

I agree that the dialogue is cringe-worthy, but funny enough, I think it's the most realistic part of the series and the part that reminds me most of high school. lol.

> it’s hard to ignore these are 20-something’s meant to be high school kids.

You don't watch many shows set in high school do you? That's pretty much the case for almost all of them."
Nobodys Looking,"As far as I'm concerned Euphoria is a horror series. I'm not saying its realistic, but viewing the series as if this could all be really happening in teenagers lives is terrifying to me."
Nobodys Looking,"My favourite parts of Euphoria are the beginning segment of each episode, where she focuses on a single character and how they grew to become the way they are now. Those are fascinating. 

I loved season 1. Not a fan of season 2."
Nobodys Looking,The way this show deals with addiction is so on point.
Nobodys Looking,"I won’t try to defend it to anyone else, but I absolutely love Euphoria. 

There probably are legitimate flaws in the show, but I found myself too entertained to care"
Nobodys Looking,"Honestly, as a zoomer that was in school from 2014-2018, the dialogue is more realistic than you think.

Edit: wtf, why am I getting downvoted??"
Nobodys Looking,"If nothing else, just watch the 2 special episodes focusing on just Rue / Jules. Amazing acting and dialog."
Nobodys Looking,It's not perfect but it's entertaining. Some episodes are genuinely incredible though. Season 2 Episode 5 deserves all the awards. Can't wait for you to get there.
Nobodys Looking,"I think Sam Levinson is much stronger as a director than as a writer. He has such a strong sense of atmosphere and tone, and his visual style is great. But a lot of the writing is a mess at best and kind of gross at worst.

I'd say the real standout of the series is the stuff about addiction. I've found a lot of that to be really well done and honest. As an addict myself it all feels really authentic and unflinching. I think it's one of the best and most honest depictions of addiction in media that I've ever seen.

So it's a really shame that it exits among some real cringe dialogue, messy storytelling, and some pretty questionable character writing."
Nobodys Looking,"Levinson and the cinematographer Rev have great eyes for aesthetics, but Levinson can’t write for shit and refuses to collaborate with anyone for the most part. The result is a really unbalanced prioritization of form over content in a show that seems to need more substantial dialogue because of the storylines it attempts to tackle. Everything always feels just a little unfinished. I think you’re right, weird is a good way to describe it. Not bad, and I watch the show myself, but it’s def weird"
Nobodys Looking,"I cut out partway through season 1. It has its moments, but I just started feeling depressed by it, so I quit it. Maybe I'm just too old. The high schoolers played by adults didn't bother me, that's just TV as far as I'm concerned. For me it was the self destruction. It was like watching Requiem for a Dream in slo mo. Not for me."
Nobodys Looking,"Man, maybe I'm crazy but I saw a lot of affluent kids I went to high school with acting a lot like these characters and quite a few that I was like ""whoa, that's way too similar""."
Nobodys Looking,"Skins did it better. Mix of self-aware camp and genuine heartfelt moments. 

Series 1 and 2 shaped a lot of Brits in school at the time, myself included."
Nobodys Looking,"The porn aspect of it I could leave but the styling and the soundtrack and some of the themes ie: drug addiction had me stay all the way.

And again the soundtrack 👨🏾‍🍳💋"
Nobodys Looking,"Euphoria is a CW tier show with HBO production values. If it wasn’t for Zendaya, it would be getting blasted for being the pretentious, exploitative garbage that it is."
Nobodys Looking,"I watched 3 episodes. I felt no motivation to root for any of the characters. I did not care what any of them did next, or how their story was going to continue. Literally everyone was a bad person in some way or another. So I just stopped."
Nobodys Looking,i also just watch it for the awesome aesthetic and soundtrack
Nobodys Looking,"Just watch Skins. It doesn't take it self seriously (for the most part), it's very funny and all the characters are compelling to watch (besides a few). The best part is that there's a complete cast change over every two seasons so it doesn't get stale."
Nobodys Looking,"I really struggled with this as a former heroin addict. I've watched plenty of shows about drugs with zero problem, but something about it just made me feel really uncomfortable. I watched 2 episodes and just don't have any desire to watch any more. Maybe it's just different once you've lived that life, it's just not interesting. I don't know."
Nobodys Looking,"It’s certainly not attempting to be a realistic or necessarily relatable depiction of high school.  But that’s kinda true for a lot of the shows that have captured the teen zeitgeist for various generations like 90210, Dawson’s Creek, The OC, or Gossip Girl.  The characters on these shows don’t talk like actual high schoolers, but they do speak to them.  
  
I honestly can’t tell if I’m watching something good or bad.  Just the fact that it’s an HBO drama makes me think it’s supposed to be deep or smart, but it’s not really.  It’s very watchable though."
Nobodys Looking,"Setting the show in community college would have made so much more sense, you would have reasons for all the characters to be together and even living at home like high school."
Nobodys Looking,"I couldn't get past the first episode. I get it, super edgy with the sex and drugs, but having all the teens go to a big party where the drama happens felt so cliched like an 80s movie

Isn't it about time to have a show about Generation Z that really feels like this current generation?"
Nobodys Looking,"The director is a very good director but a horrible writer.

And I agree a 100% that it should've been set in college. People in college are still young and still do stupid shit. Setting it in highschool is weird as fuck, and pretty disgusting too."
Nobodys Looking,"The show just feels like an excuse to see Sydney Sweeney's tits which is fine but the rest of the ""this is good TV"" just feels like cope."
Nobodys Looking,"In my mind, it's someone looking back at their years in high school... so it's through the lens of that perspective. No high school is really like that. There are no teachers, it's drugs and sex and stuff. 

I mean, there's a drug dealer kid who is 11 years old and has face tattoos. I feel like that's someone looking back at high school, knowing a drug dealer, and are telling us that 'he was so young... and had face tattoos...' But in reality, that 11 year old was really 23 and had a neck tattoo, etc. It's a heightened remembrance of what can a wild time in one's life... but not a realistic depiction of a modern high school experience."
Nobodys Looking,I couldn't get through any of it. I hate seeing kids being self-destructive. The first episode was just too depressing and I couldn't engage with any more of it. My wife watched it and I played video games.
Nobodys Looking,"Just based on me reading about it and what people have told me, I stood away. Just from the outside looking in you can tell they made it sex heavy even though this is based on highschool. It’s weird, I know people are sexually active in high school but I can tell they just took it to another level. 

Just not realistic enough and someone told me it’s like soft core porn which is weird since it’s supposed to be about highschool. I’m sure they overdid it with the drugs too. I have HBO and haven’t even bothered"
Nobodys Looking,Yeah because conversations and logic is very thought provoking and mature in high school.
Nobodys Looking,i would say high schoolers nowadays maybe are talking and looking like college kids.
Nobodys Looking,">it’s hard to ignore these are 20-something’s meant to be high school kids.

hate this trend recently. cast actual teen actors as teens."
Nobodys Looking,Right. I’m very conflicted with season 1. Why is it so damn dark & sexual… very much celebrating how twisted and perverse the show is. Series does look stunning though😂👍
Nobodys Looking,Watch a show about young people who think they invented fucking?  no thanks
Nobodys Looking,Nothing about this show makes me want to watch it. Why would you keep it going with it
Nobodys Looking,"It's just the instagram of TV. Looks great, completely shallow and has the intellectual substance of a teenager."
Nobodys Looking,"I like it. Haven’t watched the second season yet.

The standalone episode with Zandaya and her sponsor is excellent."
Nobodys Looking,"I said it before I’ll say it again it’s just a higher budget and more artsy Riverdale (when it was like somewhat grounded). 

The entire show seems like it was created by a film student trying desperately to make an impression and show they’re not like other students so they try to make the most edgy thing ever (not sure if this makes any sense but whatever)

The dialogue tries way to hard to be realistic and bantery that it just comes off as really shitty.

“That’s the definition of black mail”

“Oklahoma”

Like bro really lmao


Also the high school thing doesn’t annoy me. Look at most movies from 90s/2000s. They got 20/30 year olds playing high schoolers. Liz Allen access in Spider-Man Homecoming was like 28 when the movie came out haha"
Nobodys Looking,it only gets worse. I actually really liked season 1 but season 2 gets so far up its own ass and it feels like nothing happens
Nobodys Looking,The show is run by some... questionable people.
Nobodys Looking,"I think it's a fun experience. The cinematography and music are amazing. But I agree on the characters.


Honestly, I think it's just best to suspend some belief on how high schoolers act  and look."
Nobodys Looking,"Honestly I was so disappointed with this show. Actors and visuals are good however the storyline didn’t appeal to me. It’s trying so hard to be edgy but it’s just show about teenagers, sex and drug addcits but in the nice coat. Not my cup of tea, can’t get through season 1."
Nobodys Looking,"I watched one or two episodes and it was too far from what I was expecting. Didn’t feel like a high school show at all with the wild parties and felt much more like college to me. 

Now that you point it out it’s very weird it’s not a college show instead of high school."
Nobodys Looking,It's Trauma Porn
Nobodys Looking,"This show is exhibit A why most nudity/sex on tv adds nothing to the plot, much better show when they cut it down."
Nobodys Looking,"An adult making the conscious decision to sit down and write a tv series about the wild, drug-fueled sex lives of teenagers is a little weird, to put it lightly"
Nobodys Looking,"I tried to watch the show, but I got about 20 minutes in and realised I was bored, this show is not for me."
Nobodys Looking,First episode? Ok bruh
Nobodys Looking,This show is all style and no substance. None of the characters are believable and every actor bar Zendaya are pretty bad. This show is a massive cringe fest.
Nobodys Looking,I never get shows where all the “friends” seem to hate each other and act really shitty to each other the entire time. Like why do y’all hang out?
Nobodys Looking,"I have a few problems with the show, but my biggest gripe is how over the top it is and how many youngish people claim they can relate to the plot points. 

I’m in my 30s - I’m not that old. I can recall my very average, suburban high school experience pretty well - people died, people did drugs, people had sex. It all happens. 

The drama that happens to this small group of people inside of a week wouldn’t happen to my collective high school of 1200 students in an entire year. This shit is too off the wall."
Nobodys Looking,"The actress that plays Maddy, Alexa Demi, was 28 in the first season. Its way too much of an age gap, as she is playing a 17 year old."
Nobodys Looking,"It is a modern day extremely high budgeted gossip girl, just way too depressing."
Nobodys Looking,I think it's weird people want to watch a show about teenagers having sex...pedo vibes
Nobodys Looking,One episode in??? Boy are you in for a wild ride. The plot gets so nonsensical at multiple points that it feels like you're watching a Mexican novela with a massive budget and Zendaya giving herself max screentime since she's a producer.
Nobodys Looking,"Just some teenage garbage, mixed with unrealistic storylines, boring characters and events. It was watchable during the first season until it turned into a stupid sex torture fairy tale, full of unnecessary drama. I quit by the first episode of the second season, i've had enough cringing already. Music and direction probably were the only good things about the show."
Nobodys Looking,"Great visuals, its trash druggie porn otherwise."
Nobodys Looking,Euphoria is for getting high and enjoying the cinematography and soundtrack. We’re not here for storylines and dialogue
Nobodys Looking,It's what happens when you put lipstick on a pig. It's pretty enjoyable tho.
Nobodys Looking,"Ok let’s take a show based on actual high schoolers. Like a dawsons creek for example. It’s not quite on the same level but I see euphoria as a satire of that. 

I love euphoria and will go to my grave defending it. Also guess what … ITS FICTION. So it doesn’t even have to be realistic !? Crazy"
Nobodys Looking,"As far as why it's set in high school and not college, I read something once that made it make so much sense. you can get the audience to relate more to the show because almost everyone goes to high school, but not everyone goes to college. Its easier to have the audience to relate to high school related tropes and all that"
Nobodys Looking,Bro watched one episode and wrote a review lol
Nobodys Looking,It was written by a pedophile
Nobodys Looking,My sister is forcing me to watch this show but I don't want to because I know it's gonna stress me out because I dated a girl like Cassie.
Nobodys Looking,bad show
Nobodys Looking,overhated
Nobodys Looking,That's why it's so fucking fun.
Nobodys Looking,">Cringe-worthy even when these people talk like they’re in a sex comedy like Superbad or something.

That's not even remotely true.  It makes me question whether or not you even bothered to watch the show or if you're just bored in life and are doing some weak trolling.

>but damn it’s hard to ignore these are 20-something’s meant to be high school kids.

Considering every TV show or movie out of Hollywood uses 20 somethings to play teenagers (with the exception of The Disney Channel), now I know you're trolling."
Nobodys Looking,"Sometimes I would find that airing in HBO but I never managed to watch more than five minutes. And the few minutes that I could withstand were usually “musical numbers”, so they really didn’t need a plot to work. 

The dialogue itself is so bizarre that I don’t even know what the show is all about. Maybe it’s about nothing, who knows…"
Nobodys Looking,Ohh.. I think we both think about different ... Euphoria... \*zips\* well see ya next time.
Nobodys Looking,"I felt the same but kept watching. Realized Season 1 makes sense as a show portraying teens as they see themselves. It's a lot of posturing and speaking with authority in a nonsense language about things you know nothing about. Or sometimes you do, but you probably shouldn't if the world was a more decent place. Those who start out naive learn about the things they think they're in control of and it does not go to plan. It's exaggerated, it's campy, but a lot of the things happening are actually happening with young people and I think their being in high school is meant to make us very uncomfortable about that. I think the first season did a really good job of showing some of the real horrors of being that age and showing the kind of predators that are out there, and just how hard it can be to deal with the confusing space between being a kid and being an adult. The acting saves a lot of its shortcomings. I think the people playing these characters care more about them than their creators. 

Season 2 has a little of what made Season 1 work, but they lose the line between exploration and exploitation, with a lot of questionable choices, bad stereotypes, and making cheap excuses for some of their characters. I've heard some gossip about the show's creator/behind the scenes environment, and it seems like season 1 having any redeeming qualities happened in spite of itself. Maybe I'm giving it too generous a read. I'll probably drop it, but still really like the characters and actors"
Nobodys Looking,As a parent I was grateful to watch this show because it showed some very real things that teenagers deal with. That said it was a difficult watch. But Zendaya absolutely crushes it. The relationship between her and her sister broke my heart (speaking as a big sister).
Nobodys Looking,"I've always felt like it's literally just two shows in one: there's Rue's struggle with addiction and relationships, and then there's the insane highschool drama with all the other characters. These plot threads usually carry on entirely separately, especially in season 2 with an occasion plot contrivance to force them together for an episode or so. 

I really like Rue's show. Zendaya is really really good in this role and her internal monologue is pretty entertaining. The show is very clear about how much damage her addiction is doing to herself and her loved ones as well as the mental struggles and alienation she feels that leads her to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. 

The other show is basically a meme and has very little direction. There is some attempt to relate them together with the theme that all the character's are ""addicted"" to things that cause them harm but the characters don't really act anything like highschoolers so it just feels like endless pointless drama."

I don’t really have a saga now, but I would kill for mammoth-budget series set in the worlds of Jurassic Park (more faithful to the darker novel than the movie), Terminator (this would entirely depend on nailing the showrunner, directors, and cast tho), The Abyss, and Blade Runner (I know Amazon is doing that, we’ll see how that turns out). 

A couple Paul Verhoven movies like Robocop, Total Recall, and, like you said, Starship Troopers may actually lend themselves better to an extended miniseries format than a two-hour movie. To do right they would require insane budgets that only Apple and Amazon can really afford tho.

individual novels I’d love to see done right in a limited series that would require a huge budget are World War Z, Gravity’s Rainbow (Thomas Pychon), and The Island of Dr. Moreau (a proper adaptation, not whatever the hell the Brando thing is).

The Sparrow and Dark Matter also, but those are already in development at FX and Apple, respectively.

Lastly, Amazon needs to get moving on Mass Effect w/ Henry Cavill. It’ll happen one day cuz video game adaptations are pretty much guaranteed hits as long as they’re decent, but I want it soon lol."

However, that team did such a phenomenal job creating an engaging, nuanced story with stunning animation that it's now one of my favorite things. I've watched the whole thing through several times. Everyone I recommend it to comes back raving about it. 

Good writers take the shakiest of IP and make it something worth being excited about."

Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"Attack on titan. Let's be real, Hollywood is already trying to make an adaptation and while more money doesn't necessarily mean more good, they can at least give us good visuals and cgi, especially since doing the titans and odm gear cannot be cheap.

Also the upcoming Death Note series from Netflix. It's a good thing they opted for a TV series rather than trying to shove an entire series into a poorly made, cringe-inducing, straight-to-DVD looking movie. Haha nope. Netflix never made a death note movie. There was no Netflix death note movie. *there was no Netflix death note movie*. -Denial intensifies-"

Narcoworld: Dope Stories,The pilot Amazon did is meant to be very faithful to Wizard and Glass.

Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching.

Narcoworld: Dope Stories,This is the most pretentious shit I’ve ever seen.
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"I’ve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I’ve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I’m intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."

EDIT: Okay just realized entry number 3 is actually Squid Game."
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"Okay, I have some specific praises to give that may make this list make a little bit more sense.

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,Yellowjackets?
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Narcoworld: Dope Stories,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."

Dolly Partons Heartstrings,That’s better.
Dolly Partons Heartstrings,"It's an anthology series with each episode loosely based on one of Dolly Parton's songs. She also stars and they work in some singing.

This review isn't entirely complimentary, remarking that the episodes can be bloated and predictable, similar in tone to Hallmark/Lifetime content. The ones I've seen are goodhearted and gentle, which has its place. It's easy to pick up and watch any episode in any order. 

It's not for anyone who doesn't at least mildly enjoy Dolly, and people need to be able to tolerate above average wholesomeness.

Rated TV-14"

Dolly Partons Heartstrings,"I really enjoyed this series, I just had to suspend my jadedness and allow the wholesome sentiments to roll over me. It’s a fantasy, relax and enjoy it. The first episode was the weakest."
Dolly Partons Heartstrings,Disappointing. Here's hoping *Scenes from an Italian Restaurant* will turn out better.

I'm glad for this warning.  I can only tolerate below average wholesomeness."
Dolly Partons Heartstrings,"Ha! Maybe in your face wholesome? I was going to call it saccharine but that has negative connotations that I don't think is deserved. The first episode, Jolene, has themes of marital cheating and ""promiscuous"" behavior, but with a happy ending."

Their prestige shows started losing the acclamation, and they began green-lighting a lot of bad projects.

Dolly Partons Heartstrings,"Netflix shows have been on a downward trend for a long time. Even the 2015 list is mostly mediocre tv shows with low budgets, cheap sets and bad lighting. They gained buzz early on by making a small amount of high quality tv shows, but as they expanded the amount of shows they've been making, the quality has been dropping off. They dont care anymore as they have enough people to watch their mediocre shows. 

Even more shows like The Witcher, which I did really like, they messed up by rushing through the storylines and having poor writing. They could have been great, but as other services start to compete, they will start losing subscriptions. Netflix's strength is in the shows that they license."
Dolly Partons Heartstrings,"Lot easier to have a lot more buzz when there were less shows in general. 

In 2019 they are competing with themselves, with other platforms. 

There's a new show every other week now, you can't maintain high buzz levels on everything. And not all shows are designed to get high buzz."

And they will probably continue it bcoz I know for sure that it will be more successful than the other Turkish series on Netflix."
Mortel,"“Dark” is by far the best foreign tv show I’ve ever watched and is definitely one of my favourites. It’s on Netflix and is German, there are 2 seasons and expecting a third"
Mortel,"There are tons of non american shows I enjoyed, for example Les Revenants (French), Yellow Peppers, Shtisel (from israel) Polseres Vermelles (catalan) or Kingdom (the only korean show i ever tried). Im gonna try Atiye after i finished s2 of You."
Mortel,"I could easily say that the gift is the second best Turkish tv series ever, I hope second season comes asap.  For the best Turkish tv series, look up for Şahsiyet you won’t regret"
Mortel,We should create a subreddit named Atiye
Mortel,"I saw it in my recommendations and was thinking about giving it a try. The premise seemed to be interesting. 

I would like to ask some questions if you don’t mind.

1) If you had to compare the show, which other show would you pick?

2) What genre/genres you would put the show in?

I would recommend Trapped, Black Spot, Diablero, Kingdom, La Mante, Bordertown, Stranger, Signal and Border.

Trapped, Black Spot and Bordertown are Scandanivian mysteries. With Black Spot having bit of supernatural stuff going on.

Kingdom is a Korean zombie TV show. Signal and Stranger are korean mysteries. 

Border is a supernatural Japanese detective TV show."
Mortel,I was thinking about trying this.
Mortel,Season 2 is in production
Mortel,"Finished it.

It’s... okay I guess. The main character (Atiye) has the Mary Sue syndrom where everything happens to her, the whole destiny and all. The first episodes were also a bit frustrating to watch because she’s extremely passive to her family who basically control her life and she barely does anything about it. Like, there is even a case of sexual assault and it’s completely ignored. 

And my last annoyance: the first minutes of the first episode. There’s a funeral. Then the title sequence, and we’re suddenly elsewhere like if the first scene never happened. This is never addressed nor acknowledged from the entire season. Once the season has been watched it’s possible to come up with theories and whatnot, but it’s frustrating to be so instantly teased with the possibility to never have closure on that because we all know Netflix loves to cancel series. So not only we have to deal with the Netflix cliché end season cliffhanger because god forbid writing a conclusion, but we *also* have to deal with a cliffhanger from the very first scene for the entire season lol. smh.

But it’s still interesting to watch nonetheless. I don’t regret at all."
Mortel,Found Dark (German) was really well done - I recently finished the Stranded (Thai) on Netflix which also was impressive. Definitely waiting for new seasons for these shows.
Mortel,Busy binge watching it now. Pretty awesome!
Mortel,"Gomorra: La Serie is a great show concerning various gangs in around Naples, Italy. Realistic and based on the book of the same name about the Italian crime epidemic."
Mortel,Quite honestly... I didn't like the show. Good acting and production quality. But the plot was contrived af. Typical TV show plot and tropes. Reminded me of some Brazilian soap operas. Bad rich guy good poor girl mentality. Not a bad show by any means but for most people there are 100 other netflix shows they can watch instead.
Mortel,"Can we talk about how the symbol at the end is different from the symbol throughout the show? The main character looks more shocked by this than her sister being alive again. 

What about Atiye's funeral at the beginning of episode 1?

Also, i'm wondering if there is a deeper meaning for the cross-promotional marketing with the Witcher, considering in the witcher universe, there is an event named the Conjunction of Spheres involving merging of dimensions, kinda similar to what happens in Atiye. Wacky theory, what if Atiye actually caused that conjunction? lol"
Mortel,"Yes, Turkish shows are fantastic!"
Mortel,Thanks for this post! I have a backlog of some other international originals so I’ll ad this one to the list :)
Mortel,[deleted]
Mortel,Actually they filmed first two seasons together so i assume that we won't wait that much for second season.
Mortel,"I really liked it. Can't wait for the 2nd series.

I'm amazed at how many people come into any posts, like this, where someone likes a show, just to try to stir the post up by saying how horrible they think it was & complain about how they had to watch it. If you don't like it, don't comment & you sure don't have to watch it. Geez."
Mortel,I recommend *Marianne* and *Mortel* (France).
Mortel,I just started watching this about fifteen minutes ago. Please tell me the English dubs get better? I would so rather hear the original and read subtitles instead of... whatever this is.
Mortel,Turkish shows are not so good. There are couple of them which are good. Like Şahsiyet or Ezel. They may not be available on Netflix.
Mortel,"Give a try ""Masum"" as well.

 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6478318/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6478318/)"
Mortel,"I also binged in a day, and now am sad I have to wait so long for season 2."
Mortel,I binge a day watching the whole season today. Love it
Mortel,Just binged it in a day. Loved it.
Mortel,Black Spot (Zone Blanche) is a phenomenal French crime/supernatural elements show. And Alta Mar (High Seas) is a great crime/supernatural elements Spanish show. Both can be found on Netflix!
Mortel,Black spot is another goodie
Mortel,Amazing show. I binged the whole season. Can't wait to binge the second one.
Mortel,"Same I just binged the whole show yesterday! So worth it, great performance, cinematography, story line!"
Mortel,"i also watched Ares this weekend, it’s Dutch. i enjoyed it."
Mortel,I just binged this show yesterday and was surprised that it did not have it's own reddit yet. I really enjoyed it. Was acted pretty perfectly and ticked all the boxes when it comes to the plots I like :) Wondering if it will get a season 2 or if they are leaving it with that ending.
Mortel,LOVED this. I was so intrigued at its depth and I'm still laughing every time I ponder the final scene. I can barely wait to see where they go with this.
Mortel,"It leaves a lot of loose ends, but doesn’t seem like there’s enough remaining substance for another season; I wonder if this is where the book it’s based on ended, or if there is more.. 🤔"
Mortel,[deleted]
Mortel,The I.T. Crowd is quite hilarious!!
Mortel,"This post and half of the positive comments here must be paid shills from gift marketing department. Other half is probably nationalist Turks. 

Honestly The show sucked. Boring plot and pace. And why the hell this show was so dark ? I put my brightness to full still I couldn’t make out what I was watching

Hakan was bad too. Sahsiyet is good tho"
Mortel,Can somebody explain to me why a wealthy business man can insult and order police forces/ everybody like that in the wild? I really don’t understand it and make a lot of noise to me.
Mortel,"Anyone know where Atye’s forest home is located? Or better yet, anyone have a URL link to the house? I’ve been trying to find it online"
Mortel,"Anyone know where Atye’s forest home is located in season 3? Or better yet, anyone have a URL link to the house? I’ve been trying to find it online"
Mortel,"Where did you watch Sahsiyet? I looked all the usual streaming sites Netflix, Hulu, Prime, etc and could not find it there."
Mortel,"Did you guys notice Dark and The Gift/Atiye have the same ominous ""bbrrrraaaaaam"" sound when something spooky is happening? Like it's the same note and duration. 

It made me feel like I was watching the same show lol. That said, both are very excellent."
Mortel,I can't wait for season 3. Such a great show.
Mortel,"I think if more Korean (and Chinese) shows condensed their episode count down like Kingdom and Stranger did they'd probably get more international success. They have loads of shows that would be as highly regarded if they didn't keep turning stories that should be 10-20 episodes into 30-60+ episode slog fests. Of course, they might not care about international success and perhaps the Korean and Chinese people prefer massive episode counts for all i know.

Stranger was the first Asian drama i'd seen, was a little weird at first getting used to the quirkyness but once past that it sent me down the rabbit hole that is Viki over the past couple of years."
Mortel,"This show is just fun, campy, and well produced.

Acting and cinematography are good too, but the writing is sub par in my opinion.

Think of it like the TV show version of Da Vinci Code. It's exactly that.

I am a huge fan of the Nordic Noir genre (like the shows you listed) but this show is no where like those shows."
Mortel,"Hey! I say definitely check it out.

To answer your questions:
1) If the da vinci code was a series - I'd compare it to that for sure. It's got some history, mystery etc.
2) Sci fi, International

Thank you for the recos ♡

Btw Money Heist was RLY good."
Mortel,"This is a great list thank you, I just finished Vagabond and will probably start Stranger or kingdom but I’m not really into zombie stuff but I’ve been hearing a lot of good stuff about it."
Mortel,We apparently have identical taste lol. All great shows!!
Mortel,"1. Probably The Protector, since it was the first Turkish Netflix show. The Gift is definitely SO much better than The Protector. Everything about it is much much better. They both have that kind of mysterious, fantastic vibe but It kinda bores you in The Protector. But I never got bored in The Gift. I binged the whole season and I don't regret it.
2. Fantastic, mystery, thriller (maybe)"
Mortel,Maybe it was another timeline that she somehow stops and changes lol
Mortel,She's not a Mary Sue.
Mortel,"I'm glad that I found someone who thinks the same as me. I thought there were waaaaay to many typical tropes, so much so that by the whole way through I could pretty much predict what was going to happen. Not a bad show, but nothing amazingly memorable, if anything The Protector (or at least season 1, season 2 was terrible imo) was a bit more gripping.

To give some examples: Crazy old woman with a mystic edge.
A useless boyfriend (Ozan) who haplessly runs around being useless.
Seemingly normal businessman who about 5 minutes in is clear that he is not all he's set out to be (Serdar).
Indiana Jones (Erhan).
And this is just the none spoiler tropes."
Mortel,Yes! Started really well and then it just fell apart into a  boring melodrama - it tried to tie it together in the last episode but it really couldn’t do it
Mortel,"Same feeling  
Just completed it with multiple 10 sec skips in later eps. It got pretty boring halfway through - like the whole cave sequence with Atiye and her memories.
To top that, they introduced this ""alternate reality"" before even completely explaining what's already going on. Revealed too little to keep me interested. The plot is very interesting but probably won't be watching the second season.
Not even sure if this is a fantasy or a scifi show."
Mortel,Watching anything without subtitles is a mistake. Dubs are for people who can't read.
Mortel,"I get used to the dubs as it goes. The dubs & the subs don't match at all on parts of this, I just keeps subs on all the time, as my hearing doesn't always catch the dialogue, so sometimes & I am listening & reading. Some of the subs & dubs show that they did not use native english first language speaking & it's pretty funny how they conflict. 

I know on some shows the subs change if you put it into native language rather than dubs. Dark is one example of that."
Mortel,"Okay yeah I can't watch this. Omfg. I don't mind the slowness and the story is interesting. The acting is alright. These English dubs are unbearable, seriously. All of the voices sound the exact same, maybe with the pitch changed ever so slightly. Like imagine every white basic bitch you've ever met and that's what these voice overs sound like. I was going to try and mute it and turn on subtitles but I would still hear their cringy droning. Good luck to any who decide to watch this, hope it works out for your ears."
Mortel,"LOL this one def was!
Super provocative scenes as well."
Mortel,"Turkey is the biggest exporter of non-English tv shows in the world. So, saying they are usually not good is objectively not true."
Mortel,"As a Turk who doesn't watch any Turkish TV I could say that they do have good stuff once in a while but most of the mainstream stuff are the same thing because all of them follow the same popular thing (ottomans, mafia stuff, rich guy/girl and poor guy/girl love story.). But there are some good ones like Ezel, Şahsiyet, Muhteşem Yüzyıl(the first ottoman tv show) and there are couple of more others but I think i like them because I can understand the plot and jokes around the culture so I won't recommend them."
Mortel,"Most Turkish shows on Netflix aren’t good, but in general on tv they are actually not that bad."
Mortel,"If you like that you should check out Muhteşem Yüzyıl it is about Suleiman the Magnificent it doesn't have the ""bad"" fighting scenes of Ertuğrul but It has a better story. If you are interested in fights you can check out Fetih 1453 it is a movie about the Fall of Constantinople."
Mortel,"
>positive comments here must be paid shills from gift marketing department. Other half is probably nationalist Turks

You are actually insane lol sheesh"
Mortel,You can definitely watch Şahsiyet entirely free on the original publisher Puhutv website with english or german subs on every quality out there friend. I liked the show as well.
Mortel,Wlext 😬
Mortel,BluTv
Mortel,"Growing up in a household that watched a ton of Chinese drama, gotta say, they definitely love drawing things out. It's def a cultural thing.

Kingdom was amazing and will def check out Stranger! 

Thanks so much"
Mortel,"You're right, the 20 episode treshold is a good indicator. If you're lucky the 60 episode ones have a recap at the start of the episode and you can check in every 5 episodes and you don't miss a thing.

There are a few exceptions like San Guo (Three Kingdoms) of 2010 where most of the 95 episodes were worth watching.

Spanish language telenovelas have the same problem. The numerous problems with aunties, grannies and/or evil mother-in-laws take up 25-33% of screentime and often they're just a waste of time to get you angry..."
Mortel,"Yeah. The setting and political intrigue makes it was better. Also, season 2 is coming."
Mortel,Lol. Can you suggest me something that I missed?
Mortel,"It was really really easy to predict what would happen next. SPOILERS:

When Erham kicked over the box of his father's belongings my GF and I instantly knew that he would fine another clue. The bee landing on the grave stone being another to open the secret box. Everything was just really predictable...but I still enjoyed it, and Turkish is a beautifu language I've never heard."
Mortel,Or people who do other things without constantly keeping their eyes on the screen. I crochet a lot when I watch tv.
Mortel,"The dubs of the trailer felt like every female character was dubbed by a single woman. It is just that bad, and seems rushed. Original language is actually quite good."
Mortel,Why don't you watch it in Turkish with subtitles? It was default for me.
Mortel,A 2 hour long episode filled with nothing is good? Just because everyone watch it doesn't mean it's good.
Mortel,"Dark, Bron, Babylon Berlin, Wild District, Fauda, The Break, Sacred Games, Bodyguard, Nobel, Suburra, Case, Hinterland. This could go on and on with a shows I enjoyed but here’s some maybe u have caught or could"
Mortel,"Yeah even if it's in a language I speak natively, if I have no subtitles I get distracted. I feel ya."
Mortel,"I may try to do this. Like I said, the story is really interesting, my kinda thing for sure. I don't even understand why it defaulted to dubs. No other foreign films I've watched on netflix has before. I was bamboozled, I think."
Mortel,"It doesn't give me option of turkish audio. Only english, spanish, french, and german. I wonder why."
Mortel,Adamlar bilmiyo basmışlar downwotu. Bir türk olarak söylediğin şey o kadar doğru ki
Mortel,"Lol. We do have similar tastes. But unfortunately, in my country, Bron, Wild District, Nobel, Babylon Berlin and Case are not available. Though I have watched Bron. Bron is so good. Thanks for the recommendations. I will watch them via other means. Babylon Berlin has always been on my radar."
Mortel,"I'm like half way through and it's okay so far, a little slow but I do love archaeology/mystery type stuff so I'm hopeful"
Mortel,Just what I thought about dubs lol. In the dubbed trailer it seems like there is only one female vocal artist doing dubs for all female characters in the show. The original language is pretty decent.
Mortel,"That's so weird, I'm in the US and for me Turkish [original] and Turkish [audio description] are at the very bottom"
Mortel,Kalitesizliğe tamah ediyor aq milleti.
Mortel,"Enjoyed it quite a bit and the next season is soon. Couple others to check out are Dogs of Berlin, Mr Sunshine, Balthazar, sahsiyet, Marcella, Hinterland, Happy Valley, absentia, occupied, 3%, and warrior(kriger). Ok I’m done now lol"
Mortel,"Omg, i'm such an idiot. I'm on my phone and didn't see the option to scroll down. Your right it's at the very bottom. Thanks!"
Mortel,My backlog just got bigger. Thanks for all the recommendations.
Mortel,Second season of what?
Mortel,Babylon Berlin
Mortel,Ohh. Okay. Thanks. Thought it was only meant to have two seasons. Better get to it before it becomes a daunting task to even start it.
Mortel,Think it premieres end of January. Good luck and enjoy!
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"> Nobody has been convicted for the murder of Gregory. The killer, dubbed “The Raven”, has never been found 

Damn. The never got the killer. 

I will not put myself through watching it and then yelled at the tv cause there wasnt a resolution"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I get much the same creeps from watching Missing 411 videos on YouTube. Lots of stories of little kids gone missing in U.S. wilderness. Maybe searchers find their intact clothes neatly laid out a year later, miles away & up a mountainside."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,What’s with the downvotes???? Theses are literally comments made by a detective investigating the case.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I think the ginger girl (Murielle) has something to do with it. If not then shes the murderer you can see it in her eyes and her face. Great documentary. Feel so bad for Christine and Jean-Marie.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,They never got a conviction because the law was taken into his own hands.  It was clear who did it
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I’m watching it now.  The over dubbing from French to English , kind of ruins it .  The deliver of translation is monotonous  and lacking any inflection / intonations.  I simply wish it had better dubbing.  The story is horrific, heartbreaking, and  almost unimaginable ."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,[deleted]
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Mom did it so she could take a sexy selfie at the funeral.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"It's worth watching and there isn't zero resolution, by the end you kind of understand what happened and who was involved. The reason no one has been convicted was due to sheer incompetence by the people working the case. Especially the judge."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I think it’s worth watching the first episode just so you know the deal with ‘The Raven’. It’s sounds like the set-up to a mystery novel.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Oh man, you’ll kill the television when a certain detective pops up. Good lord."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"The mystery part isn't the main point of this series. You can kinda compare this case to OJ Simpsons' - it's obvious who did it, but prosecution and a weak, fame-hungry judge fucked up the case so badly it'll always be ""unsolved"" now. 

Article makes it seem like it's focused on murder and stalking, but show moves on from it after a couple of episodes(again, because mystery isn't that complicated) and focuses more on media circus and what it did to the family.  That's the true horror part, what this couple had to endure is absolutely insane."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I think it was Murielle AND LaRoche. I don't think it was ever disproved that she DIDN'T ride the bus that day, AND it was mentioned she got into a car. Also the insulin found matches that her mother is the only person in the family with diabetes. And Murielle described the firehouse where they thought the body was dumped. (I guess the officer drew the map of the village, but she drew the key points.) You're right that she always looked guilty in her eyes and face. Also I noticed a still frame when she found out LaRoche had been murdered by Jean-Marie, it was more than ""omg he's dead!"" It was like ""omg look at the consequences of our actions! That could be ME."" Also you know her sister was PISSED that she gave up her husband/Murielle's brother-in-law, hence retracting the statement in the first place.
LaRoche was also hiding at his aunt's(?) House in fear, AND granted I still have an episode to go, those two suspect drawings so far have been proven to not be false. And obviously he's a dead wringer for that suspect sketch. 
I feel like their entire family was not right in the head. (Murielle/LaRoche/his wife/his aunt). The Raven is utterly fucked up. 

The local garmanderie (?) was trying, but ill equipped to handle such a horrific case. The judge was a fucking JOKE!! Like, I don't even know where to begin with him. The federal police (from Nancy?) were too obsessed with Christine's looks...like that somehow implied her guilt because she was bangable?!?! Everything that spiraled from there was a complete and utter shit-show. 
I feel terrible for both Christine and Jean-Marie, but most importantly, GREGORY!! Omg he was so adorable. 

Finally, why was everyone involved named some sort of variation of jean/Jean-Marie/marie/etc?! 😩 I was so confused."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,You could just watch it in French with subtitles?.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I tried the dubbing first, but after hearing the monotone voice I decided I'm better off with French and subtitles instead."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"The police are completely inept, a 3-page report for the murder of a child? Great job France!"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Mec, je sais pas ce que t'as fumé mais j'ai jamais entendu quelqu'un dire que c'était de la faute des grands-parents."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Nothing points to that at all. The killer was alone and insane.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"It was that sweater. I was attracted to her wearing that sweater, so she must be guilty."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I live in the US.  We definitely have issues with prosecutorial misconduct and bad police work but my God some of the foreign documentaries I watch have the worst police work imaginable. It’s a literal joke. The press was running this investigation the judge was a fool.  It’s terrifying how bad they are at investigations.  
Don’t they have fingerprinting. No one ever mentions any attempt to get prints off of the letters…..find out where the paper was purchased or search homes for similar paper and envelopes. 
They just let reporters make shit up and run with it."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Certain detective?
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I know right i was confused with all the John-Marie and Jean-Marie it lost me a little but. I found it so bad that the police inspector was going on about christine and the way she looked. It sounds like it was mire of their sick fantasies than reality! Felt so awful when I saw Christine faint at the funeral. At least Jean-Marie got his revenger and rightly so I bet he sleeps better at night for it. I think I would have done the same!
Who Killed Little Gregory?,">  The local garmanderie (?) was trying 

I come late to the party, but it's ""Gendarmerie"", it's a branch of the police in France attached to the military (while the ""Police"" are civilians, which explain some of the feud between the two corps). The closer analogue in english coutry would be the canadian RCMP.

It comes from ""Gens d'armes"", aka ""Men in arms"" in french."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Good point
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Careful, people may downvote you  for stating that fact lol ,  I’ve been using subtitles  too.  I should have studied French , Instead of Latin ."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,[deleted]
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Actually, it's very improbable that it was someone acting alone. The current theory is that three members of the family did it and the grandparents knew. The three were actually arrested recently but had to be released because of a paperwork error or something like that."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Ohhh my god that part was so weird. Just like three dudes in a row talking about how they wanted to bang this lady, and somehow that affected the case"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"How freaking insane was that?! It was like, January I think, when the detective met her? It's not like he met her a week later. JFC."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"If you watch it, you’ll know. Asshole detective who makes assumptions based on the attractiveness of a ‘suspect’."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"My dad has been watching it with me and he said to be fair, if someone did that to my kid and i was certain who it was, I'd be in prison too."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Ahhh! Merci. Gens d'armes. Makes sense. 6 years of French and I never learned there were two different types of police lol. (and I'm even later to the party!)
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"So, I took 6 years of French and then 1 year of Spanish (bad idea, don't do it) but was always mad that my school didn't offer Latin. Does Latin not help you with all Latin-based languages? I thought for sure knowing Latin would be the key to knowing every Latin-based language (as opposed to learning one, then having to learn each other one)"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Déjà, t'as commencé ton commentaire avec ""En France tout le monde sait que"", c'est faux. Après peut-être que dans tes clubs néonazis c'est la théorie principale, mais dans le reste de la France, non."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,To have your parents know who murdered your child and say fuck all would be so devastating I can't even imagine.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I got really strong ""she's asking for it"" vibes from that part. Then not long after there was someone saying one of the guys had a crush on her trying to play it off as cute and sweet. It made my skin crawl."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I was shocked at the way he described Christine! ""She was wearing a tight top"". 

As though she should have been in loose flowing funeral robes"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Good on Jean-Marie! Definatley a wierd family fact his own mum wouldn't even tell him!
Who Killed Little Gregory?,[deleted]
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Excuse, inspecteur gadget, 35 ans de carrière. T'as un filon sur Lady D aussi ou pas ?

A quel moment dans l'article on dit que Monique est coupable de meurtre ?"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,[deleted]
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Mais tu te moques du monde ou ça se passe comment ? Les grands-parents c'est clairement Monique et Albert. De plus, la mise en examen des Jacob a été annulée, comme celle de Murielle Bolle."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,[deleted]
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Ils ont foutu les trois quarts de la famille en examen, ça veut littéralement rien dire dans cette affaire. Surtout que si t'étais vraiment renseigné, tu saurais que les Jacob ont un alibi qui a été vérifié. Bref, la discussion me paraît peu utile."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I think there were a few key words that I might have not understood, but I think I got the gist. Are you guys saying the grandparents are Jewish and it was them (Monique et Jacob?)? I think you said you've never understood why anyone would blame the grandparents?

Also, aren't ""primo"" and ""secundo""... not French? Sounds Italian. I'd say Spanish, but that's segundo (I think)"

Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Whatever it’s flaws, it was all worth it when Maya screamed, “How the fuck was I supposed to know that?”"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Jason Bateman being a cat and telling that his revenge would be sweet was fantastic.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Yeah totally agree. Pete was an unnecessary addition at the end. He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise and he did not gel with the rest of the episode. Really enjoyed Jason and Maya and the rest of the episode until then. When Jason realized Santa was Sean and said ""aw you roped Sean into this?"" I laughed out loud."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Master Bateman and Maya Rudolph were great. Marshawn Lynch was a nice surprise (“Oh shit, it’s the dude from Ozark!”).

Pete Davidson was kind of “eh”, but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

Apparently he was sequestered in his trailer for 4 hours, according to Krister Johnson, writer for Murderville, in the /r/murderville subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/murderville/comments/zm8rz7/_/j0e4mai/"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Yeah, but that's the joke, right? The murderer was someone Maya hadn't even met, and Pete was asked to choose the killer with no information at all. There's no way he could have added anything to the investigation, so he was just having fun with it. 

I liked the interplay between the different guests better than the first series where it's just the guest with Terry, but it would probably be better to have them all there from the start. It would be less confusing for the viewer, and hopefully they would actually choose one of the suspects in the end."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Jasons bird dance was incredible
Who Killed Little Gregory?,It was almost worth it though for Bateman's deadpan scolding of Pete for mocking Donna Foccacias name
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I absolutely loved the episode and agree that Pete didn’t add anything. I feel I could’ve done what he did, being I have zero acting talent and what not."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,It was almost like Pete was walking by the studio while they were filming the ending and just dragged him in for no reason.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,We said the same thing! It was SO funny but how none of them chose one of the three suspects kinda killed it. I will say I cracked up that Jason picked Santa because it was absolutely absurd. I think the idea of having someone come in at the very end was great but anyone but Pete. His hype needs to be done. If they got Molly Shannon or something that would’ve been awesome.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Wasn’t the joke that because he was brought in last minute there’s no way he could of known what was going on? I thought it was funny anyway…
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"The thing about him pulling the wires though is that they were about to get him to disarm the bomb anyway so why didn’t they just roll with it and be like “oh, good job Pete. That did it I guess”"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Agreed. I loved the special and hope they do more Murderville. But Pete Davidson is just not funny, and this was made more apparent sharing the stage with actors who can actually do improv well."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I think Santa was my favorite thing in the episode. From him dying like 3 separate times, to the mannequin bit with the Orphans... i just lost my shit."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"My wife and I were blitzed when  we watched this on Friday and I cannot remember a time we have laughed more post COVID.  We were extremely happy to see Marshawn make a cameo and we loved him pointing out, ""That's the guy from OZARK!""

Might be the alcohol talking but it was by far our favorite thus far!"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I kinda like how it feels like improv between friends and a chaotic mess. Also makes it feel more real, less set up and less rehearsed or prepped for as some shows that fake realism can be. Tho it is better when will arnett is trying not to laugh and the comedian digs in to make him laugh. There’s few times where arnett or the other actor is trying to drag some improv out of the guest whose stuck but you can’t win them all in improv.

Throwing Pete last minute was some wild farcical comedy. If you don’t care if he solves it or not it is funny how lost he is"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I think he would have chosen the mint girl if he didn’t see both Maya and Jason picking outside the box. The bomb thing was absolutely dumb. But it was an enjoyable episode nonetheless.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"The ending did piss me off a bit, and I was surprised that having three professional comedians resulted in them all going against the basic fundamentals of improv comedy.

Definitely would have been better without Pete, but I wouldn't have minded them bringing in a third person at the end.  I liked the underlying premise of ""This guy has no knowledge of anything that has transpired yet.""  Marshawn Lynch would have been good."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,That was literally the entire joke but alright lol
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Agreed completely.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I like Pete more than the average redditor but he straight up sucked. He didn’t even try to play along at all, didn’t say a single useful or funny thing, and then pulled all the wires on the bomb at the end which is just textbook terrible improv."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Still can’t believe no one made a joke at the end about it being an arresting development
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I never knew in wanted a Jason Bateman Maya Rudolph team up and now I want a whole movie
Who Killed Little Gregory?,It’s crazy to think an actor with no range or ability to maintain character spent so many years on a live variety sketch show.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,He was fine. Is he as good as the others? No but he absolutely didn’t “ruin” anything and imo played off decently with the other cast. It ain’t perfect but I think it’s obnoxious to write a whole post about it.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I wonder what the back story to it was in real life. Like was he just chilling near the studio and someone was like “hey were filming this come join! It’s not like you need a script” or something similar. 

It didn’t seem planned (not that much is) but in some ways that’s the charm of it. 

Or maybe it was just horribly planned out. I’m going to hope there is an amusing backstory."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I did love the idea of bringing in a 3rd person with absolutely no understanding of what has already happened, right at the very end... but agree.  I wish Davidson had taken it a little more seriously, even if I did laugh at most of what he did.  Including pulling all the wires.

That said, though.  We went back and rewatched the others after the special and I do like the way the Christmas special flowed, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery party of friends, than the others did, because of the character breaks and things."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Agreed, I just don't understand how he keeps getting work. I used to think it was a conspiracy that the entertainment industry force feed you certain people, but I 100% believe it with him. He's smarmy and not funny, who are his fans? What does he actually bring to the table? I'll never understand it."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I agree. The episode was great, but Pete Davidson almost ruined it. 

I really tried to give him a chance, but Pete was laughing the whole time and pointed the finger at Will just to seem funny. He wasn’t even playing the game. When he pulled all the wires, I just gave up. He was an awful addition to the story. 

Referencing the Smartless podcast, what if they got Justin Theroux instead of Pete Davidson? That would have been gold."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I don't like Pete Davidson. Don't get what his appeal his. He's not talented in my eyes. Just a run of the mill chum.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I groaned when >!Pete Davidson!< lumbered onto the scene. Didn't add anything of value. I wish it had been someone like Michael Cera as a sort of wink and a nod to Arrested Development, like how they had >!Sean Hayes!< on there as a reference to >!the Smartless podcast!<."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"If you've not seen it you should check out Murder in Successville, which is the original version of the show."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Pete Davidson ruined it to be honest.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I guess I was the opposite. Pete is pretty well known for breaking at the drop of a hat so you just have to have that expectation and enjoy it when it happens. Especially since Bateman had made several fourth wall breaking comments and Maya broke when she heard Santa was dead. It's one of those shows where breaking can add to the show, rather than detract."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I died when they asked Jason Bateman to dance and he pulled the “ca-caw ca-caw” chicken dance from arrested development
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"By the end my impression of things was that:

Maya was all in and enjoying the hell out of it

Bateman was over it and contemplating who he was going to kill first, Will Arnett for getting him involved (since I imagine that is how it happened) or his agent because agents.

And that Davidson had been walking by while they were filming and some producer yanked him in off the street for the hell of it."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I loved it when Maya accused the mayor who immediately said, ""the fuck?"""
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I’m not the biggest Pete Davidson fan but I really enjoyed the unnecessary addition. It was more so a joke to add someone at the last second who missed the entire case and then have them pick who they think the killer is. Also how could you not break if you’re coming into the end of the episode?
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"The kind of “cardinal rule” for improv is the “yes, and” approach. Pete didn’t say yes to any set ups; he didn’t play along with the bomb wire. He gave his present to someone who wasn’t a suspect. He just sat and smiled and didn’t attempt any effort to get into any sort of character. 
I think a lot of us had bigger expectations because he was on a comedy sketch show, but he either doesn’t have the chops or he prefers to bring chaos and watch everyone shift to his style. 
It’s way more fun to watch improv when everyone tries to gel; he gave no gifts/easy lifts to the other teammates and he heightened zero scenes. The ability to keep the bit going is all on Will, Jason, Maya and the supporting cast."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"It had its moments, but the whole thing didn’t feel well put together.  It’s like they started filming and decided to call Maya and Pete to see if they were free to swing by. 

They should have all been in a group from the start."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Completely agree. I was so disappointed bc Pete seemed to not play the “game” and instead seemed to want to just f up the story line. 
It made no sense adding him. 
Also they should have brought in Maya earlier in the show."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Me and my girlfriend thought him showing up out of the blue was one of the best parts of the episode.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I don’t blame Pete because they brought him on right at the end and he didn’t have any context. I wish instead of staggering the guests they were all present at the beginning. Or they did separate episodes. Overall thought it was great. Loved Jason’s nod to Arrested Development with the chicken dance
Who Killed Little Gregory?,It's the American remake of Murder in Successville in case anyone else was confused.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"I feel almost completely the opposite about the episode. I thought everything until Pete showed up was weaker than most of the regular episodes, but when he showed up the chaos it brought was hilarious. I don't think without him there Jason and Maya would have picked the killers they did, and it just raised everything up. There's no way it would work as a normal thing, but for a special episode it was a great ending."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Everything was perfectly imperfect and the entire special was wonderful.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I didn’t mind Pete Davidson. He didn’t add anything spectacular but his laugh was contagious as a viewer
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"That's why it was funny.

No matter who you bring in, if they're only there for the last 5min, they'd act the same way bc they have no sense of the pacing or what the other 2 ppl have gone through the entire time. 

I found that hilarious."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,I think that was the point a bit. To bring some doofus looking guy in who was clueless and had 30 seconds to make a decision and wouldn’t take it seriously.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Honestly, just having Pete Davidson in a cast is an immediate ""no thanks"" from me, no matter how amazing it might be. Kermit-looking motherfucker is just awful with stupid tattoos."
Who Killed Little Gregory?,Before he came in I was sure I'd rewatch it in a year's time. His appearance made it much much worse.
Who Killed Little Gregory?,"Yeah, WTF why was Pete Davidson even there. He had no context, no frame of reference, he didn't seem like he wanted to play along."
Holiday Secrets,The Stranger Things Christmas Special sounds like a spectacularly bad idea.
Holiday Secrets,"Excited for Marriage Story, I've only read good things about it. Seems like Laura Dern might win a Oscar for it which she should because she's a national treasure"
Holiday Secrets,I’m excited/curious about Marriage Story.
Holiday Secrets,"YOU: Season 2 really excites me. I was absolutely blown away with how good the show was, and I'm hoping that it doesnt branch away from the vibe of the first season."
Holiday Secrets,"Really looking forward to season 2 of Lost In Space, the first season was pretty great."
Holiday Secrets,Is Locke and Key ever going to come out?
Holiday Secrets,[Let It Snow](https://youtu.be/pitxxQYZcug)
Holiday Secrets,[deleted]
Holiday Secrets,Hshs
Holiday Secrets,"I like Adam Driver too, but can we at least get a blurb that doesn't make me think that using a cheese grater on my junk would be more entertaining?"
Holiday Secrets,The Sabrina one wasn’t bad.
Holiday Secrets,"It's really brilliant. If it happens to be showing somewhere, check it out in cinemas."
Holiday Secrets,Agreed.   Just a fun show to watch that feels like the episodes fly by.
Holiday Secrets,Apparently filming finished in July.
Holiday Secrets,People like Christmas movies around Christmas?  Who knew?
Holiday Secrets,Is this the part where we kick you?
Holiday Secrets,"If you're saying everything else sounds generic, that just means you haven't watched them. Lost in Space sounded generic as fuck, but it was amazing. You shouldnt judge an entire tv show based on a one sentence description."
Holiday Secrets,">A stage director and his actor wife struggle through a gruelling, coast-to-coast divorce that pushes them to their personal and creative extremes."
Holiday Secrets,Interesting take...
Holiday Secrets,Oh really? For some reason I thought it was much longer than that. Thanks.
Holiday Secrets,yeah that sounds like a lifetime movie. gonna be a pass from  me. at least Girls had a gimmick.
Holiday Secrets,"Well you'd be missing out on a favourite for best picture and definitely one of the best movies of the year. It's a seriously brilliant film.

Also, blurbs aren't a good indicator of quality."
Holiday Secrets,"Some people just need ""gimmicks"" in their entertainment."
Holiday Secrets,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Holiday Secrets,Hooch is crazy

Holiday Secrets,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Holiday Secrets,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Holiday Secrets,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Holiday Secrets,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Holiday Secrets,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Holiday Secrets,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Holiday Secrets,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Holiday Secrets,that's a lot of content
Holiday Secrets,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Holiday Secrets,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Holiday Secrets,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Holiday Secrets,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Holiday Secrets,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Holiday Secrets,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Holiday Secrets,[deleted]
Holiday Secrets,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Holiday Secrets,Any specific dates to go with this?
Holiday Secrets,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Holiday Secrets,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Holiday Secrets,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Holiday Secrets,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Holiday Secrets,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Holiday Secrets,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Holiday Secrets,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Holiday Secrets,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Holiday Secrets,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Holiday Secrets,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Holiday Secrets,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Holiday Secrets,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Holiday Secrets,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Holiday Secrets,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Holiday Secrets,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Holiday Secrets,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Holiday Secrets,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Holiday Secrets,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Holiday Secrets,[deleted]

Holiday Secrets,Thanks man you're awesome
Holiday Secrets,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Holiday Secrets,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Holiday Secrets,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Holiday Secrets,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Holiday Secrets,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Holiday Secrets,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Holiday Secrets,It’s pretty genius
Holiday Secrets,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Holiday Secrets,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Holiday Secrets,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Holiday Secrets,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Holiday Secrets,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Holiday Secrets,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Holiday Secrets,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Holiday Secrets,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Holiday Secrets,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Holiday Secrets,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Holiday Secrets,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Holiday Secrets,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Holiday Secrets,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Holiday Secrets,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Holiday Secrets,That’s pathetic
Holiday Secrets,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Holiday Secrets,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Holiday Secrets,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Holiday Secrets,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Holiday Secrets,[deleted]
Holiday Secrets,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Holiday Secrets,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Holiday Secrets,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Holiday Secrets,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Holiday Secrets,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Holiday Secrets,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."

No Time for Shame,"Start counting how many people these ""Livestock Agents"" kill during shootouts."
No Time for Shame,We tried getting into this show and just couldn't. There's no one to root for. The prequels are more enjoyable for us though.
No Time for Shame,I enjoyed it and Beth became a quick favorite. The show is a bit too outlandish for me and it gets even more so as the seasons progress. But worth the watch for sure.
No Time for Shame,"Its a great show.

Its the most popular show on TV for a reason.

But its not reddit-friendly for some reason. 

I think reddit thinks its too cool for that show.

That said, later seasons do drop off in quality."
No Time for Shame,Prequels are good
No Time for Shame,Same
No Time for Shame,Beth is the worst part of the show.
No Time for Shame,"It's basically a modern conservative cowboy fantasy: ""this is MY LAND and I have GUNS so go away you government people"". Plus these people get away with all sorts of shit."
No Time for Shame,The vitriol towards this show on the basis that is targeted towards an older demographic makes me cringe beyond belief. Though a lot of young people do most likely watch it. Not every show should be targeted towards people under 40. It is ridiculous to think so otherwise.
No Time for Shame,The first prequel was awful. The daughter character was just brutal to watch.
No Time for Shame,I can see that. Maybe not the worst part but she can wear on you and her character is somewhat of a schtick now. But i certainly enjoyed her personality and trash talk early on. I haven’t seen Season 5 either.
No Time for Shame,Kinda hot though
No Time for Shame,"Aren't the Duttons the ""government people""? Isn't Kevin Costner's character the governor of Montana?"
No Time for Shame,every tv show is a modern ____ fantasy (just fill in the blanks).
No Time for Shame,There are like 30 episodes before that happens and didn't he only become the governor so that he could protect his land?
No Time for Shame,The Last of Us?
No Time for Shame,Is this show Peaky Blinders in the American West?
No Time for Shame,"apocalypse-porn. 

Its a type of show, like Walking Dead (which is another good show, just like Last of Us is a good show).

There is a reason the video-game is so popular."
No Time for Shame,"In PB everyone is a criminal. In this show they aren't criminals, they just do a lot of shit that should have the FBI involved but somehow doesn't...."
No Time for Shame,"Apocalypse porn is a fantasy? Only in the broadest possible sense, as in all of fiction is a _____ fantasy."
No Time for Shame,">they just do a lot of shit that should have the FBI involved  

So...crime?  

>In this show they aren't criminals  

But they do a lot of ""shit that should have the FBI involved"", meaning crime.  

I'm not sure we think the same thing about who is or isn't a criminal."
No Time for Shame,"The idea behind the game, and show, and other shows like it, is to engage in the true romanticized fantasy (similar to Yellowstone) to live cathartically through the characters. The CW does the same (girl fantasy, hot boys, love triangles, etc). Every niche is filled."
No Time for Shame,"In peaky blinders everybody is a criminal -- they make their money through criminal enterprise. In this show they have a legitimate business that they protect with things that border on criminal.

It's a silly debate either way."
No Time for Shame,"In PB they also make a lot of money by racing a horse and winning races, and by selling liquor, and by selling auto parts, and by running a legal betting operation at a track, and by running pubs and nightclubs; they just *also* make money by criminal enterprises.  

Sounds exactly like the folks in Yellowstone, you say they have legitimate businesses *and* do a lot of crime.  

The ""and they do a lot of crime"" part makes them criminals."
No Time for Shame,k ✌️
No Time for Shame,"Had the pleasure of meeting Kevin O'Neal at a charity do once. He was surprisingly down to earth, and VERY funny."
No Time for Shame,">The TV Academy is no longer allowing HBO’s “The White Lotus” in the limited/anthology category and Variety has confirmed that the series will likely move to the drama category, but a final decision has not yet been made.

UPDATE: Variety edited the text, now stating that HBO's decision to submit The White Lotus in Drama is official. At the 2023 Emmys, HBO will have four major contenders: Succession, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and House of the Dragon."
No Time for Shame,"great. 

on to season 3."
No Time for Shame,Good. It’s not a limited series lmao.
No Time for Shame,"It's really sad that Better Call Saul is so amazing, but almost completely unrewarded due to such massive competition"
No Time for Shame,If this was the result of having more Jennifer Coolidge then it was well worth it!
No Time for Shame,"Sweet, split that HBO vote, and Better Call Saul can coast to victory"
No Time for Shame,"Really hope Succession is going to be winning some stuff. Truly one of the best shows mankind ever made imo (hopefully they will stick the landing with Season 4 & Season 5) but man, is the writing on that show something else. Too good"
No Time for Shame,[removed]
No Time for Shame,Good.  No limits!
No Time for Shame,"Rumor is White plans on making an “all-star” season eventually, this could also be in mind."
No Time for Shame,"So dumb, like American Horror Story would belong to Drama."
No Time for Shame,"Good, it was an extremely overrated show"
No Time for Shame,i dont get it but whatever.
No Time for Shame,[deleted]
No Time for Shame,Somehow that Franco guy got completely gross. Good luck with that
No Time for Shame,Should have been there last year with season 2.
No Time for Shame,"Rightfully so. Great show but returning characters should absolutely exclude a series from qualifying as an anthology limited series at the Emmys. 

This puts all the pressure on White House Plumbers to succeed for HBO as I think The White Lotus would have swept the field in Limited series had it qualified. Now The White Lotus goes against Succession and The Last of Us. Be interesting to see what comes out on top as I feel all three have the edge over Better Call Saul, The Crown, and Severance. Very strong drama field for HBO and that is not even counting Perry Mason or Golden Globe winner House of the Dragon!"
No Time for Shame,HBO split their own votes too much.
No Time for Shame,What an amazing year for TV
No Time for Shame,"Rip better call Saul getting some last minute love

Also fuck The Alienist  for winning the awards over Twin Peaks the Return and then coming back with a second season as it wasn't neither a limited or miniseries"
No Time for Shame,"But how about award he got before?

Bc it not limited anymore, did it cheating"
No Time for Shame,And they will all lose to The Last of Us. I can’t imagine a world where eps 3 and 5 of TLOU don’t win every award
No Time for Shame,It’s not tv
No Time for Shame,"Damon Linelof said once Watchmen was submitted as a limited series he didn't think it was fair to continue.

Pretty sure he was joking, but makes sense anyway"
No Time for Shame,Sierra Nevada is no longer a “micro brewery “.
No Time for Shame,It was renewed before season 2 aired.
No Time for Shame,It passes as an anthology series imo.
No Time for Shame,The secret of getting ahead is getting started. —Mark Twain
No Time for Shame,How many times do Better Call Saul fans have to be taught the lesson that award shows just don’t like it like that lmao
No Time for Shame,"Better Call Saul isn’t going to win anything, and it breaks my heart, one of the best TV shows I’ve ever seen but let’s be realistic, the Emmy’s love HBO and haven’t given BCS 1 award, I mean there’s been episodes like Five-O, Chicanery, Winner, Bagman, Bad Choice Road, Rock and Hard Place and Plan and Execution in the past Emmy’s and they’ve not won a best acting award, writing, directing, cinematography, or best drama, nothing, if they’ve come this far it’s so unlikely"
No Time for Shame,"Genuine question and not at all meant to be snarky. What about the show makes it best in history?  I’ve watched it. It’s very good. The acting is fine. But, I feel like every season is the same. Which of my kids will inherit my empire?  Or, more appropriately, “Which of my fucking fucker kids will fucking get my fucking empire?”"
No Time for Shame,"Does it matter really? This is the sort of post that this sub should have, news relevant to TV. Does it matter how it's posted?

Who removed that comment? Stupid thing to do."
No Time for Shame,Not sure why this is getting downvoted. I’d be excited to see this.
No Time for Shame,"Basically, there is a rule at the Emmys that states that for a production to be eligible for a Limited Series, it is mandatory that there is no return of characters from previous seasons. The presence of Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) goes against that rule, so The White Lotus will have to compete as Drama or Comedy (according to Variety, it seems HBO will choose Drama)."
No Time for Shame,"I’m so confused about Barry being a comedy. I love the show, but it’s for sure a drama."
No Time for Shame,they are talking about season 2.
No Time for Shame,This is for season 2. Last year’s Emmy’s were for season 1.
No Time for Shame,"I can see *The Last of Us* doing very well in the ""below-the-line"" categories. With Barrie Gower, a four-time Emmy winner for *Game of Thrones* and *Stranger Things* doing their prosthetics, the other shows may well as not turn up."
No Time for Shame,"Man, what a great era of TV we're in. Every last one of those is a banger."
No Time for Shame,"The last season of Succession was hard to beat.  I know that Severance is ""deeper"" but, Succession was just off the hook."
No Time for Shame,"But they've been nominating actors playing returning characters in sequel miniseries for decades. Peter Falk in the 70s, Helen Mirren in the 90s, Idris Elba and Benedict Cumberbatch in the 2010s. 

Seems weird that it's suddenly an issue now."
No Time for Shame,"i don't agree, it's anthology in spirit completely"
No Time for Shame,I'm not sure why they didn't submit it as a comedy. The comedy categories are generally less competitive. I love White Lotus but it's now probably going to get shut out of the major award categories.
No Time for Shame,I loved The White Lotus but I would rate it at the bottom out of the four shows from that list I've seen. It's really great but I would have put Better Call Saul in the top three. I don't know how Emmy ranks her shows but I liked Severance more too.
No Time for Shame,"Depending when Succession airs, it may not be eligible this year. IIRC the cutoff is around late May. I think all of Severance was before the cutoff, it was for the last Emmys, I doubt S2 airs before May. 

If Succession hit that date, HBO indeed have 4 series that can compete in Outstanding Drama Series. Succession, The Last of Us, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon. I guess it's a good problem to have but they would have to make some choices to avoid competing against themselves.

Also for the limited series, they might also have True Detective S4 as a contender, it looks pretty good."
No Time for Shame,But each season is self-contained. I didn’t watch season 1 and it didn’t matter when I watched season 2.
No Time for Shame,"> returning characters should absolutely exclude a series from qualifying as an anthology limited series at the Emmys.

Why? An anthology can have recurring characters."
No Time for Shame,There’s an upcoming miniseries on HBOMax called life and death with Jesse Plemons and Elizabeth Olsen.  Looks like a high budget crime drama and it’ll end right before the eligibility window closes. I could see it being their limited series push for this year based on the trailer.
No Time for Shame,Having any of the same characters in more than one season is the disqualifier I think.
No Time for Shame,One more time
No Time for Shame,"It would be nice if Rhea Seehorn could win, she deserves it. She will face tough competition though"
No Time for Shame,"It has a good ensemble cast where everyone dances to the same beat. The best shows imo are the ones driven by strong writing alone. There are no gimmicks, visual, vfx or fantasy clutch. If you can make a dry concept with boring characters interesting and funny, you got a winner."
No Time for Shame,"“Which of my fucking fucker kids will fucking get my fucking empire” is surprisingly similar to “which one of these fucking fucker houses will sit the Iron Throne?” 

And we know that show got pretty much universal praise for like 6-7 seasons"
No Time for Shame,"Yeah it’s a solid show, but some of the praise has gone pretty crazy to me. But everyone’s entitled to their opinion in the end. Not everyone’s gone have the same favorite show."
No Time for Shame,"personally, I love the show because all the characters are so complex despite having similar goals, and it's genuinely got some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen"
No Time for Shame,I'm with ya. I guess it's fine but I think it's a bit overrated.
No Time for Shame,"It was just a question lol I saw their name pop up a lot recently and peeked at the profile, pretty good history and that got me curious if it was a bot, hobbyist, or professional."
No Time for Shame,Reddit mods being stupid? *giga-gasp!*
No Time for Shame,"They will probably choose Drama but I’d list it as a comedy to get it away from Succession, The Last of Us, and House of the Dragon. They are pretty light on Comedy this year unless they have late releases planned for Barry or Hacks before the May cut-off point."
No Time for Shame,So that impacts Fargo too then right?
No Time for Shame,"but they ruled that it was ok for Coolidge to come back:

>the organization ruled that “the reappearance in a subsequent ‘season’ of one character from a large ensemble does not prohibit eligibility based on Academy’s main criteria for limited series.”"
No Time for Shame,"Whatever, it was worth it for the gasp of shock and then bonk noise"
No Time for Shame,[deleted]
No Time for Shame,Season 2 was already greenlit for last year.
No Time for Shame,The work done for the bloater in episode 5 is utterly amazing
No Time for Shame,Last of Us has to win whatever award they give for production design. It's been on another level.
No Time for Shame,Shortening seasons really allowed writing to shine and great actors to sign up to do TV.
No Time for Shame,If you look outside of most of the Disney shows this has been the best era of television since 2014
No Time for Shame,"Though Succession won’t be competing for season 3 this year (it won best drama last year), they’ll be competing for season 4."
No Time for Shame,"Oh, fuck off!"
No Time for Shame,Better call Saul is a bit better than all those shows but unfortunately has a much smaller audience
No Time for Shame,"The television landscape has changed a lot over the past couple decades, with miniseries/limited series/anthologies making some of the largest shifts and becoming a much bigger category than it used to be. *American Horror Show* really seemed to tip things to the point where they've really struggled to define what counts as an anthology and what as a drama as the lines have become increasingly blurred.

It's not really that this particular thing is an issue *now*. It's a larger reflection of them attempting (and re-attempting) to create rules and shape the category to be representative of what shows they believe fit. And that's resulted in them changing the title of the category and what qualifies like four times in the past decade as they try to chisel it down."
No Time for Shame,"Episode count matters, the British shows only having 2-3 episodes makes them ineligible for Drama/Comedy series."
No Time for Shame,"it fails in definition

>presents a different story and a different set of characters in each different episode, season, segment, or short

if they didn't bring jennifer coolidge back then it would be fair to fight to stay in the limited category. you can't call it an anthology because it meets 99% of the criteria

edit: even when you break it down you have the character groupings that mostly interact with each other (with quite a lot of crossovers)

* bert, albie, dominic   
* cameron, harper, ethan, daphne   
* tanya, greg, portia, quentin, jack   
* valentina, mia, lucia

i don't know how much runtime each set used but it was a pretty even spread. you can't have a returning character eat up ~25% of the season on their continuing story line from the first season (and have a small role for a second returning character- greg) and still expect to call it an anthology. unless we want to submit grey's anatomy for a limited series emmy considering the amount of original cast members remaining"
Candy Online,I get all these pairings except Shiv and Connor. Will she have to run his presidential campaign or something?
Candy Online,Came for the Greg and Tom poster. I was not disappointed.
Candy Online,"Interesting that J. Smith Cameron’s Gerri is getting featured in the promo materials now, leads me to believe she is going to become pretty pivotal"
Candy Online,Tom and Greg FTW.
Candy Online,No M&Ms?
Candy Online,Cousin Greg will claim the throne.
Candy Online,If Greg doesn’t end up as CEO I’m gonna be pissed.
Candy Online,Fuck I can’t wait. But I have to ask: why no poster of someone who had an interest in politics from an early age?
Candy Online,Is this show a drama or a dark comedy? I've watched all of it so far and sometimes it seems like it's trying to be Breaking Bad and other times it seems to have the seriousness of Arrested Development.
Candy Online,"On one hand, I cannot wait for this to return. On the other hand, I don’t know if I can stomach another moment like Boar on the Floor again"
Candy Online,"Can't wait for this season, love this show."
Candy Online,"Narratively, Shiv should go with Tom and Connor is just in his own little Connorland. But for promotional purposes, they know we all want to see Tom and Greg paired up, so Shiv and Connor are just what's left."
Candy Online,Connor Roy 2024: He Was Interested In Politics From A Very Young Age
Candy Online,It certainly implies that. Or they just didn’t have a logical match for those two.
Candy Online,So it be so it is.
Candy Online,If you wanna make a Tomlette you gotta crack some Gregs.
Candy Online,And what a glorious sheet it is.... Greg's face is hilarious.
Candy Online,Her role already expanded pretty significantly in season 2 and given her developing relationship with Roman I expect her to continue being a major player.
Candy Online,*You can't make a Tomelette without breaking some Greggs.*
Candy Online,Candy’s for daddies! Not little babies!
Candy Online,Daaaark Comedy.
Candy Online,">Is this show a drama or a dark comedy

Both.

It's somewhat similar in that sense to the Sopranos where the humour doesn't come from a joke laden script but instead from allowing the characters to be their hilariously pathetic selves. This in turn allows the drama to flourish because the show never feels inauthentic despite being incredibly funny."
Candy Online,"I’ve been describing it to people as having the script of one of those deadpan British sitcoms (appropriate, given the writers) but with the production team of a prestige drama"
Candy Online,Yes.
Candy Online,It’s a drama written by a bunch of comedy writers
Candy Online,Fuck that was a great scene. Gonna watch that episode again tonight
Candy Online,I've been thinking that this is exactly what Matthew McConaughey running for Texas governor feels like. Rich narcissist wants to lead the world.
Candy Online,Without fail this line is posted every time this show is brought up on this sub. It’s like the shows catch phrase at this point ha
Candy Online,"There is some jokes in there as well.

""then why the fuuUUUCK are you wearing deck shoes"" comes to mind"
Candy Online,"Honestly, I'd rather see him win than Greg Abbot or Beto O'Rourke. Just about anyone could do a better job running Texas than those two, it's Trump and Hillary all over again."
Candy Online,“F*** off” seems like a catch phrase too.
Candy Online,">Beto

Did you mean Robert Francis O'Rourke?"
Candy Online,you can swear online it’s ok
Candy Online,Fuck off
Candy Online,"She got kidnapped. In front of multiple cars in a fast food drive-thru, kicking and screaming, and nobody noticed except for her sister one car behind where she was?

Bad start so far."
Candy Online,I can't see how they're gonna stretch this series out into anything more than 1 season before the singles population of New York dies at the hands of this guy. 
Candy Online,"My main problem with the pilot is the logic of the show which is terribly flawed and that creates plot holes like the one /u/Iamametameta pointed out.

Also, the romance is too cheesy and campy to watch. The romance in many shows from The CW are way better (and tolerable) to watch while the romance in Eye Candy is not. God.

The only good part of the pilot is how it ends with the ""It's war"" moment between Lindy, the main character and the mysterious serial killer. But this is not enough for me to continue watching the show.

I like Victoria Justice and I appreciate MTV is trying out more serious programming through Eye Candy but if you need to watch a really good thriller, Eye Candy is not one of them."
Candy Online,"I kind of liked the killer as a narrator of some sort (he talked over the title sequence and at the end). Not exactly a good start, but I guess I'll keep watching for now. I wanna see how well VJ acts in a more serious show, at least more serious than Zoey 101."
Candy Online,"Haha I said the same thing too at the beginning. Wouldn't they notice her climbing on their vehicles to try and get to her sister? No one gets out of their vehicles? That was pretty far fetched, but the rest of the episode seemed alright for the most part. I can't say I'm overly hooked but Victoria Justice is hot so maybe I'll keep watching. "
Candy Online,"Bystander effect. 

Now the fact that nobody got mad that she climbed all over their cars bugs me a bit. "
Candy Online,"I don't usually notice plot holes but god, that was a terrible plot hole if I noticed it very quickly. 

Bad start so far indeed."
The Club,I don't think this scene will hit as hard if you don't know the context of what has happened in Tony's dream so far. He's in a strange city because of a conference but can't leave because he accidentally picked up Kevin Finnerty's luggage including his wallet and identification. He cannot get in contact with Kevin Finnerty to get his stuff back. He is mistaken for Kevin Finnerty by some Buddhist monks who demand reparations for something Kevin Finnerty did. And to top it all off he is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He just wants to get home to his family but he can't. He doesn't even know who he is anymore. In this scene he wanted to call his family but then just gives up. Such a sad scene.
The Club,God I love this show.

The Club,Quasimodo predicted all of this you know
The Club,"He did call this family though in a different scene from his alt-Soprano state. The voices and character were completely different from usual ""healthy Soprano"" behavior - Carmela nagging, daughter sarcastic, suspicious and desperate to go away... 

While he was in coma they came to this caring mode though, while 
Jr. manned up for a moment and came to the psychiatric ward to kill the other Jr. 

I thought that season would never end. The sheer length of it was almost enough for two seasons....

I guess that's how much time needed to tie up loose arcs."
The Club,"I love the scene where the Buddhists confront him in the hallway.  ""Lose your arrogance"" is a part of my vocab.  It's been awhile since I'd seen this, I'm rewatching the series due to listening to the Talking Sopranos podcast but haven't gotten this far yet (I just watched Whitecaps).  Got a kick of the part where he walks in his hotel room and there's a Muzak version of ""Day After Day"" by Badfinger."

What's the German show about? I don't want to Google it for fear of being on a list"
The Club,"really? I couldn't pass the first episode. I was just laughing at the story and how bad the acting was, I mean it was terrible. Nothing made me keep watching."
The Club,"It’s not a great show, it’s more a show to have on as the background while you’re cleaning or having on while being on reddit. Acting can be over the top, typical mexican telenovela type. Im on episode 6, because my PS4 is at my bfs and i have nothing else to watch. It’s not really attention grabbing and generic storyline so far."
The Club,Just finished it and it was really good! That ending was insane.
The Club,"The overall plot arch is good, the actors are fantastic, and production value is on point.

However, the storyline is sloppy as hell. In at least one episode scenes were edited in out of order, and otherwise there isn't a lot of coherence scene-to-scene, and there is a supreme lack of character development.

It has potential though."
The Club,Monarca is amazing
The Club,"Ah, it is? I was wondering why the accents sounded different. Thank you, I'll edited the post"
The Club,"This is a Netflix originals show? Never heard of it, usually Netflix of pretty good at promoting Originals"
The Club,The best i can do i suggest to watch the trailer. I can barely find anything on it and i cant screen record because netflix doesn't let you :(
The Club,"I had the same thought, lol. To win back his girlfriend who broke up with him after spending a year abroad, he decides to start selling drugs with  his best friend through their app.as their success grows things start to spiral out of control. It's a dramedy, and it's very gen z and social media focused fyi if that's something you might not like.

It's really short, 6 episodes and around 30 minutes each. It's a really good show though.


Here's a trailer: https://youtu.be/3sxg1xXmd0I"

The Club,"With scenes like these I wonder how people can mistake this show for a straight forward mob show that they expect a straight forward ending.

The Club,"This show so perfectly captured so many things.  I always got the impression that this scene was the feeling of what purgatory may be like. 

There's also those [nightmare scenes Tony has when he gets food poisoning](https://youtu.be/v8hUcqtRNWs?t=14) and you just hear that disturbing creaking in the background the entire time.  Things don't make sense, pieces of his past are popping up in his nightmare and it's just so fucking eerie. 

I think another thing that's incredible about the show is that David ~~Simon~~ Chase has admitted to not knowing what may be the ""best"" music for the show and he mostly selects the music he uses just by how he feels is right.  It evidently leads to a lot of people in the production team disagreeing with him, particular Steve Van Zandth, who, in addition to playing Silvio, is a noted musician/song writer.  I believe he remarked that David ~~Simon's~~ Chases musical choices were jarring when first discussed but the way he used them with the scenes made it very powerful.  

The two that come to mind for me are the [""I'm not like everybody else""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haWOLGAHppc) scene which just speaks volumes about Tony's character and I believe the season 1 closer had [Christopher pridefully grabbing a ton of newspapers that recognized him to a song from Cake.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuknbVZ-dkc)"

Michael has spent the entire season trying to find out who burned him from his job working for the CIA.  He's being tracked by some mystery person/organization and his car's OnStar system gives him directions without being prompted and calls him by name, despite the fact that he's in his friend's car.  The GPS guides him to a bridge with a tractor trailer stopped, with a ramp leading to an opened trailer hatch.  The voice on the GPS tells him they're looking forward to meeting him.  He becomes acutely aware of the fact that he has two choices: to retreat and gain nothing, or to put his ass on the line in order to learn something.  He stops the car and spends a minute considering this.

He then slowly puts his car into gear, drives onto the ramp and into the darkened trailer.  Someone shuts the hatch behind him, enclosing him in darkness.

And that's the end of season one.

In addition, the end of the pilot episode, when Michael enters his loft to the collection of photographs of him, letting him know he was being followed by someone he couldn't detect.  And in the middle of the collecion of photos was a postcard, reading ""Welcome to Miami"".

Burn Notice is a severely underappreciated show."
The Club,"Magnum PI [..Ivan did you see the sunrise?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7vW1oEKP1k) I was 12 or so and watched this, HOLY SHIT!

So back story Magnum is a private investigator, hes always the good guy. Ivan was a Russian with diplomatic immunity that had tortured Magnum in Vietnam. Hes a war criminal but cant be touched. One of Magnums good friends gets kicked out of the Navy for helping him and they go out on an all night drinking binge. His friend jumps in Magnums Ferrari and yells something to the effect of "" Hey lets go watch the sunrise!"" and boom a car bomb goes off. 

Later on Ivan is about to get away with murder by leaving and Thomas chases him off into the jungle and the dialogue begins. Ivan admits he tried to kill Magnum and pretty much says ""you don't have the balls"" Well he did.

I love the use of music in Luther. I'm always excited to hear what the closing song will be and it's chosen and used so well. The song in this clip is perfect because it's Luther all over. They even used it in the (excellent) teaser trailers.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you’ve done trapeze! (I’m an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons 👀)"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services?

Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?

Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood’s usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn’t be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing 😂

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about 😂) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life.

Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,[deleted]
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a “show for kids”.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ❤️"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‘locklyle’ shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It’d make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character’s past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren’t having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they’d be doing?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it’s one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here’s my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it’s based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,what were first and last shootings?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,what was your favourite location to film?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"The netflix adaption of Lockwood & Co was so visually stunning and still did the book series justice! 

What scene was most fun to film? Because of the scene itself, or on-set antics?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: what talent would you prefer to have? Touch, Sight or Listening?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Thank you to everyone involved in this project! It is a pitch perfect adaptation of one of my favorite series of books. Love the cast, the settings, and the whole vibe of the show! Hoping for more seasons as I would love to see Aickmere’s Department Store and the Fittes’ headquarters scenes on screen. 

Question for the cast: what was the most challenging scene to film?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,choose my lockwood and co themed tattoo PLEASE
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What is your favorite song from the soundtrack? 

I love the show so much! I had never read the books, but after one watch, I was inspired to read the books! That's how great the show was! Perfect adaptation! After reading the books, i can appreciate the work that everyone put into the show that much more to bring Jonathon Stroud's masterpiece to life. Best show I've seen in years! And the acting was on point! I'm super impressed with Lockwood's character! He was literally copied and pasted from the books to TV lol. Lucy is a badass and George is hilarious and so lovable. Y'all are awesome! :)"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"To all four of you - 

The show's had a chokehold on me ever since I watched it (as soon as it came out) and I haven't been able to eat/sleep/watch anything else because it's always on my mind! I'm not even exaggerating 

So first of all, thank you so so so so so much for this opportunity, my brain is finally at peace.

As for the question, how does it feel to be a part of something as big as this? You guys have put in your absolute 100% and trust me it shows! Not only have you catalysed the spreading of this fandom, but every single person who has watched the show has only had positive stuff to say about it!"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Why does Lockwood wear pink socks? And are they the same ones or does he have multiple pairs lol?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,Is Lockwood jealous of Lucy initially that she can speak to type threes?
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"What was it like filming the scene when Lucy is ""possessed"" by Annabelle?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"Greetings from Ukraine! Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question! After watching the adaptation, I really wanted to read the books, so I have a lot of respect for the painstaking work on the series.  
Before I ask the question, I just want to express my endless love to the actors who played their roles incredibly. This is the best adaptation from netflix in the last year, if not two :ʼD  
Questions for Ruby: did you prepare in any way for the role, I mean maybe read books to soak up the atmosphere, or maybe listen to some playlists like Ali. Maybe you were looking for something on tiktok or aesthetics on pinterest? and did you enjoy the fencing lessons before filming?  
Questions for Ali: (George is my favorite character and the way you played him is just amazing). Do you like George as a character? Do you have any similarities? maybe you found some minuses or pluses in your character?  
Questions for Cameron: When I found out that this was your debut role, it was a pleasant surprise for me, because you completely got into the character of Lockwood and his charisma. Did you read the books or maybe some excerpts? Plus you are very good at using a rapier. If you had the chance, would fencing become your hobby? Is it possible that fencing is already one of the hobbies?  
And a question for all three of you: if you had the opportunity to take a vacation as characters from the show, where would you go/fly and what would you do there?"
Im with the Band: Nasty Cherry,"THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE! The show is incredible! I love it! Everyday I’m watching it twice! 
Q to Joe: Did you saved all sets, costumes and stuff for maybe a second season or has everything been dismantled?"
My MVP Valentine,"I really like that Netflix does these holiday specials for their animated shows, Bojack, Aggretsuko and Neo Yokio all had great christmas episodes that worked perfectly within their universe. "
My MVP Valentine,**BHUBBLE BHATH*
My MVP Valentine,[deleted]
My MVP Valentine,"The more Coach Steve in my life, the better."
My MVP Valentine,This show is the actual Sex Education.
My MVP Valentine,YES. More Big Mouth is always a good thing
My MVP Valentine,"Now I can have a double feature with this anf Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special!"
My MVP Valentine,"can't complain, this show is one of the funniest things Netflix has put out "
My MVP Valentine,Oh god
My MVP Valentine,"Love this show. Kinda a ""turn off my brain"" type show."
My MVP Valentine,"Tyler and Maurice in musical number: ""It's a cuddly little cupid...with the cock of a full-grown horse!""  
  
I've seen this episode probably 5 or 6 times and that still slays me."
My MVP Valentine,"Honestly, I really hate this art style, but it’s plastered all over my Netflix and I can’t make it go away because the algorithm thinks I want it. "
My MVP Valentine,netflix please stowop
My MVP Valentine,do people watch this? 
My MVP Valentine,"Y’all are insane for watching this asinine low brow animated soft core child porn. There’s no point at all other than to giggle at children fucking each other every episode. 

Initially I was mad at Netflix first for pushing this unmitigated third trimester abortion, but my outrage more recently is directed elsewhere. Sure Netflix is disgusting for making this trash, but the real problem is the degenerate pedophiles that take such delight in this show. The company would stop making it if they would stop slurping up this show like the four inch cocks they depict regularly.  These folks will also say I’m triggered, squeamish, I can’t take a joke, it’s just a cartoon, I’m a pussy or whatever. Fine. You got me.  Not wanted to see cartoon underaged cocks and vaginas makes ME the weirdo. 

God I love modernity. "
My MVP Valentine,The general consensus is the Bojack one sucked 
My MVP Valentine,"I mean, vulgarity is the intention of the American title as well. "
My MVP Valentine,"What expression? I can't think of anything with ""Mi peludo Valentín"" in it. "
My MVP Valentine,">""You truly are an enigma.""

>""You're not supposed to say that word anymore."""
My MVP Valentine,"I tell you this all the time, but your the man Steve"
My MVP Valentine,"I had a pretty good sex education in middle school, but this would have added so much more to it.  I wish I had it back when I was 14."
My MVP Valentine,"I'd have to disagree only because I don't like a flippant approach to SE. Sex went from something sacred to  something hedonistic. And you'll probably just call me a prude but I could just as easily call someone oversexed. At the end of the day Big Mouth isn't a big deal it's just a manifestation of moral relativism. We're losing values and eventually we'll have nothing. Anything will go. Big mouth has blurred the lines of pedophelia. It's not polarized because people are prudish, it's because of relativism."
My MVP Valentine,Nah I considered it the opposite. Sex education is big mouth if it were good.
My MVP Valentine,"I could have done without that episode where all the underage kids have an orgy in the school gymnasium.  I get that the message of the episode was to not be ashamed of your own sexuality and urges, but that went way overboard."
My MVP Valentine,"It's really ugly, but it works - since the show is all about puberty and sex, the ugly art style actually goes well with it. Makes it less awkward. Also you'll totally get over how ugly it is pretty quickly."
My MVP Valentine,The algorithm knows you don't want it.  The algorithm just doesn't care.
My MVP Valentine,My friend was the same way.  Then one night when we were hanging out I showed him a few clips.  He ended up binging the whole series in under a week.
My MVP Valentine,"The show is freaking hilarious, so yes."
My MVP Valentine,I bet you have a ton of friends. 
My MVP Valentine,"Cool, I liked it. "
My MVP Valentine,"It's not as good as Bojack Horseman, but then what is."
My MVP Valentine,"Was worthwhile for ""Bradley Hitler-Smith"" alone"
My MVP Valentine,"So what? I've seen every episode of Bojack and I think it's sucky pretentious garbage, but they're content creators and many people enjoy it, so power to them if they wanna create more of their stuff."
My MVP Valentine,"Yeah, but is even more vulgar or obvious in this case"
My MVP Valentine,LMAO imagine being so beta that you think SE was good
My MVP Valentine,"Huh.  I felt like the message was that shitty as it(he) is, shame does serve a purpose.  "
My MVP Valentine,It wasn't an orgy though...
My MVP Valentine,It's not underage if everyone there is underage.
My MVP Valentine,i have just seem the netflix adds on youtube.
My MVP Valentine,I hope they do another one
My MVP Valentine,"If you didnt like it, why would you watch every season ? "
My MVP Valentine,They are both well made shows. Just obviously different styles. 
My MVP Valentine,Yes it was pretty unambiguous
My MVP Valentine,Well load up Netflix and enjoy 2 seasons of hilarious episodes.
My MVP Valentine,"How would I know I didn't like all of it if I didn't watch all of it? I watch lots of TV shows; the majority of it I enjoy, but I watch plenty of stuff just to see what it's about. I'll watch kids shows, boring procedurals, ultra trashy reality, just to see what I'm missing. I can't judge if I don't know what it is!


Also cause I'm a furry looking for spank bait."
My MVP Valentine,Fair enough. I usually give shows at least half a season but if I dont like it by then I usually stop. 
My MVP Valentine,Definitely the most grounded lesbian couple I've seen portrayed on TV.
My MVP Valentine,[deleted]
My MVP Valentine,">What makes RYM different than discogs and other sites though is that the community has expansive subgenre, even at times very specific subgenre terminology systems to describe albums, eps, singles (whatever the release-type is).

What the actual fuck are ""Pop Punk, Skate Punk"" subgenres?

>Think of it like last.fm

Yep, sounds about fucking useless."
My MVP Valentine,*Sneers*
My MVP Valentine,"IMDB does allow keywords to be fair, it's just really badly implemented. But if I recall they've never done it.

But in any case, other IMDB-type sites don't really offer what I'm referring to either."
My MVP Valentine,">More simply, they don't want you to find the best fantasy show. They want you to watch their bad Wheel of Time show.

To be fair, IMDB could more brazenly manipulate data on their site if they were chiefly interested in promoting Amazon TV shows. I might take the wider point, but I still note that this isn't *just* an IMDB shortcoming."
My MVP Valentine,">What the actual fuck are ""Pop Punk, Skate Punk"" subgenres?

Have you never heard of Pop Punk?

>Yep, sounds about fucking useless.

Last.fm is flawed, but it does allow tagging and is somewhat useful."
My MVP Valentine,"> Have you never heard of Pop Punk?

I've heard of ""Pop"" and ""Punk"", pretty arbitrary definitions on their own. ""Pop Punk"" is just nonsense."
My MVP Valentine,"Well, that shoegaze link is not what I expected. I think of shoegaze is British indie with an electro twist. So tags are limited."
My MVP Valentine,"Blink 182, Sum 41, Green Day, The Offspring, New Found Glory?

[Pop Punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk) is not some obscure small genre."
My MVP Valentine,"Shoegaze is culturally somewhat 'indie', but it's not innately 'electro'.

The majority of people hold MBV to be the defining sound of Shoegaze."
My MVP Valentine,">Pop-punk is variously described as a punk subgenre, a variation of punk, a form of pop music

It's meaningless giberrish."
My MVP Valentine,"The entire music world disagrees with you. The Sex Pistols obviously do not sound like Blink 182.

Why do I find it useful to use music subgenres to help isolate music I'm more likely to enjoy?"
My MVP Valentine,"spoiler, but one theory i kind of like is that mouse is actually a person in a lab on some sort of psychoactive experiment or something. The city he's trying to escape from is the trip he's in. and it all takes place within a single minute (which is why the clock is always the same time). shark and square are the agents responsible for the experiments. haven't watched it in awhile though."
My MVP Valentine,"sry, I think I'm about a month late...how'd it go?"
My MVP Valentine,I doubt it but if so it would be one of the most brilliant shows ever made.
My MVP Valentine,Yeah I'm real late to the party but I just watched through seasons 1-3 again and this is definitely whats happening. They show him in the lab at the end of season 2. 
My MVP Valentine,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
My MVP Valentine,Hooch is crazy

My MVP Valentine,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
My MVP Valentine,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
My MVP Valentine,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
My MVP Valentine,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
My MVP Valentine,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
My MVP Valentine,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
My MVP Valentine,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
My MVP Valentine,that's a lot of content
My MVP Valentine,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
My MVP Valentine,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
My MVP Valentine,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
My MVP Valentine,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
My MVP Valentine,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
My MVP Valentine,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
My MVP Valentine,[deleted]
My MVP Valentine,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
My MVP Valentine,Any specific dates to go with this?
My MVP Valentine,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
My MVP Valentine,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
My MVP Valentine,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
My MVP Valentine,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
My MVP Valentine,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
My MVP Valentine,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
My MVP Valentine,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
My MVP Valentine,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
My MVP Valentine,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
My MVP Valentine,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
My MVP Valentine,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
My MVP Valentine,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
My MVP Valentine,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
My MVP Valentine,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
My MVP Valentine,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
My MVP Valentine,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
My MVP Valentine,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."

The Stranded,I had was hoping OA would get a season 3
The Stranded,Glow for sure bothers me. Daybreak was fun and definitely santa Clarita diet
The Stranded,"I'm not sure what you expect. From shows i've personally watched on this list, Altered Carbon, Luke Cage, Age of Resistance - they finished their current arcs. They might not have Big Finale, but they don't leave some main plots unresolved. Cage and Iron Fists were also cancelled due to Disney pulling their license. Glow got  kinda fucked and got cancelled due to increasing costs of production under COVID regulations. Mindhunter (i assume you mean Netflix production without  *s*) stalled production due to Fincher overthinking everything and moving to other projects.

A lot of best shows in history doesn't have Big Finale. They just... End, and the life continues after cameras are shut down. It doesn't make them in any way bad. Just not every story need Endgame as a finale to tie everything up in neat package. 

For clarity  i would recommend moving all non-originals on the bottom of the list."
The Stranded,"Deadly Class isn't a Netflix show.

October Faction got cancelled though."
The Stranded,"My take: very few shows stick the landing. Most shows have to stop, because the audience lost interest, usually because the quality dropped far enough. Why should their finale be anything memorable/mind blowing now? If nothing sticks with me after a series ends, it might as well end on a cliffhanger. Of course I'm sad about premature cancellations of shows I'm currently watching, but it isn't the first and won't be the last time. And when I'm sad about it, then it means it at least entertained me enough to care."
The Stranded,"Kim's Convenience The last episode they put the lights out, that is not a ending?"
The Stranded,"I can't do a list, but I know for a fact that I Am Not Okay With This was cut off at a clifflhanger, but to me it still felt quite satisfying. I hope I helped a bit ^^"
The Stranded,"If it’s not a Netflix Original, it’s not a Netflix show. Take them off the list lol. This thread…"
The Stranded,"I love this subreddits Netflix hate boner… how is this a “problem” for the service?  Networks have canceled shows forever, good and bad, the only difference here is that those mainly disappear from a catalog and Netflix has them there still.

This isn’t a new practice.  Maybe the idea of this thread isn’t a bad one, but it’s phrased in the same overly dramatic way anything about Netflix is posted here."
The Stranded,"If you're going to put Iron Fist and Luke Cage on here, you could put all of the other Marvel shows (Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones) on here too. Although I'm not sure they fit as neatly because generally all of the Marvel shows did have resolution to their season plots, just left some foreshadowing for the next seasons open."
The Stranded,Insatiable
The Stranded,"Daredevil

The Get Down - it had an ending, but it was clearly very rushed and the fates of certain characters were never revealed

Dogs of Berlin - Netflix never announced a cancellation, but it’s been 2.5 years since it was released and the final episode was inconclusive"
The Stranded,Crazyhead
The Stranded,Friends From College.
The Stranded,Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
The Stranded,Hemlock Grove had an ending.
The Stranded,Is altered carbon worth watching without a true ending? I was *just* about to start binging it.
The Stranded,"I'd love someone else's take, but I wouldn't say Designated Survivor fully had an ending. Netflix took over in Season 3, and then cancelled it."
The Stranded,"Thanks for adding Messiah, that show was shockingly smart"
The Stranded,Everything ends brother
The Stranded,"Probably Glitch Techs, but it still hasn't been officially announced as cancelled."
The Stranded,It's Bruno does not fit on this list. The first season was very self contained.
The Stranded,I think you'd be better off with a list of finished shows. That would be very short list.
The Stranded,The Mist?
The Stranded,"You have to define what you mean by *ending*. I would not consider many shows on your list, e.g Mind Hunter, need an ending."
The Stranded,Omg guys calm the fuck down. Its just words its not gonna hurt you. go out and touch some grass or some shit
The Stranded,[deleted]
The Stranded,V wars is apparently cancelled

The Stranded,Tidelands and Altered Carbon.
The Stranded,Cursed and Jupiters Legacy
The Stranded,Gypsy
The Stranded,"4400. Not a Netflix show but being streamed there. Got cancelled just as it was getting good.

Also The Beauty and The Baker. Again, not a Netflix show but streaming."
The Stranded,"Sword of trust. Actually a great movie, until suddenly it ends very annoyingly & with no real resolution.

I heard that a woman who directed & wrote it died, & that's very sad but releasing it without a real ending was a total bummer."
The Stranded,"La Revolution and Black Spot

Still salty about those two."
The Stranded,You could be meta with The OA and say that they're in our world lol
The Stranded,"Santa Clarita Diet doesn't have a conclusive ending with all questions answered, per se, but the end of it is an ending. If they had placed ""and they lived happily ever after"" on the screen after the last scene it would function perfectly fine as an ending."
The Stranded,"Defenders was a one off season if memory serves?

ASOUE followed the books so proper ending/planned."
The Stranded,"So mad about Dark Crystal, Glow and Mindhunter."
The Stranded,Sense8
The Stranded,Happy... great show
The Stranded,"I think insatiable has an ending, a comic ending for a comic series, it leaves open for more, but isint the same as the OA or Santa Clarita that really needed another season."
The Stranded,Insatiable got canceled after season 2
The Stranded,The Never Ending Stories TV version
The Stranded,"""Everything Sucks"" is the one that hurts the most for me because I think it was a pretty great first season and wanted to see more...but I can understand that it probably ended at a decent enough spot...until the guy's dad shows up!"
The Stranded,Mindhunter is just on hiatus.
The Stranded,the stranded was officially cancelled. i think its bruno had a nice ending and maybe we will even get new episodes since the show hasnt been cancelled.
The Stranded,I think I’d rather see a list of shows that have an ending so I k ow which ones to look through.
The Stranded,Everything sucks. It didn’t end on a cliffhanger but I know it only got one season
The Stranded,/r/doesitresolve
The Stranded,"It's been almost a year since it came out, and there's still no news on renewal/cancellation (which makes me think things don't look good for renewal), so I'm not sure if you'd count it, but I would say Julie and the Phantoms."
The Stranded,"Its ridiculous how much cancelled unfinished shit they have.  Like I've been saying ever since they cancelled Teenage Bounty Hunters, before long, people will need a ""does the dog die dot com,"" except it will be ""does the netflix show get cancelled without a finale dot com.""  Which is exactly what this thread is about in a way.     
         
Ten years from now their back catalog is going to just be a complete minefield of unfished shit that you are afraid to even bother starting.  Not to mention, who wants to start a new netflix show in its first season when the odds are that it gets cancelled are so high?"
The Stranded,If you're ana Amazon prime member Bosch is a fantastic series!
The Stranded,"I think only Bojack Horseman, OITNB and House of Cards have endings with only Bojack having a great final season.

I think the original shows that Netflix launched got their time and closure but none of the new stuff really has."
The Stranded,This should be stickied.
The Stranded,The show Colony. Notorious example cause they dragged us through a couple seasons
The Stranded,"Does it count if it's a foreign show Netflix just distributes? If so there's The Stranded. Ended on a cliffhanger, and I have no idea if it ever get a second season."
The Stranded,"One Day at a Time, though that's also Pop TV's fault and it's a sitcom so not the end of the world"
The Stranded,Dear White People
The Stranded,The last man on earth
The Stranded,I'd also add House of Cards. I know it has ending but definitely not the original one. They must have had to change lot of things.
The Stranded,Manifest. Started watching then found out it was canceled
The Stranded,Kim's Convenience
The Stranded,It makes me not want to watch some Netflix originals if there’s a large chance it won’t finish. Santa Clarita Diet cutoff was disappointing
The Stranded,it is pathetic.  they have cornered the market on so many things they are the only place making apocalypse stuff now and it always gets cancelled or sucks.
The Stranded,"I assume you’re doing this for other services and networks too?

I also assume you’ll figure out once you do that that other networks cancel shows more often than Netflix. 

What’s the purpose of this? What company do you work for?"
The Stranded,Travelers
The Stranded,Ozark
The Stranded,Hit and Run. Ends on a major cliffhanger and has been canceled by Netflix.
The Stranded,Ong. Yes. So Dick of no endings.  I’ve given up watching any new ones.  Done!
The Stranded,"Wow, just finished INSATIABLE.  Should have come here first.  NETFLX series are like roads with no warning signs, no road closed signs that end at a cliff overlooking the danged ocean and woosh, off you go into the water witn no hope.  Thank you so much for this list.  That's a LOT of hours of wasted time saved for me.  Time to go back to books I guess."
The Stranded,Hit and Run
The Stranded,"Look how long we had to wait for Peaky Blinders now that wait pissed me off, it takes so long on most new seasons I have to watch at least 3 episodes to remember how it left off, Why can’t Netflix not agree, but or whatever they do hold off on 1st season releases until they know if there will be an ending season or until they have the complete seasons with endings. I swear most of their releases with seasons are dead headers"
The Stranded,This whole thread is a shit show lol
The Stranded,True will remove
The Stranded,Will update. Thank you!
The Stranded,It’s also not a Netflix show
The Stranded,"Ya, I think Hannibal has a very satisfying ending despite it being open ended. 100% doesn’t belong on the list."
The Stranded,"> there is a cliff~~hanger~~

FTFY"
The Stranded,Agreed the ending is gorgeous but they set up something with bedelia at the table post credit. I think it was canceled so given that great ending but also a breadcrumb in case
The Stranded,It got so meta I kind of think we are *in* the third season now. It’s just happening all around us.
The Stranded,Is it not? I thought it was too.
The Stranded,"> they don't leave some main plots unresolved

Luke Cage and Dark Crystal definitely leave some major plots unresolved. Hell, the latter had a vision take place that was to set up further seasons. You literally see snippets of scenes that were supposed to be given context later.

Both shows are still worth watching IMO. But they definitely weren't completed, and so there's always going to be a little bit of me that's left unsatisfied with them."
The Stranded,[deleted]
The Stranded,Moved
The Stranded,Updated
The Stranded,"This is the truth that many failed to recognize (and is my gripe with the hatred GOT/Sopranos received at the end). It’s very hard to end a tv show well, and few have done it perfectly. The more tv you watch, the more you realize how many of them simply just end in a mediocre fashion, be it a poorly written ending, rushed finish or simply just fizzling out. I do think the expectation has been compounded with the emergence of binge watching tv shows from beginning to the end, which is a relatively different way to how tv was consumed before this era."
The Stranded,">  because the audience lost interest,

yeah, when you stretch the ending and pack it with boring fluff, that's what happens."
The Stranded,For sure. Thank you!
The Stranded,I don't think OP really understands what they're trying to talk about
The Stranded,Adding!
The Stranded,Daredevil has a perfect finish if you ignore the pos-credits scene.
The Stranded,Adding!
The Stranded,Will remove
The Stranded,"I don’t remember Hemlick Grove having an ending at all, wow I saw that one so long ago maybe I just forgot the lousy ending. I told my sister I think Netflix shows are like the B side of a 45 record in fact most are B movies. Unknown actors, actresses, and sorry but most of their series don’t finish tired of waiting for a season to conclude the series. I’m happier with Acorn TV, MHz Choice, & Walter presents my gripe on those when you first subscribe there is so many to see but damn their new add ins and replacing the old ones are far and in between. I love the shows they have but the ones that are on there never are replaced it’s been years for those they told me new ones every Tuesday THATS complete BS"
The Stranded,"Each season is pretty self contained. It was left open ended, but there isn’t some major cliffhanger that you need resolution to. The first season can also be watched alone if the slightly open ended nature of the second is off putting. I personally wouldn’t have included it on this list."
The Stranded,"My personal opinion is that Season 1 is awesome and I'm glad I saw it, but idk if I can say it's worth watching. It's kind of up to you. Sorry, I know that probably doesn't help much."
The Stranded,"Just watch the first season. It's prime cyberpunk noir goodness. S2 is a weird cw show hybrid with aliens and a generic forest. Don't even bother, s1 ends on a good note."
Maradona in Mexico,"I work in the film industry in New Mexico. There's an enormous amount of demand for studio space, and it's getting bigger every year. This new studio space is going to be incredibly productive for the state and for the pueblo. Huge win for New Mexico."
Maradona in Mexico,That’s really cool. I hope they’re successful.
Maradona in Mexico,I was already looking forward to Dark Winds; it's cool that they're able to shoot on native land like this. Should add some verisimilitude.
Maradona in Mexico,More competition in the industry and possibly diversifying styles seems good
Maradona in Mexico,"As a native actor, it’s very nice and encouraging to see this."
Maradona in Mexico,"Florida used to host many film and TV projects, due to excellent tax breaks that made it a great place to shoot. Unfortunately, Republican governor/ convicted criminal/current Senator/ all around piece of shit Rick Scott unilaterally abolished that program, because he didn't want ""Liberal Hollywood"" to get the benefit of Florida tax breaks and influence our citizens. So our neighbor, bright red Georgia, was happy to take the annual $8 billion in revenue that the movie/TV industry generated in our state. 

Just one more way that Rick Scott cost Florida billions of dollars and thousands of jobs."
Maradona in Mexico,"With Mexico rerouting through New Mexico instead of Texas. Hollywood, casinos, all great news for New Mexico. I’ve always been rooting for New Mexico. It needed so much TLC. The little state that could. I hope it begins to thrive, it deserves it, so much positive energy there."
Maradona in Mexico,"Fight the system?

Nay, leverage and CHANGE the system.

Well done. 👍🏼👍🏼"
Maradona in Mexico,Nice!
Maradona in Mexico,"This is amazing news for the tribe and film as a whole. 

I’ve wanted to move to New Mexico for film work for some time from AZ. 

Worried the rates wouldn’t be comparable to my commercial rate here."
Maradona in Mexico,"Oof. AMC… they’re just rolling the dice a different way. I hope it works out, but an AMC show is either really great, or a huge disappointment."
Maradona in Mexico,Just watched the trailer. Looks awesome. I think this could be AMCs next big thing. Finally moving away from the Walking Dead/Breaking Bad era. I’ll definitely be watching.
Maradona in Mexico,"After playing Far Cry 5, and was so enamored with Montana’s scenery that I decided to watch cinema made in Montana. Found only two movies but the scenes and setting were so beautiful that I have a hard time understanding why Montana isn’t a popular film location. 

The entirety of Fargo also makes it really easy to appreciate the biomes of that part of the northernmost US and I would like to see it a lot more than New York or San Francisco."
Maradona in Mexico,Dark Winds looks alright
Maradona in Mexico,Getting Hollywood to stop filming in Georgia and move to New Mexico instead is a brilliant move all the way around for everyone.
Maradona in Mexico,Good for them!
Maradona in Mexico,"well ,the Seminole own Hard Rock Cafe"
Maradona in Mexico,Love this
Maradona in Mexico,"This is a great idea and a boon for the industry as well as the tribe, I think.

So glad to see a business venture moved away from a vice like gambling into something more creative. God bless the Tesuque Purblo people in this endeavor!"
Maradona in Mexico,"Probably a good investment on their part. With more states taking about legalized gambling and online gambling, Reservation casinos are probably going to see a decline in revenue. Diversification is necessary. I hope it works out for them!"
Maradona in Mexico,"That’s cool, hope they make some serious money with it"
Maradona in Mexico,Now that's fucking brilliant? Are there any reservations in Georgia? They need their dance card yanked.
Maradona in Mexico,"There's literally no difference between a casino and a movie studio.

Both are filled with weird assholes."
Maradona in Mexico,"Who has the rights to the DC/ Vertigo comic book Scalped? Last I heard, the same guys who created Banshee was writing the Pilot"
Maradona in Mexico,this is going to end so badly!
Maradona in Mexico,Someone post this on r/amcstock
Maradona in Mexico,Is it really Hollywood if it's not IN Hollywood
Maradona in Mexico,If it's tax exempt then they are assholes
Maradona in Mexico,Such a brilliant and creative idea. Kudos to them!
Maradona in Mexico,It’s time!
Maradona in Mexico,I kinda want them to make a western where every native role is portrayed by actual natives and they cast a bunch of Filipino people to play white people and pretend like its normal
Maradona in Mexico,Hell yeah!!!!
Maradona in Mexico,Dark winds looks cool.  Excited to check it out!
Maradona in Mexico,Saw a dark winds advert today and now I do recall the set and setting was remarkable. Interesting.
Maradona in Mexico,Amazing
Maradona in Mexico,Is this all because of Breaking Bad?
Maradona in Mexico,Didn't Netflix just build a $1 billion filming lot there in Albuquerque?
Maradona in Mexico,"While this is all true, we've seen this story before. Who knows how long this'll last before the  incentives go away and everyone picks up and leaves."
Maradona in Mexico,How easy is it to network/get work comparable to LA? About the same?
Maradona in Mexico,"I’m also in the film industry working out of Atlanta.

Is New Mexico really as booming as they say? Because many productions that I’m aware of that shot there still hired Atlanta crew. So is this influx of productions good for New Mexicans or just good for the productions who want tax breaks."
Maradona in Mexico,How do rates in New Mexico compare to LA? Considering the move. From AZ. In commercials now
Maradona in Mexico,I fucking love New Mexico. Favorite state to vist
Maradona in Mexico,Too bad the tax credits won’t apply…
Maradona in Mexico,"That area could really use some money. When I was near there, it seemed like everyone had to fight for any kind of work in Los Alamos if they wanted a chance to survive in that area."
Maradona in Mexico,Indubitably
Maradona in Mexico,Adding *verisimilitude* to my lexicon.
Maradona in Mexico,"Yeah, *really* looking forward to this second go-round on the Hillerman series. I remember when *Masterpiece Theatre* on PBS did *Dark Wind* and *Skinwalkers/Thief of Time/Coyote Waits* back in the early '00s (which also had Chris Eyre as a director) when it was Wes Studi and Adam Beach as Leaphorn and Chee."
Maradona in Mexico,"I agree, shallow and pedantic."
Maradona in Mexico,I learned about that word from the movie American Pie back in 1999. Good times.
Maradona in Mexico,Versi what ?
Maradona in Mexico,My Favorite Word!!!
Maradona in Mexico,"I don’t know what tribe it is in New Mexico, but I know some areas they believe that photos steal the soul. It’s especially in an area between Santa Fe and Albuquerque."
Maradona in Mexico,"Hopefully it also affords more native actors and native-led productions ability to realize projects, even if the Hollywood engine slows."
Maradona in Mexico,"I love it. Reservation Dogs, Dark Winds, the movie Prey that's coming out soon. I remember listening to Sterlin Harjo on Tigerbelly talk about how studios were ok with Native stories but wanted white leads (like Red Road, etc). It's about time."
Maradona in Mexico,"Of course, POS Rick Scott would argue that Georgia is now purple. Which is a beautiful thing."
Maradona in Mexico,"It's kind of insane how many pieces of media from video games to movies have the Georgia Media logo on them. 

 https://imgur.com/Wqglbrg.jpg"
Maradona in Mexico,I fucking hate Skelator. I don’t understand how he beat out Bill Nelson. Didn’t Rick Scott ban any mention of climate change while he was governor? You know the state that is at the most risk of sinking into the ocean?!? (Maybe Louisiana will sink first because it’s constant water level issue)
Maradona in Mexico,One Florida’s trash is another Georgia’s treasure.. as the saying goes.
Maradona in Mexico,"It had happened in New Mexico too, NM was courting Hollywood with tax breaks which is why a huge portion of shows and movies were made in the mid-2000s (Breaking Bad, Thor, No Country for Old Men, Little Miss Sunshine), but republican Susana Martinez got rid of all of them and almost burnt entirely the Hollywood relationship. The only reason Breaking Bad kept filming was the because the setting of Albuquerque was way too well established. Eventually the massive loss of revenue as well it being a deeply unpopular decision made Martinez reverse the decision (and dubbed it the Breaking Bad rule, that idiot) and initially I was worried the industry wouldn’t ever come back but it’s nice to see that it’s been forgiven somewhat."
Maradona in Mexico,That and you would hard pressed to find a blank acre of Florida anymore to shoot anything. We are so overpopulated. It sucks because Florida has so many cool places and if it was only preserved to benefit the movie industry at least it would be preserved.
Maradona in Mexico,"I moved to New Mexico less than two years ago. It really is a nice, interesting state. It has huge honking crime and poverty issues, but hopefully those will improve."
Maradona in Mexico,"It’ll be interesting to see how much New Mexico grows and changes from all this.  To me New Mexico is Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, and road construction.  So I’d like to see more stuff but still spread out when passing through.  Maybe even stay longer next time."
Maradona in Mexico,Natives know fighting the system doesn't always work *see natives when it comes to everything when dealing with the US Gov* but finding and leveraging an exploit is a great way to combat the system.
Maradona in Mexico,All I need is better call saul
Maradona in Mexico,I really liked Longmire and I'm hoping this scratches that itch of wanting more (and I think there's a very good chance of it)
Maradona in Mexico,"There isn’t shit in Montana, that’s why. I don’t mean that as an insult - Montana’s one of the prettiest places in the United States. But a big reason Georgia has seen a big boom in film production over the last fifteen years is due to the ease of moving around. A production can situate itself in Atlanta, but twenty minutes or less outside the city, you’re in small town America if you need that. You can be in the sticks in less than an hour. There are freeways aplenty to make navigating these disparate locations easy, as well. Similar for Northern Ireland on the Europe side - headquarter production in Belfast, you can find beaches, woods, farms, etc. less than an hour away if that’s what your production requires.

Montana, by contrast, is almost entirely rural. The biggest city in the state is Billings, which has just over 100K people. The top five cities in the state do not equal the population of Atlanta, for comparison. Any story that requires a dense urban center couldn’t convincingly find one there. Even shooting in downtown Billings would have mountains and lush green prominently in the background. Then there’s the weather, which is brutal. It’s *cold* in Montana for most of the year. Like even in summer, it gets frigid. You’re lucky if you get two months that feel like a summer there some years. That’s not mentioning the rain, thunder storms, and wildfires. Poor weather is a big deterrent for film productions, as they work long hours and need dependable conditions.

Unless it is something with a huge budget or an acclaimed filmmaker behind it, the trick to filming location for most things is finding somewhere close to an urban epicenter (which can provide set space) that has a surrounding area that can pass for rural if necessary. Montana, much as I love it, doesn’t have so many of the ingredients necessary to have a streamlined, smooth production. A lot of money would have to be spent setting up a production there, and since there isn’t an industry there in the first place, that means you’re burning a lot of cash you could save filming in other places. I imagine tax incentives are another part of it, as many others have mentioned in this thread."
Maradona in Mexico,Why is that?
Maradona in Mexico,About that whole “reservations in Georgia” thing…
Maradona in Mexico,"It almost always does on reservation property. There are no property rights or recourse when contracts are violated. That's why no one builds houses on reservations, even though you could."
Maradona in Mexico,"Wrong AMC. AMC the channel is owned by AMC Networks, but AMC Theaters is a different company.

Both are publicly traded"
Maradona in Mexico,"From article:

>Because the Tesuque land is its own nation, productions that shoot here are not eligible for New Mexico’s tax incentives"
Maradona in Mexico,You really have a problem with natives using tax exemptions to make money? Isn't that like the least we owe them?
Maradona in Mexico,That’s literally one of the reasons they have reservations
Maradona in Mexico,Damn how dare people who's land was stolen and ancestors were brutalized and murdered not pay taxes
Maradona in Mexico,"We literally genocide them. 

It’s the least they deserve."
Maradona in Mexico,You seem upset. Guess they’re just better business people than you are.
Maradona in Mexico,Damn you got owned!!!
Maradona in Mexico,"A lot of sci-fi opportunities there as well. A very wide range of natural scenery that isn’t congested with people, the weather is consistent, it’s got a great spooky, otherworldly vibe but it’s versatile and could mimic a lot of other places with few tweaks. These are a few geographical reasons it would be ideal. I’m sure there are a plethora of financial positives as that is usually the kicker."
Maradona in Mexico,I thought it was due to the tax rebates?
Maradona in Mexico,Little miss sunshine.
Maradona in Mexico,Basically every Western you've ever seen has at least some scenes filmed in New Mexico.
Maradona in Mexico,BB and BCS
Maradona in Mexico,"Used to be state sponsored tax incentives (I wanna say it was around 30% of the budget?) luring studios to shoot there (that’s why you see tons of shows shot in Georgia or Canada (- the “made in georgia” logo at the end credits is a requirement of the tax rebate) if the rebate is significant enough, studios will come and shoot - but imho for these policies to actually work in the long run, you need to mandate a threshold of local hires/local spend and min% of actual production taking place within the state to trigger the rebates - I assume that’s still the case?  But to your point, I feel like breaking bad helped foster a skilled production labor pool, which is vital (along with incentives, facilities, etc) in building a lasting entertainment production economy in NM. Remember a metric shit ton of reality shows from Alaska?  Shortly after deadliest catch came out they started offering filming incentives (At one point, there were over 20 shows shooting there at the same time. ) - AK repealed the incentive laws because they didn’t really mandate local hires - it was just a bunch of people being flown in to make the shows and the state didn’t see any immediate financial benefit after doing it for a bunch of years -  studios naturally saw it as a n easy way to save tons of money for dirt cheap content (no unions either) so Alaska ended up sending tons of money out of state for what amounted to a glorified tourism campaign and a giveaway for Discovery, et al."
Maradona in Mexico,"It's the other way around. 

NM has had production tax incentives for a long time now. Breaking Bad was originally set in LA, but they rewrote it as Albuquerque for this very reason."
Maradona in Mexico,"Yep, the film industry is practically booming here now and it’s awesome"
Maradona in Mexico,North Carolina here. I concur
Maradona in Mexico,"Things are really spread out and open here, so the drive would likely be longer... but there's next to zero traffic ever, even during rush hours, so it probably evens out time-wise but is a nicer drive here than in LA."
Maradona in Mexico,"The lack of local below the line workers is a problem. I'm currently on the statewide curriculum development committee for the governor's Next Generation Media Academy. Combined with the state's Opportunity Scholarship, it's going to be possible for anyone in NM to go to college (anywhere in the state) for one year for free, and be trained to work on sets. IATSE and the state film office are helping place everyone who goes through the program in a paid summer on-set internship. It will take a few years, but I think it's a good plan for developing local set labor."
Maradona in Mexico,ABQ is an absolute playground. There is so much to do. Outdoor activities out the wazoo. Cool and unique restaurants. Live music in old town. All that and character to boot. Not to mention all the art spaces.
Maradona in Mexico,Hopefully they can get work in Non-union shoots. With non union or their own union and tax exemptions this plan will get more productions and jobs to the reservation
Maradona in Mexico,Perchance.
Maradona in Mexico,Forsooth
Maradona in Mexico,It's a good word.
Maradona in Mexico,Adding lexicon to my wordy-bank.
Maradona in Mexico,"Use *verisimilitude*

Thanks Professor!"
Maradona in Mexico,"""In an effort to *expand* my vocabulary, every day I learn a new word that will help to increase the verisimilitude of my arguments.  Anyway, today's word is 'expand'."""
Maradona in Mexico,"Double click the word, right click ""Google 'this word'""."
Maradona in Mexico,"Whatever the truth of that is, I feel very confident that that doesn't apply to this group."
Maradona in Mexico,If the tribe believed that they wouldn't convert the casino into a film studio then.
Maradona in Mexico,Really? I always heard that belief associated with indigenous Australians.

Go Go Squid,"> Italy’s 2,500 dubbing industry workers are on a protracted strike demanding higher wages, less frenzied work conditions, and protection against digital dubbing devices, which they claim threaten their jobs.


> The country’s unions representing Italian voice actors and dubbing directors have been on the war path since Feb. 21. On Tuesday they announced the strike will continue for at least another week.


> The unions are demanding that standard contract wages that have remained unvaried for the past 15 years be raised. But they are also clamoring for the right to be able to work at a slower pace, claiming that “current production rhythms are not conducive to [good] quality of work and of life,” according to a statement issued by Italian dubbers’ union ANAD. 


For people who might be wondering about 'Andor' thumbnail..


> Bianchi, a voice actor, is the regular Italian voice of international stars including Stellan Skarsgård. He most recently featured in the “Star Wars” series “Andor.” Bianchi said the time crunch prompted by more Hollywood movies going out day-and-date along with the increase in product that needs to be dubbed for the Italian market have been causing “an insane work rhythm where it’s impossible to maintain our quality standards that have been steadily deteriorating for a long time.”


> Italy, where local audiences until recently rejected subtitles en masse, “once stood out around the world for the level of excellence of its dubbing quality,” said Bianchi who as a dubbing director recently oversaw the Italian version of Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans.” “We want to work better, with more time at our disposal,” he noted."
Go Go Squid,"A few years and AI will be able to completely translate movies with the voice of original actors. Good luck fighting for higher salary against a cheaper and more reliable option.

One of the first casualilty, AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore."
Go Go Squid,"This will be a hard fight for them, Italians speak with their hands too."
Go Go Squid,"I’m not very optimistic on this issue. The Luddite movement wasn’t able to secure any kind of job security, this won’t be any different."
Go Go Squid,Is the tech good enough to replace them yet? I was under the impression it was close but not quite there yet.
Go Go Squid,"They haven't seen anything yet, with deepfake video/audio technology, in 10\~20 years you will have on demand dubbing in actors voices and with lip-syncing."
Go Go Squid,"I’m gonna leave this here:

Why Obsidian uses AI voices for game development



This is terrifying"
Go Go Squid,AI making music. AI making posters. AI doing translations. It does seem like AI could end up taking over everything. Does that really benefit humans though? Maybe the rich executives. But everyone else? It seems like there should be limits on this.
Go Go Squid,"Saw some article the other day taking about AI screenwriting, but AI can't generate ideas. To me, this is the real threat to writers - all of the non glamorous, non creative work. The day jobs. And not just for writers either, there are going to be hundreds of people who get put out of work because the computer can do it now. What will a day job look like in the future? Will everyone even be able to get one?"
Go Go Squid,"That's just the direction we are going though. Why would I want to pay someone for one job when I can buy a program and have it do all types of jobs for me forever? 

Imagine how much we could get done. 3D printing for construction, automated vehicles, ai for education and a wide range of other things. 

Honestly there's no turning back."
Go Go Squid,"We need to start enacting some form of measures to protect jobs regardless of how good AI is at doing them. I’m in support of protests like these. So long as we’re going to live in a capitalist world and jobs are going to be necessary, we need to take steps to protect them. People think AI taking jobs will happen slowly and will be resolved by it miraculously creating new jobs. This is only somewhat true. It will create *some* new jobs, but overwhelmingly it will delete entire career paths and this threatens to *massively* destabilize global economy. Companies and governments need to start enacting policies to protect those jobs or OTHERWISE abandon a capitalist system and start developing an infrastructure that can support people who can not work because of their job being replaced"
Go Go Squid,"Oh wow, it’s almost like AI has no place in creative fields and will only realistically be used to screw over actually talented *people* because it’s cheaper.

What a goddamn surprise."
Go Go Squid,"Yeah idk if not working is the solution to stop something that’s taking their jobs. But I side with the dubbers. It’s inevitable that studios will choose the cheaper option, but the use of AI needs legislation and fast. Either through taxation or general devaluing if AI is involved, something like a limiting MSRP on AI involvement, the free market never corrects things for the betterment of the disenfranchised. If it’s cheaper to produce, it should be cheaper to consume."
Go Go Squid,"And typesetters lost their minds when digital printing gutted the industry. 

Good luck with that boys, you're better off looking for your next career than chasing the scraps of the last one."
Go Go Squid,Video killed the radio star...
Go Go Squid,"It sucks, I hate that AI just happened and all of sudden millions of people’s jobs are threatened. We need legislation to protect workers from AI and to limit the reach of AI products. Otherwise we’re going to lose a lot of potential creatives who are going to give up before they even start."
Go Go Squid,I remember when I heard the story of elevator operators going on strike when the automatic elevator with buttons was invented and being installed in select places. Going in strike like this might make their jobs more obsolete
Go Go Squid,We live in a dystopia without all the cool blue/pink neon lights.
Go Go Squid,The dubbing industry sounds like they are reading actuarial tables. I would rather just read the closed captioning than listen to the dubbers deliver the lines without any emotion.
Go Go Squid,"It’s shocking people only discussing this now, this has been a long time coming as we have seen automation take over. But I guess those in the creative industries thought they would be immune and didn’t care. Now it’s too late and their loosing their jobs"

Go Go Squid,"The help doth protest too much, methinks"
Go Go Squid,"Their jobs only go faster with them not there doing them… it’s a lose lose, but those jobs are gone. They should have tried to find a way to profit from the incoming ai takeover unfortunately. I know it sucks though."

Go Go Squid,Fuck “human working conditions” I want “human living conditions”
Go Go Squid,AI will be the downfall of humanity.
Go Go Squid,"The absolute worst thing about this thread is that there are people saying that's it's ok, just another obsolete job to be replaced. All hail the progress. Just like horses and cars, right?

In which universe is listening to a robotic soulless voice better than enjoying the emotions conveyed by a real human? Just because it's cheaper and faster? I don't care how good the AI gets, as a human I want to see and listen to other humans. I crave human connection, and I want humans to tell me their stories and feelings through media. I don't care what a machine spews out, no matter how good it is, because it is a fucking machine.

How much do you have to hate yourself to be ok with that on a personal level"
Go Go Squid,Dubbing should just be stopped. Unless it's kids shows.
Go Go Squid,"i kind of feel this is like mathematicians going on strike because someone invented the calculator, ai is a tool, not a replacement, and at the end of the day the world doesn't give a shit if ur out of a job if it means easier and more effective means of getting shit done, dont get upset because the world is changing and you are becoming obsolete, adapt or die its simple evolution"
Go Go Squid,"There goong to be jobs replaced by AI, that just what it is."
Go Go Squid,"It's the cotton gin all over again.

If it's crested by humans, it's human."
Go Go Squid,As someone who is Italian and has worked in the Italian dubbing industry: they are pathetic. Hope they'll start looking into new careers :)
Go Go Squid,VO actors go on strike against AI? Sounds like a perfect time to double down on AI!
Go Go Squid,"Hey guys, if you really want to see and hear something more interesting Italian or want to create italian video by using dubbing software use https://wavel.ai/solutions/dubbing/"
Go Go Squid,Sounds to me like Hollywood just needs to get copies of work prints out to these dubbing studios earlier to prevent the last minute crunch that seems to be plaguing them.
Go Go Squid,They also not being paid since months
Go Go Squid,Aye yes.  Convince your employers to not use machines by making your own labor more expensive to use.  What could possibly go wrong
Go Go Squid,So It sounds like automation can help lighten the load so they don’t work as much?
Go Go Squid,"Who cares. Italians, just use subtitles like normal people"
Go Go Squid,"There are already demos out there of software that can not only output text in the original actors’s voice but also change lip movement to match.  In ten years, dubbing will likely be a dead occupation."
Go Go Squid,"A lot of streaming services already use machine translations for subtitles, and the result is often absolute trash; sloppy, mistranslations and mixing up words, direct translation of idioms, etc.  
  
Just yesterday I saw one show on D+ translate ""headshot"" into the ""shot in the head"" meaning rather than the ""photography used in the entertainment business"" meaning, saying a guy had shot his cat in the head many times (""he has many headshots of his cat""), which changed the tone of the scene rather drastically."
Go Go Squid,"Yep. I'm a writer for a fortune 50 and pump out press releases, been doing it for ten years now. If I'm already testing AI to make by own job easier, you can bet your ass that my days are numbered.

These guys are pretty foolish to believe they're going to win this cause."
Go Go Squid,UBI
Go Go Squid,"Needed? No.

Should still exist? Absolutely. 

AI has no place in the creative fields and only braindead techbros think otherwise."
Go Go Squid,">AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore.

People have been learning that continuously for centuries now, only difference here is that this is the first time ever that creatives are being bitten on the ass and they are doing what they do best: making drama out of the whole thing"
Go Go Squid,"Luddites are actually a surprisingly apt analogy. Like these workers, they weren't against the machines themselves, they targeted companies that used machines to skirt labor laws. We have a lot better worker's rights now though so fingers crossed for this union. AI is like other tools in that it can be used inhumanely or horrifically, that's up to us."
Go Go Squid,It requires training data and many new contracts are including the stipulation to use the VA’s lines in that data set.
Go Go Squid,"It can't match human quality, but it's decent enough in many cases that bottom-line companies will go with that since it's vastly faster and cheaper. 

If you read ""AI""-translated stuff, it's generally about ~~80%~~ 90% ~~indistinguishable~~ raises no eyebrows, 9% correct but reads a little weird, and 1% things that are just not accurate or that haven't translated properly. For an exec or someone who is more concerned with the bottom line than conveying the spirit of the text, that's usually good enough. The problem then becomes, are enough people willing to pay for that extra level of quality to sustain an industry? The programs are being trained on the work of translators, but those translators are not seeing economic benefit from it. They are, in a sense, competing with their past work in a system where the bottom line is all-too-frequently the final word.

Economic concerns aside, the real killer is that iterative learning will always (at least so far as I've seen) favor textual fidelity over the voice of the text, and doesn't have the ability to make executive decisions based on outside knowledge. One of the benefits of a really good translator is that they understand the stuff that isn't being said, the metatext of language that accompanies and accentuates our diction and syntax. For example, *Les Misérables* (which has been translated into English at least 4 times, and possibly as many as 8 depending on how derivative a work can be before being considered its own translation) was written in the vernacular French of the mid-19th century. Victor Hugo was intentionally writing for a universal audience, but by modern standards his prose would be considered significantly elevated (in no small part because the style of writing he used became seen as respectable thanks to his work). One issue that translators have grappled with is, where do you split that difference? (Notably, Hugo hated the first (Wilbur) translation of the novel, he is reported to have declared upon reading it that ""translation is censorship."")

Of the translations, the three I want to look at are Norman Denny (1976), Julie Rose (2007), and Christine Donougher (2013). These are generally agreed to be the best available (fun fact, an 1863 edition had the anti-slavery parts excised so it could be sold to Confederate soldiers during the Civil War!) and anyone looking to read Les Mis in English is generally steered towards one of them. (Maybe less so Denny these days, but of the 20th-century translations his is the best-regarded)

However, they have vastly different approaches to the language and structure of the story. Denny chose to make editorial alterations to language and remove parts he considered irrelevant to the overall story being told, an interesting choice considering Victor Hugo's insistence upon the importance of his digressions. He favored an ""old-feeling"" voice, to make the novel feel its age. [The opening page as per Denny, including a somewhat representative phrase:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-denny-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was said of him that his father, intending him to inherit his office, had arranged for him to marry at a very early age, about eighteen or twenty, following the custom that was fairly widespread in parliamentary families.""

Rose, by contrast, kept everything in but ""modernized"" the language, stating that she wanted it to feel to a reader like they were relating to the text in the same way that a 19th-century French reader would have. [Her first page, with the same line quoted below:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-rose-les-miserables-1.png)

>They reckoned his father had put him down to inherit his position and so had married him off very early in the piece when he was only eighteen or twenty, as they used to do quite a lot in parliamentary families.

Donougher seeks to find a middle ground, updating the cadence to be accessible to readers without using the same level of explicitly modern language. [Her introduction to the bishop, and that same line:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-donougher-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was reported that his father, intending that his son should inherit his position, had married him off very young, aged eighteen or twenty, a fairly common practice among parliamentary families.

The same information is being conveyed in all three of these, but the voice of the translator is evident.

Now, imagine you want to do an ""AI""-driven translation of Les Mis. How on earth do you begin to parse this? Do you train it exclusively on French from the 19th century? Exclusively on Hugo? Do you feed it every Les Mis translation we have, or the collected works of a single translator? Issues of ownership aside (and I would argue that any translator would have very solid grounds for legal action if their translations were used to create a new translation that did not include them in profit-sharing), the voices are not just divergent, but actively trying to do different things, and no program can even come close to matching that."
Go Go Squid,"check this out: https://beta.elevenlabs.io

not perfect, but they’re getting there"
Go Go Squid,"I don't think it's there yet for dubbing, because you need to also match the other person's lip movements.

But it's just a matter of time."

Go Go Squid,"Uh, my brother in christ, that is happening right now. [Bruce Willis already did it.](https://collider.com/bruce-willis-sells-rights-to-deepfake-firm-deepcake/)"
Go Go Squid,"It's depressing because instead of being democratic and making all of our lives easier, AI seems to already be going to direction of empowering corporations over people and fortifying their grip on people's time and labor.

Time is the most valuable resource any of us have, and yet the vast majority of people have been losing it while the elite few reap the value of that time, turning it into more money than they could spend in many life times."
Go Go Squid,"Terrifying? More like fascinating.

They use it in the stage of the game where it would be economically impossible to use real voice actors. When you are creating the dialogues and doing tons of re-writes and all kinds of changes... you cannot have the whole cast of VAs behind your back reading the lines. But now with AI the writer can actually hear what they are writing with the correct expression and emotion.

Also, it's fascinating that the AI voice company in the video chose a route that still gets the VAs involved paid. Noone is losing anything in this scenario. Only gaining."
Go Go Squid,Why is this terrifying? It doesn’t seem like a bad thing to me.
Go Go Squid,"i think it sounds like shit, honestly. if i had heard it without knowing what it was, i would be remarking on how crap these voice actors are."
Go Go Squid,It would benefit humanity if we change our economic system.
Go Go Squid,"Not trying to be glib, but who do you think will be using/purchasing it? It will probably take over some areas because it will be in demand. If people mostly decide to not consume it, then it won't."
Go Go Squid,Ok buggy whipper
Go Go Squid,"I don't think I'd want to watch an AI created series even if it's good. Who knows though, maybe that will change. I wouldn't want to buy AI artwork either because it loses all appeal to me. Maybe as a wallpaper but that's about it.

Wonder if that will be the popular opinion going forward or not."
Go Go Squid,"> AI can't generate ideas 
 
People used to say ""AI can't draw like a human"" and see where we are now."
Go Go Squid,Then there will be no use for humans and it will kill us off
Go Go Squid,"Fully agree. All techbros can say is just ""lmao just stop doing your obsolete job and get a better one"" but HOW are THOUSANDS of people going to, what, become programmers and nurses? This is absolutely ridiculous."
Go Go Squid,"Good luck with that. 

The advent of useful AI systems is no different than the mass adoption of the internet. It will be disruptive, some people will lose their jobs, but entire new industries will arise that nobody has yet even conceived. 

The sun will rise in the east, babies will be born, things will go on."
Go Go Squid,Ai creative writing continues to be disappointing and soulless. The only worry I have is if people fall for the astroturf and fake pr campaigns that accompanies the shitty writing.
Go Go Squid,"I can’t believe that in the first year of having AI, the main things I’ve heard it threatening are artistic fields… art, music etc… the one thing that I thought wouldn’t be able to be emulated by a robot.    
Where are the robots taking real estate, banking, finance, law and management jobs!"
Go Go Squid,"it's pretty much already too later. There's a ton of communities generating thousands if millions of high quality AI art. and it's only getting better. it really does suck.

one thing though is that it does have to learn styles and you can tell a ton of it is pulling heavily from just a few dozen or less styles. Like a ton of it just seems like it's drawn by the same person.

And even when you take AI out of the equation, Chinese ""artists"" have been tracing real artists for decades and selling it as original art. They for example, will trace art of Sailor Moon and change the hair to make it look like Misty from Pokemon and copy the painting style and then make 5+ variants of that artwork with Misty in different stages of undress.

But then thing is they do this in a sweat shop type setting where they have dozens of people churning out these traced drawings every month and they're all pretending to be one person, typically a pretending to be a girl to get more willing supporters that'll pay ""her"" a lot of money because they know people are more likely donate to a female artist than a male artist who draws quality NSFW art.

It's no different from the AI art. AI makes it worse, maybe...I'm sure there are people selling AI art as if they're making it themselves, but it'd be pretty impossible to fool other people who just use it as a hobby, which a lot of these communities do. From what I've seen, they like using it make stuff they want to see...which might seem obvious, but most don't seem to be using it for any business reasons. Seems to be a lot of it's done for a laugh and...of course...porn. Some really questionable porn (as in deep fake type of stuff where they have the AI make nude paintings of celebrities) and less questionable, of their favorite cartoon characters. 


It's probably really gonna suck in like 10 years when people can more easily do it. Right now, installing that stuff and figuring out how to run it is hard for the average person, so you have to spend money monthly using websites or use free websites that do it for you, but they're limited.

Eventually one of these people is gonna make a user friendly version...maybe...they seem to be completely unable or unwilling to do that which might be for the better I guess...and a lot of the people who like to post AI art that ""they create"" are unwilling to share how they create it because they want to remain unique and special. If everyone starts ""making"" AI art, they wont feel special anymore. So it's being held back to some extent at least...but...yeah, it's already at a point where it makes really great looking images and wide spread."
Go Go Squid,"Every company activity needs to have an average monetary value attached to it equivalent to the monetary cost of having a skilled human do the same task.  

Companies need to report these tasks to the tax authorities when done by automation.  And then taxed to an extent that will allow the creation of stable universal basic income."
Go Go Squid,"machine learning and automation has been eliminating jobs in the business world for a decade+ now, and no one cared that much. its because art is such a visual and publicly consumed industry that people care more now"

Go Go Squid,"I see the exact opposite. AI creating content as good as, or better, that a lot of people can use/consume and thus improve their situations/realities. We just need to relocate people that have their jobs immediately replaced, they will benefit from it too. This argument is no different than saying we should limit development of cars to protect the jobs of horse breeders, or protect VHS from DVD and so on. Change will always come"

Go Go Squid,The wheel is technology.
Go Go Squid,People are already being killed by machines. I don't think the victims care if the decision to drop the bomb came from a drone operator on the other side of the globe or a machine learning program.
Go Go Squid,"> AI will find no logical purpose for us

And do what with that information?"
Go Go Squid,I get the concept of cinema “purity” but there are people that legitimately struggle with reading and it’s not a bad thing to be inclusive of those people.
Go Go Squid,"That's been happening for several year now, but not for the purpose of helping dub studios. It's because streamers tend to launch titles globally all at once, and strive to have all the dubs ready at title launch. Whereas in the olden days, you could spread out the dubbing work because regional launches were on different time frames."
Go Go Squid,"Sounds like they just need to be okay with distributing subtitled versions day-and-date and releasing the dubs later, when they're ready.

Of course, that still poses a challenge for localization and subtitling teams..."
Go Go Squid,Film production doesn't work like that and rarely will
Go Go Squid,How did you manage to fit that many grammatical into this short of a sentence?
Go Go Squid,"It could, but we live under capitalism, where automation is used to help the bottom line of the owners."
Go Go Squid,"I'm afraid it's going to be much sooner than that but that's definitely a safe guess. We'll also have CGI indistinguishable from reality.

AI is great but my general opinion is that it will be more bad than good for people."
Put Your Head on My Shoulder,"- I Love Lucy. Iconic comedy that popularized the multi-camera approach with a live studio audience and the approach to syndication. 

- All in the Family. Incorporated discussion of current events, becoming a cultural touchstone during a time of substantial social change. 

- Seinfeld. Perfected the approach of separate disconnected plots, each individually funny, coming together for a larger punchline at the end. 

- The Simpsons. A massive stack of instantly recognizable plots and characters and gags that spans literal generations.  

Just off the list: Cheers, Cosby Show (due to the... unpleasantness), Arrested Development.

Green Eggs and Ham,"You'd likely be surprised at the list of A-list and B-list celebs who wanted in on something like this but didn't get it. Some projects exist entirely to fulfill contract obligations, and Dr Seuss properties are pretty much zero-risk, both reputationally and financially."
Green Eggs and Ham,"The cast is good, Sam-I-Am"
Green Eggs and Ham,"Actually, those of us who are animation nuts were all over it from Day 1, not so much for the stacked cast but because it was the first big animated show on Netflix that wasn't being done by Dreamworks, but by Warner Bros (which we all assumed would always end up on HBO or some other place). :D  The animation is one big love letter to Chuck Jones.

And if you think that cast is stacked, check out the voice cast on *Dark Crystal: The Age of Resistance*, some time. :)"
Green Eggs and Ham,"It's pretty much the only Dr. Seuss adaptation that I think really captures the spirit of his work. The cast is great, but it's the animation team that are the true MVPs."
Green Eggs and Ham,"> massive amount of talent

[https://i.imgur.com/i0hxKWs.gif](https://i.imgur.com/i0hxKWs.gif)"
Green Eggs and Ham,"Actually, not so much Seuss/Geisel to my mind as mad **Chuck Jones**\-lovers.

[Geisel's illustrative style](https://www.drseussart.com/illustration-art/i-like-them-sam-i-am-daasz) is pretty different from [the show](https://www.awn.com/animationworld/warner-bros-and-netflix-deliver-beautifully-hand-drawn-green-eggs-and-ham), which has much more of [a Chuck Jones feel](https://www.comic-mint.com/chuck-jones/applause-wb-00530)."
Green Eggs and Ham,Anybody with an opinion on season 1?
Green Eggs and Ham,"Shockingly, it was really fun."
Green Eggs and Ham,Never expected to get emotional over Dr. Suess characters until I seen the entire series.
Green Eggs and Ham,Really enjoyed season 1! Might not be as Seuss like as people want but it still had great animation with a fittingly fun voice cast. Honestly didn’t expect to be that engaged with it but it was a very enjoyable binge.
Green Eggs and Ham,"Season 1 took all my expectations for a Green Eggs and Ham show and blew them to the moon. On top of being without question the most gorgeous animated series I've ever seen, the characters and story were hilarious and heart wrenching to the end. Basically, it's really *really* good."
Green Eggs and Ham,[deleted]
Green Eggs and Ham,"Love the first couple of minutes in Episode 1 where the narrator was shocked at Sam-I-Am as a spy saying ""This is suppose to be based on a Dr. Seuss work"" or something like that."
Green Eggs and Ham,"After finishing Season 1 after it first dropped. That gave me more hope on Warner Brothers' Animation doing a feature-film adaptation of ""The Cat In The Hat""."
Green Eggs and Ham,Great in what way?
Green Eggs and Ham,"Compared to Illumination (The Lorax and The Grinch) and Universal (The Cat In The Hat), this show managed to give a modern take on Dr Seuss characters more justice."
Green Eggs and Ham,Til this show exists. Seems fun and based on your enthusiasm will watch with kiddo.
Green Eggs and Ham,"Well, the main thing is that S2 of *Green Eggs and Ham,* isn't *Green Eggs & Ham,* but *The Butter Battle Book.* :)  For me, I think the issue is that the hiatus between the two seasons was >2 years, so it's harder as a viewer to pick up the threads and march forward.  But also we don't have a Chickeraffe to liven up the season as much, and the storyline has mostly split Guy from Sam, the relationship at the core of S1. 

OTOH, all the James Bond/spy movie references are kind of killing it. 

I don't like it as much as S1, but I'm still entertained by it and wouldn't say no to a third serving."
Green Eggs and Ham,I agree it was really well done.
Green Eggs and Ham,"Watching it with my son right now. I'm enjoying it. Adam Devine is actually killing it with his voice acting, I'm pleasantly surprised."
Green Eggs and Ham,I haven't even finished the first episode but I can already say this is some of the best 2D animation produced in the west in years.
Green Eggs and Ham,"Just watched EP1.
This is fucking amazing!
Great visual, characeter, animation."
Green Eggs and Ham,"This is insanely good. It's insane that it even exists and it's insane that it's so good.

Dr. Seuss is great but more senarios and fables than complete narratives so while the scenery is 100% Seuss they had to splice in some frog DNA when Jurassic Parking this thing together and it feels like they filled in the gaps with the emotions of Disney and the humor of Looney Tunes. I'm only three episodes in but I know I'll watch the whole thing which is a complete 180 from my bewildered shrug when it was announced."
Green Eggs and Ham,"I've just got to the fourth episode and man is the animation and scenery gorgeous. Considering that Warner Brothers Animation was involved with this show. 

It's actually starting to make me feel cautiously optimistic about the upcoming ""Cat in The Hat"" animated feature film done by the same studio. If I remember correctly, the film is planned to arrive sometime in 2020 or 2021.

Edit: Just got up to episode 10 and I didn't expect to get emotional in that episode."
Green Eggs and Ham,"Watch me backflip!  Rivers Cuomo at it again hahahaha

&#x200B;

Edit: There's a narrator muter!"
Green Eggs and Ham,"This show had me at ""OH IT'S A NINJA!"""
Green Eggs and Ham,"It looks great and the story is engaging but I was most impressed with the voice acting. The cast seemed like they had a blast. Key had the seemingly thankless job of delivering rhymed narration but made it fresh and fun. Douglas and Keaton sound ageless. 

I wouldn't be surprised to see multiple Emmy nominations."
Green Eggs and Ham,"Remind me why movie studios switched to 3D again?* This show is gorgeous.

*I don't actually care. I just wanted to say that the animation is beautiful."
Green Eggs and Ham,"I love it! The animation is 2D (YESSS) and the colors are bright but not overpowering, the voice acting is great and the tone is hilarious and refreshing! I love it abd Im on episode 3!"
Green Eggs and Ham,I’m 20 years old and this show almost made me cry. Was not expecting that sudden emotional turn at all!
Green Eggs and Ham,"I just finished the series, and it’s way better than I expected. The writing and jokes are surprisingly good for an animated children’s cartoon. I would definitely give it a try."
Green Eggs and Ham,"I really enjoyed it. The animation was wonderful, the voice acting was great, the writing was funny, and it was also REALLY well paced. Just a very solid show all around, glad I saw it."
Green Eggs and Ham,"I'm 9 episodes in and I'm in love. I heard that the second season's already in the works and I'm curious how that'll go. Heck, this makes me look forward to their Cat in the Hat movie even more.

UPDATE: Finished all 13 episodes. What a rollercoaster ride of a series!"
Green Eggs and Ham,"Just finished it. That was really good. A lot of the interactions and characters conflicts were stuff I often see in animated movies, but I do enjoy that stuff and it was handled well in the show. It even had a few unexpected plot developments. I will say [BIG SPOILER](#s ""that since Sam was the one who broke the chickeraff out in the first place, I assumed he was working for Snerz from the beginning and I wasn't sure where the BADGUYS fit in. So when they had Sam call Snerz it ended up being one of those ""Oh wait, that was supposed to be a surprise?"" kind of deals."")"
Green Eggs and Ham,Really charming show!
Green Eggs and Ham,"This show is weirdly good. I saw it on the Netflix home page and turned it on not expecting to watch more than ten minutes to see how they would turn such a simple plot into a full blown TV show.

I legitimately laughed at a couple of jokes, though I'll say there are quiet a few misses for me there as well. The animation is really good and I have a soft spot for road trip stories.

I don't know if I'll watch it all the way to the end but I'll at least see a few more episodes before I give up on it."
Green Eggs and Ham,"So Eddie Izzard plays a rich tycoon who steals exotic animals...for a second time this year.

He did the same thing in DreamWorks' Abominable."
Green Eggs and Ham,"Currently watching episode 6, however the mother-daughter “relationship” reminds me of another show called The Act. The way they dress, how over protective the mom is, and how the daughter takes risks of being caught by her mom, all of it just screams Gypsy Rose and her mom. No?"
Green Eggs and Ham,"""Ouuuu I'm leaning in"" lol.

/r/GreenEggsandHamTV for anyone interested."
Green Eggs and Ham,"Season 2 Announced: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSmvvwi2ac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSmvvwi2ac)"
Green Eggs and Ham,"It makes me so happy to see all you guys praise this series as much as I did, cuz OOoOoooomg it's subtle at first, but there is an ever-present emphasis on what emotionally drives these characters. And like,, I've **NEVER** seen this kind of attention to detail in Seuss adaptation. It's uncanny that this series shares the same universe as the DreamWorks and Illumination movies."
Green Eggs and Ham,"Posts like these are why I’m never having children.  It adds nothing to the conversation, But he has to let everyone know he has a child.  It’s a cry for help for a meaningless, ruined life."
Green Eggs and Ham,Suddenly the budget for this show makes sense.
Green Eggs and Ham,"I think that's the charm of it, honestly. It really does feel like a *modern* take of Seuss and I mean that in a good way. Look to the live action films or the Illumination ones. Modern but souless and sometimes all around cringey. This show feels very...I know Geisel was not one for adaptations but I feel this one, out of so many of the recent ones, is the best one yet."
Green Eggs and Ham,"“This is Dr Suess, so I was not expecting a ninja!”"
Green Eggs and Ham,"Hopefully the upcoming ""Cat in The Hat"" animated feature film might be done in this style."
Green Eggs and Ham,Because 3D CGI animation takes way less effort and money.
Green Eggs and Ham,"“Keep trying, Sam”

My heart, goddammit!"
Green Eggs and Ham,">I would definitely give it a try.

Turns out the *Green Eggs and Ham* is good if you stop dismissing it and give it a try. How appropriate."
Green Eggs and Ham,Lol I’m exactly 9 episodes in as well.
Green Eggs and Ham,It gets better as each episode progresses. Episode 10 was surprisingly emotional for a Dr Seuss adaptation.
Green Eggs and Ham,"Geez man, you okay? The fact is, my son and I are both enjoying it, it's a show for kids, but it's good enough for me to like as well. I gave my side of it, short and sweet, sorry if you think I'm trying to cry out for help, I assure you I'm a-okay. 

On the other hand, while I actually gave my small opinion on the topic at hand, your comment is the one that actually added nothing to the conversation, and your surprising amount of aggressiveness toward my answer screams, 'I want attention'. Or in your words, a cry for help. I don't know a thing about you, so I'd never call your life meaningless or ruined. Even if I did know you like that, I wouldn't have the heart to say that to you, it's just immeasurably rude. 

I hope all this built up aggression isn't caused by something detrimental going on in your life. I wish you the best, and you should try out the new show Green Eggs and Ham, my son and I both enjoy it, so whatever your age may be, it's a fun watch."
Green Eggs and Ham,The sudden completely unwarranted  harshness of this comment genuinely made me chuckle.
Green Eggs and Ham,It’s probably because no one wants to get within 3 states of your slimy waste of skin
Green Eggs and Ham,what's the budget for this show?
Green Eggs and Ham,"I was surprised to see that something this lavishly animated was thirteen episodes. Although, I've only watched part of the first episode, so I don't know if the quality holds through the season."
Green Eggs and Ham,How the turntables
Green Eggs and Ham,"But honestly though, the kid ruined your life at least a little bit."
Green Eggs and Ham,"Childfree person here.

FULFILLED childfree people don’t talk like this guy. I feel bad for him."
Green Eggs and Ham,The fact that it’s made on a thread about a children’s show is what sealed it for me. What a sad dude.
Green Eggs and Ham,"I'll check on that later, but if I remember correctly it's the most expensive animated series. Each episode was made around a million dollars if I remember correctly."
Green Eggs and Ham,$6 million per episode
Green Eggs and Ham,"Keep watching, I've currently reached the 5th episode as of this writing."
Green Eggs and Ham,[deleted]
Green Eggs and Ham,Well look at how much you ruined your life and you didnt even need a kid.
Green Eggs and Ham,"My life was bad before I had him, you never feel love like the love you have for your child. To each their own, having a kid means taking time away from things you enjoy spending time on, whether that be friends, hobbies, whatever. It's not for everyone. Personally, I'm excited to experience life with him."
Green Eggs and Ham,Just because your parents hate you doesn’t mean that their kid ruined things for them.
Green Eggs and Ham,"My son improved my life in 1000%, you may think this comment add nothing to the discussion and I'm just crying for attention, but my true goal here is to try to change your opinion about kids, even if you feel like never having one. Sure, raising a kid is hard work, and you must abstein from lots of things like partying every weekend and shit. But imo those things add nothing good to your life, while hard work, the love from the most important person in your life, and growing up as a person had an immensurable  positive effect on mine. So, even if it wasn't planned and my life changed drastically, I don't regret it even for a second"
Green Eggs and Ham,"You what?

Wow I watched the trailer and thought it looks so weird and goofy and you just pulled that on me lol


Edit: you freaked me out haha. Wiki says each episode was closer to 5-6 million each. 

Still a lot but yeah not a billion hahaha"
Green Eggs and Ham,"I just watched the trailer. The animation of the lip/mouth flaps is way more expressive than your average TV animation. 

However, at the same time it's kinda weird. The spoken dialogue seems to struggle to match the more detailed animation. It looks off most of the time where cheaper, simpler animation usually does not. It now seems clear to me why most TV animation doesn't have more detailed animation for dialogue. 

It certainly looks more polished and expensive. I'm just not sure it was worth it in those particular instances. The wider shots look great though."
Green Eggs and Ham,"I can believe it. I can imagine someone watching the trailer and saying ""Wait, it's a *series*?"""
Green Eggs and Ham,"Coming from a childfree person, don’t listen to this guy. You seem like a fantastic dad, though I hope you have your own life outside of your son.

Anyway. People like this fucker give us a bad name. He will die old and lonely. Sure, you can be childfree and die fulfilled and surrounded by loved ones, but not if you shit on people who made different decisions and make your life all about the frivolous shit.

You keep on keeping on."
Green Eggs and Ham,Are you trying to convince me or yourself?
Green Eggs and Ham,"LMAO, fuck that.  I’m going to Italy and Morocco this year."
Green Eggs and Ham,"6 million?

Per episode? 

And there's like 13 episodes? 

No wonder tuca and bertie got killed."
Green Eggs and Ham,"No, I think yhe dialouge is fitting for the animation"
Green Eggs and Ham,"""Wait, it exists?!""

""Wait, it's a series?!""

""Wait, each episode is twenty minutes long?!""

""Wait, it's actually the right mix of funny and emotional while also succeeding to make a complex and engaging narrative out of an otherwise simplistic plot?!"""
Green Eggs and Ham,"Yeah, I'm actually divorced and only have my kid on the weekends, but I enjoy every moment I can with him. I appreciate the kind words"
Green Eggs and Ham,No convincing dude. You asked a question. I answered. Do you act passive aggressive all the time?
Green Eggs and Ham,Good for you bro
Green Eggs and Ham,Well at least that explains why the animation for the characters look so smooth and good.
Green Eggs and Ham,">tuca and bertie

Appropriate comparison considering they both balance surreal comedy and a whimsical setting with down to earth and heart-trending character drama."
Green Eggs and Ham,"They’re owned by different companies Netflix doesn’t
own either show

Tuca and Bertie is owned by Torante (under Tuca and Bertie productions for copyright purposes) and Green Eggs and Ham is owned by Warner Bros. (also I think dr. seuss’ family has a stake too)"
Green Eggs and Ham,Not all the time.
Green Eggs and Ham,who hurt you
Green Eggs and Ham,his parents clearly
Green Eggs and Ham,"Nice, this show were really great. Didn’t expect it to be this good, probably one of my favorite shows this year"
Green Eggs and Ham,"This show made me feel so good. So creative and beautiful animated, and the characters were great and felt so real. Can't wait for more!"
Green Eggs and Ham,This news makes my day. This show was of such high quality and had such a singular vision I assumed no one would watch it.
Green Eggs and Ham,TIL there was a Green Eggs and Ham season 1.
Green Eggs and Ham,Excellent news! I adored the first season. I hope this means we see some classic Seuss characters like The Lorax or maybe even the Cat
Green Eggs and Ham,"I usually dont end up liking dr Seuss movies and shows but this one,season 1 was really good."
Green Eggs and Ham,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSmvvwi2ac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSmvvwi2ac) Announce here.
Green Eggs and Ham,I put this on to give my baby something to look at. It was so lit that I continued watching it without her.
Green Eggs and Ham,I watched this on acid and the desert hallucination scene fucked me up. Along with all the made up words
Green Eggs and Ham,Oh God! They just keep ruining shit.
Green Eggs and Ham,It’s probably the best modern Seuss adaptation made yet.
Green Eggs and Ham,I guess I don't know your taste / how much you watch a year but that seems like high praise. What's so good about it? I kind of just figured it'd be your average kids show
Green Eggs and Ham,It's a shame Dr. Seuss doesn't teach grammar in this day and age.
Green Eggs and Ham,"""Green Eggs and Ham starring Michael Douglas"" is yet another one of those sentences you never thought you'd hear."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Murray Bartlett is quickly turning in to one of my favourite tv actors. What a huge transformation from his white lotus role. Amazing work. Nick Offerman, as usual, is an absolute god damn treasure."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Phenomenal. The reveal of Bill as a prepper with a Fleetwood Mac blues song is one of my favorite character reveals of all time. The whole episode is much different from the game obviously but this is how you tell a story. It’s so fucking beautiful. I’m almost mad I ruined it for myself because when Frank was talking about his plans for his last day, I said if I were Bill I’d just kill myself too. So it softened the blow but doesn’t take away from how incredible that whole hour was"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,🍓
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Although I really missed the banter between Bill and Ellie from the game, I was amazed at how they created that entire backstory for Frank and Bill just from the letter they found with his body in the game. I watched this episode twice and then followed it up listening to the HBO podcast.   
The writing on this show is amazing and I hope other video game adaptions follow suit."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"For those interested in how Frank and Bill's story played out in the game:  
  
>!Bill's alive when Joel and Ellie arrive, but Frank has left. Bill tells Joel that he used to take care of someone, but not anymore, says it only would have gotten him killed. You pick up hints throughout the level that Frank got tired of surviving without actually living and left. Bill never softened up like he did in the show, and he and Ellie but heads a lot. Bill warns Joel that Ellie will probably get him killed, but eventually acknowledges she can handle herself.!<  
  
>!After escaping some infected, they find Frank's body hanging by a noose in a building with a suicide note. Frank got bit soon after leaving Bill. He says in the note that Bill was right that he couldn't take care of himself, but he was still glad to be gone because he always hated Bill's guts. Bill is obviously saddened by this but doesn't want to admit it. As Joel and Ellie leave, Bill asks Joel if they're square, and when he says yes, Bill says ""Now get the fuck out of my town.!<  
  
[Frank's note.](https://i.imgur.com/W5b39xF.png)"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Ron Swanson gets to be Ron Swanson in a completely unrelated show. You couldn’t ask for a better casting role. “You new world order bastards.”
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It was definitely a divergence from the source material but this was SO much better. That part of the game works fine in the game, but this was an really excellent way to adapt the source material. Though I kept being worried Bill was gonna not grant Frank his wish and he was gonna take off and do it himself (somehow). It wasn't until he downed that glass of wine that I was able to relax a bit.

Also, as a gay man, though it's becoming more common, it's still rare to see great gay love in media that isn't just trauma porn. This could easily have become trauma porn... but it wasn't? Tragic, but also very sweet. And seeing two men grow old together is even MORE rare. It was all just really nice to see and I like how they tied it into Joel's feelings for Tess.

EDIT: Just editing my comment about trauma porn to make it clear I'm saying this episode was not that, since I can see how it might've been vague."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Without any spoilers.

I am assuming the episode is lower rated because of review bombing due to certain relationships being presented with Bill? And not that the episode itself is actually bad?

If I go now on Imdb it has a 8.4 out of 10. There are 5,642.. 1 STAR reviews. The 1 star reviews make up 20% of the overall reviews. There were 1 star reviews for the first 2 eps, but they made up less than 1% of the overall reviews.

Which, leads me to believe that this is just a bunch of homopbhobic people lashing out about the episode."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"This is why all that talk of adaptations needing to stick to the source is not entirely correct.

You just need good writers that respect the source, don't have to follow it 100%.

Also very good to know that Craig Maizin can write some good old ""classic"" drama. He's not just an ""end of the world"" expert."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,It’s refreshing for apocalypse show to talk about how important love is to survival. Usually they go into just kill and betrayal so much but never much into why it’s worth to fight to survive
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Finally a network not afraid to give us the hot, gay Nick Offerman sex scenes we all have always wanted."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"My daughter played the game. I knew nothing about it, but watched with her because she seemed very excited and I was curious. I’m glad I did. Same as the game or not, that episode was incredible."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I woke up this morning and decided to rewatch it while I did my morning jog on the treadmill. Went ""It won't be as sad the 2nd time, I got this.""

Did you guys know jogging is extra difficult when you're crying?"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Two amazing performances in this episode. Wow. I was mesmerized the entire 80 minutes.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"You NEVER see movies or TV shows where gay men grow old together. Let alone in a big budget entry in a massive genre IP.

It's usually two hot bisexual women played by two straight actresses one of whom dies two episodes in to make the other one sad."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"This has to be one of the best cases of how deviating from the source material can make the new medium better. I played the game, I knew Bill, but I did **not** expect this whatsoever. But it's so good, it makes perfect sense for television.

Also, Andor has now gotten mentioned numerous times in this thread, it's on my list but it seems like I need to watch it ASAP!"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"""I like you old. Getting older means we're still here.""

Hits a lot harder when you realize that these two men lived through the AIDS epidemic, too."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It felt to me like a strong episode of The Leftovers, and I can't give a show a higher compliment than that"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"What's hilarious to me are the people who dislike it saying ""it didn't move the story forward!"" as if the Bill's Town section of the game wasn't just mostly a character development filler arc to get a car, all of which was accomplished in the first and last 20 minutes"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I think this is going to be the episode people mention when talking about the show. LOST had ""The Constant,"" The Leftovers had ""International Assassin,"" and TLOU is going to have ""Long, Long Time."""
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Oh my God, I started crying as soon as Frank stated what he wanted for his last day!"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Anybody who liked this episode would probably get a lot out of watching the series Station Eleven.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Cried my damned eyes out. Beautiful episode
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I really thought it would be one of those overhyped/overrated episodes but it was more special than I expected. It feels like 3 maybe even seasons worth of what Walking Dead is trying(but failed) to tell. If Euphoria can win acting awards for hype alone, then this one deserve it even more."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Honestly I think we can start to move past judging this show as just a ""Game to show adaptation"". It's absolute top tier television, period."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I wonder if the “jackboot fucks” line was an intentional callback to Nick’s role in Fargo
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I'd say there's been some equally good episodes in recent memory:

* **The season finale of Severance**; I've never felt that much tension watching a TV show. I'm not even as in love with the series as most people; I thought it was merely OK. But that last episode, man, is transcendently good.

* **House of the Dragon, episode S1:E8** The old King ascending the throne for the last time and the dinner party afterwards, in particular.

* Maybe a bit long in the tooth now, but that **third episode of Arcane** is still sticking with me. I used to play the game. I knew about the plot twist going in, and it still floored me.

With honorable mentions to the last episode of Better Call Saul, a few episodes of Attack on Titan, and For All Mankind in general. I feel like the Boys, Invincible, Andor, and maybe even the most recent episode of Vox Machina (S2:E6) should be in there as well.

And I bet a bunch of episodes of shows I don't watch. There's a lot of good television these days."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett absolutely deserve award nominations for their performances in that episode. Beautiful!
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I thought it was brilliant and on par with Andor's prisonbreak scene within the past year
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I really like the different directions the show has gone from the game. The expanded back stories of smaller characters, the early days of the fungus, etc. A shot for a shot TV show wouldn't add anything, IMO the whole point of recreating a story in a new medium is to add to it or portray it in a way they the other medium could not. Frankly, I don't know what you could do differently in a TV show from a game, they're both visual and the game of course has cutscenes, so expanding the world is an awesome way to differentiate the show from the game and make it worth watching."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Didn't expect it to be that good.   
It hits so hard when the episode ends too. Damnn!"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I like how they changed up the way the relationship ends in the show than the way it played out in the game.  They made Bill likable!
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It was a great episode. Great setup of the theme of finding purpose in a world so utterly hopeless and bleak, which we get to observe now in Joel and Ellie's story."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,[removed]
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"almost brought me to tears when Ellie was reading the letter out, and i know nothing of the game /  story.

&#x200B;

masterfully written and acted. got to care for 2 old guys in the space of 45 mins more than you do for most character in an entire series"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Absolutely amazing episode. The acting, the music, my tears. So much heart in one episode."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"All I could think at the beginning was ""Uh oh Ron Swanson"" but Offerman turned it around and became emotional and tender. Needed this episode to show that love didn't die off with the end of civilization."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I didn't expect to cry half the episode. After Bill got shot and they showed Frank in a wheelchair I was holding back tears and got choked up a couple times because I thought I knew where it was going. I didn't expect a double suicide.

I cried more this episode than I did with Sarah's death in game and on the show, I didn't think that was possible."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"45 year old man here. That scene with the rings brought me to tears. The games brought me to the show, but performances like this episode will keep me watching for sure."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I love that Bill got a happy ending with Frank!
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Fantastic episode and academy award level acting. 

A wonderful, touching description of diverse, different gay men - Neither falling into cliches and caricature of gay men which is the Hollywood standard.


Bravo. 👏 Bravo!"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I could not stop crying. So beautiful
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I got Leftovers Season 3 vibes from this episode. That is a good thing. A very good thing.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I haven't seen a realistic depiction of masculine gay love in any form of media worth watching in I don't know how long. I'm a straight, married, cisgender father and this episode not only made me tear up, but made me have so much more appreciation for Nick Offerman than I have had for any actor in the last decade. Amazing performance, writing, and directing. 

If this doesn't win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance , or a Golden Globe, everything is wrong with both bodies."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Would i enjoy this knowing nothing about the game?
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"The episode was amazing for san many reasons, with the portrayal of Bill and Frank's love obviously being the frontrunner, but one of the things I don't see is how it breaks so many rules in the postapocalyptic genre we have now. As soon as we meet Bill, it's made very clear that he has nothing to offer. Frank knows, seemingly, just about everything in the damn world and when Bill gets a chance to show off as the heart to counter Frank's mind at the piano, we see that Frank's emotions run about a mile deep too. Now, the two tenants in play for the genre are 1. It's about what you have to bring to the table, and 2. If you haven't suffered to the point of breaking and becoming something new, you're not done suffering. The whole episode I was waiting for Frank to train Bill, or Bill having to take up the survivor mantle after Frank dies, or at the very least for the uneven power dynamic to come into play since Bill can't pull his weight. Surprisingly, it was none of that, and I think it showed the bravery of Bill and Frank to not stop hoping they could live the lives they want, without reservations, and the bravery of the show to say ""They deserve love because they want it. And that's the only reason they survive as well as they do."""
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"They made it a bottle episode. Compare to TNG's ""Inner Light"", The Magician's ""A Life In The Day,"" or Adventure Time's ""Puhoy.""  They're all tearjerkers."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Lots of butthurt dudes in threads popping up around Facebook
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Oh good, this wasn't bleak enough without me being sad for dead gay Ron Swanson.

*sigh*

Amazing episode, 10/10. Only real problem I have with it is it feels *real* early in the series for a kind of a break from the main cast, especially since they haven't had a lot of time to develop the Joel/Ellie relationship. I feel like this would have fit better as an EP5-6 but I'm getting from the other replies that this was a super early game character and they kind of had a ""window"" to do anything about it. Still works, just not where I'd put it if I could get away with it."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I didn’t expect such a beautiful love story in a show about surviving in a post apocalyptic world filled with fungus zombies. They were both brilliant  and there was so much chemistry between them!
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Everyone: Episode three of this show will blow your socks off


Me: Oh there's probably shitloads of zombies and shooting and explosions


TLOU: *Hehehehehe*"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Wow it's almost like if you follow the script of the game and add to it but don't take way from it then it becomes an amazing tv series. 


Holy shit who knew."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I didn’t get to see the episode until last night, unfortunately on Sunday night I saw a couple of reactions to the show online that slightly spoiled the episode for me which was a bummer. But even with that I still cried. Very emotional episode and really well written. Experiencing a relationship from start to finish that sparks and ends during what is essentially the end of the world felt pretty unique and was handled so tenderly."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"As a gay guy, I enjoyed seeing a gay relationship on a show that is *not* a queer show. Usually when i see a gay male couple, its often in a show directed toward a queer audience. I was really glad to see such an authentic depiction of gay romance without being a satire, or part of a punchline. Perfectly done."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I watched this last night and my partner and I can’t stop talking about it. Was one of the best I’ve seen in a long time.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I need to go back and rewatch it from a different perspective.  I just finished playing the chapter with Bill in the game and enjoyed it so much I was looking forward to that Bill in the show.  I was disappointed in the representation of him as his game persona was still ingrained.  I’m sure I will enjoy it much more if I’m not expecting the video game character.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,[removed]
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Yupppppppp.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' was the violin song if anyone was wondering. Also featured in Shutter Island and Arrival. 

Such a goddamn slapper of a depressing tune lol."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,it was good but this is silly
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Why was Bill standing in the middle of the street with a sniper rifle shooting at them instead of behind cover, what did that scene serve?"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I’m sorry but y’all say this every time something good comes out. Y’all said the same about mando , said the same thing about bcs. Can we please go back to using realistic measures not everything is “one of the greatest tv episodes in recent memory”"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I balled my eyes out. and I said the same thing to my wife. For me, It was on par with the San Junipero episode of black mirror."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Stop using ""subvert our expectations"" as a catch-all term for offshoot storytelling/world-building."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I wonder if the writing went this route for a secondary reason as well.  The writers had a difficult decision.  I'm sure they started off with the concept of Bill from the game and I was really looking forward to this portrayal.  The problem is the more back story you create, the more unlikeable ellie's relationship with Bill becomes.  As the show runners want Joel to gradually like her and become her protector, they also want the viewers to do the same.  It can be a struggle to get viewers to like precocious young girls.  There was no need to make it harder.

>!If Bill is alive when Joel/ellie arrive, her comments to a grief stricken and broken man would take her character backwards.  Stealing items from him and making fun of his gay porn might make viewers hate her.  Bill allowing Frank to change the town’s vision was the only real change.  The rest of the episode was the alternate universe result of that decision.  In both the game and the TV show,  Joel has a decision point as well.  He can wallow in the past or move forward  !<

Both universes exist and they are the ideal result in their individual worlds.  I wonder if those who hate the episode are missing the point of both stories."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It was great, even made my eyes misty at times, but no it's not one of the greatest TV episodes it recent memory.

People need to chill out with their tlou hyperboles lol"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I was sat in my front room at 6am crying like a baby.  I'm 47 years of age.

&#x200B;

It was one of THE great episodes of television."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Disclosure, I didn't play the games

I thought the episode was pretty good but IMO it is a little too self contained that I felt like the writers went out of their way to make me feel sad and emotional with no payoff or relevance to the overall story. I would have liked if Bill somehow continued to live on and ran into Joel and Ellie and Joel got to see/learn from a person who managed to find love and joy in such a bleak world. That's my only criticism of it though, the episode was very well made and memorable."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Sobbed. Ugly sobbed. What an episode.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Another week, another post about the greatest episode of TV in recent memory.   I think people around here have no long term memory."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It was such a brilliant episode and fantastic alternative to the story we already know, the only thing I'm sad about is that we didnt get to see bill and ellie's banter."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Exactly my thoughts. It's been a long time since something hit me this hard.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Oh, need to tune in soon on this one.🫢"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It was good. Felt a bit overly familiar though, especially with that Max Richter music which is so overused."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Had me tearing up, very rare occurrence. Bravo."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKAtM9xS-fA&ab\_channel=ConCherry
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,They took a hard left with Ron Swanson lol
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Absolute masterpiece of an episode
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,That was a masterpiece. Watched it again and find it even more beautiful. 10/10
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"It's been a few years since we've gotten a great ""watercooler"" show. We live in a golden age of television, but this is special in my opinion."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Honestly, Last of Us is weird, because I enjoy the show a lot, but I have so much less interest in Joel and Ellie than in the prequel sequences."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"I hope this means we'll also get an episode following Ish, whether it be in this season or Season 2. I don't think we ever find out what happened to him in the game, but I remember going out of my way to try and find all of the notes, so it would be really to see his story played out."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,It was a very welcome deviant from the game story with how the expanded on and changed the outcome for Bill and Franks story. Though Andor prison episode is still up there for greatest episode in recent memory for me lol.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,This episode made me cry😂😂 I haven’t cried in years!?
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Well said & beautifully expressed…. Totally agree….
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Totally agree! This episodic was touching and so well done.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I’m just blown away how good this show is.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"That was an outstanding bit of writing, directing and acting."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"thought it was a really great episode of TV. would I have liked to see the set pieces from Bill’s level played out in live action? Hell yeah i wanted to see Pedro hanging upside down headshotting infected. But that isn’t what the creators of the show are trying to do. They’re doing something different and it really works. Besides, I can always just play the game if i want to experience that!"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Yes it was
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I just watched S1 White Lotus and had no idea that was Armond in that hole!
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,This is the most beautiful and moving episode of tv I’ve ever seen. It reminded me a lot of The Magicians episode A Life in a Day.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"This episode turned me into a crying, snotty mess. It hit really hard."
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Definitely my favorite episode so far
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,There was a personal reveal on watchmen that was better IMO. But yeah this was damn good.
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"great ep, craig mazin should make all the game adaptations"
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,I don't think iv cried like that in a TV show on years. Unexpectedly touching
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,Meh
Greatest Events of WWII in Colour,"Never played the game (or really any other game besides like pac man and tetris); i’ve never owned a video game system. Don’t recall ever having seen a video game adaptation, but i’ve been watching Last of Us and enjoying it.

Last night’s episode was gripping and emotional; i just loved it."
Voice,">Bedrock catches up with the Flintstone family two decades later, with Fred on the brink of retirement and 20-something Pebbles embarking on her own career. As the Stone Age gives way to a shiny and enlightened new Bronze Age, the residents of Bedrock will find this evolution harder than a swing from Bamm-Bamm’s club.

Cast:

* Elizabeth Banks as Pebbles
* Stephen Root as Fred
* Amy Sedaris as Wilma
* Nicole Byer as Betty
* Joe Lo Trulio as Barney
* Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam."
Voice,"When someone inevitably comments “*Who wanted this?*”

It is I. I wanted a Flintstones animated reboot. 

Jetsons next, please, though that is overdue for its live action treatment that’s been collecting dust in Hollywood for ages."
Voice,"Sounds like an interesting concept. I'll check it out. I hope the art style is similar to the original style and not some unique off putting hybrid. 

>Joe Lo Truglio as Barney

I'm sold."
Voice,Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is absolutely perfect casting
Voice,Wasn't Seth MacFarlane trying to develop a Flintstones reboot at one point?
Voice,Stephen Root is amazing.
Voice,Is this based on the comic where [Yabababadoo](https://loginportal.funnyjunk.com/comments/I+greatly+enjoyed+the+flintstones+comic+_3630d2d2c835f69a58fe8575740d3a76.jpg) is a nonsense phrase to help veterans deal with trama from the war?
Voice,Amy Sedaris is a national treasure. I will watch anything she is a part of.
Voice,"Whether this turns out to be good or not, if you are a Flintstones fan, you absolutely owe it to yourself to read the DC comic by Steve Pugh!

It's such a truly fantastic retelling of the story and creates a very nuanced and much more interesting Bedrock."
Voice,"I hope they take inspiration from the recent Flintstones Comics, which really delved into modern issues as reflected in the weird Paleolithic pastiche of The Flintstones universe. [Like Fred's pals Adam and Steve.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1sb55) 

[Or this infamous panel.](https://external-preview.redd.it/XahAdnM9U9vhLUmGkHlK3IRQw3jDzOlfSVl31KuVzyU.jpg?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2449c02c1798f8941b05266f8386e7fe515a9aa) 

It's a fantastic satire."
Voice,Hire Mark Russell!! His 12 issue comic series on them is GOLD!
Voice,Elizabeth Banks and Manny Jacinto as the adult pebbles and bambam makes so much sense in a way I really can't explain.
Voice,Alright. This sounds really cool.
Voice,Of wow it’s happening. Last time I heard of a flinstones reboot it was sarah underwood on attack of the show on G4 announced that Seth MacFarlane was going to run it. Then right after that Kevin Pereira made a fun adult comment that went over my too young boy brain.
Voice,"Hope it takes some inspiration from the 2010s DC Comics reimagining of the Flintstones, which I recommend people check out."
Voice,Yo that cast looks bonkers! Bortles!
Voice,This is something I didn't realize I wanted until I read about it LOL
Voice,"> Manny Jacinto as Bamm-Bamm.

Dope."
Voice,Now I've got that Ram Jam song in my head.
Voice,Wow that’s a pretty talented/funny lineup behind the voices
Voice,"I have nothing against it personally, but why is it okay for other races to be cast for a white role (disclaimer: I’m not white), but when a white person plays a non-white role (like the Simpsons cast, for example) people are “offended”?"
Voice,Seth McFarlane had this reboot ready to go and they shelved it at the very last second.
Voice,I really hope there is some Boyle Boys' love between Fred and Barney.
Voice,"I smell another ""Velma""."
Voice,Didn’t  Seth MacFarlane work on this for years?
Voice,"let me guess, Fred and Barney are dumbasses and Wilma is the real empowered deal"
Voice,Predictions on who is gay? I’m going with bam bam.
Voice,Ok this is what we need
Voice,I was wondering if anyone would revisit this property soon and here we are. Interested to see how it turns out.
Voice,“Idk cast the latino as bam bam”
Voice,More trash 🤮🤢
Voice,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAqlx_9lv0
Voice,Of course Wilma is voiced by a black woman.
Voice,Just please don't Velma it.
Voice,I hope this doesn't replace The Great North.
Voice,"is it going to have horrible modern flash animation


also nicole byer so totally does not seem like Betty at all"
Voice,[removed]
Voice,How?
Voice,"This is going to be another Velma, right?"
Voice,You had me at Lynn and Charles Boyle as Fred and Barney.
Voice,This is still a thing?  I assumed this had died years ago.
Voice,I remember Seth MacFarlane wanted to be involved in this.  Almost Sade he isn't.
Voice,"If you want to do an adult oriented (Bit of a misnomer since the cartoon was Primetime in the 60s) Flintstones, they should go with the comic DC put out a few years ago."
Voice,You know I'm kind of interested in the premise. A technological shift from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age? I dunno that sounds like an interesting jump start.
Voice,"Solid as hell cast there.

 Now they just need to toss in Paul reubens as the great gazoo."
Voice,So is this before Bamm bamm and pebbles had a kid?
Voice,Were the bronze and stone ages only 20 years apart? 😜
Voice,You had me at Amy Sedaris.
Voice,Holy shit Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is an awesome casting choice.
Voice,Stephen root as Fred is an instant sold for me
Voice,I want a continuation of the Harvey Birdman Flintstones.
Voice,"I’m honestly surprised how long it’s taken for a true to form reboot. This premise looks interesting, but just making a modern take on the original feels like a nobrainer. It’s not like sitcoms ever went out of style."
Voice,"Jetsons would be cool, that 60s retrofuturism and so on... I know people have this head canon of them being in the sky and the earth being a dead zone beneath.  I think that's a bit too much, but I like the idea of other cities being the future as envisioned by other decades.  So we have an 80s cyberpunk city, a 30s deco city like Metropolis, a Y2K silver/aqua fluid organic type of city, etc..."
Voice,"Also, Seth MacFarlane. He's talked about it a lot, and I'm guessing he's sad he's not involved with this"
Voice,We need Danny Devito as Mr Spacely.
Voice,They’ve been trying to make this for a long time. It was attached to Seth Macfarlane. I think he used to talk about it in interviews.
Voice,"They need to make a live action Jetsons ASAP, while Danny DeVito is still around to play Mr. Spacely."
Voice,"""Who wanted this?"" is the dumbest (whatever it's called... *trope statement*?) that has ever existed.

Are creators supposed to poll everyone before they create? Fuck off

The most awarded movie in cinema history,  EEAAOA... did anybody want that?"
Voice,"There are a lot of shows you can justifiably ask, ""Why?"" This is not one of them."
Voice,"Yeah, but one true to the original, no?  Or what are you hoping for?"
Voice,"This appears not to be a reboot, but a sequel."
Voice,"Joe Lo Truglio and Nicole Byer being Barney and Betty is inspired. And manny jacinto as their son?

Cue the vince mcmahon meme"
Voice,"""Every time I have a problem I hit it with a club and scream out my own name and just like that I have a new problem."""
Voice,"Oh man, Bam Bam figured it out? This is a new low."
Voice,Oh dear heavens it's Jason.
Voice,"""BORTLES-BORTLES!"""
Voice,"yes, amazing casting"
Voice,Very inspired casting.
Voice,"Apparently part of the reason it didn’t pan out was because he couldn’t figure out how to distinguish Fred from Peter Griffin. Not that he *wanted* them to be similar, he genuinely didn’t seem to know Fred acts nothing like Peter to begin with. That should tell you everything."
Voice,"That fizzled out about a decade ago.

He doesn't seem interested in making animated sitcoms anymore."
Voice,Thankfully that didn't work out. Don't think we need the Flintstones with rape jokes.
Voice,Yes
Voice,"The link is broken, but I don't believe it's based on the recent satire series."
Voice,"Have you, by chance, seen [The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drunk_and_On_Drugs_Happy_Funtime_Hour)"
Voice,Exit Stage Left the Snaglepuss Story is also a phenomenal examination of McCarthism and its effects on the theater industry and I'm not even joking
Voice,What an odd tone. Is there comedy in between or is it just straight up serious/dramatic the entire time?
Voice,"I've been reading the series recently and it's been fantastic. Really good satire about everything from capitalism, consumerism to PTSD. Highly recommend."
Voice,">Homo Erectus

Brilliant."
Voice,Literally only clicked this thread to see if someone mentioned the comic. Great little series.
Voice,"The issue that most people have isn’t that voice actors can only voice characters that are the same race as they are. The issue is that in an industry that is predominantly white, even the few POC roles that exist often go to white actors."
Voice,Isn’t it for a voice role?
Voice,because white people bad
Voice,Because white actors aren’t underrepresented in media. Now can people stop asking this question?
Voice,"I'm still wondering why if a character is biracial, it's not okay for a whole white person to play the part, but it IS okay for a whole black person to play the part."
Voice,That was my first thought too. Like isn’t this supposed to be racist now?
Voice,"The secret is no one really cares about that either. Most of it has been voice actors voluntarily stepping down. 

I dont think just about any regular person cares."
Voice,I mean that would be just like the original...
Voice,"So, The Flintstones then."
Voice,"Too easy. Actually it will be revealed that Barney and Fred were, uh, more than friends all this time."
Voice,"It's one thing to be racist, and another to be so racist you can't tell the difference between latinos and someone who's chinese-fillipino."
Voice,Jfc y'all can't even get your fake outrage right.
Voice,"Yea that’s actually a solid spin on the original. Turn Fred & Wilma into Boomers who don’t get new tech.

What do you mean you drive without feet now?"
Voice,"Relevant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyu4u3VZYaQ"
Voice,The Great Gazoo is honestly not even one of the top 10 stupidest things on the original show. Everyone just ignores that there's a Bewitched crossover in it for no apparent reason.
Voice,oh hell yes I need Pee-Wee Herman as Great Gazoo
Voice,"""Don't do that. Don't make me hope"""
Voice,"They were 0 years apart.

But the Bronze Age was not 20 years away from the dinosaurs."
Voice,"No, but they also didn't celebrate Christmas and have talking elephant vacuum cleaners during the stone age."
Voice,"I mean it depends what you mean, parts of the Neolithic age was technically.

Of course due to lack of safe travel in those days and scarcity of resources, you could cross from the stone age into the bronze age and back again, over a span of maybe two hundred miles."
Voice,Your dead to me can opener!
The Devil Next Door,"To save you a click:

>The Daily Courier reported last Monday that the show was “postponed … due to producers’ decision to add new footage and reporting to the show, which was scheduled to begin Tuesday.”

Also some church group complained.  I'd expect the first part is a bigger reason, with them doing some due diligence in reporting hopefully."
The Devil Next Door,"Thanks for posting, I was curious too."
The Devil Next Door,Both Treblinka and Sobibor were located in occupied Poland though...
The Devil Next Door,"There is something really weird about this map. It's not a correct map of WW2 time Poland (which would've been the obvious choice, why didn't they simply use one?). It's not a correct map of contemporary Poland (which would also make some sense). And it's not a correct map of post-WW2 Poland either...

There is USSR depicted on the map, and so is Czechoslovakia. Yet... there is an independent Lithuania, in its today's borders!

So there are two possibilities really. It's either a map the documentary authors prepared themselves, which they aimed to be a correct post-1945 map (why post-1945 though?) and they botched it (by placing Lithuania incorrectly), which would be pretty strange.

Or it's a map of some really short-lived state (possibly) of the borders somewhen during the border transformations of 1990, which would not have been valid several months later anymore. Again, an extremely strange choice to choose such a short-lived map to be used in a WW2 documentary.

I'd really like to learn what their thinking process was in this :D"
The Devil Next Door,"They were, the documentary, however, presents them as being placed in unoccupied Poland (as the area on the map is called ""Poland"" and not ""occupied Poland"" - the implication is obvious) while also portraying Poland's borders in the post-1945 form."
The Devil Next Door,"I don't see what's wrong with that. They are in occupied Poland, they are in current Poland as well. That doesn't mean that Poland was responsible for them. O think we all understand that Nazi Germany was in charge of those camps."
The Devil Next Door,But what will you say about this: https://twitter.com/GrzesiekDumaa/status/1194333994285854722?s=19
The Devil Next Door,"You don't see what's wrong in the portrayal of Poland as an active perpetrator of the Holocaust? OK then. I guess the whole ""Polish death camps"" thing is really working."
The Devil Next Door,"They didn't do that. The portrayed death camps as being in Poland, because they are literally in Poland.

I said in my previous comment that nobody is claiming the Polish committed the Holocaust. The map just shows where the camps were/are."
The Devil Next Door,I bet that in the future your kid will tell his kid that  Nazi are from space and they attacked poor Germany and together with Poland started killing good jews.
The Devil Next Door,"I don't see why there is this push back, are we supposed to pretend those camps weren't in Poland? Where they were and who was doing it are two different things."

The Devil Next Door,"- Starts as a film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

- Almost a decade passes and no progress on the film.

- It goes to Hulu as a limited series.

- 3 years pass, nothing happens.

- Keanu Reeves is announced to star while Todd Field directs.

- Less than a year later, Reeves leaves and so does Field.

- Limited series is now scrapped.

Hmmm, I'm starting to think this adaptation is cursed."
The Devil Next Door,"This is legitimately never gonna get made at this point lmao

Please just get some history nut veteran showrunner an HBO budget and cast Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham.

Edit:

> In recent weeks, Jeremy Allen White and Jude Law were in talks to star but in the end, the entire project fell through. Was it the deals or was it a top-down message that an expensive period piece wasn't the way Hulu should go? ([source](https://twitter.com/borys_kit/status/1632911131986784256?s=46&t=nfDSG6o3y6zWZ-Y4pfC3bA))

We were so close"
The Devil Next Door,"Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? Whether as a movie or a show? Huge names have been attached to this yet it keep falling apart."
The Devil Next Door,This is disappointing news
The Devil Next Door,Maybe it’s for the best. Look how long it Y The Last Man to be made and that adaptation was pretty mediocre.
The Devil Next Door,"Man this project certainly fell apart. Went from having a lead actor, director and a network last year to none this year."
The Devil Next Door,"With all the crap that streaming turns out, this one can't make the cut?"
The Devil Next Door,"Feels like every year or two I hear new names attached to this project and then it disappears. Same goes with Blood Meridian. TBF, both seem like they'd be very difficult adaptations."
The Devil Next Door,This project is cursed.
The Devil Next Door,Cursed but American God's got made so I'm hopeful still
The Devil Next Door,I really wanted to see this
The Devil Next Door,"I literally just finished this book. If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

Edit: I actually really enjoyed the fair sections, I just can’t imagine that be very exciting because a lot if it was about choosing architects, floral designs and such. They’ll probably play up the fires and such, though."
The Devil Next Door,"Had a feeling this was a dead series when Keanu dropped out. 

It seems like a weird project to adapt. A story about the creation of a giant expo and a story about a serial killer, neither of which have anything to do with another.

I'm surprised nobody has decided to ditch the part about the World's Fair and do a film about HH Holmes. It's probably all the parts about the World's Fair and recreating it is what would cause the project to have a giant budget."
The Devil Next Door,Hard -- in the visual media -- trying to figure out how to fit in 3 episodes on architectural history in the middle of a story about a serial murderer.
The Devil Next Door,This and “Confederacy of Dunces” have pissed off the adaptation gods and just can’t get out of development purgatory.
The Devil Next Door,"Depending on your definition of progress, there was a lot of it on Scorsese’s film version. There’s a couple different drafts of the script floating around online, and probably several other versions that never emerged anywhere. Lot of writers worked on that movie over the years."
The Devil Next Door,"A real shame, this would be a pretty epic 3hr movie more than a series IMO. DiCaprio would have been perfect too."
The Devil Next Door,A Scorcese and DiCaprio vehicle sounds like a non-brainer to begin with. Really weird why it didn't go to completion at that first step tbh
The Devil Next Door,"I remember first reading Devil In the White City because it was an inspiration for the then-upcoming Bioshock Infinite. 

That was ten years ago this month."
The Devil Next Door,Pretty sure that before Leo and Scorcese Tom Cruise was attached to it as well.
The Devil Next Door,It has been an emotional journey to follow along the whole time
The Devil Next Door,Has Robert Eggers ever expressed interest in show running?
The Devil Next Door,"Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham?

Speaking of being so close..."
The Devil Next Door,"Attaching huge names might be the problem. Star power is expensive and difficult to schedule unless it’s their passion project. Cast some unknowns. Grab an up and coming director. Save a bundle and give someone new a chance. If the production is good and the people behind it are talented, you don’t need star power."
The Devil Next Door,"> Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? 

Because the best parts of the book would make for one really dull drama. The best parts of the book was about the architecture of Chicago and the work done to put on the world's fair.

All the shit about HH Holmes is really a pretty forgettable story about a serial killer. 

The only thing interesting that Holmes did is he built an elaborate torture chamber. 

So at the end of the day they only options for story telling is about someone building things."
The Devil Next Door,The show runner wanted to turn the show into something else. The main cast were pretty good but they didn't have a lot to work with. Alienated anyone who liked the source and didn't attract any of whatever demographic they were aiming for.
The Devil Next Door,"Setting aside the question of whether you could make a direct adaptation of Y: The Last Man today, not having the Israelis and Amazons essentially got rid of the antagonists from the comics. That adaptation was a bit like making a Harry Potter movie without Voldemort and the Death Eaters, where Lily and James Potter really did die in a car crash.

Whether or not a slow burn quasi political post-apocalyptic story is something anyone has ever been interested in watching is something I think is fairly clearly answered by the fact no other show like that exists. Maybe such a programme (of film) *should* exist, but it's pretty clear they were just using the framework of the IP to trick people into watching/greenlighting what was a fundamentally different story. Sort of like Foundation except people didn't really like the new plotline. I suggest the major difference is, and I haven't read Foundation, that the Lee Pace stuff is kinda necessary for anything in Foundation to make sense, whereas in Y: The Last Man the politics stuff exists in an inherent tension with what the main characters are trying to do. Having a storyline about ""what comes next"" after a world shattering event, is a bit nuts when your ostensible main characters are trying to shatter the foundations of this new world.

They also made specific changes to Yorick and Mann that made both of them much harder to sympathise with. Alas, the specific change to Yorick was destructive to his entire character concept from the comics. Show Yorick knows Beth wanted to end things, whereas comics Yorick is sort of this hopeless romantic, which is endearing... even as the audience knows his mission *should* be doomed to failure (due to dramatic irony).

There are worse ways to make an adaptation, but Y: The Last Man's failure is clearly on how they tried to adapt it, not that they tried to adapt it in the first place."
The Devil Next Door,"God if there was one comic that seemed to be an easy homerun it was Y last man. I really liked the first episode or two but then they decided to completely stall the story and change shit around. Same thing happened with preacher, yeah let's just spend an entire season focusing on shit that has nothing to do with the comic. TWD started great and faithful to the source material then got bogged down. The Witcher, eugh. 

If the last of us has a lasting impact I hope it's that the people with the money find someone who loves and understands the source material and let's them stay faithful."
The Devil Next Door,"I finished the book the other month and after a certain point found the Holmes stuff to be an absolute drag on what I really wanted to get back to, which was Frederick Olmsted getting really annoyed over the specifics of park designs."
The Devil Next Door,"Everyone can have their favorite parts, but if prior to reading the book you had told me I would dismiss much of the serial killer stuff and be profoundly captivated by the 1893 Colombian Exposition I would have laughed at you. But that’s what happened. The World’s Fair stuff is magical. And if I was ever offered an opportunity to go back to a time and place, it would be Chicago the year it opened."
The Devil Next Door,"> If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

That also seems like it would be prohibitively expensive. They'd need a huge budget for sets and CGI extensions to show off the large scale of structures and workers and show all the progress over time in building the fair. Not to mention of course its a period piece which makes everything more pricey."
The Devil Next Door,That's literally the only part I care about!
The Devil Next Door,Disagree greatly.
The Devil Next Door,"The race to put together the World’s Fair is the actual story though, it’s not in the middle of a story about a serial killer. And there’s a lot of dramatic thrust there, wouldn’t be hard to structure it in an episodic format. It’s not like it’s just dudes staring at blueprints, there’s fires and storms and huge egos and crazy people coming from around the world and people dying under construction failures.

If anything in the book the HH Holmes stuff gets kinda repetitive and feels tacked on. It’s pretty clear to me that Larson wanted to write a book about the World’s Fair and the publisher made him include a serial killer hook."
The Devil Next Door,"And a 20 minute aside on the layout of the fair and the risk of flooding that they had to avoid.


It why I never read Thunderstruck also by Erik Larson it's the same schtick of a bunch of interwoven events occuring and some just aren't interesting."
The Devil Next Door,"Blood Meridian, too. 

I had no idea Confederacy of Dunces had been through adaptation hell. I feel like that one would require exceptionally gifted writers. The line between hilariously off-kilter and just weird seems like it'd be very fine for this one."
The Devil Next Door,Throw *Neuromancer* in there too.
The Devil Next Door,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is another great book that has had an adaptation in development hell for many years.
The Devil Next Door,"At first you had my curiosity, but now, you have my attention."
The Devil Next Door,But star power also brings in financing and this will be a very expensive period piece.
The Devil Next Door,"Exactly lol the thing that would be the easiest to make into a television show would be HH Holmes and his murder house, but that's quite literally a backdrop to the story of the world's fair and the enormous feats to pull off its creation  

Might just be one of those things that simply works better as literature  

However, as someone who loves time period pieces I would absolutely watch a mini series about its creation"
The Devil Next Door,"Yeah, the Holmes stuff is interesting early on in the sense that it's fascinating to watch this guy just sort of glide his way into building this little fiefdom/murder machine but once he has all the pieces of the machine set in place and the initial horror wears off it's mostly just a guy devoid of a soul repeating a pattern over and over again, and so checking in with him almost feels like a chore.

Meanwhile the Burnham side of the book is such an incredible look at what it takes to get something like that done, all the little ways in which it helped shape the century to come in terms of innovations, the labor movement, etc., and really this snapshot of life at that specific point in time. I think a really good show could be made out of it but it would cost a lot and would be pitched at a pretty niche audience, like if a David Simon show about urban development was given a huge amount of money by someone who just wanted to see it and didn't care that they lost a ton of money on it."
The Devil Next Door,I honestly think his capture and trial would be interesting enough for a movie.
The Devil Next Door,"Which for some reason seems to be the way most adaptions worked over the last decade. Buy the rights to a beloved IP, scrap everything the fans love and then come up with their own stories within this universe which is glorified fanfic at best.  
The people behind the Halo show stated they didn't care much for any of the existing lore which turned the Master Chief into a completly different character and ignored canon lore established in every prior media. Or the example of Henry Cavill and the Witcher adaption. The script writers stated they wouldn't respect the author and would come up with way better stories themselves resulting in Cavill leaving the project.  
It seems like many showrunners or script writers want to tell their own story but can't get funding for it. So instead they just pitch an established IP and try to squeeze their own script into it and pissing everyone off in the end."
The Devil Next Door,Same. More than anything I want an anthology series on all the Worlds Fairs. Hell I want to go to a Worlds Fair.
The Devil Next Door,"the amazing thing is what was done for the fair in such a short amount of time.  It's insane, obviously destined for colossal failure, but they pulled it off."
The Devil Next Door,Personally I was enjoying the architectural stuff more than the murders. I found it a fascinating story of the challenges involved in pulling off the fair.
The Devil Next Door,"I haven't read the book, but I wonder if doing something like what Legion did with it's [Jon Hamm narrated asides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-WWoGOf8fY) would work.  Those were sprinkled throughout the season and were used to reinforce the themes of the episode, but didn't apply directly to the story."
The Devil Next Door,"Jesus I thought it was just me.

I picked up that book because people were raving about it but holy lord the number of digressions is preposterous."
The Devil Next Door,"If Blood Meridian was made right, it would be fucking horrifying to watch. Absolutely horrifying"
The Devil Next Door,"> Blood Meridian, too.

Probably for the best, I don't think I could picture anyone else playing Judge besides Phillip Seymour Hoffman."
The Devil Next Door,"For a while every star cast in COD had died so it was considered cursed, but I think that has ended"
The Devil Next Door,Bioshock infinites setting is based on the Worlds Fair so there's that atleast
The Devil Next Door,"Yeah the murders are just the hook to get a wider audience interested, the real meat is in that sweet sweet Ferris wheel"
The Devil Next Door,I found myself skimming through the Holmes chapters to get back to the interesting stuff about the fair.  Really cool to visit Science and Industry in Chicago after reading it to get a sense of the scale of it all.
The Devil Next Door,By the digressions you mean all the murders right? Because those are the real digressions in the book.
The Devil Next Door,"Yeah I agree, a lot of the asides felt like he was trying to reach a page count. Spread too wide and thin for me. I'd rather have read a In Cold Blood story of the killer."
The Devil Next Door,Yep. I'm guessing that's why every 2-3 years another star shops it around and then drops it.
The Devil Next Door,Oh man. He would have been perfect.
The Devil Next Door,I think Stellan Skarsgard would be great
The Devil Next Door,But how many marriage proposals were there on it???
The Devil Next Door,"Will watch because: Chris O'Dowd

Still hoping for another IT Crowd reunion"
The Devil Next Door,If you like O'Dowd give Moone Boy a watch.
The Devil Next Door,"This is so exciting!! The pilot was actually filmed in my hometown almost a year ago and I got to be an extra on it. I hope I can see myself in the episode! (It look place at a carnival so I’ll be on the lookout for that scene)

Edit: At the time it was called [Zoltar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8548836/) and was supposed to take place in the same universe as Tom Hanks’ “Big”."
The Devil Next Door,Looking forward to it. Apple has been giving me a lot of hits lately
The Devil Next Door,OP seems to only post about Apple+ content.
The Devil Next Door,"Shrinking has been amazing too, Apple has some hits already"
The Devil Next Door,I love that this show doesn’t premiere for 2 weeks but a dislike for the show in the article is that the season ends abruptly.
The Devil Next Door,"“A small town is forever changed when a mysterious machine appears, promising to reveal everyone's true potential”

The premise makes me think of the video game Control. An Altered World Event with the “mysterious machine” being an Altered Item or Object of Power."
The Devil Next Door,The Good Place was thought-provoking ? I enjoyed it but i might have missed something.
The Devil Next Door,To be fair The Good Place wasn't exactly thought provoking.
The Devil Next Door,well that’s a low bar
The Devil Next Door,Good place was thought provoking?
The Devil Next Door,"I see y’all have never seen Xavier Renegade Angel smh. Renegade Angels, arise up!"
The Devil Next Door,"glad reviews coming in positive, the trailer wasn't the best but looks like it's worth checking out."
The Devil Next Door,Another Apple TV banger? Sign me up
The Devil Next Door,Anyone who feels similar better have watched Get Shorty. He was *fantastic* in that.
The Devil Next Door,“a fire….. at a sea parks…?”
The Devil Next Door,Heard that’s unable to happen due to a fire…..in sea parks?!
The Devil Next Door,Have you tried turning it off and on again?
The Devil Next Door,Anyone with kids who likes him should watch Puffin Rock on Netflix. It’s delightful.
The Devil Next Door,Might be tricky given the show's creator being politically controversial.
The Devil Next Door,Another? Did they do one that I missed?
The Devil Next Door,Saw on IMDB he’s credited for 1 episode… despite being on the poster and heavily featured in the trailer 🤔🤔they better not be baiting and switching
The Devil Next Door,"Oh nice, I was just looking at the cast and thought I didn't know anybody."
The Devil Next Door,"Oh man, how good was the IT crowd?

I think the girl with glasses has a new Netflix show 
Cunk on earth 

Anyone seen it?"
Meet the Adebanjos,"You oughta know, sweetie"
Meet the Adebanjos,"Paulie had the greatest comedic timing on the entire show, he was a spot on throwback to vaudeville, just perfect"
Meet the Adebanjos,"The Sorpanos showed that these gangsters are not the cool and honourable mafiso they want to be seen as. They’re ass-kissers, bullies, cowards — but you’ll still find Tony Soprano used as an example of ‘real men’ in memes!"
Meet the Adebanjos,Thanks. Now I have to watch the whole series again.
Meet the Adebanjos,The guy was an interior decorator!
Meet the Adebanjos,NOBODYS GOT AIDS!! I don’t wanna hear that word in here again.
Meet the Adebanjos,"Paulie has every right to be nervous, that scene where Tony curb stomps the guy who creeps on Meadow. Oof, Madone!"
Meet the Adebanjos,Chrissy...he's fucked up!
Meet the Adebanjos,It's may ham!
Meet the Adebanjos,"Great television show of all time.  
whaddya hear whaddya say!"

Meet the Adebanjos,That kid was the worst character

Meet the Adebanjos,I love how Paulie just screams his name whenever he ends a conversation
Meet the Adebanjos,What? We're bustin' balls here!
Meet the Adebanjos,I knew *that* was comin’!
Meet the Adebanjos,Whateva happened to Gary Coopa?
Meet the Adebanjos,"If he was a real man, he'd having the makings of a varsity athlete."
Meet the Adebanjos,This is why I love the Sopranos. It's a dark comedy about these lame baby boomers who have extremely poor impulse control.
Meet the Adebanjos,"Well, this isn’t Tony in this scene, it’s Paulie, who is absolutely an ass kisser and a bully. 

And while I agree that Tony is an absolute scumbag, to pretend he doesn’t have considerable machismo and projects an imposing presence is missing a lot of the point of the show. 


It’s toxic masculinity for sure but it is a sort of “traditional,” masculinity. It’s frequently shown to be juxtaposed with characters like AJ or Artie. Tony *is* a tough fucker. But that’s not necessarily a good thing.


Edit: the show actively pushes this too, it’s not subtle about it at all. There is literally a scene where Tony bursts into a (naked) politician’s bedroom and whips him with a belt for sleeping with his *former* mistress. The guy swings his dick around in everyone’s face constantly."
Meet the Adebanjos,"I fucking love this show. In this 1 minute clip, David Chase says what other shows take an entire episode to say.

For example, I'm watching 'Snowfall' right now and holy fuck, the pace makes me want to rip my hair out. I like John Singleton as much as the next guy but good god. 

Yes, I get that Franklin is grown up and business savvy. I get that Leon is as gangsta as they come and is at ends with Franklin. I get that Alton was a Black Panther, drug addict trying to redeem himself. They just beat you over the head with these plot lines for several episodes when all you needed was 2-3 minutes to get the point across and then move onto something more interesting or further develop these characters and explore something. I really enjoyed Season 1 and 2 but after that, it feels like a show where they didn't realize they were going to get renewed and are just retreading old ground over and over again because they don't know what else to do."
Meet the Adebanjos,"> Tony Soprano used as an example of ‘real men’ in memes

Haven't seen a single example of this since the rise of the internet, but since people unironically use Ron Swanson in the same way even though he's a blatant caricature even in the actor's eyes, I wouldn't find it surprising at all."
Meet the Adebanjos,"> but you’ll still find Tony Soprano used as an example of ‘real men’ in memes!

Are memes supposed to be taken seriously?"
Meet the Adebanjos,His house looked like shit
Meet the Adebanjos,"Don't they have medicine they're supposted to take, these assholes?"
Meet the Adebanjos,Why don't you get outta here before I shove your quotation book up your fat fuckin' ass!
Meet the Adebanjos,You made an alt account to post this? Lmao
Meet the Adebanjos,"Listen to him, he knows everything!"
Meet the Adebanjos,He’s definitely not likable but he does give a pretty good outsider’s perspective on how traumatic it would be to be around excessive violence
Meet the Adebanjos,He was objectively the most decent recurring character on the entire show. He was cringe but overall a good guy. Glad he eventually got away from Meadow and her crazy ass family.
Meet the Adebanjos,Better than Meadow’s other boyfriend that kid really sucked
Meet the Adebanjos,"My favorite thing is that Tony does that whole rant at least twice in the series. It's as if he has the routine memorized, like Sil's Godfather homage. Very New Jersey fatha thing. ""He's talking about Gary Cooper again..."""
Meet the Adebanjos,"He was gay, Gary Cooper?"
Meet the Adebanjos,"I know it’s Paulie, just pointing out Tony the main character is still hero worshiped. And you right, on the surface Tony is a tough guy — but viewers know he’s a insecure guy with mother issues."
Meet the Adebanjos,Fuckin’ intanet
Meet the Adebanjos,Don’t make me pull rank on you kid!
Meet the Adebanjos,Poor you
Meet the Adebanjos,Noah or Jackie Junior?
Meet the Adebanjos,"Catching, not pitching?!"
Meet the Adebanjos,">	but viewers know he’s a insecure guy with mother issues.

He definitely is, and I think your overall point still rings true that the Sopranos does a great job showing how unglamorous the mafia really is…

but while the other people in Tony’s crew are mostly insecure and bullies, I personally think Tony is a genuinely intimidating/manipulative/unhinged motherfucker due to “this thing of ours” that he grew up around. He’s got a genuine foothold in the North Jersey area. So much so he’s got cops in his back pocket, hooked up with a corporate lawyer who was trying to buy properties he owned, got some random stranger to take off his hat simply by staring him down, killed a made man simply for killing a horse/hooker (depending on interpretation), etc. The other guys are insecure, but Tony’s a ticking time bomb"
Meet the Adebanjos,"""Life's too short Chrissy, you can't waste it fighting with your friends.  Look what happened last night, someone could have gotten hurt for Christ's sakes.""  (said after they murdered an innocent waiter over a tip)"

Meet the Adebanjos,"Jamal Ginzburg, the Hasidic homeboy."
Meet the Adebanjos,social club? He’s gotta go!
Meet the Adebanjos,"Exactly. He is absolutely a tough guy. By pretty much any definition. So if that’s your perception of what manliness is, and it is to a lot of people, Tony *is* going to epitomise it in many ways. 


He’s a hulking brute who is capable of literally beating people to death with his bare hands. He curb stomps a man in the middle of a restaurant while holding another man at gunpoint for making crude remarks towards his daughter. 


He is not a good person, nor hero. But if your idea of manly is someone you’d be terrified to fuck with… he ticks that box. Coward he ain’t."
Meet the Adebanjos,"> Tony is a genuinely intimidating/manipulative/unhinged motherfucker due to “this thing of ours” that he grew up around. He’s got a genuine foothold in the North Jersey area

Another layer to what you’re saying here is that Tony also shows flexibility in how he gets what he wants which adds to his intimidation and scary aura. One of the episodes, he simply harassed a guy to return his deposit over a beach house without ever resorting to physical violence just by blasting music and having enough money to pay off fines indefinitely."
Meet the Adebanjos,Noah. Fucking hated that prick
Meet the Adebanjos,">He curb stomps a man in the middle of a restaurant while holding another man at gunpoint for making crude remarks towards his daughter. 

I don't know that that's an example of him not being a coward, both the gun and his station protect him from any reprisals."
Meet the Adebanjos,"No, it literally does not, they end up at war. Not over that exclusively but it was a factor. And you think he couldn’t beat the shit out of Butchie if he wanted? He wasn’t part of it. The gun was telling him not to even try intervene. 


But I wasn’t using that as an example of him not being a coward, just that he is clearly not someone you fuck with. He went *that far* with a made man from another family."
Meet the Adebanjos,"Just started watching this and absolutely LOVED it, it’s definitely not a typical superhero show"
Meet the Adebanjos,"In case anyone is wondering, the song is “Something for Your Mind” by Superorganism, and yes that is the actual band appearing in the show."
Meet the Adebanjos,It's incredible how fast this series exited the collective mind. Nobody seems to talk about it.
Meet the Adebanjos,I wish some of the characters from Legion would pop up in Loki.  The production design for the TVA seems heavily inspired by Legion.
Meet the Adebanjos,I found Switch exceptionally attractive.  Shame her role basically disappeared after the first couple of episodes of that season.
Meet the Adebanjos,I wish the whole season had been a bit more inspired like this.
Meet the Adebanjos,Well that was odd
Meet the Adebanjos,Love this show and how absolutely trippy and fucked up it was willing to get to tell its story.
Meet the Adebanjos,I really like this scence and a lot of the first half of season 3. I think the second of the season really drags
Meet the Adebanjos,Best Marvel television show.
Meet the Adebanjos,I watched it years ago with the closed captioning on and thought the word `SUPERORGANISM` was explaining the nature Legion’s relationship with his followers.
Meet the Adebanjos,It appeared on Fifa soundtrack the same year this season came out so when they played it on the show I literally did the Leo DiCaprio pointing at the tv meme ha
Meet the Adebanjos,"Their first album was my most listened to of 2018, I even went and saw them live. (One of the weirdest concerts I’ve ever seen btw) Try as I might though, I just really couldn’t get into their new album World Wide Pop."
Meet the Adebanjos,"WOW I didn’t realise it was also the actual band, damn"
Meet the Adebanjos,Thought it was them
Meet the Adebanjos,"My family talks about it all the time. The third season especially clicked really well with us. I've never read marvel comics, so I was completely blown away by >!David being the son of Charles Xavier!<. I think that there's just so much media that when a show ends, the people who watched it will talk about it, but it doesn't leave certain circles. Like Atlanta, another FX show. Very satisfying ending, to me. Great series. But I haven't seen anyone mention it online since it ended."
Meet the Adebanjos,Is it still good?
Meet the Adebanjos,"If nothing else, everybody knows MCU's X-Men is coming eventually. There's zero reason they couldn't involve some of the cast into the films/tv shows that follow."
Meet the Adebanjos,There was a 3d season?
Meet the Adebanjos,Needs a full series Blue Ray release.
Meet the Adebanjos,It is an absolute masterpiece of anachronisms. I loved it.
Meet the Adebanjos,Yeah. But it does end up having more style than substance.
Meet the Adebanjos,"A shorter answer than you're getting is that, yes it's worth watching. Super weird, very memorable, extremely creative."
Meet the Adebanjos,"Dan Stevens is wonderful in everything.  Would love to see him in the MCU, even if he doesn't play David."
Meet the Adebanjos,Maybe the most style over substance show I’ve ever seen - especially how it resolved - but I really enjoyed it.
Meet the Adebanjos,And every now and then we hear Syd saying: *David*
Meet the Adebanjos,I'd just like to see him more often in general
Meet the Adebanjos,Yup.
Meet the Adebanjos,"I watched him in a German film, I’m your Man, and he is just as good in another language!"
Meet the Adebanjos,"“Yes, I’m gonna marry a carrot”

“SHE ADMITTED IT”"
Meet the Adebanjos,"Heyheyhey, it's that actor in Maximum Overdrive!"
Meet the Adebanjos,"She was really good in Dead Like Me but my favorite of her roles was City Slickers. ""It was in his car! And I'm not a little girl, I'm twenty!"""
Meet the Adebanjos,She was also on the sitcom [Herman's Head](https://youtu.be/2O7YloHUes4)
Meet the Adebanjos,Isn't she the midwife/nurse who helps Betty give birth in season 3 of Mad Men?
Meet the Adebanjos,"She will forever be Ophelia from The Legend of Billie Jean for me. 

Loved her then, love her now."
Meet the Adebanjos,"Oh, Yeardley Smith from the true crime podcast Small Time Dicks [and nothing else](https://youtu.be/1S8YMBFda6U?t=8)."
Meet the Adebanjos,She totally looks like she’d talk like Lisa Simpson
Meet the Adebanjos,"Rewatched a lot of Simpsons this year and came to the conclusion that Yeardley is very underrated as a voice actress. The rest of the cast gets a little more glory because they voice hundreds of characters and she only does the one, but there’s such a range of emotion in Lisa that to me is very unlike any other character on the show.

[You are Lisa Simpson](https://youtu.be/1igmzkmTv6U)

[BABOON!](https://youtu.be/6HYk3R2WedQ)

Famously they had Julie Kavner do the scene from the movie where Marge tapes over the wedding video over and over again in order to get the right weight of drama from the character. I’d be willing to bet that if that were a Lisa scene, Yeardley Smith would have had it down a little sooner because she does similar things throughout the show a lot more."

Meet the Adebanjos,I loved her on Mamas Family
Meet the Adebanjos,"Jfc, there needs to be a moratorium on New Years Day of using celebrity images in articles that are not announcing their deaths. My heart just skipped a beat!"
Meet the Adebanjos,"She was good (when she was VERY young) in her arc on Square One TV (Mathnet). I'll never forget her saying, ""here, catch!"""
Meet the Adebanjos,She hosts a great true crime show called “small town dicks” & I think married one of the co-hosts?
Meet the Adebanjos,Holy shiite didn't know she was married to **Detective Dan!!!**
Meet the Adebanjos,She also has a solid podcast
Meet the Adebanjos,Scientologist.
Meet the Adebanjos,Scientologist scum.
Meet the Adebanjos,Dirty work!
Meet the Adebanjos,"Weird fact, but she was the voice of the droid at Jabba's palace that was assigning R2 and 3PO jobs. This was the Return of the Jedi radio drama and not the film. Her voice is heavily modified, but it's her."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"If you're not familiar with The Boulet Brothers' Dragula, it's a drag competition show with a focus on horror, filth, and glamour. A lot of insanely creative weirdos have appeared on the first three seasons, but this two hour special looks like a perfect introduction for new viewers. Really excited to see what they bring to this format and perfect for the Halloween season!"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,This show is amazing. Everyone should give Dragula a shot if they like spooky entertainment.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It's so weird to me that they are so famous now, I member going to black unicorn for years, they have done events forever, never thought they would someday be mainstream, but here we are..."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Only if it has Rob Zombie.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"My grandfather was a member of the easy company. He joined as a replacement just before they got to Bastogne. He wrote in a journal through the entire experience and I have memories of him typing up all of his handwritten journal entries onto a computer in the early 90’s. 

Stephen Ambrose used a lot of his personal reflections as reference material for his books. Unfortunately, he passed in 1996 but when the mini series premiered in 2001, HBO flew my grandmother, mother, and her sisters out to Paris to join for the premiere in Normandy. 

I am so extremely proud to be his granddaughter and wish I had more time with him to ask questions as I was only 6 when he passed. My husband and I took a trip to Bastogne and the Jacques Woods/Ardenne Forest in 2016 and it was incredibly emotional and surreal! The fox holes are still there and the energy is hard to describe. 

The series is so well done and I feel so lucky to have something I can watch whenever I want to remind me of everything he and his peers went through at such young ages."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Band of brothers is one of the few series I’ve watched multiple times. I absolutely love everything about it.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Want to see me cry like a baby? Play the interviews at the end of the last episode, ending with Major Winters “… but I served in a company of heroes.” 😭"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"The moment that sealed it for me was after the Bastogne campaign, where they’re all sitting in the church and listening to the choir. As the names of the dead and injured are read out, they start to slowly fade away one by one…"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"“Masters of the Air” about the strategic bombing campaign is airing on Apple TV+ this year. It’s the third in the trilogy produced by Spielberg/Hanks: BoB, the Pacific, and Masters of the Air."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"I rewatch it every year, absolute masterpiece!"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Sobel may have been the asshole he was portrayed as in the show (though fwiw his family have come out and very publicly claimed he was not) but he did not deserve what happened to him in real life, suoer tragic"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It was a great example of something only HBO could make. Some stories are better told as mini-series as well, but they are so expensive to make that we just avoid making them in the US.

Netflix burned a lot of bridges the last 4 years when cancelling many of their series. It has become such an issue many folks won't give Netflix series a try as they don't want to get invested only to be left with no closure. They should move to doing mini-series for a while to regain trust and tell the stories other networks won't invest in telling because of no multi-season/franchise potential."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Just thinking of the Bastogne episode makes me cold.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Watch Generation War next.  It's from the German perspective and hits even harder.  

Don't sleep on The Pacific either, obviously.  All three give their own unique perspective of the war."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"I'm almost 100% sure that this is the case, but I can't believe this hasn't been mentioned: 

If you're a BoB fan, the podcast that came out at the 20th anniversary, is absolutely incredible. It enriches the experience for both new and old fans by an insurmountable amount.

I've been rewatching the show almost yearly since it came out but rewatching it with the podcast as a companion was a new level of appreciation.

Absolutely everyone of importance and nostalgia is interviewed, the host is sneakily good and intelligent and warm, he is able to facilitate such good conversations with cast and collaborator.

I CANNOT. Recommend it enough:

https://open.spotify.com/show/4kPks2or9xa26GdMRRu2lK?si=PvRdPyLoTJSsPQXbW8QvIA"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Generation Kill is equally as good but in a completely different way
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"The thing that got me was the pre-episode commentaries by the actual people being portrayed in the show. It really shows the accuracy and perfection of the acting and the show production value.

I really need to watch BoB again. What a ride it was."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"The opening sequence of Episode 2, with hundreds of airplanes in the sky at once, really made me understand the concept of ‘nations at war’ at a deeper level, the sheer scale of the conflict and resources involved"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"We need /r/television version of this:

After many years I finally decided to watch [insanely popular, well-reviewed film] and I just want to say that it definitely holds up after all these years! What really stood out was the amazing directing by [Academy Award Winning Director] spot-on acting decisions by some of the legendary cast including [Academy Award Winner], [r/Movies fan favorite], and [actor identified as ""underrated""]. The story makes a grand arc with clever plot twists and a satisfying classic finish, back at the start never to be the same. If you're a fan of [Top 10 IMDB Film], or [Other Top 10 IMDB Film], or any [insert genre] films in general, I cannot recommend this movie enough."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,It probably *is* the most incredible piece of tv ever made
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Really going out on a limb here
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"most shows & movies have the disclaimer: ""Based on a true story""

BoB's disclaimer: ""This is a true story""

""The Pacific"" is just as incredible.  it doesn't follow the same characters throughout, but it does show the literal hell these extraordinary marines went through ( I salute ALL my Devil Dog shipmates!)

& I'm writing to Tom Hanks at least once a month to finish the trilogy, tell the stories of my shipmates in WW2.

plenty of source material: Pearl Harbor, Midway, Leyte Gulf, USS Indianapolis, Doolittle's Raid, the formal surrender on USS Missouri"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"^^^this^^^^

I’ve been saying this since I first watched it.  I’ll take shit for this, but I truly believe that Band of Brothers should be required watching in high school.  We all take our freedoms for granted.  And to think that many of these brave young men even faked their age to be eligible for service."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,I just watched it recently and it was absolutely incredible. Although i’ve heard that it may not be as accurate as it’s portrayed and maybe Winters wasn’t the all around great guy he’s portrayed as.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"I hadn't watched it either until recently and echo your sentiment. I liked that they also weaved in some uplifting sentiments and the cameos from the actual soldiers which was touching. ""Uplifting"" framing in I watched it right after *Come and See* in the WWII binge, which was pretty brutal."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,This is not an exaggeration.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It never stops being good, it’s one of the few shows that is consistent over every single episode"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,First time I watched it I was on a mini R&R break in a random palace on the Green Zone in Iraq as a member of the 101st Airborne Division. I was hyped to say the least.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"The episode “Bastogne” always has me like “f-ck that shit!” Frozen trees exploding from artillery impacts left and right, dude in the foxhole next to you getting a wood splinter though his throat dying choking on his own blood. Id’a noped outta there like a coward."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Move to Generation Kill next
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It is the best miniseries I've ever seen. And easily one of the best TV shows of all time. I think every American should watch it at some point in their lives, even if they have no interest in history."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It's truly special, one of the perfect examples of right people, right time, right medium, right network.

Basically all of those ducks had to get in a row, they did and it created magic. I'd have to think on it a bit, but if you argued it's the best television series ever, I wouldn't tell you your wrong as a gut reaction."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"So fucking good.  I have watched it countless times.  I always remember the DVD being expensive for a long, long, long time.  One of the very few things media, movies, TV, whatever, which brings me to tears.  Especially when they come across the concentration camp.  Everybody's acting is top notch.  Whoever cast David Schwimmer as their lieutenant, wow.  It still surprises me to this day how good he was at being so unlikeable.  Now I want to watch it again."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Band Of Brothers is one I can watch over and over and over again.  Never gets old.  Wish there was more WW2 films that was filmed like this.  Even though Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg both did Saving Private Ryan, this just takes the cake."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"I'm going to give the heads up that Pacific is not the same. It's really good and you will enjoy it, but it's not band of brothers and I think it's something to do with the source content being multiple books rather than 1 as in the case of band of brothers. 

Highly recommend the book, some subtle things in the show that are highlighted in the book (hinkel,eat ze armpit ya!)"

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Just started  a “The Pacific” rewatch. If you haven’t caught it, it’s worth a watch."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,The pacific is a must watch for you then
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"A great series that has visually stood the test of time. Is it a perfect historical depiction? No, but its very close, and certainly much closer than a lot of what we get today.

What always floors me is that the musical and visual presentation of the series still fits and doesn't look dated at all. The washed-out, high contrast, gritty style combined with the lower framerates during action sequences really works well to keep the series in the same ring as modern CG movies and shows. Hell, it even sometimes surpasses modern film and TV by being primarily in-camera effects, and leans on CG very sparingly. It doesn't show its age because of that, and the style really embodies the ""1940's WWII"" feeling so it never feels out of place.

The same argument can be said about Saving Private Ryan, though I do feel it's visual timelessness is just slightly second place to Band of Brothers. Still incredible, but just not quite the same.

Again, it's not perfect. But it's pretty damn close!"

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,I’ve always said it’s the greatest single season of any show ever. It just can’t be topped.

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Oh def. It's saving private Ryan as a series but like full quality throughout. Great choice to watch.

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"The Pacific is just as good, though more miserable. But it should be. The pacific theatre was hell on earth.

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,it really truly is a cinematic masterpiece <3
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Watch the Pacific too then. You’ll love it. Although I watched pacific then BoB, and found myself catching things I learnt from Pacific, which made some scenes a bit less realistic in BoB.  

Also, just saw “all quiet on the western front.” Wow. Def watch that too"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"If you are a gamer, you would enjoy r/hellletloose. It appears the developers were fans of the series and used it for inspiration."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"I loved the series as well. Back then, I had no interest in war movies or shows. I always viewed them as just action movies that were all about shooting people with nothing much happening. When I gave Band of Brothers a chance, I immediately understood the gravity of war from their points of view. I then branched out to other war stories and games and I learned that there's a lot of very interesting stories to learn about in them."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,I loved Damien Lewis (Lt Winters) in it. BoB made me watch Billions and Homeland.

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Episode 9 is one of the best and most hard hitting bits of TV ever
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,You'll be watching it again in a week. It's one of those
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Band of Brothers shows the totality of war. The training, the preparation, the fact that soldiers don't like being left in the dark. The lengths they will go to to survive, and how respect is earned and lost in the field. 

There are few other movies that show this. Saving Private Ryan is one of those few. War should never be shown as pretty or noble, war shows the worst of mankind, and also humanity at it's best.

If you want to see another series similar to BoB, check out The Pacific. Also, a Swedish band named Sabaton does a lot of songs based on history and warfare. Check them out, as they have taught me a lot more about European history than my high school history ever did."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,This post reminds me that I'm long overdue for a rewatch of Band of Brothers as well as The Pacific. It has to be years at this point.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Bastogne was the best episode
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,They show clips from BoB in some Army schools as examples of good leadership and it’s assigned as homework to watch the entire series. It’s an inspiring and moving show.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"The Pacific is equally good and made to the same impeccable standard, its about the US war in the Pacific Islands and conveys the same weight of human cruelty and perseverance. Band of brothers will always be the GOAT of these types of shows but I must say I think i prefer the Pacific"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Chernobyl is right up there with it and is by the same people both are amazing
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Now watch The Pacific, it's even better."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,I want to enjoy military tv series or movies but i cant... Because all the soldiers wear the same uniform and i cant tell who is who.

The Boulet Brothers Dragula,We all experienced this the first time we watched it.  After you’re done you’re almost exhausted by the emotional rollercoaster and wonder if you can ever watch another show.  Very few others are as immersive as this series.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"In my opinion, there are two mini-series' that exist that are perfect, and couldn't be improved upon in any way.  Band of Brothers, and Lonesome Dove.  Just gimme a bottle of bourbon and a blu-ray of either one, and you've made my weekend!"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Yes, it really is excellent."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,We have  watched it every memorial day for the last 15 years
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Amazing mini-series, I rewatch it every now and then. You should watch The Pacific now! Just like Band of Brothers but a bigger focus on the horrors of war rather than brotherhood."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It was great Jimmy Fallon was really believable.

As I’ve gotten older, and as the unfiltered stupidity of war comes out of places like syria and now ukraine, I have a hard time understanding the fascination people have with war media. It’s almost all moonshine."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Literally just watched the last episode for the 20th or so time.
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"It is very good.  I also think that ""Das Boot"" is a masterpiece. (1981 or 1985 versions)"
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"Great show, I’ve rewatched it more than a few times. The only part that takes me out of it all together is when Jimmy Fallon shows up in a Jeep and doesn’t even remotely try to act."
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Hot Take but I think The Pacific was the better HBO series
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,To me it is a great show that belongs in history. Watching Americans portrayed as relentless good guys in 2023 makes me question all the history I have learned. How many My Lai stories were covered up to create this spot less victory?
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,Just heard there is a new series coming out based on airborne troops
The Boulet Brothers Dragula,"I mean it's good but it's not incredible imo.

I bet that dude would be out there for 4-6 hours a day, acting like a maniac with a camera the whole time, just to get 5-10 min of quality content. I bet it varied day to day, but using the streets to continually pump out content must be volatile. Dude should use his gifts on a show that won’t breed so much inconsistency and stress."
Billy on the Street,NAME A WOMAN!!!
Billy on the Street,I don't think it would work as well now even if he did. He could still pull it off but I feel like he's going to be famous enough that the show would lose some magic.

This guy ran up to me with a camera crew and shouted in my face “KERRY WASHINGTON’S BABY” in 2014/15 when I was speed-walking on 23rd St in NYC and late to catch a train. Now I can die in peace knowing what the hell that was all about."
Billy on the Street,I miss difficult people
Billy on the Street,I would have sex with Paul Rudd for a dollar.
Billy on the Street,"QUICKLY!! FOR A DOLLAR! NAME A WOMAN!!


NAME A WOMAN!! JUST ONE!! NAMEAWOMAN!"
Billy on the Street,Even for a dollar?!
Billy on the Street,I would hope not. Seems like something he has outgrown.
Billy on the Street,"It was a stupid, fun show that had a lot of hilarious moments. But I agree he’s too famous now for it to work in the same way. It used to be this tall, loud, flamboyant man running up to you on the street asking you to name any woman for a dollar. Now I feel people would know what’s up and just get excited to be approached by him and not get thrown off in the same way."
Billy on the Street,"Half of the replies are “he’s too famous for this now” lmao a bunch of people who have never lived in New York, you see b-list/c-list celebs all the time and no one gives a fuck 

Billy Eichner is on the same level of fame as Keenan Thompson, like trust me he’s not getting swarmed by a crowd of people asking for his autograph when he walks down the street lol

The reason he won’t do this show again is because he wants to be taken seriously as an actor and not a guy best known for doing a YouTube bit"
Billy on the Street,People who don’t understand this are also wondering why Joel McHale won’t do any more episodes of The Soup.
Billy on the Street,"Like *Jiminy Glick* and *Between Two Ferns*, once the ship has sailed, it's sailed."
Billy on the Street,I’d really like to see him as a main character. Loved his guest role as the airline clerk in New Girl and his role in Friends from College.
Billy on the Street,"My favorite Billy on the street was with Seth Rogan walking next to him:

Asks random person “Did you hear Seth Rogan died”? 

Seth Rogan standing right next to him 

“Just kidding! HE’S ALIVE”!!

So stupid. So funny."
Billy on the Street,Can we get a new season of Difficult People tho? Me and the other three people that watched it really miss it
Billy on the Street,"Billy: Sir, for a dollar, name a movie. 

Sir: Duuuh Uhhhh Uuurrgghh

Billy: DUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHH

Amazing television. Laughed my ass off."
Billy on the Street,That episode in which he [lost his temper](https://youtu.be/LC1EfMmiYVA) at Joel McHale is gold.
Billy on the Street,eric andre for annoying people
Billy on the Street,I still don't get how this guy made a career off of that character.
Billy on the Street,"""Our long national nightmare is over..."""
Billy on the Street,"On the one hand, so what? And on the other, who cares??"
Billy on the Street,Good.
Billy on the Street,"I don't like his schtick, the yelling and screaming is not for me."
Billy on the Street,Will we ever see elena ever again?
Billy on the Street,"I don't know how this show lasted as long as it did, it's just a guy borderline harassing people but its okay because he's a celebrity"
Billy on the Street,Good that show was horrible and he is horrible and annoying
Billy on the Street,Thank god !
Billy on the Street,"I saw him filming it once. It looked exhausting! Hr and Will Ferrell were running up and down the block on the hottest summer day, with a huge crowd following behind him as he talked to people. 
Maybe Billy can now be Billy in the spa, or Billy hanging out poolside- to give the man a rest!"
Billy on the Street,NAME A WOMAN!!
Billy on the Street,#FOR ONE DOLLAR; who make the best street interview show ever???!!!?
Billy on the Street,"Honestly, good."
Billy on the Street,"No. NO! Nooooooooooo! 

Wait. Who?"
Billy on the Street,Good he’s annoying
Billy on the Street,Give me another season of Difficult People and I don't care what the fuck he does.
Billy on the Street,When I first moved to NYC- I saw him almost every day running up and down 42nd street screaming in peoples faces. He’s too famous to be doing that now
Billy on the Street,Billy Swollner.
Billy on the Street,##Promise?!? 😁
Billy on the Street,No one cares
Billy on the Street,I’ll miss this show. It’s how I learned about Denzel Washington’s amazing performance  in phantom of the opera.
Billy on the Street,Are the Berenstain Bears Jewish?
Billy on the Street,"The episode with Michelle Obama, Big Bird and Elena in a supermarket is one of the funniest clips it should have a zillion more views"
Billy on the Street,Arrow?! NO!
Billy on the Street,"Well, there’s covid19, and most of the time it’s little old ladies who yell at him."
Billy on the Street,He's going places and he better take Elena with him.
Billy on the Street,"I didn't even know who he was like a year or so ago. Then my gf and I had kids and I was putting something on just to pass the time and as background noise. I put on ""Billy on the Street"" not really knowing what it was. 

My gf and I proceeded to laugh our asses off through every episode. We finished all the seasons in like a week. That shit was hilarious.

Sad there won't be any more hilarity from him essentially yelling at people on the street for a dollar, but I totally understand why. It must've been exhausting running around like a madman all day"
Billy on the Street,Thank you.
Billy on the Street,I can't stand this guy so this is a win
Billy on the Street,"Good, he’s annoying as shit"
Billy on the Street,The most annoying man with the most annoying voice of all time
Billy on the Street,Good. Shit sucked.
Billy on the Street,It’s really funny but I get exhausted after *watching* more than one episode so I can imagine a little bit how he probably feels
Billy on the Street,"I just want him to do red carpet interviews for the Oscar’s in the same style, just once. Or host."
Billy on the Street,"Cool, so he can just keep posting the same 10 clips over and over and over again on his TikTok channel lol."
Billy on the Street,“Name a woman”
Billy on the Street,Ah gee... One of the original asshats of online content will no longer produce assholery... Let me go.mourn our collective loss. We'll all be less stupid for it.
Billy on the Street,Not a huge loss.  The bit is played out.
Billy on the Street,RIP Billy on the Street
Billy on the Street,Boo
Billy on the Street,Best news I heard today. Bravo.
Billy on the Street,"Im ok with that, but now give me Billy on the red carpet doing this exact show with confused celebs."
Billy on the Street,I don’t get why he’s so hung up on being the first gay rom-com guy and so self-righteous about it. Joel Kim Booster did it this year with Fire Island already so Billy must be pissed.
Billy on the Street,"From the article:  


How do you see the future of Billy in the Street, if any?  
In terms of the future of it, the vast majority of it is behind me. Maybe for special occasions we’ll bring it back. Obviously, it was not Covid-friendly. It’s a big part of my life, and it’s most likely why I’m getting the opportunities that I’m getting now, and I’m proud of it. But I’m never going to do half-hour episodes of Billy on the Street again, and I don’t ever see it coming back as a regular thing. I’ve just moved beyond it creatively. I did it for so long. People don’t realize but the first Billy on the Street-style video I made was for my live show in September of 2004. It predates YouTube! So it was a very, very slow burn of a success story. I’m not saying never ever, but I’m never gonna do it regularly again.  


His answer literally ends with ""I'm not saying never ever..."""
Billy on the Street,It was a very of the moment annoying show. It always seemed like a launching pad for his carrier.
Billy on the Street,Good his show was toxic and he should be somewhat embarrassed that that's what slungshot him to fame. That show is a cringey gimick where being an annoying and loud asshole is confused for jokes/comedy. Modern day Perez Hilton.
Billy on the Street,Oh no! Anyway
Billy on the Street,good
Billy on the Street,good
Billy on the Street,everyone here is acting like one of the most popular shows on television (impractical jokers)  doesn’t have famous people that are sometimes recognized during their jokes and then it’s edited out of the final cut.
Billy on the Street,"It’s so weird how much Reddit hates him, even a few commenters here are leaving multiple comments saying they don’t like him. So like, move on? Lol"
Billy on the Street,Did anyone ask?
Billy on the Street,Good I got tired of him fucking with people who were clearly on the spectrum.
Billy on the Street,"I have a feeling it’s the same issue that The Eric Andre Show is hitting. They’re too popular, too recognized, and too many people are in on the bits."
Billy on the Street,Who
Billy on the Street,GOOD
Billy on the Street,Good. It was obnoxious.
Billy on the Street,Good
Billy on the Street,Thank god
Billy on the Street,"White man yelling at random people is played out now.

Thanks Trump."
Billy on the Street,Good
Billy on the Street,Good news.

Billy on the Street,Who asked?
Billy on the Street,[deleted]
Billy on the Street,good. that show was dumb anyway
Billy on the Street,Good because he’s fucking annoying.
Billy on the Street,Good because he’s fucking annoying.
Billy on the Street,He should do a movie like Between Two Ferns
Billy on the Street,Good
Billy on the Street,🎶He’s making dreams come true 🎶

Billy on the Street,"“Sorry about him, we ruined peoples days in New York earlier”"
Billy on the Street,"That's sucks, I love Billy"
Billy on the Street,Never? Billy on the Street is gold. Would he make more seasons for a dollar….?
Billy on the Street,That’s disappointing. I love his style of comedy
Billy on the Street,Is this the guy with the lazy eye whose schtick is yelling alot?

Ad Vitam,What's this about?
Ad Vitam,"Ahhhhh, the French."
Ad Vitam,Could be nice... but who wants to sit and listen to french-speak for an entire series?  The two minutes of french in this trailer was enough for me to unvoluntarily expel acidic vomit through my anus. My chair is ruined.
Ad Vitam,I loved it.  This and Transfers both were quality sci-fi shows that really sucked me in to the worlds they built.

Ad Vitam,Very much so.

Ad Vitam,cool
We Are the Wave,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
We Are the Wave,The visual of Joel’s wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.
We Are the Wave,"I like how Troy Baker is listed as Video Game ""Joel"" in the BTS after the episode"
We Are the Wave,there is 100% a very bad reason why david was a teacher before the outbreak
We Are the Wave,"I do like how at first it seemed like they only ate the one guy who died, but then joel finds the whole room full of bodies. so they been at this a while"
We Are the Wave,[removed]
We Are the Wave,Always wondered how a video game actor as good as Troy Baker would do as a live action actor. The answer is good
We Are the Wave,So was the implication that they were eating the girl’s father in the dining hall? (Among many other people evidently)
We Are the Wave,"""It's okay, I believe him."" 

So badass and so chilling at the same time."
We Are the Wave,That grown man just slapped a little orphan girl in the face and then fed her her father. Eric Cartman would be proud.
We Are the Wave,[removed]
We Are the Wave,the meat from the soup isn't venison is it...
We Are the Wave,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
We Are the Wave,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
We Are the Wave,“I made you eat your parents”
We Are the Wave,the actor for david did a great job
We Are the Wave,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
We Are the Wave,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
We Are the Wave,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
We Are the Wave,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
We Are the Wave,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‘own’ her as his pet at his side. I’d recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
We Are the Wave,"I’m seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
We Are the Wave,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
We Are the Wave,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
We Are the Wave,"""Baby girl"" 🥺 

Gonna go weep brb"
We Are the Wave,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
We Are the Wave,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
We Are the Wave,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
We Are the Wave,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
We Are the Wave,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
We Are the Wave,"Indicative of David’s character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else’s

Edit - 4x’s the cannibalism"
We Are the Wave,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
We Are the Wave,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
We Are the Wave,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
We Are the Wave,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
We Are the Wave,[removed]
We Are the Wave,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
We Are the Wave,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, “baby girl.”"
We Are the Wave,I’d nit pick Joel’s recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn’t so fucking awesome
We Are the Wave,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I’d expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
We Are the Wave,"""I believe  him"""
We Are the Wave,100% that kid’s dad was the ear
We Are the Wave,Oh yeah. That’s that shit I like right there
We Are the Wave,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
We Are the Wave,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
We Are the Wave,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
We Are the Wave,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
We Are the Wave,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
We Are the Wave,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season 😬"
We Are the Wave,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
We Are the Wave,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn’t others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
We Are the Wave,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in “it’s okay baby girl” was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, “In an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.” And damn if Joel and Ellie aren’t stainless steel survivors."
We Are the Wave,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
We Are the Wave,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
We Are the Wave,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I’d just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
We Are the Wave,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
We Are the Wave,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
We Are the Wave,I counted 22 stabs…damn Ellie
We Are the Wave,Great episode overall. I wish they could’ve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
We Are the Wave,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
We Are the Wave,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
We Are the Wave,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn’t still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind 😳
We Are the Wave,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
We Are the Wave,If you’re gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
We Are the Wave,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
We Are the Wave,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
We Are the Wave,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
We Are the Wave,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
We Are the Wave,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
We Are the Wave,"I’m curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
We Are the Wave,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
We Are the Wave,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
We Are the Wave,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
We Are the Wave,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
We Are the Wave,[removed]
We Are the Wave,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
We Are the Wave,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
We Are the Wave,Ellie’s screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
We Are the Wave,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
We Are the Wave,"As someone who’s never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It’s hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I’ve seen in ages, and am loving it."
We Are the Wave,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
We Are the Wave,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
We Are the Wave,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
We Are the Wave,That went by so fast
We Are the Wave,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
We Are the Wave,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
We Are the Wave,Pretty faithful to the game. Wish that David would have said the line of how is he supposed to explain his broken finger to everyone else. Then Ellie introduces herself.
We Are the Wave,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
We Are the Wave,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
We Are the Wave,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
We Are the Wave,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
We Are the Wave,"“It’s okay baby girl, I got you” I AM NOT OK"
We Are the Wave,"Holy fuck that episode was intense. There were so many incredible lines of dialogue in this episode too.

The final scene with Ellie in the dining hall literally had my jaw dropped. The emotion Bella showed as she killed the cannibal rapist preacher was next level. What an incredible actress.

I love how this show doesn't linger on side characters. They introduce them, somehow make us invested in just a few minutes and then move on. They don't spend half a season stuck in one QZ. They don't draw out things like Joel coming back from the stabbing. I absolutely love that about this show."
We Are the Wave,"the biggest twist from david for me its not that he is cannibal or creep r-----. But that he actually worship cordyceps all along, its his God, find god after apocalypse, etc."
We Are the Wave,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
We Are the Wave,Fuck.
We Are the Wave,"Jesus, that was intense"
We Are the Wave,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
We Are the Wave,"I thought it was weird that the fire did absolutely nothing the entire last scene.  Neither of the characters acted like there was a fire and they had a lot of fire cutaways like it was building to something.  After she got out I expected the fire to attract colonists, but they just walked away.  If everything was on fire just for the vibes I think it was done badly."
We Are the Wave,"I love that they focus on the more human element of these situations, it’s really a character driven program and you can’t have as much action as the game since it wouldn’t be realistic.

But damn after Joel dropped that “Don’t worry I believe him” line and just murdered the other dude, I’m not going to deny that I’d love to see more of Joel just being a badass out here."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Hey Netflix, if you could stop spoiling the reveals in the trailers from now on, that would be great."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Is this going to be Season 5? Or is this just a special? I thought they were going to Philadelphia for Season 5.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,this show is horrible
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,It'll be a four episode special :)
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Aw man, he was the perfect first. The show has its high and low points, but for a pilot, he couldn't have been a better candidate. That's really sad, hopefully they do a tribute."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,that’s sad to hear. I loved Tom and his redneck margaritas.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,That episode made me binge watch the show.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"> He once dropped the iconic line, ""You can't fix ugly.""

Sad. Rest in Power 🙏🏿"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"That’s sad. He was pretty much off the deep end with his far-right politics before the show and then returned to the status quo not long after, which is pretty depressing considering how open and friendly he was to the Queer Eye team. Can’t have been an easy life for him. Seemed to get a bit worse after his dad died. Poor guy."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Glad that Queer Eye became such a hit thanks to episodes like this one, but it's unfortunate that it went to such a disgusting man. Must've been difficult to shoot with him."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Well shit .....
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,No!! He seemed like such a sweet man!
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"I wonder how the farmer guy in last season who was literally having alcohol withdrawals (unaddressed) during his makeover. 

Like yeah apologize to your ex we can’t fix all this byeeeee"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Aw man, he was a sweetheart. RIP."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Meh, he was a bad person. Just protect Mama Tammy"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Oh, sad. He seemed cool"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"I’m sad when anyone dies of course, but why do people like this guy? He was an alt right conservative weirdo. Not a cool person."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,This episode had me SOBBING. Rest In Peace to a kind soul 🥲
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Fuck Cancer
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Now I read about his political beliefs ,just yuck on that aspect.
Still anyone dying of cancer is sad"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,We’re all wondering. Did his final outfit in the casket have a French tuck or not?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Cancer is such a scourge.. sad to hear, he seemed like a good dude."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"I remember this episode as someone willing to be open to what he didn’t know. 

There was that great teachable moment when Tom asked in a gay marriage who was the husband and who was the wife. You could see the lightbulb go off through the parting clouds when they said they were both husbands. 

I don’t want to call it a seminal TV moment but I firmly believe many people learnt a lot in that exchange. Tom was open about not understanding but he was also open to learning. It was very powerful."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"I enjoy Queer Eye, learned a few things from it, RIP Tom. To soon my friend."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Rip great episode
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,that is the most qualified obit headline I've ever read
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,So why are people hating on this guy what’s the backstory?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,That was an amazing episode!!!
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Daaaaaamn ♥️
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Slow news day eh
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,So much for the makeover
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,I remember that episode
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,The title has to be so long to explain why this guy was relevant to pop culture.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"But this episode my my bitch ass cry :(

He was so happy, he really couldn't believe that he had ""something to work with"" and when they helped him see it it was genuinely incredibly touching."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"He was a great first on the show.

I hope his life was good."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Aww I remember him ❤️
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Time to rewatch 1st episode . I’m just about caught up on the rest of the series. I actually prefer the American original Queer Eye show . I do like this one as it’s growing on me
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Gonna go pour out a redneck margarita for my homie
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Who gives a shit?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,News?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"63 is so young :(. RIP, King ❤️"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Thank you Tom.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Could he go on QE and spout Fox News? Ya. They gave him a new outlook, not change who he was. It’s his ignorance with LEARNED racism. Tom made friends that day AND Tom is a product of his environment..It’s very southern."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"He was really kind . Didn’t seem to know what to expect at first with the guys, but they grew on him and was very grateful for the help. He was so nice."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Shit. That's a bummer. Is that show coming back?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,oh man… that’s so sad
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Probably the only episode I watched of the full series. Hus margaritas and his jorts were the main takeaway. RIP man, you were an absolute legend"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,What was his cocktail? Mountain Dew and Vodka?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"That’s sad, he was lovely"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,[deleted]
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,:/// he was so sweet
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Such a sweet man, RIP"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,[deleted]
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Coincidence? I think not…

(/s tho, seriously)"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Nope, don't like that"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,We hardly knew ye.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Crab people
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,NOOOOOOO
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,<\3
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Oh no, I only saw 2 episodes and that was one of them :("
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,RIP to a legend 🙏
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,RIP legend
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Although I'm not gay/lgbt/whatever, I remember enjoying the original Queer Eye show in the early 2000s. It was a happy show where they made crappy homes look high class. I learned a couple of useful arrangement/display tips from that show."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Argh.  He was a good guy.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,He seemed like a nice guy.  Press F.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,That was a great episode
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,RIP Brent crystals
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,My dad is 63. Tom did not take care of his body…
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Noooooo
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"RIP, I'm sure he's leaving in style."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,[removed]
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Fuck cancer man!
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,RIP Bert Chrysler
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,RIP Bert Kreischer
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,rest easy
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Tom was a really kind man. I met him about 20 years ago and sadly, he looked old and similar to how he looked on the show cause of his health issues. I assumed he was in his 60s then! I was so happy to see him getting some of his vibrancy back from the glow up. His big heart was always there and you were lucky to have met him.

RIP Tom. I hope you wore that hat until the end. You know the one. I wanna say you can see it briefly in the episode but it’s not the one they bought for him."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,I’ve only watched random segments. What are the low points? Just clients who weren’t good tv?
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,This is so sad! I teach ESL to adults and I still use his episode in class sometimes because students always ended up falling in love with him. Sad news.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Remind me what that was?  Wasn’t it like vodka and Mt. Dew?  This guy was really cool and I hope he went peacefully and surrounded by love.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Oh me too - he was such a sweetheart.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"I heard my girlfriend and her friend crying in the next room, assumed it was just some average reality TV, sat down and joined in, and it was a done deal from there, goddamn."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,I’ve never forgotten this line since I saw this episode. He verbalized what I’ve always felt about myself. This is so sad. He seemed like he had such a sweet soul.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"NO. Not “rest in power”. Do not say this about this man. This is a white, alt-right dude. At best you can say “rest in peace”.

Edit for the deleted comment:

**Rest in Power is used for people who have died due to oppression (e.g., racism, homophobia, transphobia…), and activists against the oppression.**"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Where’d you get the info on his politics and stuff??

But it makes sense, sometimes the environment you’re in can make it hard to leave that way of thinking for good."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Holy shit, just looked at his Twitter account and yeah it’s full of dumb political takes"
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Yeah they definitely “reach across the aisle” and sometimes make a genuine connection but a lot of these bumpkins probably turn around celebrate their free stuff and go back to Fox News dumpster in a week acting like they conned the gays, Netflix and Hollywood to all their friends."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,They might have just kept it simple and shot around issues.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,He was a racist arsehole. They edited him to seem nice.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Apparently he wasn't. Made some offensive comments to Tan and Jonathan
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"People contain multitudes. He was a sad old man with confidence issues, and had them partially resolved by a group of strangers who did a good thing for him.

If anything, the fact that a bunch of liberal gay dudes from NYC can have that connection with someone so otherwise removed from their culture and values is pretty nice. It's a little oasis in the increasingly vast desert between rural and urban America.

John Cleese is off down some silly rabbit hole these days, but I'll still be absolutely gutted when he dies. I can't just write off someone as a person, not until they're *really* far gone. Some people, like Alex Jones or Mitch McConnell are actively making things worse and they have a huge net negative on the world. But there's too many random people who vote stupidly for me to hate them all carte blanche."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,"Because everyone would hate everyone if people know their real feelings. I would hate you if I knew some things you’ve thought about and you would hate me. 

People are people. Find an identity over politics."
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,He truly wasn’t. If you cruise through his tweets he was racist
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,Apparently he called Tan a terrorist.
Queer Eye: Were in Japan!,This ep made a big impression on me. They just showed him so much *love* he cried when they left! So inspiring.

Probably not.  To start with, cancer isn’t a singular entity that would require a singular cure.  Even two people with the exact same type of cancer often need completely different treatment from each other.  We’ve made great advancements in the treatment of many cancers though and continue to do so regularly."
Hache,"Just finished episode 1, and as of now, Malpica's tendency towards violence against women removes any sense of ""sexy"" for me.

And ""branding"" his women? Wtf? Eye roll.

I suspect it'll make the progression of the female protagonist that much better though, so not letting the misogyny disgust me completely...yet."
Hache,I’m obsessed with him 😭😭😭😭
Hache,"Coke drama

Heroin drama

Next up is meth drama called **Sm**ashing **S**ad"
Hache,If it's half as good as Money Heist then I'm aboard.
Hache,Netflix's path the future growth will be producing high quality programming in other languages for for non-US/Canadian markets.
Hache,"I'm failing to see how this is Netflix ""doubling down"" and the article really doesn't clarify it either. Either way...I guess this is...a thing? Don't really care where something comes from or what language it's in as long as its good."
Hache,"It's not an Original, but Netflix has ""The Time In Between"" (or ""El Tiempo Entre Costars"" in Spanish) which is a good Spanish limited series of a young seamstress in the 30s and 40s who becomes involved with spies in WWII. I found it to be a lovely drama and it's only about 18 episodes if anyone is looking to get into one. Not much action or thrills, but I liked it a lot. And coincidentally the main character is played by the same actress as this article's show - Adriana Ugarte. "
Hache,"Makes a lot of sense, Spanish is a massive language, so it is a good idea for Netflix and other streaming services to produce quality shows for Spanish speakers. "
Hache,Anne?
Hache,Cool. Now maybe I can motivate myself to learn Spanish if there are more quality Spanish shows to watch.
Hache,"Are any of the Spanish Language shows good so far? I see a bunch of them and my fiancee wants to learn Spanish so it seems like a good idea.   


Too bad many of them are about the drug trade and she's already nervous about visiting my home country. "
Hache,"If they're popular, seems like a great idea, but I wish I had an option to filter them out of my Netflix lists. A lot of times I'm just not in the mood for subtitles. "
Hache,Gesundheit!
Hache,"They could just buy the rights to Metástasis, the spanish version of Breaking Bad. "
Hache,This is big for the US market as well. The US is only second to Mexico as the largest Spanish speaking population in the world. 
Hache,I think they are just making more Spanish TV shows
Hache,I just hope they're dubbed and not subtitled only
Hache,"Money Heist is great and doesn’t involve drugs.
"
Hache,"I agree, these shows sometimes look good but if I have to read my TV I’m not interested. "
Hache,"and its an underserved market for high quality tv shows too.  Nearly everything in the Hollywood is produced in english, and mexican / south american companies can't match Hollywood budgets   
Netflix could make themselves 'the HBO of Spanish shows' for a huge market"
Hache,"It's good exposure for the US as a culture as well. We've coddled ourselves with largely English speaking views or interpretations of foreigners through our own eyes. When something like *Dark* or *Le Casa de Papel* gets a sizeable audience here it grows our cultural understanding and reduces our unknowns. We can build empathy with other cultures by seeing what sorts of tropes, themes, and lifestyles they choose to cover in their media, even within action films and hard scifi."
Hache,"""Don't really care where something comes from or what language it's in as long as its good.""

Are you sure? I don't think I've ever seen a French or German or Japanese or South Korean TV show ever mentioned on /r/television. It would be quite notable if Netflix managed to capture English-speaking audiences with subtitled dramas. 
"
Hache,"Same for me.

Purist will come and tell you you NEED to see it in it's original language.

I don't care. I always watch movies while doing something else, barely watching at the screen.

Subtitles are a no go for me."
Hache,I honestly think it’s a relatively untapped market that Netflix is almost monopolizing. I’m excited to see what that means for language integration in general (since subtitles are pretty good on Netflix).
Hache,"Starz [has said in the past](https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/starz-hispanic-blair-witch-project-1201675052/) they want to capitalize on this, and released the very-good *Vida* recently (not not a whole lot of viewers). Starz doesn't have nearly the money Netflix does though, and they're only one network."
Hache,"Can’t speak to the other languages, but Dark was a German series talked about a lot on this subreddit. "
Hache,"> Are you sure?

Not OP, but *I'm* sure. I'd agree with their statement.

(1) There still aren't many few foreign-language shows being imported, relatively. There will be over 500 scripted shows released this year, I'd guess not many of those will be foreign-language still.

(2) The ones that are, do get discussed here. *Les Revenants* was a French-language hit of sorts a few years ago. Germany has had *Babylon Berlin* and *Dark* very recently, *Deutschland 83* before that. *Terrace House* gets discussed here and there. *3%* is a tiny Brazilian show that gets discussed. Netflix's *Money Heist* and *Bala Loca*. Etc..."
Hache,"Did you miss ""dark""?"
Hache,Have you ever tried watching any?
Hache,"How about Hotel Beau Sejour (Dutch), The Returned (French), Trapped (Icelandic), The Bridge (Danish)?

Those are all worth watching."
Hache,"Spanish speaker here living outside US. I read the recent coverage in [vulture.com](https://vulture.com) last week and they are not targeting markets based on geography or regions, they consider slices (their term) of different tastes. Some Spanish-speaker producers are really good adapting material or generating original content without a niche view, you don't need to be born in their town to appreciate it. And when they tweak a used idea they usually twist it and end with a good product."
Hache,"I've watched so much foreign stuff on Netflix, and talked about a ton of it here.

Try Black (woman falls for the Grim Reaper) or Lucid Dream (two lovers across time and a video game dimension) if you want something Korean and can accept that their dramas are a little soap opera-esque *and* gonzo. There are already several other suggestions here for great European shows."
Hache,"I agree, plus, if I'm sitting still for a movie, watching words instead of the characters messes that up"
Hache,"Ugh, *Les Revenants* was so good, but I can't seem to convince any of my friends to watch it! A bunch of my coworkers watch Terrace House too. I've watched a few foreign shows on Netflix, more recently including Money Heist, The Bridge, Dark, & La Reina del Sur. "
Hache,[deleted]
Hache,"Foreign shows might be my favorite thing Netflix is doing. It's an easy route to more diverse storytelling. For me it's almost worth it alone to have shows that are set or shot somewhere unfamiliar. I.e. not NY, LA, ATL or Vancouver."
Hache,"I agree it's just based on preference, and get why you may not. With that said, I never knew Netflix had any movies that were dubbed "
Hache,think i got through the first 2-3 episodes but got side tracked...not cause it was bad or anything.
Hache,"I loved it personally. Yet feel they made a massive mistake with the ending. 

Loved the cat and mouse between detective, Hache and the bad guy (who was so good as a character, very seductive yet repulsive)."
Hache,"I wish they didn’t give Malpica this ending, he is such an interesting character. I wanted to see his revenge on her in season 2."
Hache,I feel like they’re going to make us think he’s dead and he’ll try to get his revenge but at the same time having him survive those shots seems too much lol
Hache,Same here! I want her to think he’s dead. Idk where they’ll go for season 2 if he’s dead
Hache,Do you know when season 2 will be released?
Nowhere Man,"Loved this show to pieces!  I would've loved another season, but S1 ended on such a perfect note."
Nowhere Man,"Great show with interesting premise and excellent performance by Greenwood. And for once, a cancelled show that ended on a high note."
Nowhere Man,"Waited for months for next episode as a kid

Had no idea it was cancelled"
Nowhere Man,"And, yet, you can't stream it from anywhere...  😠"
Nowhere Man,"Haven't watched the opening credits in years, but his narration and the theme still haunt me.  Definitely one of the best one-season shows.  So odd to see Bruce Greenwood with long hair and rocking a denim jacket.  He went on to become a very successful character actor, he's been in everything."
Nowhere Man,"Great show. Definitely belongs in the 1 and done HoF with Firefly, Profit and Terriers. 

This show would need a new focus if it were relaunched now, as the original plot line about the photo negatives could be explained away by Photoshop before the opening credits rolled in episode 1."
Nowhere Man,I loved this show as a kid but never saw the ending. It's been lingering in my brain for years. A few months ago a co-worker told me how it ended and I felt both unsatisfied and fulfilled.
Nowhere Man,Maybe my favorite show of all time.  I loved this!
Nowhere Man,Didn't it end on a cliffhanger?
Nowhere Man,"Did you try YouTube? 

I remember re-watching the entire season last year on YouTube."
Nowhere Man,"I don't think it was a cliffhanger per se, but I do remember a lot of the major questions being answered but it left room for the series to continue"
Nowhere Man,"Without Larry Hertzog?!!... Probably a bad idea.

Also, ""Nowhere Man"" is pretty much the A#1 example of a show that should have been closed-end from the start. So, if they reboot it, they should go in with a ""We're doing 20 episodes, or 30 episodes, and that's it. We'll wrap it up."" 

They also need to think carefully about the ""conspiracy"" part - even Hertzog seemed to be ""winging it"" on that in places."
Nowhere Man,"Loved that show! Every time I've seen Bruce Greenwood in something since then I've gotten excited.

They really could have done a lot with that series if it had a chance.

It's a shame it was on UPN right when the network first started. Viewership ratings on anything besides Voyager was probably super low."
Nowhere Man,The pilot episode was brilliant - it almost works as a stand-alone Twilight Zone-type episode. The ending was great with him standing at a literal crossroad in the middle of nowhere with no idea who to trust.
Nowhere Man,Nowhere Man is one of those shows that I feel like just vanished from the face of the planet after it went off the air. Strange Luck is another good one from around that time that only lasted one season before being canceled and seemingly never from again.
Nowhere Man,"Frankly, I'm just hoping for a good video transfer of the original.  The DVD I watched a few years back looked like they just found the episodes on some VHS tapes at a garage sale."
Nowhere Man,"Great show - was lucky to track down a copy online.

Introduced it to a friend recently, and he didn't care for it. Was basically like - this is a solved issue. The government would just say the negatives were photoshopped, and no reason for the conspiracy. I thought that was a really good point. So the plot holes of the show don't age well, but the narrative arc was a trailblazer for a lot of shows that came afterwards."
Nowhere Man,Damn i wanted to rewatch it but knowing the ending makes it difficult to do so. hard to be motivated when you know there is only one season and how it ends.
Nowhere Man,Also I think back then executives didn't think audiences were smart enough for such series
Nowhere Man,That's because it was never made into HD or anything so that was the quality of the time. I have the entire series and love it so much but I think it was before its time.
Nowhere Man,"The fake season finale explained away this.

Having your identity erased over a photo was a gnarly concept."
Nowhere Man,"They could literally just leak obviously photoshopped versions themselves, then leave Bruce shouting ""No, I swear! These are totally real!"" to nobody in particular."
Nowhere Man,Isn’t Us & Them a Netflix original? Flavors of Youth? I’ve seen Chinese products before on if.
Nowhere Man,I thought ghosts were a big no no in China?
Nowhere Man,Expect homophobia and zero LGBT representation.
Nowhere Man,The Ghost Bride seems to have gotten some of its costume design wrong other then that it is good.
Nowhere Man,Expect me to prolly not watch..
Nowhere Man,[removed]
Nowhere Man,Accidentally in Love is also Chinese
Nowhere Man,"Prob targeting immigrant Chinese in america. Singapore, Malay, etc. Or Taiwan"
Nowhere Man,"Nowhere Man has a major LGBT character, one of the better written characters in the show too."
Nowhere Man,"Since there is rap music I was wondering if that was a concious choice!  Definitely felt different than mainland ""historical"" dramas"
Nowhere Man,"Almost a sentence, A for effort"
Nowhere Man,"Go into it understanding Lost is a show about emotion and human connection, its not a show written for geeks, it was a show that everyone from 40 year housewife to nerdy 12 year olds were into. It gets more sci-fi as it goes on.  

I find when people discuss Lost now they base its success on the technical details of the plot, but the show has never been replicated properly because everything after it lacked the score, the direction, the patience and the acting."
Nowhere Man,"Yea. Lost is fun to watch and see the characters and mystery unfold. Enjoy.

Some people complain about the ending but I really enjoyed the ride and the ending. It was a culture defining show."
Nowhere Man,"It's worth watching.  Just prepare yourself going in because this was in the days on TV when 22 episode seasons was the standard for all hour long dramas, so it can drag at times.  But on the bright side of it, the show had a fantastic cast who all do a tremendous job and that usually offsets the slower parts."
Nowhere Man,"Yes, the characters are brilliant"
Nowhere Man,"I personally think it's still very much worth watching, and I rewatch the show fairly regularly. However, there are definitely certain types of people who wouldn't be interested in it.

If you don't care about character studies and just want to get to the weird sci-fi/fantasy stuff right away, you may get bored with the show. If you expect the show to perfectly match our world in terms of science rather than expecting it to be a sci-fi show, you may be disappointed. If you expect the show to directly tell you the answers to all of the mysteries instead of occasionally answering mysteries indirectly, you may believe that the show failed to answer a number of its questions (especially if you don't watch the bonus material like the epilogue, web series, etc.). If you can't stand shows that reference religion or mysticism, you're going to get annoyed by the show a lot. If you take everything everyone says at face value despite what the show has shown you to be true (like taking a character's misinterpretation of a phenomenon to be the only interpretation of that phenomenon), you may be disappointed with some of the answers that are given directly to you. If you plan on watching the show in the background while playing on your phone or something, you will probably miss a lot and be very confused the further you get into the show.

But if none of the above are issues that would hamper your enjoyment of the show, then it's an extremely well-written, fun, gripping, exciting, twisty show that you should definitely give a shot to. (And avoid looking up anything about the show or its characters if at all possible because spoilers (and misunderstandings about the show) are everywhere and could easily hurt your enjoyment of the show.)

Most people who try the show find that they are hooked after the pilot, after episode 4, or after episode 10. So I would at least give the full two-episode pilot a watch and gauge how interested it makes you. If you're interested but not hooked, watch through episode 4, Walkabout. If you're still not hooked after that but are still interested, watch through episode 10, Raised By Another. If you still aren't hooked on the show by that point, it may just not be for you."
Nowhere Man,"Try to ignore a lot of the character and plot promises it makes in the first couple of seasons. It's a show built for mood, moments and intrigue and not for payoff.

Many characters change based on the needs of episode plots, most narratives are discarded before they resolve.

BUT it has some truly amazing TV moments. You're often in deft hands and they build thrilling episodes regularly. I think if you can watch without the inconsistency or flighty-ness bothering you, it's full of rewards."
Nowhere Man,"I really wish I could wipe my mind of any Lost-related episodes knowledge, so I can watch it again for the first time."
Nowhere Man,Yes but watch one ep a week and wait a while between seasons. As if it were on tv. I know it will take a while but you know how we felt. How great it was
Nowhere Man,You should do this
Nowhere Man,"Yes, you should. Still my favorite TV show!"
Nowhere Man,If possible try find someone else that hasnt seen it and watch it together. A big part of why people got so into it was talking/theorising about it
Nowhere Man,Best show ever!!!
Nowhere Man,YES!
Nowhere Man,yes yes yes yes yes yes .....yes
Nowhere Man,Absolutely.
Nowhere Man,Yes. Don’t worry about the ending
Nowhere Man,Just watch 12 Monkeys again. If you are going to watch Lost just know going into it that if you have a question while watching the show  it will almost never be answered.
Nowhere Man,"I avoided it for years because I heard about the ending and came to find out everyone misunderstood the ending, it was really good imo."
Nowhere Man,"Must-watch television, for sure."
Nowhere Man,"I haven't seen anyone mention Nowhere Man in ages. Bruce Greenwood was awesome. I loved that show.

Yes, definitely watch Lost."
Nowhere Man,Better than the rest of tv show you listed
Nowhere Man,Yes! I’m in the midst of my first rewatch since I originally watched it ~10 years ago and I love it.
Nowhere Man,I really enjoyed Lost. Like u/vision2062 says “the characters are brilliant”
Nowhere Man,Yes
Nowhere Man,"It's worth it imo, despite the controversy surrounding the finale. Just think for yourself, if you like interesting characters then you'll enjoy Lost. The early seasons have a lot of filler episodes but they're still fun."
Nowhere Man,Yea.
Nowhere Man,"Yes, it's one of the best shows I've seen in my life. Entertaining, good cast, exciting plot, you'll connect to the characters immediately. Incredibly fun show that delivers solid entertainment, once you start you'll be binging it, but like another comment mentioned it might be good to delay the gratification for the suspense. 

Enjoy the ignorance of watching it for the first time and don't read any spoilers, it is really best enjoyed with suspense."
Nowhere Man,first couple seasons are all right
Nowhere Man,Lost will choose to take you in if you are ready.
Nowhere Man,If you don't care about being totally satisfied by the ending.
Nowhere Man,"Funny, I just finished the show for the first time last evening. I recommend it greatly."
Nowhere Man,By all the gods please no. Watch Dark imo!
Nowhere Man,"I know im going to get downvoted to hell, but; **No**, its not worth it. Are there some good performances by the actors and halfway decent plots? sure, but its not worth the time sink to get there. There is better media out now"
Nowhere Man,"Yes, provided you can stay away from internet critics and spoilers."
Nowhere Man,[deleted]
Nowhere Man,"Yeah, just don't let This is 40 ruin the ending for you like it did for me.. Still a little salty since I was just finishing season 5 at the time :'("
Nowhere Man,Yes if anything for the Music alone
Nowhere Man,"If you like being dragged along over and over again just to be disappointed in the end, yes absolutely."
Nowhere Man,Good for the first 2-3ish seasons. The very end doesn't make any sense.
Nowhere Man,"No.  It starts out cool, but before too long you realize it’s going nowhere and there’s no explanation to anything and the answer to the mysteries is just more mysteries. It’s bad writing disguised as something profound but when the seams come apart it will drive you mad."
Nowhere Man,I would suggest watching the entire thing except that last episode and I mean that.
Nowhere Man,"The first 3 seasons are amazing, plus some good moments after. Definitely worth it for a while."
Nowhere Man,"Am I glad I did? Yes.

Would I do it again? No."
Nowhere Man,"It's a great watch. I like to re-watch it every so often. The finale isn't spectacular, but it also isn't Dexter S8 bad."
Nowhere Man,yes! it is my favorite show!
Nowhere Man,"When it initially came out, I couldn't get past the pilot.  It's a binge watch type of thing vs an episode by episode.  The first seasons, I enjoyed.  That final season was an epic fail and utterly disappointing.  So, yes and also, you've been warned."
Nowhere Man,"Definitely yes!  But for me the most standout part for Lost are the characters and not the mysteries. When you are looking for amazing mystery pay offs it's not  perfect, but I love the characters and the show has so many memorable moments so I think its worth it. I watched it twice in only three years."
Nowhere Man,Absolutely and don’t listen to what people say about the ending. One of my favorite shows of all-time
Nowhere Man,"Not sure if you've decided, but it's still in my top 3 shows of all time. It's a must-watch. An incredible experience from start to finish."
Nowhere Man,first 4 seasons are some of the best stuff ever. Last 2 aren’t great honestly lol
Nowhere Man,I'm not going to lie I like human connection and watch other non scifi shows but I prefer it more often then not but ill keep this in mind thanks
Nowhere Man,"Oh good lord what a load of bollocks. 

Just go into it knowing it doesn’t have a satisfying ending. The first few seasons are a great roller coaster ride, but the last few episodes suck."
Nowhere Man,"It's telling that you'll find tons of people talking about how emotional the finale was, simply due to the strength of the connection they felt between characters and the relationships that were highlighted."
Nowhere Man,I remember the days of Charmed and Buffy I prefer the short seasons but ill keep that it minds thanks lol
Nowhere Man,I will keep all of this in mind. It'll be only my for January I can give it 10 episodes.
Nowhere Man,"The water cooler was such an integral part of that show -- all the theorizing with your friends, reading all the deep dives on Entertainment Weekly and the AV Club, the PAINFUL wait between seasons....TV will never be like that again, for better or worse."
Nowhere Man,"That was great way to watch at first, but I think it's also why people didn't like how it ended. People liked discussing the mysteries between episodes, but didn't get the resolution they were hoping for."
Nowhere Man,I feel like the binging model nowadays makes Lost a better show
Nowhere Man,I watched it for the first time a couple months of ago. So ahead of its time.
Nowhere Man,What seasons would you say was more filler just want to prepare
Nowhere Man,I have heard this which is why I have been hesitant. I also like overarching mysterious.  I just finished person of intrest and I really and to push through the filler episodes.
Nowhere Man,Why are people on this sub so pathetic? Where should people go to ask for suggestions about TV shows if not r/television? Not everyone is super decisive and sometimes a second or a third opinion really helps in deciding if a person wants to watch a show or not. How hard is it for you all to comprehend?
Nowhere Man,"While This Is 40 does spoil the ending, it's more than a little misleading about one of the things it says about the ending."
Nowhere Man,This.
Nowhere Man,It might not make sense if you're an idiot or weren't paying attention. It's one of my favorite endings of any show.
Nowhere Man,100% correct.  Sorry to see the down votes.
Nowhere Man,Wow
"Bring It On, Ghost","This is one of my favorite shows out right now. I like the British one a little more, but watch them both equally!"
"Bring It On, Ghost",Good! It's great show
"Bring It On, Ghost",I was so confused for a second as there are already four series. I hadn't realised that the US had done their own version
"Bring It On, Ghost",Ok networks. now develop more comedies.
"Bring It On, Ghost",This show is so sweet and wholesome. Feel like we need more of that.
"Bring It On, Ghost",It's a big hit with the ghost demographic I hear.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Network TV is back. I think it's because streaming hasn't given us anything to laugh at
"Bring It On, Ghost","I really like Ghosts, I don’t watch CBS shows usually but I saw a commercial for this during a NFL game last year, it was a clip of the ghosts ratting on Jay for eating the Oreos, so I checked it out and it was better than expected, Rose McIver is great and the supporting cast is really good 

The s1 finale was imo the weakest episode of the season so it’s nice to see s2 starting off strong"
"Bring It On, Ghost",Thought this was a meaning the BBC version...
"Bring It On, Ghost","this one sparks joy. i liked the premiere. i miss it. recently i watched series 4 of the original uk one. they both had the same plot for season premiere. us one handled it a bit better for me. my love for this one keeps getting bigger. but they both great shows.

for those who didnt try, i definitely recommend the original series too."
"Bring It On, Ghost","Good episode, you got to see everyone and got a feeling of what the season will be like."
"Bring It On, Ghost",I gave it a try after the last season ended and enjoyed it so much more than I expected. Glad it’s back and hope it sticks around for a while.
"Bring It On, Ghost","US Ghosts is really it's own show (only major similarity is the first episode). It's better in some ways than the british version and also vice versa. I would say they are both equally charming in their own ways and I'm glad both are really successful. 

Please don't try to fanboy one or the other it's about as dumb as ""Xbox vs Playstation"" arguments. Be like me and watch and enjoy both."
"Bring It On, Ghost","I watch very little network programming, but I honestly enjoy this series. Didn't know S2 had premiered though, so that's a nice surprise for this evening."
"Bring It On, Ghost","It’s no ants in the shed, but it will do."
"Bring It On, Ghost","WTF?! I didnt even know and yet 6 million others did? Well at least my dvr did, from first season and recorded it. Just checked it."
"Bring It On, Ghost","Has anyone watched the original BBC version?  I don’t know if it’s just me but I’ve tried to watch the US version but can’t, it’s like a cringy version of the BBC one.  I’ve tried to watch a few episodes but keep comparing and just can’t do it. 😞"
"Bring It On, Ghost","I wish I liked this more. We tried – it's cute, and I guess, harmless, but just didn't laugh. Just wasn't funny. I think the premise is there but the jokes just weren't for us."
"Bring It On, Ghost","Not as good as the original BBC version have to say, I did try."
"Bring It On, Ghost",British version is way better
"Bring It On, Ghost","i did give it a try, 8 episodes, but nope, it's too.
...
i don't know, it doesn't have that je ne sais quoi, i feel nothing for the characters, specially the husband, he's just cringe"
"Bring It On, Ghost","I mean didn’t they rent out movie theaters for the premiere? I feel like that would bump their numbers a bit

Edit: Not to mention spectacle might get people curious"
"Bring It On, Ghost",The British version is so much better
"Bring It On, Ghost","This is one of those rare shows that‘s based on a UK series that makes it past the pilot episode and manages to get renewed for a second. 

It’s an okay show."
"Bring It On, Ghost","As a British viewer I find the American one superior.  This sounds stupid to say out loud but its just a simple, amusing and entertaining show without a 'bad bone' in its production.  The whole cast do a great job and its a bright spot on the TV Horizon for me."
"Bring It On, Ghost","Another Americanization of an English sitcom. Just watch the original, I don't get it 😂"
"Bring It On, Ghost",Paramount? Eh...maybe later.
"Bring It On, Ghost",This show is just a ripoff of deadbeat 🤷‍♂️
"Bring It On, Ghost",6 mil? Holy fuck that’s great
"Bring It On, Ghost",The problem I have is when I start enjoying a show it gets canceled. So guess I don’t  enjoy this show 😏
"Bring It On, Ghost","For a second ..I thought this was a post about Craig Robinson's show ""ghosted"""
"Bring It On, Ghost",Damn succession had 6 million views on its past season premiere
"Bring It On, Ghost",Anyone remember when Rose McIver was the yellow ranger?
"Bring It On, Ghost",I think the British one has a much better start but the American one really came into its own.
"Bring It On, Ghost","The couple episodes that have the same plot are interesting to watch.  The Pete episode starts the same and ends the same but the middle is different.

It's just American humor vs British humor.  They are both good but it's two different types of humor."
"Bring It On, Ghost",I definitely prefer the British one. I didn’t get into the American one. I saw the headline and got excited thinking the British one got a new season.
"Bring It On, Ghost","Based on seasons 1-3 of the UK version, I'd call them even. Season 4 of UK was kind of... rough. Some good eps, some less good. If season 2 of the US version matches S1E01, then US will pull ahead in my opinion.

But really, I love them both!"
"Bring It On, Ghost","Yea.
I wish they had a politician instead of a wall street bro

I also dont like the female lead
I saw her at a comic con once promoting her old zombie show and she was so mean"
"Bring It On, Ghost",Part of me hopes no one in the main cast gets sucked off
"Bring It On, Ghost",I really like the American adaptation but the Original features a huge portion of the Horrible Histories cast and is IMO way funnier.
"Bring It On, Ghost","first season strated off a bit shaky but by th end they were adding their own lore and really found their stride. the viking is my favourite, ""maaaybeee, that means no"""
"Bring It On, Ghost",The British version is much better
"Bring It On, Ghost",The us version is legitimately really good
"Bring It On, Ghost",Why do they always do this? Don't tell me there's a US Detectorists in the works
"Bring It On, Ghost","Streaming services to. There's a real lack of good, new, somewhat more traditional sitcoms. Not everything has to be Atlanta."
"Bring It On, Ghost",Between Ghosts and Abbott Elementary I feel like there’s a real appetite for network comedy that doesn’t overexplain or play down to an audience.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Julia and The Minx on HBO are pretty funny but they might be MaxOriginals which I guess is separate from the network
"Bring It On, Ghost",Develop more good and unique comedies* less The Goldberg’s and The Neighborhood and more Abbot Elementary and Ghosts
"Bring It On, Ghost",It's a rehash of a British show of the same name
"Bring It On, Ghost","So, CBS’s target demographic?"
"Bring It On, Ghost","I've been enjoying Reboot on Hulu. And it started mid, but I also enjoyed How I Met Your Father by the end."
"Bring It On, Ghost",Utkarsh Ambudkar is great in this show too.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Season 4 of the British version is up on iPlayer right now. Like the previous three seasons I enjoyed it and there were some good emotional parts to it too.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Both are good in different ways.  The CBS version has taken its own path away from the BBC version.
"Bring It On, Ghost",It's actually fun watching the difference between the couple episodes that use the same plot (past the premiere).  It's a clear class in the difference in US humor vs UK humor.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Jay thinking that he saw Pete was hilarious.  Pete was so excited.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Right?  Double the ghosts.  Horray!
"Bring It On, Ghost","Same, apparently they film the episodes as they release them instead of doing a whole season in one go."
"Bring It On, Ghost",I love the BBC version. I’m trying to figure out if the CBS version is worth it.
"Bring It On, Ghost","I’ve watched and love both versions. The US version takes a couple of episodes to get good, but it takes the concept and runs with it in really interesting ways while still being really heartfelt and funny. I prefer some of the UK characters and some of the US characters, but the US version definitely has the more interesting mythology while the humor is a bit of a toss-up."
"Bring It On, Ghost","I like them both.  The US version seems to slant a bit more toward US sitcom humor.  I find myself laughing out loud pretty regularly with the UK version.  Narratively, they are pretty similar though."
"Bring It On, Ghost","I love the show, both the US and UK versions of it. I wish they wouldn't call them a comedy though. I sometimes get briefly amused by them, but I watch them for the *heart* of them, for the feelings. I don't find them funny either."
"Bring It On, Ghost","Not every show works for everyone. If you really want to, you could try and see if the UK version of the show works better for you. The husband is a little different in it."
"Bring It On, Ghost",Weren’t the theaters empty though?   (Ghost only).
"Bring It On, Ghost","They rented it out for ~~ghosts~~ [Non-Livings](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/ghosts-season-2-premiere-screenings-cbs-1235387431/), and we all know how viewer counts discriminate against ~~ghost~~ non-living viewership."
"Bring It On, Ghost","The movie theaters were exclusive showings, for the living-impaired."
"Bring It On, Ghost","It's pretty simple really. Most American's have never seen the original or even know it exists, so there's a big untapped market for the show. I've seen the original now, but that's only because I liked the American version and decided to check it out when I found out that it was a remake of a British show.

There's also no reason not to watch them both as the American storylines are mostly original."
"Bring It On, Ghost",You can check out the British version on HBO Max if you have that.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Or ya know cbs.. Free.
"Bring It On, Ghost",This appeared on my Reddit frontpage and all it took was a glance at the screenshot to see that it was a remake. Family is currently enjoying the UK version.
"Bring It On, Ghost","I found out there was a British one from reddit, I tried the American one but wasnt interested, didnt dislike it, but only gave it one episode."
"Bring It On, Ghost",[deleted]
"Bring It On, Ghost",It did! Series 4 just came out in the UK
"Bring It On, Ghost","I watch both and definitely prefer the British one as well. For me the British one gives off a “Everyone here is a family” vibe, while the American one comes across as “Friends.”"
"Bring It On, Ghost",Oh no! What did she do?
"Bring It On, Ghost",This joke will never get old
"Bring It On, Ghost",Me too.
"Bring It On, Ghost",Why not let some of the cast have a good time? What they do in the bedroom is their business lol
"Bring It On, Ghost",Wet blanket
"Bring It On, Ghost",....phrasing?
"Bring It On, Ghost","Season 4 just came out too, watched first episode, still good.

On paper, Ghosts as a premise sounds shit. I'm always surprised at how good it actually is.  Way way better than it should be."
"Bring It On, Ghost",Uk version is hilarious. The character have so much…..character.
"Bring It On, Ghost","I did enjoy the British version, and I think some of the ghosts are used better in the British version, but overall I enjoy the American version more. It's maybe not as laugh out loud funny, but it's more charming and fun. Also, UTK KILLS it as the husband. He's a much more interesting and dynamic character than the British version gives you."
"Bring It On, Ghost","I have watched both and I’m going back and starting over with the British version with my daughter. I think I just prefer British humor. The US version was a slog at the beginning after seeing the BBC version, but it does get better once they start to be their own show. Totally different feel though"
"Bring It On, Ghost",I love him
"Bring It On, Ghost",I want a crossover.  One of the couples needs to go stay in the other's BNB.
"Bring It On, Ghost","The American version is dreadful, the British one is much better"
"Bring It On, Ghost","The most recent comedy that came out that’s just a straight up comedy that I liked was Abbott Elementary. Other than that, I couldn’t tell you a recent comedy to premiere (on network or on streaming) that’s just a straight up comedy that strives to make you laugh that I enjoyed"
"Bring It On, Ghost","Just started Home Economics, and I think that’s pretty good, normal, classic sitcom."
"Bring It On, Ghost",Check out Reboot on Hulu! It’s great
"Bring It On, Ghost",Yeah! They need a category for prestige comedies like Atlanta (I.e. DRAMAS!!).
"Bring It On, Ghost","That's because Reddit shits on anything new that someone tries. All while simultaneously needing to bring back traditional television and let things breathe/build up. Do you know how many Netflix shows fit the criteria of half of these comments? But because it's still trendy to shit on Netflix or play streaming wars, we don't get good shows or for that matter a variety."
"Bring It On, Ghost","You say that but my last few weeks alone have been a mix including What We do in the Shadows, Resident Alien, Harley Quinn, Archer and, hell, even She-Hulk regardless of your takes on it. And of those, RA, HQ, Archer and She-Hulk all aired on Wednesday/Thursday depending on your timezone. Past that you have shows like Hacks and The Great kicking around too - the comedies are there, and they're really quite excellent too, you just have to dig a bit."
"Bring It On, Ghost",[Ghosts is a remake.](https://youtu.be/5e0nB1mSd9Q)
"Bring It On, Ghost",I know but it still was developed as a comedy at cbs. That’s why it’s (this show) a comedy on cbs.
"Bring It On, Ghost","Is it just as boring? 6 episodes of:

Couple: we have an idea to make money

Ghosts: Absolutely not.
(Roll credits)"
"Bring It On, Ghost",This Fool is pretty good if you get a chance to watch it
"Bring It On, Ghost","My wife and I were able to watch it through HBO max. I'm hoping that they'll add the new season to that soon, unless they have already."
"Bring It On, Ghost",Traditional network model.
"Bring It On, Ghost","They don't film as they release haha that'd be crazy
They just release on a standard network TV schedule"
Tomorrow with You,There are so few good retrofuturistic styled shows nowadays that I'm tempted to check this out anyways
Tomorrow with You,I could go for season 4 of Review.
Tomorrow with You,I read similar reviews for Shrinking and that show is fucking hilarious.  So im not going to believe anything until I see it for myself.  Reviewers are just a bunch of clickbait grabbing asshats now.
Tomorrow with You,"Clickbait article. A “snore”? Please, it isn’t The Last of Us exciting, but has some great character development in just the first two episodes. I’m excited to see more."
Tomorrow with You,"I enjoyed the first three episodes, but I could see some common review complaints about it going nowhere being accurate."
Tomorrow with You,"It'd be cool if this was actually secretly the new Fallout show, in a shock mid-season twist."
Tomorrow with You,Visit r/HelloTomorrow for episode discussions every Friday!
Tomorrow with You,"""Snore"" seems to be common quality of ATV+ productions.

Why is everything so fucking serious?"
Tomorrow with You,I thought Apple TV only made shows about psychiatrists.
Tomorrow with You,"It's not a snore. It's a bit odd, and not really sci-fi at all. The setting seems to just be an interesting backdrop at the moment, but the show isn't boring."
Tomorrow with You,It’s not a snore one bit. I’m absolutely hooked. Can’t wait to see how it falls apart.
Tomorrow with You,Bring Forrest back you COWARDS
Tomorrow with You,"I saw mostly good reviews of shrinking. It is great so far, I’m just a few eps in."
Tomorrow with You,Shrinking got really good reviews
Tomorrow with You,Found this way more hilarious than Shrinking
Tomorrow with You,Actually more entertaining
Tomorrow with You,"If you actually found last of us exciting. Making books into games into one thing, but rewatching a game into a movie honestly didn’t do it for me. Then again zombie shows just bore me. 

Watched the first episode of this show, didn’t suck, but didn’t hook me yet. Will continue to watch it. 

For the last of us, I feel obligated to watch it because of the game. Don’t get me wrong, the acting and set design is great, but I know what happens so it doesn’t thrill me."
Tomorrow with You,Have those reviewers seen the entire season or just part of it?
Tomorrow with You,Probably a marketing nightmare but that would be insane.
Tomorrow with You,I wouldn't say this show takes itself too seriously.
Tomorrow with You,Couldn’t be farther from the truth.  You might just have hyper niche entertainment preferences.
Tomorrow with You,"Another one that comes to mind is ""The Morning Show"". Takes itself too seriously, and feels like it's going nowhere and all you hear is people screaming."
Tomorrow with You,I think they have 2 shows about psychology. 2 out of like 10-15 originals (not including the kid stuff) is a lot I guess.
Tomorrow with You,I like what you’ve done with the penis.
Tomorrow with You,"Shrinking   
The Shrink Next Door   
The Patient"
Tomorrow with You,The Patient is FX/Hulu
Tomorrow with You,Weird.  I thought it had an AppleTV logo at the start.  Maybe that's where they rip it from.
Tomorrow with You,Rip what?
Tomorrow with You,"When you watch a pirated version of a movie or TV show, they will usually pull the content from a particular source.  Sometimes even though the show technically airs on broadcast or cable TV, they will ""rip"" it from a streaming service because it's easier, earlier, higher quality or a mix of all those."
Tomorrow with You,That naughty old elf must be one mean bastard to give us this so early!
Tomorrow with You,"Coffin Flop will never not make me laugh.

*""I didn't do fucking shit. I didn't rig shit.""*"
Tomorrow with You,"I just hope Netflix doesn’t cancel this gem because of its obscene budget. I mean the wardrobe cost alone dwarfs Stranger Things. Have you seen how complicated the patterns have gotten?  With all the recent inflation one shirt costs like $413,000!!"
Tomorrow with You,When does it debut on corn cob?
Tomorrow with You,I think I do want to be around anymore.
Tomorrow with You,Gonna celebrate with sloppy steaks
Tomorrow with You,It’s appropriate they announced this on a FRI-DAY NIGHT
Tomorrow with You,"Best news I’ve got all week

Gimme dat!"
Tomorrow with You,"Have you been the victim of unfair treatment by a business or a corporation? Has this ever happened to you? You bought a house, it was not disclosed to you that there was a termite infestation in the walls and in the moldings? So you have to take it upon yourself to call your own termite extermination company. But when the guys show up they immediately ask if they can use your bathroom.  Then for over two hours, they take turns going in and out of there taking huge mud pies and over flushing. Then they go in there TOGETHER and you hear a bunch of ScRoUnGiNg around and then you hear a bunch of YELLING and on of them is standing in the bathroom doorway shouting at you that his friends foot stuck in the toilet. And he says, ""help him, you gotta help him!"" and when you go in there to help him, he just pulls it out easily, and laughs 'cause his foot wAsN'T stuck. It wasn't stuck at all he was just faking it. And then they get REALLY serious, they say, ""IT'S TURBO TIME!"" and they both start running around the house as FaSt as they can and jumping over the couches. But when YOU try and jump in, they yell at you and they say ""YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE TURBO TEAM, DON'T RUN, DON'T RUN WITH US, WE'RE THE ONES WHO RUN! UNTIL YOU'RE APART OF THIS TURBO TEAM, WALK SLOWLY!"" 
So, you go and lay down to be by yourself and read your art books. But then the next day you went into the bathroom and it looked like the hole in your toilet had shrunked and you said, ""how could that be? There's no way they could have shrunk the toilet"" But then you saw in the trash, a receipt from Home Depot for a toilet, the exact same size as yours but with a JoKe HoLe ThAt""S JuSt FoR FaRtS. They replaced your real toilet with a fart toilet! And now you can't take a dump in your house 'CAUSE YOUR TOILET CAN'T SUCK'EM DOWN AND YOU FEEL SICK TO YOUR STOMACH!
Has that ever happened to you?!?"
Tomorrow with You,"Not trying to be funny, not trying to get a laugh, I don’t want anyone to have the worst day of their jobs…. But, do any of these fuckers come out on May 30th?"
Tomorrow with You,"Slopping down some pig shit with these fat fucks and I’m the fattest of them all. If I die tomorrow, no one would shed a tear.  Load my freakin’ lard carcass into the mud. No coffin please! Just wet, wet mud. Bae."
Tomorrow with You,Big fat load of cum then.
Tomorrow with You,What a CROP. That's a CROP.
Tomorrow with You,"I’ve struggled to articulate why I find this show so funny, but the best way I could describe it is that all the jokes and characters are coming from a place that just barely makes sense. It’s teetering on the edge of nonsense.

30 Rock jokes are similar to me."
Tomorrow with You,"Do any of these…

..fuckers.."
Tomorrow with You,I heard Bozos doing the dub
Tomorrow with You,"I’m going to house season three of ‘I think you should leave with Tim Robinson’.

Let me take a video of you saying that you’re gonna kill the president. It’s no big deal, no one’s ever gonna see it.

Unless I hear the story of me housing season three of ‘I think you should leave with Tim Robinson’."
Tomorrow with You,"Did you see Bryan’s hat? He’s still fucking wearing it.

*what the hell…*"
Tomorrow with You,Triples is best
Tomorrow with You,This is right in my q zone.
Tomorrow with You,And the bones are their money
Tomorrow with You,"
I can’t even watch itysl anymore without a big pour of wine!

AnD pOpCoRn"
Tomorrow with You,This thread is great
Tomorrow with You,"Wasn’t it supposed to be April?

This is PUSHED BACK!"
Tomorrow with You,Excellent! This season’s totally in my Q-zone!
Tomorrow with You,Oh my god he admit it!
Tomorrow with You,It's Turbo Time!!!
Tomorrow with You,"I’ve got triples of the seasons. 

Triples makes it safe. Yeah, triples is best."
Tomorrow with You,I heard that guy used to be a piece of shit
Tomorrow with You,"I can’t believe how funny this show is, have been wearing Calico Cut Pants for the last year or so."
Tomorrow with You,"There were too many cars in the last season where the wheels flew off the handle, they need to focus on having more cars in the show where the wheels don’t fly off"
Tomorrow with You,Santa brought it early!
Tomorrow with You,"It premieres one day before the Emmy deadline, so it'll be eligible this year. Robinson won an Emmy last year for S2.

It's 6 episodes."
Tomorrow with You,If you think season 3 is a great gift then eat then you won’t mind if I eat the receipt?
Tomorrow with You,He should host SNL
Tomorrow with You,I'm such a big fan of his music and his acting. This belt I’m wearing. It’s a studded leather belt from Angels and Archways.
Tomorrow with You,Guess I got to re sub to Corn Cob TV.
Tomorrow with You,"If this show doesn’t get thirty seasons, I don’t wanna be around anymore."
Tomorrow with You,I laughed so hard rewatching this show that my water broke.
Tomorrow with You,Don't load my lard carcass into the mud yet
Tomorrow with You,Fuck! They're so dirty!!!
Tomorrow with You,Man I bet this is gonna release right at lunch time.
Tomorrow with You,"It’s interesting, the premiere date."
Tomorrow with You,I know that. IM SMARTER THAN YEWWWW
Tomorrow with You,What if he was going to a job interview and I was the boss?
Tomorrow with You,"Ah reminds me of Detroiters, such a good show, cancelled too soon yet still easily rewatchable"
Tomorrow with You,Robinson you're a genius at this
Tomorrow with You,DONKEY DICK
Tomorrow with You,I don’t think I wanna be around anymore.
Tomorrow with You,This is fantastic news! SLOPPY STEAKS ON ME!!!
Tomorrow with You,I don’t think I’ve ever seen a sketch show that almost every single sketch is laugh out loud funny until this show.
Tomorrow with You,MOON RIVER ROCK. MOON RIVER LOW.
Tomorrow with You,If I don't get to binge the entire season that day I'll kill myself on live TV.
Tomorrow with You,I just excited to finally get some new quotes for these reddit threads
Tomorrow with You,May 30th? Hell yeah. That was also the night that the skeletons came to life.
Tomorrow with You,Jizz
Tomorrow with You,Honk if you're horny
Tomorrow with You,Fuck Bart Harley Jarvis
Tomorrow with You,It’s illegal for you to ask me that!
Tomorrow with You,Why isn't this on Corncob TV? WTF
Tomorrow with You,*honk *honk *honk *honk *honk **honk *honk  *honk *honk *honk *honk *honk *honk *honk **honk *honk  **honk *honk *honk *honk *honk **honk *honk  *honk *honk  *honk

Tomorrow with You,Is that a toupee you piece of shit!?
Tomorrow with You,"So, renew subscription for one month on June 1st. Got it."
Tomorrow with You,Looks like Christmas came early
Tomorrow with You,"There are two things that make me laugh every single time. Thinking of Beavis and Butthead laughing, and thinking about corn cob tv. It’s just so irrationally funny I can’t help it"
Tomorrow with You,"It’s interesting, the ghosts."
Tomorrow with You,Big fat load of cum then
Tomorrow with You,"This show is batshit insane I love it

Baby of the Year! Featuring oral sex bribes and an assassination attempt"
Tomorrow with You,This guys gonna jack off!
Tomorrow with You,Everyone wants Season 3 of Detroiters as well.
Tunnel,How does Epix still exist? Difficult to believe it hasn’t been absorbed into another streamer like Hulu.
Tunnel,"If this show was ok Netflix it’ll be a hit, I can see a lot of ppl liking it"
Tunnel,It doesn't anymore. It is about to be become MGM+.
Tunnel,Well then MGM needs to resurrect Perpetual Grace Ltd!
Tunnel,Isn’t MGM owned by Amazon?
Tunnel,"This show is quick witted and hilarious.  

The best way I can describe the style is a Canadian version of Gilmore Girls/Ted Lasso/Arrested Development for dudes.

Edit: Bums in seats."
Tunnel,"As with Letterkenny, the Shoresy soundtrack *fucking* **RIPS**

Great show, couldn't recommend it enough.

Also, all them rockets? YEW!"
Tunnel,The show feels like a movie. Its very focused compared to Letterkenny. The season flies by. I highly recommend the show.
Tunnel,The Jims are fucking beauts!!!
Tunnel,This show has absolutely no right to be as good as it is.
Tunnel,Unbelievable
Tunnel,Allegedly
Tunnel,You ever seen such beautiful tough natives?
Tunnel,I reckon its got every right
Tunnel,Settle down
Tunnel,That’s a Texas sized 10-4 good buddy
Tunnel,Tough Natives is redundant
Tunnel,"I like the reckon, but seriously… A spin-off starting the most one-note character in a series with a lot of one-note characters, starring a bunch of dudes who aren’t actors. And it became probably my favorite new show of the year. Makes no sense on paper."
Tunnel,"What's weird is that in the Cyberpunk world there's a street gang that modified themselves to be The Brady Bunch, which means there's a gang member out there looking like Cindy Brady. This fact will never stop being weird to me."
Tunnel,"CDPR Developer:

>“She's best girl, but I feel a little bit guilty to say it because I was one of the people on the creative team to actually vote Rebecca out of the original cast during pre-production. CD Projekt Red first got the character design for Rebecca and they were like 'She's a loli. Lolis don't exist in Night City. It doesn't fit the Cyberpunk 2077 aesthetic'"".

Trigger:

>”No, the loli must stay.”"
Tunnel,"I've watched the whole series, and I never saw her as a ""Loli"" character. She's just a short girl. She's clearly an adult, and written as an adult. She's just as competent as everyone around her."
Tunnel,Is this a good show?
Tunnel,"Literally all the outrage in this thread is based on a mistranslation.

Here's how [the interview](https://twitter.com/SieteSeventh/status/1571161774115659776) actually went:

CDPR felt that the character design of Rebecca was ""too cute"" for a dark setting like Cyberpunk 2077. Trigger said that the cuteness was going to make the action and violence pop-up more. Once CDPR saw her in animation, they agreed that her design made her more interesting. 

People frothing at the mouth because they think Studio Trigger was gleefully rubbing their hands going ""yes...yes...we MUST have sexualized children in this anime!"" are getting mad over something that didn't happen."
Tunnel,"i don’t really see anything wrong with them not wanting to redesign her. she seems to be similar to a lot of their usual female side characters like Nonon, Sucy and Lucia; and the design itself doesn’t really look too out of place from the cyberpunk world.

the phrase itself is weird but i feel like there’s maybe some lost context from that conversation or decision."
Tunnel,"The creator of the show recently gave more context to this on Twitter. 

“Just a comment to add context for us wanted to cut Becka. We were quite against it when Trigger wanted to introduce a new character to existing scripts but once we saw this early design we were in. She is a super important part of the story and my personal fav. #Edgerunners”

https://twitter.com/gwentbro/status/1571159352848924672?s=46&t=lOuEBSPB4IA3KBT7FbxoLg"
Tunnel,"She's a loli character? She doesn't come across as one. 

Honestly, from the start she just seemed like a small adult. The way she acts doesn't feel loli in any way."
Tunnel,"Well that dev's paraphrasing really is a trashfire. Without direct actual quotes from Trigger, that's the stupidest way they could describe their reservations."
Tunnel,I never got the impression Rebecca is a loli. Short people exist.
Tunnel,In all my years of Reddit browsing this has to be the worst comment section I’ve ever seen.
Tunnel,"I'm looking at her design...  


That doesn't look loli at all. She's just short and flat chested. That doesn't mean Loli. Loli tends to be pretty explicitly juvenile and childlike. That's just an angry short flat adult. Those exist.   


I wonder if this is CDPR being a little out of touch of what a Loli is and were just concerned she didn't have enough anime tiddy?"
Tunnel,This is cringeworthy
Tunnel,She’s a fucking bad ass is what she is!
Tunnel,"I looked up some scenes and she’s just an adult that’s a little on the short side compared to giants like Jackie and sometimes has a haircut that’s on the more youthful side? Maybe she has big anime eyes?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m fully willing to criticize the whole “five hundred year old vampire dragon that looks and speaks like a child” trope, but she just comes across as a twenty something. Older than David, even, if only by a few years."
Tunnel,She's hardly a loli compared to other anime. I didn't think she was one till seen this
Tunnel,"Yeah Trigger never actually called her a 'loli'.

Also short woman = loli I guess."
Tunnel,"Having just learned what a “Loli” actually is, I am conflicted to say the least. I still don’t think it would be that ridiculous for a character like her to exist in NC. Who would expect someone like her to be able to blast them to bits? It’s like a sort of camouflage. Also, she is just a really good character. She’s competent, loyal, and a good friend to David and co till the bitter end. At the same time, if the trope exists simply to sexualize minors, then I’d rather see her character be portrayed as a normal 18+ as it wouldn’t change her character that much."
Tunnel,"“The Loli must stay” has to be publicity bait right? That or just really oblivious and stupid. The term loli is so volatile and charged it’s guaranteed to light every thread on fire. But the disgusting degenerate loli characters the general public thinks of when they hear the term are nothing like the Rebecca character though? Trigger is generating backlash for a character by associating it with a term that doesn’t really fit well. Like this is marketing isn’t it.

Edit: maybe it’s just a trash article."
Tunnel,Its weird that this discussion even existed cuz in the show shes clearly just a short adult. I never even thought of her as a loli.
Tunnel,"This is Trigger. Sure, lolis don't fit Night City, but pretty much anything Trigger touches turns into gold producing machine. Think star wars visions, it was so good not many people gave a fuck that it shouldn't be possible to cut your sister without killing her with a lightsaber when jumping into hyperspace."
Tunnel,"Between her and Uzaki, is every short character considered a loli now?"
Tunnel,"I just saw the main crew as having an admirable variety of body types. To start, you had a few average or skinny builds, two big and bulky muscle heads (one male, one female), her brother, who was long and lanky, and then her, who was short and petite."
Tunnel,"You guys sure love to clutch pearls on this subreddit, you'd think it was mainly frequented by Facebook moms. Good lord."
Tunnel,"you know, what upsets me is that the show is genuinely an incredible piece of work that deserves conversation and attention around it, but the mainstream discussion is likely to be magnetized around the developers describing the character as this term

I think anybody who's seen the show would just classify Rebecca as a short woman; don't think it ever even crossed my mind that she was juvenile. Voice acting, demeanor, overall presence was of a dangerous, tough outlaw. 

CDPR should really be more careful with their words. damn shame, this'll get remembered as the ""slightly pedophilic character design"" because that's the connotation of the phrase they used"
Tunnel,Its so common place I didn’t even notice it.
Tunnel,She stays
Tunnel,"I never thought of her as a loli 

She was always a one of those fast moving goblins to me."
Tunnel,Gotta read that like it's a Gus Fring Quote.
Tunnel,"Honestly, we could do with less sexualized lollies, and more psychotic lollies with a long history of violent behavior"
Tunnel,"Short adults can exist, especially in a world where most people don’t have organic parts left lmao"
Tunnel,"I’ve been loving this discussion, so many shit takes, its been a blast reading through it all and saving comments kek

Rebecca is a loli and people saying she isn’t have no understanding of the concept of what a loli."
Tunnel,Idk thought of her as someone with dwarfism then a loli.
Tunnel,"She was a great character, so im glad they kept her in."
Tunnel,"If their goal would have been to have a sexualized loli character, they wouldn't have designed her with zombie-like bloody eyes."
Tunnel,"CDPR probably just didn't think she matched the Night City aesthetic of a loli. Because in night city the children just look like tiny adults.

Night city must be rough living, because all the kids walking around look like 3' tall 35 year olds."
Tunnel,Short = Loli. Murica brain
Tunnel,I’m scared to ask what a Loli is lol
Tunnel,Trigger just can't stop being based.
Tunnel,Was there an outcry or something?
Tunnel,"Bro shes just short, let short people exist in anime"
Tunnel,"At the risk of sounding like some creepy weeb content connoisseur, this is not at all what lolis look like."
Tunnel,I don't know what a Loli is but I just saw her character as a smaller woman with robot gorilla arms who is also delightfully mad
Tunnel,"Fuck all that noise. Until I start hearing complaints about the 17 year old minor, I don’t care what anyone has to say really."
Tunnel,This title is completely meaningless to me.
Tunnel,Bruh she’s just short
Tunnel,"After seeing all these comments I feel inclined to say that all in all loli characters in some instances are ok especially when depicting a full grown adult, where I draw the line is hentai that depicts grooming of loli’s, that is fucked up and don’t say it isn’t, my nail in the coffin is that when I was younger my preference was loli’s now I’m more a petite and over all everything else guy, if me as a child liking loli’s isn’t a sign I don’t know is"
Tunnel,"first off, she's just short. I read her like 17 at youngest.
second, she's not even sexualized. This isn't some harem anime where the main character buys her as a slave and then has some ""will they/wont they"" doe eyed relationship BS. She's just a character like any other."
Tunnel,Murder goblin is one of my favorite archetypes
Tunnel,i was kinda on their side until they said 'loli...'
Tunnel,"She looks from the screencaps that shes meant to fit that Jinx/Harley Quinn ""Manic Pixie Gun Girl"" trope, not a loli."
Tunnel,"The hell? She's like 4'10 and has A or B cups and developed hips. She's not even a loli, she's just a petite woman."
Tunnel,I’m what universe is this chick a fucking loli? She does not come off as a child at all lol
Tunnel,"Regardless of how the character turned out, a sexualized child actually fits a dystopian cyberpunk future quite well. It makes the dystopia more fucked up. I'm sure other cyberpunk media have at least touched upon the topic."
Tunnel,I thought she was short?
Tunnel,Was she a Loli? She had a pretty mature sounding voice actor plus she is an adult the whole series.
Tunnel,"Same guy that made an anime about girls panties turning into weapons is ok with lolis, not a surprise"
Tunnel,"Loli being a constantly evolving term makes it incredibly hard to define properly when a character either is or isn't. It doesn't mean child as much as it means small and cute. It's more petite but naturally you can't brand underage characters other things so they got lumped into the group. Japan doesn't have a term like shortstack either, so you end up with a over-encompassing term that covers literally anything shorter than average height.   


Hell, her size changes according to the scene to force her manic energy. I'd personally call her more of a Lolita since she's more manic gremlin than underage child, but whatever.  


Big day for annoying people, anyway."
Tunnel,"Wait, she was supposed to be a loli? I thought she was just short and the gag was that this shirt woman is a badass psycho."
Tunnel,"Could not care less about any of this, but the show is fucking great. Animation is SOOOOOO good. Knowing now that it was Studio Trigger, it should have been obvious while watching."
Tunnel,"If she looks like a child, she’s a loli"
Tunnel,Non-Weebs and Lolis. The timeless combo for a cesspool of a comment section.
Tunnel,Hot take lolicon is equivalent to our toddler/child/teen beauty pageant shit
Tunnel,"Loli is derived from ""Lolita"" a story about a guy who grooms a kid

Rebecca is a 20-something woman (who's hot as hell)

Can we not conflate the two I'm so tired of this"
Tunnel,Always fun when eastern culture becomes mainstream and suddenly people learn anime is more than Pokemon and Dragonball
Tunnel,Honestly fuck the west and its attempt at making japanese animation as boring as western media.
Tunnel,This show is awesome! Good!
Tunnel,**The Loli Must Stay**
Tunnel," Leave the gun, Take the Loli."
Tunnel,"smh, why is so much of anime pervy af?"
Tunnel,"Not going to take a game ""journalist"" account of what happened as face value with the years of attack on gamers.  This article is clearly bait.  Would not be surprised if this is taken way out of context, especially with a foreign speaker."
Tunnel,People really have forgotten what loli actually means
Tunnel,What the fuck
Tunnel,"Fuck sake because of this thread I now know what a Loli is, I'm getting off reddit today."
Tunnel,You really don't get a say when handing the keys to a Japanese studio to do the animation. West written shows with an anime studio for the animation doesn't happen.
Tunnel,[removed]
Tunnel,"Redditors: “I didn’t see her as a loli character and here’s why”

The studio that literally created her: “she’s a loli character”"
Tunnel,"""The loli must stay! How else would be garner the anime pedophile crowd!? Which is a lot of them!""

Is basically the convo I hear them having."
Tunnel,"People romanticize Japan to no end but no one ever talks about their rampant pedophilia problem. And this ""loli"" shit just proves it's being more normalized over here now due to anime culture. There are tons of popular anime that just straight up sexualize their underage characters very overtly. Bottom line if you use the term ""loli"" you're a fucking weirdo degen"
Tunnel,[removed]
Tunnel,That’s what they deem a Loli!?
Tunnel,digi bro must be ecstatic.
Shine On with Reese,"As for her role on The Morning Show:

""Witherspoon has fulfilled her contractual commitment to The Morning Show, which is now wrapping production on its third season. Witherspoon’s current deal was for three seasons so her future on The Morning Show is unclear but All Stars doesn’t preclude her from exploring further involvement around the Apple TV+"""
Shine On with Reese,"I could see her being written out tbh if they wanted to keep going for The Morning Show.

Happy for Aline Brosh Mckenna though"
Shine On with Reese,Tess Laddo
Shine On with Reese,"That was definitely the interesting takeaway from the article. I wonder if they throw money at her to stay or if they just announce the third season as the final one for The Morning Show as they did with See earlier in the year? 

I guess they could even press on without her. Even without Witherspoon the cast of The Morning Show is absolutely stacked!"
Shine On with Reese,Is this the only question he is asked by reporters?
Shine On with Reese,"Robert Pattinson gave the best summary of this situation…

>	I always say about people who do method acting, you only ever see people do the method when they’re playing a a–holes. You never see someone being lovely to everyone while they’re really deep in character."
Shine On with Reese,"At this point, this ‘method beef’ story is starting to feel like marketing."
Shine On with Reese,"Cox:

>“He’s (Jessie Armstrong) very disciplined in that way, and also he’s very British in that way. The American inclination is to milk it for all it’s worth.”

>“I’ll miss the cast, I’ll miss the atmosphere, I’ll miss the bonhomie. Logan, probably, I’ll miss a bit. But upward and onwards.”


On Jeremy Strong:

>“I’m glad he is not in pain personally, he's a wonderful actor. It’s really a cultural clash. I don’t put up with all that American shit. I’m sorry. All that sort of ‘I think, therefore I feel.’”

>“Just do the job. Don’t identify.”"
Shine On with Reese,"I like to think he does this as his own way of method acting to keep Jeremy/Kendall in character as hating Logan. But he's probably just an old grump, and that's fine too. He's earned it."
Shine On with Reese,"He is aware that the king of method acting, Daniel Day-Lewis, is from London right?"
Shine On with Reese,"Gary Oldman, Christian Bale, Daniel Day Lewis….."
Shine On with Reese,"The majority of big-name actors who I’ve heard of doing this aren’t American, though…"
Shine On with Reese,He sounds cranky like his character anyway so method acting is sort of a moot point.
Shine On with Reese,DDL isnt American
Shine On with Reese,"Brian Cox is a crusty old Scot and I FUCKING ADORE HIM.

""If you were my son, Mac, I wouldve *smothered* you by now!""  Fucking love him in Super Troopers 🤣🤣🤣"
Shine On with Reese,"Maybe my favorite anecdote from the New Yorker piece on Jeremy Strong is that Brian Cox once asked him why he behaved so oddly and insisted on avoiding the other members of the cast and doing all this method acting stuff etc. and Jeremy Strong basically said ""I don't know another way to embody and perform as this character"" and Brian Cox said ""....have you tried...acting?"""
Shine On with Reese,"They could all take a page out of Jason Alexander's book ""Acting Without Acting'."
Shine On with Reese,"Ironically, Brian Cox is currently engaging in method acting by being so vocal about how he hates what Jeremy Strong is doing."
Shine On with Reese,"There’s more than one way to skin a cat. If getting your best performance is method - great! If it’s not - great? 

Do method actors annoy some people on set? Yep. At my job there’s plenty of people who annoy me - as long as they don’t keep me from doing my part though that’s not my problem"
Shine On with Reese,I think Brian Cox is a great actor but I wouldn’t ever want to spend any time with him. Absolutely annoying AF
Shine On with Reese,"I think that most American actors pursuing method acting **today** were probably inspired by the quite English Daniel Day-Lewis.

**Edit:** Added a word."
Shine On with Reese,"“American shit?”, every method actor I know is British"
Shine On with Reese,How does he feel about actors talking shit in the press about their coworkers on a constant basis?
Shine On with Reese,His tendency to try to be shocking is just as tiresome as the media that keeps reporting it.
Shine On with Reese,"This is the guy from super troopers, right ?"
Shine On with Reese,Didn’t a Russian come up with method acting? How’s it American?
Shine On with Reese,"Heh. My brother is an asshole. He got cast as an asshole in the high school musical and tried to call it ""method acting"". heh."
Shine On with Reese,Hmmm. Method acting? Didn't he play a rich guy in the show? Did he have to go on vacation for months to play a rich guy? Or is he already a rich guy? I could get used to that method acting.
Shine On with Reese,Does he think Method Acting is exclusive to American actors?
Shine On with Reese,"How is The Method which was invented by Stanislavsky in Russia an ""American shit""?"
Shine On with Reese,"Lol he put up with it for years to make money, so quite clearly he will put up with it. 

Sadly, the irony of he himself being a method actor asshole is lost on him."
Shine On with Reese,My dumbass thought Brian Cox (physicist) and was very confused
Shine On with Reese,Couldn’t he be considered a method actor himself? He always plays the same asshole.
Shine On with Reese,Sounds like he's method acting a grumpy old man
Shine On with Reese,Isn't the most famous method actor in the world British?
Shine On with Reese,Maybe he was in character when he answered? lol
Shine On with Reese,Isn't Daniel Day Lewis a big method actor?
Shine On with Reese,"Christian Bale is one of the most notorious method actor. And famously, not American"
Shine On with Reese,"He used Daniel Day Lewis as an example of how shit method acting is, despite the fact that the man is English lol."
Shine On with Reese,The method acting stuff gets all the attention but I'm really here for his weed takes
Shine On with Reese,Daniel Day Lewis. English.
Shine On with Reese,"Method acting is Russian in origin.

And it's most famously used by Daniel Day-Lewis, an Englishman.

Dude sounds like an asshole. Seems like he just wants an excuse to bash Americans."
Shine On with Reese,Does Mr. Cox know that Stanislavski was Russian lol
Shine On with Reese,OMG! This notion that acting is hard.
Shine On with Reese,"Great pitchers are different. Some throw 100 mph fastballs, some throw 85 mph curveballs. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLSNgZNE-Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLSNgZNE-Q)

Daniel Day-Lewis method acts and is the only actor I know that was heralded for his 1800's accent that is no longer spoken.

Brian Cox is an actor who can close his eyes and be in character. 

Doesn't mean one process makes a better actor."
Shine On with Reese,I’m sorry but I’m calling bullshit on Cox. He tolerated American Jeremy Strong method acting for 4 seasons of succession. So he apparently does put up with that “American shit”.
Shine On with Reese,"This one time I directed a simple short film about a scientist who traveled back in time to save his wife, we all knew that the shirt film was cheesy but that’s why we made it. We found this one random actor through Facebook who was an interesting guy… he was also a “method actor”, so this whole time he wanted to keep the props (our take time machine) during shooting (even when the cameras were turned off) so he could remain in character. He also wanted to ask the cast to refer to him to the characters name all time and he almost hurt the other actress bc he was too much in his character. The funniest part was that during a crying scene he asked someone from production to go to the grocery store to buy onions cause he couldn’t feel the emotions. Crazy experience"
Shine On with Reese,Honestly sounds like something Logan would say - maybe Cox is next-level method acting so deep he doesn’t even know it?
Shine On with Reese,He sounds like he’s method acting as Rupert Murdoch
Shine On with Reese,What if he's the *ultimate* method actor and this is all so he can continue to hate Jeremy Strong's character?
Shine On with Reese,you mean to tell me Captain John O'Hagen was not method acting? my world has been shattered.
Shine On with Reese,"Ok but the most famous method actor was British, Brian (DDL)"
Shine On with Reese,And yet I'm still seeing him in dumb ass commercials...what's wrong Brian do you somehow not have ENOUGH money???
Shine On with Reese,All I'll say is him and Jeremy strong have dynamite chemistry together so whatever drama they are trying to drum up is clearly working. Keep it up!
Shine On with Reese,"> ""Acting is about the exploration of character rather than simply a projection of self. I was in New York with Maggie Smith recently, promoting a film, and we were asked about the Sanford Meisner Method school of acting which is based on ruthless self-exploration. Maggie, in her unique way, said, 'Oh, we have that in England, too. We call it wanking.'""

Shine On with Reese,I’ll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet!
Shine On with Reese,My take is that Jeremy Strong accomplished exactly what he wanted with his method acting.
Shine On with Reese,Winning friends on both sides of the pond is old Brian Cox.
Shine On with Reese,I feel like one of the most famous method actors of all time is Daniel day Lewis and he is from the uk
Shine On with Reese,What a cranky old wanker!
Shine On with Reese,Isn’t method acting French?
Shine On with Reese,"Like Robert Pattinson once said: actors who go method always do it when they’re playing crazy assholes. No one ever says, I’m being super nice because I’m method acting a kind person lmao."
Shine On with Reese,but acting like you are your character is the whole point
Shine On with Reese,"I never gotethod acting, the whole point in being an actor is being able to pretend, method acting is literally anti acting"
Shine On with Reese,"As usual have to post this clip from Sharpe:)

https://youtu.be/wUeTOLEwyZ8"
Shine On with Reese,I wonder if he’s ever been to the method one acting clinic with Tobias.
Shine On with Reese,This dude sounds like an asshole
Shine On with Reese,TIL Daniel Day-Lewis is American.
Shine On with Reese,"First off, it's *Russian.*

Strasberg, Adler and Meisner might have made it popular in the States, but it was Stanislavski who created it.

But second, ***yeah, Mr. Cox, we can tell don't use it because you play the same character in every fucking thing you do.*** 

Meanwhile, Gary Oldman along with DDL are considered the best actors of your generation, so I guess that ""American shit"" has worked very well for them."
Shine On with Reese,"Basically the guy who plays a jerk, is a jerk.  How is this not surprising?"
Shine On with Reese,I wonder if Jeremy Strong is an asshole to others on set or if he just does something weird that Brian Cox doesn’t like? I’m sure there’s details in an interview somewhere but the rest of the cast all seem to get along fine with Jeremy so I think Brian just lets it bother him way too much.
Shine On with Reese,"Isn't the most famous method actor English? I'm talking about Mr. Learned to butcher meat, Czech speaking, touches his eye with a knife, dress maker, Daniel Day Lewis?"
Shine On with Reese,American shit? Bro one of the best method actors of all time is a Brit. Daniel Day Lewis.
Shine On with Reese,Ironic he hates method acting but did the interview as Logan Roy.
Shine On with Reese,Says the guy taking money from McDonald's to sell Chicken sandwiches.
Shine On with Reese,Isn't the most famous method actor in the world British (Daniel Day Lewis)?
Shine On with Reese,"Man who has literally only ever acted like himself thinks actors who actually try to act like someone else are fools!

/eyeroll"
Shine On with Reese,"Cox: get over yourself. ""Wah, someone does their job different than me. WAH! I don't WAH put up with this Waaaaaaaahhh!"
Shine On with Reese,"One of his co-stars (I think it was Kelvin Harrison Jr.) said about Peter Dinklage, that he can be joking around but the instant they call action he is immediately in character.  *That* to me is real acting."
Shine On with Reese,"""That American Shit""?

Remind me where Daniel Day-Lewis was born?

Myopic old coot."
Shine On with Reese,"Except, the most famous user of method acting ... isn't American."
Shine On with Reese,"Always felt Cox was the same character in everything I’ve seen him in, so his word doesn’t mean that much."
Shine On with Reese,Brian Cox is your average European Redditor
Shine On with Reese,Old wind bag talks too much.
Shine On with Reese,"Honestly, it sounds like Jeremy Strong had been getting on Brian Cox's (and others) nerves while filming.  I'd read the plan was originally 5 seasons (and is what HBO hoped for), but I'm guessing season 4 was a tough shoot and the creator just thought it was best to end it.  My worry is that this being the final season was announced months after season 4 filming ended, so I hope we get a proper ending."
Shine On with Reese,Badabababa he's not loving it.
Shine On with Reese,Does he know Daniel Day Lewis is English? DDLis the king of method actors.
Shine On with Reese,I love him
Shine On with Reese,Don't have to method when you are the character.
Shine On with Reese,"Jeremy Strong: ""Shenanigans""

Brian Cox: *whips pistol*"
Shine On with Reese,Isn’t DDL a method actor? He’s a lrettt strong actor so it works for him
Shine On with Reese,"I’m haven’t watched the show, so I only know him from other roles, but does Brian Cox have any range other than being Brian Cox? I feel like he’s great in all the roles I’ve seen him in, but he only plays like one type of character, and it seems to match his personality in these interviews."
Shine On with Reese,Brian Cox is awesome. Just no shits given. Look forward to whatever he is in next.
Shine On with Reese,Buda bah bah bah - Brian Cox on my McDonald's Ad
Shine On with Reese,Oh fuck offf!
Shine On with Reese,Err...the veritable king of method acting is from the UK. Why the dog on Americans? Fuck off!
Shine On with Reese,"Isn't Daniel Day Lewis, a very famous non-American, one of the most notorious method actors out there?

Edit: made comment before I read, he referred to DDL in the article, LOL"
Shine On with Reese,"He just comes off as an asshole, wants to bag on the American shit but you can rest assured he never turned down that American paycheck."
Shine On with Reese,I don't know what Succession is but this headline has made me not want to watch it.
Shine On with Reese,"Honestly these comments from him make me think he’s actually method acting, it just seems too close to a real Logan/Kendall interaction."

"Wait, My Youth",Yeah I agree but at least it’s on HBO Max
"Wait, My Youth",That's pretty much just Richard Horvitz's real voice
"Wait, My Youth","I love Dracula. He's not just Black, he's *Black*. 

""Everybody know Dracula turn into a bat! That's what Dracula do!"""
"Wait, My Youth","Actually, there were lots of great episodes, thinking about it. Underrated great show."
"Wait, My Youth","> And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized.

While not untrue, Billy and Mandy really stands alone in this era and all Childrens TV animation. Only comparable stuff was on Adult Swim."
"Wait, My Youth",The single bumper clip of Mandy quoting the tenets of satanism would have unleashed a firestorm of bad press if released today.
"Wait, My Youth","Nope, it doesn't matter. Dozens of episodes end with characters being killed, including Billy & Mandy (mostly Billy). Apocalyptic world-ending events happen constantly and everything is always reset. There is a VAGUE sense of minor continuity with characters like Jeff the Spider and Nergal/Nergal Junior, but it's so inconsequential that it doesn't really matter. You're good to just watch it on HBO Max."
"Wait, My Youth",Yes… for now.
"Wait, My Youth","""Well, maybe if you hadn't made your babies so delicious, Dracula wouldn't have had to eat 'em!""

Kind of horrifying, and hilarious."
"Wait, My Youth","Dan Vs, Robotomy (cancelled after 1 season), Invader Zim, The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, just a handful of shows that were also for kids and just as dark"
"Wait, My Youth","Well, for the most part that is true. But HBO 111 is really the pilot, so should be watched first. The introduction of Eris, Toadblatt, and Delgado should also be watched first and I'm not sure if HBO has those in the correct order.

However, starting HBO season 3 the episodes are correct order if not correct ""season"" (and most of ""season 2"" was correct order as well)."
"Wait, My Youth",Which is why I am recording it to DVD-R...HBO can get rid of it in a snap.
"Wait, My Youth","Season 4 is better or, at the very least, more impressive as a storytelling accomplishment. 

I've never seen a scifi show tie up all the time travel paradoxes before. Most of them don't even try. 12 Monkeys pulled on one loose plot thread that was obvious in retrospect and suddenly everything laid out perfectly for the final stretch. 

It's completely justified that the last three episodes are the highest rated of the series. It's just a fantastic final season. Jennifer also gives one of my favorite quotes of all time about what you're not supposed to do with a time machine."
"Wait, My Youth",The time travel shit is amazing the way they link it all back in
"Wait, My Youth","The whole show is a masterpiece. You probably cant see this until you watched the entire series.

Think of Breaking Bad. No one would have ever imagined that it would go down as one of the greatest dramas of all time based on its first season. BB's first season was not as intense as latter seasons but it certainly wasn't bad in retrospect."
"Wait, My Youth",Massively underrated show. It was a hidden gem during peak prestige TV.
"Wait, My Youth",Made with a lot of care and love. You just can see veryone is havingf fun making this show.
"Wait, My Youth",Season 3 was bloody amazing! And season 4 is even better! Enjoy it!
"Wait, My Youth","12 Monkeys was fantastic, a really underrated show. All the cast is excellent and gets better season by season."
"Wait, My Youth","I've been tempted to check this out, the showrunner is Terry Matalas who I didn't know about until last season of Picard.  

Picard season 2 was all right, better than season 1.  Picard season 3... holy shit."
"Wait, My Youth",Oh shit I gave it up as I couldnt give time to keep up and heard it finished strong. Maybe I should pick it back up.
"Wait, My Youth","This show was so good. The first season is an amazing retelling of the movie and continuation beyond its original scope, and you can tell starting in season 2 they mapped out the time travel all the way to the end. The pay offs are so worth it, and it's chronology is pretty close to perfect."
"Wait, My Youth",What streaming service is this on?
"Wait, My Youth","12 Monkeys was really great, modern shows can only hope to run for 4 seasons and be as consistently well made"
"Wait, My Youth","If the show was a netflix original in 2015 it would have been a global hit. Its a shame it was stuck on syfy but to be fair syfy was firing on all cylinders with their last real effort when they had 12 Monkeys, The Expanse, and The Magicians all airing at the same time. (Happy! also sorta overlapped)"
"Wait, My Youth","> episode 8 ""Lullaby""

I liked how they tweaked the mechanics of time travel in that episode. The reveal is a scene I rewatch a lot."
"Wait, My Youth","12 Monkeys as a whole is a masterpiece, I'm glad that it seems to be getting picked up on the radar a bit more recently. I think it may be fast approaching time for another rewatch."
"Wait, My Youth","have you watched dark? you'll like it just much if not more, it's my favorite time travel media."
"Wait, My Youth","Before 'Dark' I used to think that this series use of time traveling was the best I've ever seen on film/television, I really do need to watch it again."
"Wait, My Youth","I started this show after seeing a post about how great the show is. I finally finished season 1 and I was amazed at how many times I would roll my eyes or just think wow that was dumb. Episode 11 could be the worst episode television I've ever seen. None of the decisions make any sense and the plot points seem to happen simply because the writers thought it would be cool. There are many examples in season 1 but this episode was so over the top with nonsense. 

Ramse and Cole go back in time to Tokyo. Ramse has now decided to make sure the entire world dies so his son will be born. Insane. At no point has his character been this selfish But people do crazy things for their kids okay fine. 

Cole and Ramse have a fight in some night club and smash thick pint glasses against eachother heads and just keep fighting without being phased. Once the corrupt Japanese buisness men stop the fight, Leland decides to give them a knife so they can continue until death. Okay that's weird why not call the cops on these two lunatics. Because in his eyes they are just crazy dudes saying they are from the future. Once the impromptu death fight is over they decide to just ignore Ramsey because he won? And kill Cole (ofcourse he doesn't die. Because literally every episode a main character is about to die and then doesnt. Every single episode). They let the knife fight decide which one of these 2 they should murder??

Ramse is then put in prison for 5 years! For having blood on his hands. What?!? No body no murder. Just unexplained blood. 5 years. During prison he is beaten EVERY DAY by some inmate until he decides to tell everyone that the inmate is a snitch. How he came this info, no clue. Why everyone just believes him, no clue. And then he is just let go after 5 years also for no reason. Who the fuck wrote this episode? I swear they just said this could be a cool scene and then just wrote a plot to film it."
"Wait, My Youth","Is it on a streaming service?

I watched Season One back in the day but then got busy."
"Wait, My Youth",Season 3 and Season 4 is S-tier television and no one can convince me otherwise!
"Wait, My Youth",i quit after watching the first episode. how does it got 4 seasons?
"Wait, My Youth","i haven't seen 12 monkeys, no idea where it's streaming where i am. but this reminds me a lot of black sails. season 1 was meh, season 2 started getting better and man... s3 is where it hit its mark in all departments story telling, characters, everything. s4 ended things perfectly. if 12 monkeys is anything like that i'll have to check it out"
"Wait, My Youth","And you say this without finishing the series.. Oh, boy, it just gets better!"
"Wait, My Youth",Agreed. I watched it two years ago because someone on Reddit said it has one of the most satisfying finales of any show ever and ties up every possible loose thread. Didn't quite believe that going in but man...it totally does.
"Wait, My Youth","> I've never seen a scifi show tie up all the time travel paradoxes before. Most of them don't even try. 

May I introduce you to Dark? A German time travel show on Netflix that is also great at that"
"Wait, My Youth",Can you elaborate on the one loose plot thread they pulled on? I love this show
"Wait, My Youth",The pilot of Breaking Bad is a masterpiece in TV writing. Go download the script. So much happens and it sets up the entire series perfectly.
"Wait, My Youth","This show is absolutely amazing. Some ones that stand out really well are:

>!The one where they go to Nazi Germany!<

>!The one where Gaius Baltar man went through his history when he was trying to escape his destiny!<"
"Wait, My Youth",So underrated. It's such a good show
"Wait, My Youth",S2 was worse than S1 imo but Matalas only did the first few episodes because they did pre-production of S3 at the same time as S2 production in order to film back to back….which was the best part of S2
"Wait, My Youth",Best part is Todd Stashwick and now Kirk Acevedo showing up too.
"Wait, My Youth",Anyone who doesn’t say Picard season 1 or 2 were anything short of dumpster fires automatically makes me negate any opinion of theirs lmao
"Wait, My Youth",Hulu
"Wait, My Youth",Hulu
"Wait, My Youth","It gets much, much, much, much better! It becomes insanely good!"
"Wait, My Youth","I'm a big booster of 12M. But believe it or not, I too also quit after the first episode. But then I went back to it a few months later.

It is one of my favorite shows of all time. On my list with Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, Dark, The Leftovers, Bojack Horseman. I am not kidding either.

But, of course, people's preferences are subjective. I could not get into The Wire."
"Wait, My Youth","I frequently lump Black Sails, 12 Monkeys, and The Leftovers together as my favourite shows of recent times. Every single one of them is great and worth diving into.

A slow start is usually a sign of great things to come for shows like these; you've just got to have the patience to enjoy and absorb it - buckle in for the ride."
"Wait, My Youth","Yeah that was my first thought as well.

I can't imagine a time travel show as well thought our as Dark tbh it felt perfect"
"Wait, My Youth","I'll be a little vague and spoiler tag since we're in a thread with someone who's excited for the final season. 

>!*Until one day the serpent came upon a demon*!<

>!The identity of the demon is the loose plot thread I'm referring to. Once that's revealed, it starts a chain reactions of answers. It brings you directly to Cole's mother and why she was being chased by the 12 Monkeys, why Cole could time travel, and why he was so important... but more importantly it helps explain why none of the solutions were able to fix time like they expected. We're witnessing a stable timeline (the snake eating its own tail), but the demon's continued existence (and the solutions that depended on the demon's existence) means that we can't move back to the ""original"" timeline because the snake is still being poked in the eye.!<

>!It also answers old questions about causality, like the Witness needing Cole and Cassie to exist, Cole and Cassie only interacting due to the virus, and the virus only existing due to the Witness. Those are causality loops inside of the larger causality loop, which normally can't be broken without breaking the entire timeline, except the causality loops themselves were the result of a broken timeline. !< 

It was really well written and carefully planned."
"Wait, My Youth","I agree but many have said the first season of Breaking Bad was ""slow"" and even ""boring."""
"Wait, My Youth",People only rave about it. It's not underrated.
"Wait, My Youth","yeah I get the impression that Matalas' involvement on S2 was the 25th century stuff before they ship off to the past so everything could make sense for S3. Akiva Goldsman is the one who showran most of that season. S3 seems to be Matalas' baby and it's soooo much better, it's really pulling off the balance of fan service and story/character work. 

I'm so curious about what happened with this show and who's at fault for why it went off the rails the first two seasons. It's easy to blame Kurtzman and Goldsman and they probably deserve a lot of the blame but Sir Patrick is also notorious for basically turning the TNG films into action movies as well. S1 was pretty good and an interesting take on post-Nemesis Trek until the finale. S2 was stupid and boring mostly throughout. And S3 could still fall apart but so far it's been fantastic, and I want to give most of the credit to Matalas, especially knowing what he did with 12 Monkeys.

It's also making me want a USS Titan Spinoff."
"Wait, My Youth",Aaron Stafford too! He was the Ferengi.
"Wait, My Youth","I think S1 had some interesting albeit half-baked ideas about where to take the franchise post-Nemesis. Romulan diaspora, ""harvesting"" a Borg cube and the ethical conundrums around former drones, the stuff they did before the finale with AI/androids, the Federation/Starfleet being vulnerable post-dominion war, the idea of a man who dedicated his life to duty having to retire and leave behind the only things he ever loved, the regret in Picard's later years. There was a good base there but they kinda just threw it all away to do another ""AI bad universe in peril"" story.

S2 is just trash.

So yeah, I think dumpster fire is probably a good way to describe it lol. But not completely irredeemable. And clearly S3 so far has proven that it was salvageable. I just hope it doesn't fall off the rails again and make me eat crow because I actually have hope where they can go after this show is over."
"Wait, My Youth",Thanks!
"Wait, My Youth",i was one of those. it took me 3 or 4 attempts to finish the first season
"Wait, My Youth","You're totally right. Issue is that it's unknown, haha"
"Wait, My Youth","The book this is adapted from was excellent, I've been excited for this show since they announced it. Hopeful they stay true at least to the spirit of the book, since wanting an exact story adaptation is probably a bit too much. Anyway, i cant wait to watch it."
"Wait, My Youth",I gave the book my best effort. I just couldn't get into it.
"Wait, My Youth","This trailer seems almost breezy in tone compared to some of the dark & extreme places the book goes (though there definitely are hints). I expected something much heavier, but I wonder if that's just a misdirect to bring people in."
"Wait, My Youth","Empowering people is good. Giving 100,000 of teenage girls superpowers that could be lethal and destructive seems...less good."
"Wait, My Youth","I'm really hoping the trailer was just focus-grouped to death, and that's why it had this unserious, lightweight tone and framing. The novel is really far from that stylistically; it's award-winning fiction, not a teenage cash grab. Barack Obama put it on his book list. It's got more in common with *The Handmaid's Tale* than *The Hunger Games*. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_%28Alderman_novel%29):

>The Power is a book within a book: a manuscript of an imagined history of the tumultuous era during which women across the world developed and shared the power to emit electricity from their hands. The manuscript is submitted by Neil Adam Armon to another author named Naomi, approximately five thousand years after the power emerges and revolution reassembles the world into a matriarchy. This historical fiction chronicles the experiences of Allie, Roxy, Margot, Jocelyn, and Tunde, as they navigate their rapidly changing world.

Most of those characters aren't YA, either."
"Wait, My Youth",I can't see this being more than a one season thing. Toni Collette is always great but these types of shows don't seem to do well on Amazon and this one was a mess bts.
"Wait, My Youth",Looks great! I can't wait
"Wait, My Youth",I’ll be honest I dont think I can sit through a movie where all of the main characters are teenage girls. I just know how annoying the dialogue is going to be.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Yes, it is a sitcom."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"I doubt Ray would murder Debora, throw her body down a mineshaft, and later blow up himself with the children.  That’s more of a Robert thing."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Sir, this is a Wendy's"
A Little Thing Called First Love,"If you're so up in arms about Everybody Loves Raymond, you might actually have a heart attack if you watched All in the Family.

A Little Thing Called First Love,🫣
A Little Thing Called First Love,its a show. Go touch grass
A Little Thing Called First Love,Are people in this sub supposed to know who Josh Powell is?
A Little Thing Called First Love,"I never thought Everyone Loves Raymond was funny. On a related note, the actor who plays Raymond (for the life of me I cannot remember his full name) did a comedy show during Gator Growl in the late 90s at U of Florida and completely bombed. It was just not funny. He wasn’t trying to be edgy or say anything controversial for laughs where students got offended which is often the complaint of comedians who stop playing colleges - dude just was not funny."
A Little Thing Called First Love,To be fair. It was a fairly shit sitcom. Bring back Malcolm in the middle?
A Little Thing Called First Love,You must have missed the series finale then
A Little Thing Called First Love,And Married With Children
A Little Thing Called First Love,Josh Powell is a real life guy who probably killed his wife. The OP is trying to say that because Ray has an unpleasant personality and is not a great husband that he is basically the same as murderer.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Yikes. This is a bona fode ""Sir, this is a Wendy's"" moment."
A Little Thing Called First Love,C'mon son
A Little Thing Called First Love,Performer of the week? You must be outta your damn mind!
A Little Thing Called First Love," Ha! I love that an actor gets accolades for a currently running show and we all just run with jokes from a show that ended 9 years ago. Psych is still my favorite show.  


... Tsk... c'mon son."
A Little Thing Called First Love,I’ve heard it both ways
A Little Thing Called First Love,Oh cool I didn’t realize he was using his real name now! I love it
A Little Thing Called First Love,I'm Shawn Spencer and this is my partner Lavender Gooms
A Little Thing Called First Love,You know that's right
A Little Thing Called First Love,I beg your pardon? My name is Black. His name is Tan. I can’t believe you just made that assumption. You should be ashamed of yourself and your family.
A Little Thing Called First Love,Always enjoy his work

A Little Thing Called First Love,🍍🍍🍍
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Although most people probably will never remember him for any character other than Shawn Spencer, I'm really proud that James is getting praise for his drama skills. This isn't a super famous show and it's airing at the same time as big productions, so it's really cool that he's being recognized for it."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"[I’m Shawn and this is my associate MC Clap Yo Handz](https://youtu.be/CefU27YmuAE)

[Gus’s many aliases](https://youtu.be/KLicgtao6f8) were a great running gag that built over time."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Honestly surprised this show is still on. The first season was pretty good, but I haven't seen it since."

A Little Thing Called First Love,Have you heard about Pluto?….that’s messed up
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Huh, I'm generally pretty aware of TV but I've never heard of this show despite it having five seasons and featuring a number of people I've heard of.  Is it any good?  I'm getting ""This Is Us"" melodrama vibes from the description."
A Little Thing Called First Love,Say it again. Use a Jamaican accent.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"If I wanted to watch depressing porn, I’d just set up a camera in my bedroom.

I bailed on that show after the first year.

But when is Psych 4 coming out?"
A Little Thing Called First Love,"*dramatically points finger* ""I'm proud of you!"""
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Gus, don’t be this crevice in my arm. We’re going to be fine!"
A Little Thing Called First Love,Great actor!! The show Psych was brilliant. This man truly has talent.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"In his heyday, he could've easily played a live action Nathan Drake. You know that's right."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"I remember seeing him and  Michael Weston off-broadway in 2010 during his Psych run of a performance of  Gabe McKinley's Extinction. He got very dark in the play, and did some heavy things that made me literally watch Psych differently. Like, I didn't see Shawn, the loveable goofball but a alcoholic asshole who was doing bad things.  Great show but I've been waiting for his big break and I'm glad he's finally getting it. I still can't watch Psych though lol"
A Little Thing Called First Love,I love James Roday Rodriguez and I’m not afraid to say it!
A Little Thing Called First Love,Good for James getting some recognition after a down week for The Last of Us. Good luck to anyone who isn’t Henry and Sam from TLOU getting this recognition next week.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"This episode had me BAWLING. I'll miss this show a lot when it's over, and will rewatch for sure."
A Little Thing Called First Love,I am loving all the Psych comments.
A Little Thing Called First Love,TIL “A Million Little Things” is still airing.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Judging by the comments, I really need to finish “Psyche.”"
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Him and Martin Sheen, I never knew where of Hispanic descent. I knew Emelio took his mother’s maiden name, Estevez, but based on his roll as a white bread sports jock in the Breakfast Club you never would have guessed."
A Little Thing Called First Love,Imagine you've been working as an actor for decades and finally get praise for your dramatic acting skills and all the internet can do is reference something from a comedy show that ended nearly a decade ago.
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Is this show actually any good? The ads always looked a bit cringe so I’ve never watched it, but happy to have my mind changed"
A Little Thing Called First Love,His Psych character always reminded me of Ace Ventura.

A Little Thing Called First Love,"Funny thing is, I had no idea about Psych until I saw the poster on a streaming service and recognized James from AMLT and decided to watch because of him. So maybe I've watched it both ways?"

A Little Thing Called First Love,"Yes we all know that, but Gus isn't ON the show that this actor is getting praise for."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"This is the last season, so not for much longer. I dropped off last season. It’s a perpetual depressing show that tries to one up each terrible things that happens with an emotional epiphany."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Same. I haven't watched since the pizza night episode.

Lady was essentially like ""I know my husband killed himself because I cheated on him with your husband, but it's pizza night so we have to be friends"""
A Little Thing Called First Love,I only knew it as the same kind over emotional sad fest as This Is Us but also one time I tuned in accidentally and they were covering up a kidnapping and murder??
A Little Thing Called First Love,Lisa from Temecula was one of the funniest sketches in a long time. She finally did a balls to the wall character and it was perfect.

A Little Thing Called First Love,Guy Buttersnaps
A Little Thing Called First Love,"You're getting those vibes because it was made by ABC as counter-programming to NBC's *This is Us*, after the success of its first season."
A Little Thing Called First Love,The first two seasons are really good. A little mystery hidden behind the drama. But it nosedives with bad writing after that.
A Little Thing Called First Love,It feels like Brothers & Sisters and a little bit of This is Us
A Little Thing Called First Love,IMO it's a great show. I like it better than This Is Us to be honest (maybe because of the cast).
A Little Thing Called First Love,"In Psych 2, Henry is watching This Is Us, and Shawn says, “They have the same show on ABC, but newer!”

Cracked me up."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"It's knockoff This Is Us, but instead of cathartic tears, it just wants to make everyone depressed"
A Little Thing Called First Love,"I knew of this show but didn't realize it was still on. 

Tv is too busy telling me about this fucking dumb bitch hiding shrimp tails in a jar as a way to convince me to switch to State Farm to actually tell me about other tv shows that are airing."
A Little Thing Called First Love,"Michael Weston was in ""two"" episodes of Psych. Cloudy with a Chance of Murder. Then they remade the ep in Cloudy with a Chance of Remake. He was great in both!"
A Little Thing Called First Love,TIL there are Criminal Minds spinoffs; and a Hallmark show with time travel
A Little Thing Called First Love,do it
A Little Thing Called First Love,Estevez isn’t Emilio’s mothers maiden name. It’s Martins real name. He was born Ramon Estevez and took the name “Martin sheen” as a stage name. Same with Charlie sheen (born Carlos estevez). Emilio just opted to keep his real name instead of adopt his fathers stage surname.
A Little Thing Called First Love,That’s just how beloved that show was. It’s a cultural phenomenon
A Little Thing Called First Love,I've heard it both ways.

Prank Encounters,[deleted]
Prank Encounters,I just hated that it was a poor imitation of Scare Tactics. Way too much build up and not enough pay off. And the host is annoying.
Prank Encounters,"I can not speak for this particular show, but if the producers or actors are being cruel to people for ratings and money, they need to be dealt with swiftly.  I used to be ok with Jack Ass when they did the stupid stunts to themselves.  When they were doing it to others, not so much.

There was one episode the guy put a doll into a baby carriage and placed it on the roof of his vehicle.  Then he would proceed to get in and begin to drive off with the supposed baby still on top of the car.  People would run over to try to get him to stop.  What if another vehicle came in the process and in the confusion and someone got hurt?  Not cool."
Prank Encounters,I thought people were mad since it seemed fake af.
Prank Encounters,[deleted]
Prank Encounters,"It's such a stupid concern I think. People just seem to want to hate.

The jobs are temp jobs so it's not like anyone got tricked in to thinking they got a job and were pranked instead. It's jobs for that night and they get paid. Probably more than they would otherwise. So there is no issue."
Prank Encounters,"I am poor and I wouldn't bother calling my mom, a job is a job is a job, they're easy to come by if you try hard enough and act appropriately. I would just say thanks for the money and start looking for another, better than getting laid off, fired or having to leave because of relocation, etc. Gotta enjoy what you can while you can, money doesn't make a person rich. Then again that's just me and the life of trades, not everyone likes leaving leaving their comfort zone."
Prank Encounters,"The jobs are temp jobs so it's not like anyone got tricked in to thinking they got a job and were pranked instead. It's jobs for that night and they get paid. Probably more than they would otherwise. So there is no issue.

For the record, I have not been able to get a real job for at least 2 years now."
Prank Encounters,"Some didn't go as well as I thought but most of found both build up and the scare hilarious. Yeah the host is annoying but Tracey Morgan ain't exactly the opposite, I think they fit their role pretty well though"
Prank Encounters,"Yes I agree but jackass seems to be a lot less supervised and controlled. In this they're essentially just placing these people on stage for a live drama where they're unaware and have to watch the scary thing in front of them, I'd only be concerned if it was someone with heart problems but it's usually younger people they prank, the most out of control it got was a 19 year old ran out of a house because he didn't like spiders."
Prank Encounters,"Naw it's legit, I was skeptical at first so did some digging. Seems they think it's cruel to pay someone for being hired on a fake job. As someone who's worked real jobs and never got paid I think it's funny."
Prank Encounters,"There was no hint of cruelty with Candid Camera, at least not the original version hosted by Allen Funt."
Prank Encounters,"Never heard of candid camera, I only seen scare tactics and just for laughs gags that compare and I really don't mind if more people started making these, I mean look how many over the top cop dramas there are and I much prefer these, just my opinion tho"
Prank Encounters,"That's good for you, but you are not the person this happened to. I can't speak for that person, but you can't assume what a person's situation is. I've been in some not so great situations in my life and if I was absolutely struggling and finally got a job only to be told I was pranked for the benefit of a reality show, I would be devastated. The money they give me wouldn't matter because that hurt would exist for everyone to watch whenever they want. And telling someone ""try harder"" when it comes to job searching is entirely the wrong thing to ever say to someone and I would recommend never actually saying that to someone because it tells them you have no empathy for their situation."
Prank Encounters,"I do not know the OP's comment you are directly replying, to as it has been deleted.  But no, Candid Camera was not made out to be horrible to anyone at anytime.  That was just pure good fun.  The stuff people do now, some deserve to be disciplined."
Prank Encounters,"No, it's sympathy and understanding how to get through it, not trying at all will do no one any good. Trying harder than you did last has at least a chance for results, however nothing's guaranteed in life. Whether I'm empathetic or not I couldn't care less, I'd rather see you get out of your tough situation and not trying or doing the bare minimum simply won't cut it. I'm not assuming to know anyone's situation but judging by the people's reactions on the show, they seemed to enjoy themselves and liked the escape from everyday life regardless of their situation. Not everyone has to be empathetic and I wouldn't expect everyone to be, in my experience that'll lead to a lot of disappointment"
Prank Encounters,"I started a thread about it on the Netflix subreddit. The reactions range from ""gay men are safer because they won't defend themselves physically"" to ""gay men's reactions are funnier.""

Yikes."
Prank Encounters,"So you know, Yanks don't understand that definition of 'camp'."
Prank Encounters,Absolutely! I've been watching this tonight and all I can think is why is every single male victim gay? As you said it's way too consistent to be a coincidence.
Prank Encounters,Is it because the straight ones didnt wana look like scared beetchez? Lol
Prank Encounters,"It's not about the dudes being gay. Most of the gay dudes in my circle don't put up with shit and would fuck your shit up. They would also have not been cast for this show.

They probably  intentionally cast men that were more passive and docile and less likely to be physically confrontational. 

This is a good idea, considering the average guy would not have reacted as passively as these guys had. This casting choice was for the safety of the actors and crew and everyone involved."
Prank Encounters,[deleted]
Prank Encounters,"I also noticed this too and was wondering if it was because they’d be less likely to get physical when they feel threatened. I can see how if a man tried to physically take someone down when they felt their life was in danger, it would be a huge liability."
Prank Encounters,Almost makes you wish one of the Kray twins were still around.
Prank Encounters,Yes they do
Prank Encounters,"Idk we describe plenty of shows as ""campy"""
Prank Encounters,"Could be because they want to be super-inclusive

Or someone really hates gay people."
Prank Encounters,And one token black person
Prank Encounters,Its...pretty obvious.
Prank Encounters,"Well my gay boyfriend and I aren't from Georgia so the social cues may be a little different. 

But we're saying ""hey do all the guy prankees seem gay to you?"" by episode 6. On episode 7 we're saying, ""hey yeah, this guy too"". And episode 7 guy starts talking about his male partner. So we haven't exactly done science, but we did a hypothesis and it was tested and hasn't been disproved yet."
Prank Encounters,"I've edited the question from ""are"" to ""seem"", since I can't know what people identify as, but I can describe how they appear to me. 

My current theory is Netflix ran some other prank show, got some metrics that indicates lots of cross over with lgbt content, college age content etc, and decided to make their own prank show that they targeted at the same niche.

An alternative is we have a bunch of people who have been specifically selected because they're less likely to derail the prank by calling the police, and what I'm perceiving as a Kinsey scale variation is just a general submissiveness.
Since deception is built into the show, it would be very awkward if it is relying on personality metrics taken under the guise of a job agency to find exploitable people.

The prankees mention on the show that they are paid $20/hour and they found the ""job"" through an agency."
Prank Encounters,"But he was talking about men being camp, ie. obviously gay in terms of mannerisms and such."
Prank Encounters,You are completely correct in them picking gay marks the entire time.
Prank Encounters,"They picked all women and gay dudes because they are less likely to actually fight back lol. The women all really take control in most of the situation. All and all I like the show, they can go a little further. Side note, this shit is basically Scare Pewdiepie since I noticed a lot of the same actors are in it."
Prank Encounters,How did camp come to mean that?
Prank Encounters,I don't know. Probably because of (perceived) similarities in acting hammy and over the top.
Prank Encounters,Now when you say hammy ....
Prank Encounters,"Hamming it up, the way an actor will in a camp movie."
Prank Encounters,"All those actors that dont make it, they go there."
Prank Encounters,They don't it's all fake
Prank Encounters,Even the “targets” are actors. Do they not wonder why the interior of the car they’re in is all lit up? There’s also a few instances where you can see the “regular people” mic’d up.
Prank Encounters,Look at their marks every episode - gullible girl + dramatic gay guy = ??
Prank Encounters,They should just bring back Prank Patrol tbh
Prank Encounters,"Prank shows have been around ages and pretty much all follow the same pattern. You film tons and tons of footage, and then maybe some of it they sign a release on, and some of it is actually usable after you ""creatively"" edit it. They often film for a long time before they get one or two that work.

And yes, sometimes its not entirely real as well."
Prank Encounters,They prank a lot of people and they only show you the ones that dont obviously figure it out.
Prank Encounters,"Some of it seems sincere but a lot of it's obviously staged. I think they are probably told something that doesn't line up, which makes them somewhat surprised but not actually surprised/scared/etc"
Prank Encounters,"You're overestimating people's intelligence.  Look at the Holocaust.  You have people malleable enough to follow orders and willingly aid in genocide, plus today you have people gullible enough to believe it never happened.

So you can definitely find marks who are highly susceptible to persuasion and who aren't smart enough to think logically under stress.

Plus the effects seem pretty convincing.  The actors do seem fake at times, but I'm pretty sure those are the scenes shot separately and they gave more realistic performances during the actual prank."
Prank Encounters,Yeah so why are they making this shit
Prank Encounters,I'd honestly love a show of the people figuring it out.. That would be more entertaining
Prank Encounters,"This is a completely different generation and  wildy not the same situation as being rounded up by fear of death. 

This is a generation who sees prank shows 100 times over on the internet and on tv.... it’s not hard to see when something fake is about to/is happening. 

If you saw a clown walking around in a parking garage today, what would you think? Cartoonishly scream and run like scooby doo or.... “oh this must be a prank video like I’m in 2012.”"
Prank Encounters,Cuz it's cheap as shit
Prank Encounters,People watch. And alot of people think it's real
Prank Encounters,"People are fundamentally the same, no matter the generation.  Our psychology doesn't change.  The fact is most people will always defer to others and take direction, particularly in stressful/uncertain moments.  All the reactions of how the targets tried to question something or go off course only to be steered back by the actors seemed very genuine and what you'd expect in a manipulative situation like that.  If they were actors, those moments would be impossible to fake.  It's too nuanced.  And of course lots of people believe in ghosts and aliens and shit.  So, it's hardly a stretch to think that faking aliens and serial killers in front of people might actually convince a lot of them that it's real.

And this isn't a random clown in a parking garage.  This is a scenario that they've been put in and established as real and genuine, with other people there confirming it, for probably hours that we don't see.  If I hire you to clean my house and you come over and clean for an hour before my neighbor barges in to try to murder me, you have little reason to think that that's fake.  These scenarios all seem well-engineered, but obviously as the audience we have a different perspective.  Put yourself in their shoes and there's clearly something crazy going on.  A Netflix prank show starring the kid from Stranger Things would be one of the last things you'd suspect.  Would you believe it's an actual ghost?  Maybe not, but like Scooby Doo, it could be an actual murderer in a ghost costume, which is reason enough to be afraid."
Prank Encounters,"If a “demonic teddy bear” starts walking towards me I’m not gonna scream like chris tucker. I’m gonna think ok this is fake. Like the show is. 

Besides the “victim” realness. How are these shows still entertaining to anyone anymore? Like my main point. It’s been done to death, like how teen movies died with Superbad. You can recite the formula before you see the movie. And yet they still tried to resell it with younger kids in “good boys”  wow cool middle schoolers saying fuck a lot... big laugh material there"
Prank Encounters,For the Teddy Bear episode the black guy specifically said he thought they were a cult out to murder him. He didn't believe the teddy bear was necessarily real but he thought they were out to get him. Like the guy above said: even if you dont believe in ghosts you could believe in a psycho murderer dressed as a ghost
Prank Encounters,"You know, you might just be maturing or you've just had your fill of that format. If you go back and watch some of the Scare Tactics you might find you don't enjoy those as much either.

Personally, I might like one or two of those episodes entertaining, but at some point, it ends up being the same thing over and over. And you start o see some of them might be faked reactions for the show all together."
Prank Encounters,"Scare Tactics had a better vibe and overall presentation. This show is just a repackaged Scare Tactics with all the same actors, but the host is completely unnecessary. Tracy Morgan was hilarious and the music was great."
Prank Encounters,Of all the things to watch on Netflix.
Prank Encounters,"I'm just glad it turned out to be a Scare Tactics clone, and not the 'we'll just fuck with unemployed people with no other hook' show they first announced."
Prank Encounters,The most genuine part of the show was in the first episode at the end where nobody knew who Gaven watshisname was lol. I would watch it again if every ending was like that. Sorry but your not quite Ashton kid.
Prank Encounters,"That’s too bad I really enjoyed it. Some of those scenarios were really fun. I never watched s are tactics though so it was fresh to me, also I didn’t find the kid annoying which helped"
Prank Encounters,"Eh, that could be part of it. Some of the reactions are entertaining, but for the wrong reasons, like when the ""victims"" don't even react to begin with. And it is a fairly limited format. One of the pranks I watched here was definitely in Scare Tactics, too, so it wasn't really a new thing. 

Just all very underwhelming, but perhaps you're right."
Prank Encounters,"To be fair I find their programming in general to be pretty underwhelming :|

lol @ downvoting, I guess there are a lot of Netflix shills here?"
Prank Encounters,"> not the 'we'll just fuck with unemployed people with no other hook' show they first announced.

Was that an original premise for Prank Encounters, or was that a different show they were developing? I'd be curious to read up on that (sounds screwed up though)."
Prank Encounters,"> also I didn’t find the kid annoying which helped

Yeah I mean he's not *that* bad, and I'm sure he's required to say ""My show on NETFLIX"" every time, but it's still kind of ... blech.

Definitely check out Scare Tactics if you liked this, the episodes are paced better in my opinion."
Nailed It! France,"Really depends on the show, but I think people would be surprised at how little some crew members make. On some of the biggest reality shows, teams of producers are non-union and get no benefits.

Production companies like Magical Elves, Kinetic, World of Wonder, World Race productions that make Drag Race, The Amazing Race, Love is Blind all of have teams of producers who are non-union and it's reports like these where networks would rather shut down production than work with crews trying to unionize that continue to make it difficult."
Nailed It! France,WES?
Nailed It! France,[deleted]
Nailed It! France,"Bummed not to get more holiday episodes, which are my favourites, but obviously I support the staff and they deserve to be treated and paid fairly."
Nailed It! France,"And then people go and celebrate when actors successfully lobby to get paid 100k per episode, meanwhile the people who actually MAKE the show get like minimum wage while also putting up with unsafe shit depending on the show (like I'm sure animated shows don't have much of an issue with safety violations, but reality and action shows probably have a lot)"
Nailed It! France,Sounds like he couldn't take it any more.
Nailed It! France,It seems to be more than $$. There were apparently practices that were not necessarily safe.
Nailed It! France,"Na. It’s just a big message to the industry. We don’t care if we make money or not, you can’t exercise your rights, if you do so, we will invest elsewhere."
Nailed It! France,They probably don’t want to set a precedent.
Nailed It! France,Hah hah hah... they make a fortune.
Nailed It! France,"Last I heard, Nicole Byer, who hosts this and also Wipeout still has a damn roommate."
Nailed It! France,same
Nailed It! France,We won't get to see his golden locks anymore.
Nailed It! France,"You mean covid safe or something else? Baking show can't be that dangerous, well maybe for the contestants."
Nailed It! France,Aren't large portions of the industry extremely unionized? That's what the Screen Actors Guild and company ARE.
Nailed It! France,"Has she shared thoughts on this? Last I heard, which is couple years ago, they just inform her like few weeks before hand to come and host, like she was barely made aware if the show was cancelled or not. Seemed pretty shitty."
Nailed It! France,"I listen to one of her podcasts & the roommate moved out with his partner last year. 

Since then, Nicole has picked up some extra dollas from NBC for the first session of 'Grand Crew', plus she's co-hosting the critic's choice awards with Taye Diggs so she's doing a-ok."
Nailed It! France,She has said on her podcast she likes having a roommate.
Nailed It! France,I heard that there was an accident one time with the liquid nitrogen and a crew member that shouldn’t have been handling.
Nailed It! France,"Correct, but they don’t want new ones."
Nailed It! France,Not for Netflix productions.
Nailed It! France,HAWESSSSSSSSSSSS has had enough of this shit.
Nailed It! France,Honestly shocked a show with this viewership and this many seasons wasn’t union already. These “New Media” shows need to stop getting away with stuff like this
Nailed It! France,I stand with IATSE.
Nailed It! France,HWES needs to unionize
Nailed It! France,Can someone give us the highlights of why it matters either way?
Nailed It! France,I worked for Magical Elves as the interim IT administrator in 2009 for a few weeks so this hits really close to home.
Nailed It! France,It's not a great loss. It's such a cringe show it's hard to watch.
Nailed It! France,HWES!
Nailed It! France,"I don't even think it's a new media issue (though it is an issue), I worked on newer seasons of reality/doc shows in 2016-2018 and those weren't union."
Nailed It! France,IATSE is the union for grips and other off screen workers. Essentially they announced they are going to try and unionize
Nailed It! France,"Unionization provides the technical workers with pension and health care benefits and other guarantees to break time, and daily turn around time. Striking a show with the support of the union prevents any union member from working on that show and makes “scabbing” the show as non union worker a bad idea if you ever want to join the union. On the flip side it costs the production company more money. Much of the time these shows flip union without any fan fare."
Nailed It! France,"The workers unionize: The world literally becomes a better place.

The rich fucks win: The world's oligarchs have even more resources to rape children with."
Nailed It! France,This was such a cringe comment that was hard to read.
Nailed It! France,I’m tired of opening these crappy “secret” doors  on this crappy “secret” show!
Nailed It! France,[deleted]
Nailed It! France,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Nailed It! France,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Nailed It! France,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Nailed It! France,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Nailed It! France,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Nailed It! France,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Nailed It! France,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Nailed It! France,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Nailed It! France,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Nailed It! France,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Nailed It! France,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Nailed It! France,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Nailed It! France,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Nailed It! France,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Nailed It! France,🙂💕
Nailed It! France,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Nailed It! France,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Nailed It! France,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Nailed It! France,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Nailed It! France,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Nailed It! France,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Nailed It! France,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Nailed It! France,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Nailed It! France,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Nailed It! France,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Nailed It! France,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Nailed It! France,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Nailed It! France,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Nailed It! France,“Fall” isn’t setting a Netflix premier for Great British Baking Show. We already knew “Fall” it’s always “Fall.”  I’m looking for a date. Or at least a specific month.
Nailed It! France,Next month for Nailed It! Hell yes
Nailed It! France,I wish Netflix would get The Great Canadian Baking Show (Dan Levy hosted first two seasons and was terrific) and the Great Kiwi Baking Show. I was briefly able to get them in nefarious manners but would watch again. With Dan Levy being so popular it’s surprising TGCBS isn’t available outside Canada.

Nailed It! France,"Same energy as saying ""I PAY YOUR SALARY"" to public service workers. 

The $15 a month you pay isn't enough for them to close the millions of dollars they'd need to get the license back for this stuff.  I know Hunger Games used to be on there, I assume the viewership numbers were too low to justify them continuing to pay for the streaming rights. 

Just buy the DVDs."
Nailed It! France,"Seeing as how I also pay them, I say they do the opposite of what you say."
Nailed It! France,I can't tell if you're trolling or just incredibly young with terrible taste.
Nailed It! France,"The term exists, but in this case the show would then be called ""The Great British Face-Off."" Not exactly a fitting title for a friendly baking competition! And ""The Great British Baking Face-Off"" just doesn't roll off the tongue, so we settle with Baking Show. 

It's because Pillsbury, an American baking company, holds its own baking competitions and owns the trademark for the term ""Bake Off."""
Nailed It! France,Crime Scene Kitchen isn’t quite as wholesome but it’s a pretty fun twist on that Baking show format.  Plus Joel McHale is far less creepy than Matt Lucas.
Nailed It! France,"Yeah at first it was people who could at least get close.  Like you could at least usually see what the end goal was.

Charlie has for the most part been the most positive of the gang despite constantly getting shit on by them (while still being for the most part an asshole).  He craved Frank's attention when he though he might be his father, going back to like season 3, something Frank originally didn't really want.  He's had a difficult life, he lives in squalor, and his only real goal in the show was obtaining an unobtainable love interest, who didn't fill the hole in his heart once they started dating. He had an odd childhood with a loving but fairly absent minded mother, numerous hints that he was molested as a kid, etc. >!He finally finds his father and goes 100% in on building that relationship.  One of his friends gives him COVID and kills him.  His friends help him carry the body up the mountain but one by one they leave him except Frank who Charlie tells to leave anyway. Then  after an episode of building up Charlie trying to bury his feelings, he finally breaks down after 15 seasons and most of his life never going his way. !< And I thought Charlie Day sold the fuck out of it.

Nailed It! France,"They discussed it on their podcast. I believe it was this scene that Ryan Reynolds saw then contacted Rob and that was how they became friends.

This scene might be why we have Welcome to Wrexham."
Nailed It! France,"Laughs are cheap, I’m going for gasps."
Nailed It! France,I thought this was gonna be a post about the dance off with Dennis lol
Nailed It! France,"I think he's said that he spent over a year getting in shape and training for this one scene.

Between the weight gain, the weight loss and this, the amount of stress that Rob McElhenney has put on his body in the name of that show is beyond unreal. The discipline the man has is inspirational."
Nailed It! France,I prefer the dance they do it at their high school reunion
Nailed It! France,"I always feel like the most emotionally affecting moments are not in dramas, but in comedies, because the laughs let your guard down and leave you vulnerable enough to hit you hard when it gets sincere. It’s why I’ve cried more at like, the Office, than any dramatic program I’ve seen.

Sunny has very very few sincere moments, so seeing one like that, while definitely out of left field, still works so well because at the end of the day we’ve stuck with these characters so long and have love for them regardless of how vile they are."
Nailed It! France,Oh my god... I get it
Nailed It! France,I was so impressed to find out that Rob had no previous dance background and learned everything you see in that dance in a year - That is incredibly **hard** and Kylie Shea (his ballerina partner) had to put 100% trust in him since lifts and catches can go terribly wrong with even the most trained male dancers.  Shout out to the Alison Faulk and Leo Moctezuma the choreographers as well.
Nailed It! France,Is there a clip online where I can see this dance scene?
Nailed It! France,"I loved the part where he spins around and pretends to blow Dennis. Ah wait, wrong dance."
Nailed It! France,"https://youtu.be/pSiCn0KKZIg

Here’s the link in case anyone wants to watch it. Truly a beautiful performance."
Nailed It! France,"Looking back I think its far less out of place than people think.  Along with Charlies breakdown after his real dad dies.

They STARTED the show with these horrible people who you wouldnt mind seeing fail and have bad things happen to them. They were just supposed to be sociopathic and unlikable.  

But then they started with Charlies illiteracy and being molested, his mom being a prostitute, and him not having a dad.  Macs obviously criminal parents and his supremely toxic dad and religion.  And then you bring in Dennis/Dees dad and mom and how their mom was this cold woman and Frank being, well, Frank.  And Dees is truly tragic once you realize she was a fun, soon to be successful ""Sweet Dee"" prior to what was a brain injury.  

You start to realize these people were doomed by their horrible families (and the skating injury with Dee) and what was just a dark comedy slowly becomes a tragedy."
Brotherhood,"The best part is that if it ends up being about Malcolm having his own kids, and features the parents, poor Malcolm is still technically in the Middle."
Brotherhood,"This show was a comedy gold mine. I rewatch it from time to time. I'm open for more *Malcolm*.

There were so many great moments, but my favorite was that time [Hal led Craig's co-workers into a revolution. All while Phil Collins plays in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuYZz2n2AjQ&ab_channel=KamB%C3%A1)"
Brotherhood,“Malcolm the middle aged”
Brotherhood,"I used to watch this as a kid on TV in my country, just random episodes and loved it. I just finished a full watch for the first time and it brought so much memories.

I would love a movie or reunion of some kind if its done correctly"
Brotherhood,He was just on the most recent episode of Conan O’Brian Needs a Friend. Conan talks about how Hal is one of the funniest characters to ever grace the screen and that Cranston is one of the best comedic actors there is. Cranston didn’t mention anything about the movie though unfortunately (unless I missed it).
Brotherhood,This show had phenomenal writing
Brotherhood,"So Malcolm is working towards being president? Deweey is some rich musician?

Was anything else predicted?

I guess Francis has a typical family man lifestyle 9-5.

Reese probably has his own restaurant (maybe even funded by Francis) would be nice if the two of them got into hospitality with Reese doing the food. Maybe Hal and Lois live with them in the countryside to retire away from the city. Maybe Hal and Lois sold everything they had to fund the hotel.

But Francis enjoyed getting fired from the ranch and working an office job right? I found that the weirdest storyline in the whole show 

Jamie. God knows. Military?"
Brotherhood,This will be the true end of Breaking Bad since the whole show was a bad dream that Hal had after eating a deep-fried Twinkie.
Brotherhood,I just want to have the reboot happen so modern day [Stevie](https://imgur.io/HhYrx) can make a cameo.
Brotherhood,Aaron Paul should make a cameo.
Brotherhood,Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. Can you repeat the question?
Brotherhood,"It’s funny that with all those young actors on that show, Bryan Cranston was the one to break out and have long term stardom."
Brotherhood,"Wonder if they will have any problems getting Frankie Muniz’s schedule to line up. He’s going full time in stock car racing now. They’d likely have to film in the off-season.

[Why ‘Malcolm in the Middle’ Star Frankie Muniz Is Driving in the ARCA Menards Series](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a42484488/actor-frankie-muniz-arca-menards-series/)"
Brotherhood,"That show held up super well. 

Also, credit to Vince Gilligan for fighting the brass and casting Cranston as Walter White. I really think this would’ve killed his career had he not gotten the chance to prove himself on Breaking Bad. 

Now, we can look at Hal and laugh about it, while respecting the insane acting we’ve seen Cranston pull off since then."
Brotherhood,[deleted]
Brotherhood,"i love love love malcolm in the middle, so part of me doesn’t want this to happen because there’s a 75% chance it’ll be shitty"
Brotherhood,Did they replace Francis with a wax figure for that photo?
Brotherhood,I still can't believe he's Walt and Hal. I just watched all of MINTM then straight into Breaking Bad. It took me a whole two episodes to fell it. What a great actor.
Brotherhood,Malcom in the middle age 😎
Brotherhood,It’s interesting that movie franchises are getting shows and old tv shows are getting movies. How the turn tables.
Brotherhood,used to watch this when I was a kid. I’m 25 now and the show still holds up. Absolutely cracks me up
Brotherhood,Malcolm needs to have a joke where people keep thinking he has amnesia and doesn't remember his childhood.
Brotherhood,*Do it.*
Brotherhood,Please let this be a reality I'm rewatching that show now. so damn good.
Brotherhood,"they could always end up seeing how well it does and then do a new series where Malcolm in the dad now and shows him having to go through fatherhood, plenty of cameos from the main cast"
Brotherhood,Yes
Brotherhood,Am I crazy or isn’t Malcom supposed to be President? I distinctly remember the reason why his parents push him harder than everyone else is because they were told he’s a genius and the show started on a flash-forward with him taking the oath of office did that happen or am I nuts?
Brotherhood,Pleas stop these reboots and derivatives
Brotherhood,Why is she holding the child by the crotch in that photo lol
Brotherhood,Let's not do this please.
Brotherhood,These movies based on decades old movies and shows with the original cast are usually pretty bad. I would prefer him to spend the time of something that has a higher chance to be good.
Brotherhood,Thank you!
Brotherhood,yes please!
Brotherhood,This is wild considering Frankie Muniz doesn’t remember much about being in the show.
Brotherhood,Finally we’ll find out if the Breaking Bad conspiracy theories are canon.
Brotherhood,"I am sure this is the minority opinion, but my hopes are low.  I think it will just be depressing and inferior to the final episode."
Brotherhood,Finally something I can be excited for.
Brotherhood,It was all Hal's dream sequence is canon
Brotherhood,Can we not?
Brotherhood,"Is a Malcolm in the Middle movie happening?

Yes no, maybe, I dooon’t knooow, can you reepeat theee queeestion?"
Brotherhood,Please don’t
Brotherhood,No thanks
Brotherhood,"I dont know if i would want a movie imo. 

I love the show and it holds up super well, but most of these actors have moved on with their lives and u would rather have a fond memory versus a tarnished conclusion. 

Frankie Muniz doesnt really act anymore and i think he had a traumatic brain injury from stock car racing. 

Pretty sure Justin Berfield and Erik Silluvan both stopped acting as well. I dont know what happened to the actress for their mother.   


I guess the stakes are against them in making a successful movie imo"
Brotherhood,Enough with the remakes.
Brotherhood,Would Frankie even be able to do it? Doesn’t he have a  severe memory loss problem to the point that he doesn’t remember making most of this show?
Brotherhood,"Oh god, I have had this dream of this movie for a very long time. Not because I love the show just some random ass dream. 

But this is the story. Hal and Lois are at their son Malcolm's wedding. We see Dewey and Reese with their new wives, along with their older brother Francis and his wife Piama. It is a wonderful ceremony. While the reception is taking place, the dance floor is full of everyone partying, with Hal and Lois sitting at a table with friends around, laughing and drinking. Hal is the focal point in the shot, is visibly shaken, as the camera begins to pan through the crowd that is now clearing a small visual path showing a group of friends standing with Malcolm shooting the shit as old friends do. With one new but familiar face to Hal. Aaron Paul plays a business friend of Malcolm. Who share an interest in cars. 

The night goes on with Hal visibly shaken but playing the best poker face he can.  Eventually, Hal and Aaron collide paths trying to hide each other pasts. But when the two finally get a moment to themselves, they begin to reminisce about their journey and the good times they shared in an old life. Til the question everyone wants to know is asked. ""So, Mr. White what the fuck happened, yo?"" ""The News said you died."" 

We are then given the story of how Mr. White survived all along and gave up the cartel to become Hal."
Brotherhood,"Pretty sure (don't know his name) the ""children"" actors went through hell of a drug phase or still are, if I'm not mistaken?"
Brotherhood,Will rapist Danny Masterson’s brother be in it? Francis was a fun character.
Brotherhood,It'll all be brand new content for Frankie Munez
Brotherhood,Inb4 they recast malcolm as an atheist genderqueer BIPOC
Brotherhood,"Reese dies tragically and they all come home to the funeral only to find out that shenanigans begin. Or Malcolm wins the presidency, and their family stays in the white house and then Reese dies. What would it even be about?"
Brotherhood,No thank you.
Brotherhood,Plot twist: >!The family has a distant cousin named “Jesse” visit.!<
Brotherhood,Forget talking let's see some action
Brotherhood,Please let this actually happen
Brotherhood,Please let this happen
Brotherhood,Hell yes! This literally comes in my mind on a weekly basis
Brotherhood,Best part of this show was when it got canceled.
Brotherhood,I don’t see how this movie gets made without Cranston being the main character and Malcolm being an afterthought
Brotherhood,[deleted]
Brotherhood,Hope Frankie plays a race car driver in the show.
Brotherhood,I didn’t watch this show till after it was canceled and only reruns were aired. Didn’t think I would have enjoyed it and laugh so much. I think Hal is for sure the best character.
Brotherhood,Cinematic masterpiece incoming.
Brotherhood,*faints*
Brotherhood,BUT WHAT ABOUT FRANKIES NASCAR DREAM BRYAN
Brotherhood,im excited to see dewey on screen again!
Brotherhood,Hell yeah. Just recently finished a rewatch.
Brotherhood,Honestly I hope they follow up on his moms vision of his future.
Brotherhood,Malcolm in the Movie
Brotherhood,movie in the middle
Brotherhood,He had better be president
Brotherhood,YES YES YES
Brotherhood,Why have I never seen this show in syndication? I gotta see Steve harvey for an hour every night
Brotherhood,There was a baby?
Brotherhood,"I hope that there is Breaking Bad references somewhere.

That and Francis was awesome"
Brotherhood,Didn't know show creator Linwood Boomer was Adam on Little House on the Prairie and had written episodes of Silver Spoons and Night Court.
Brotherhood,"I think Reese should be a crypto bro. Not like a billionaire one just a bandwagon one but has made a reasonably high amount of money (like $1.5 million) from having gone all in at the right time. 

That's my only creative suggestion."
Brotherhood,I wonder if they'll make Malcolm president
Brotherhood,"Jesus… leave it be.

They said no Breaking Bad sequels….just a matter of time."
Brotherhood,">The actor would love to revisit the Wilkerson family 20 years later.

Didn't his parents' plan involve Malcolm ascending to the Presidency? Unless they drop that, it will be interesting to see how this goes, probably one look at his siblings and he has no chance at political office."
Brotherhood,I met frankie muniz at work once. He said he has very little memory of filming Malcom in the middle… now I don’t know if he was lying or not.
Brotherhood,I always forget there was a good Masterson.
Brotherhood,"That show has a special place in my heart - one of the only shows my family and I would watch all together and laugh. It’s pure gold. 

I’m totes here for the movie! Yay!!!"
Brotherhood,Times were simpler when I was binge watching this on Netflix.  Things were just better.
Brotherhood,It’s agent Cody banks 3. So excited for this news!
Brotherhood,Noooooooooooo. When will Hollywood stop being greedy and start leaving masterpieces alone?
Brotherhood,Isn’t Malcom a nascar driver now ? I know that sounds crazy lmao bc it is but I’m pretty sure I read that
Brotherhood,"Eh, not really sure if I'm interested."
Brotherhood,ugh why
Brotherhood,I always wanted Francis to reunite with his brothers and start raising hell
Brotherhood,Malcolm in the Middle!!!
Brotherhood,Didn’t i just see that Frankie Muniz is a full time NASCAR driver now? Wouldnt mind a reboot but that may throw a monkey wrench in the works.
Brotherhood,😂
Brotherhood,"People: the main issue is that the actor that plays Dewey has been AWOL for quite some time, to the point where he didn’t show up to their reunions. If they do make it they’ll more than likely have to do it without him."
Brotherhood,Malcolm should be President
Brotherhood,my god. yes. yes please
Brotherhood,This show was comedy gold!
Brotherhood,Is Frankie even going to know what’s going on or why he’s there?
Brotherhood,Director was Linwood Boomer i think that’s his name he’s better known as Adam   (Mary’s blind husband) on Little House on the Prarie.
Brotherhood,Omfg yes!!!!!!!!!! Merry early Christmas everybody!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nailed It! Spain,yeah this def. a staple in spanish households
Nailed It! Spain,"So many generations have grown up with this show, gave good life advice on numerous occasions"
Nailed It! Spain,"I love that someone said ""let's make a show about a young, orphan boy that's homeless, lives in a barrel, and it mistreated by his neighbors, but we'll make it a comedy.""

And it worked."
Nailed It! Spain,Man this show actually hilarious. I was raised with slang spanish in LA and this was a staple in my home
Nailed It! Spain,"Oh shit I’d completely forgotten about la chilindrina, so that’s why I have a certain type…"
Nailed It! Spain,"Funny, wholesome and with good life advice.  Recuerden “la venganza nunca es buena, mata el alma y la envenena”."
Nailed It! Spain,Mimimimimimimi
Nailed It! Spain,Intro song still a banger.

Nailed It! Spain,"Wonderful show. I'm 36, Argentinian, and this is still quoted all the time and you can spot people with Don Ramón t-shirts everywhere lol."
Nailed It! Spain,Trivia tidbit: Chespirito is meant to sound like “little Shakespeare” in Spanish: Shakespearito
Nailed It! Spain,[deleted]
Nailed It! Spain,Shame Quico never got his square ball.
Nailed It! Spain,eso eso eso! 🤏🏽
Nailed It! Spain,Lots of great memories of watching these with my grandparents growing up in Puerto Rico
Nailed It! Spain,"Dude, this was the thing to watch in Brazil during the afternoons. They aired it every day for years, to the point it was impossible to find a kid that didn't know ""Chaves"" and their quotes. Great humor and wholesome moments, truly a program for the whole family."
Nailed It! Spain,Fantastic claymation opening credits
Nailed It! Spain,mane i love this show
Nailed It! Spain,I watched this as a kid in PR.
Nailed It! Spain,I remember this as a kid.  Fuck I’m old.  Being late 30s suucks.
Nailed It! Spain,Truly THE thing that simbolizes latin american culture.
Nailed It! Spain,Crazy how my parents grew up watching it and as a result so did I.
Nailed It! Spain,"El Chavo! Love this show, used to watch it all the time. The comedy's timeless, to the point it seems prescient today still."
Nailed It! Spain,"My god, this unlocked some memories.

I used to watch this when I was a little kid with my grandmother."
Nailed It! Spain,It's the guy from fortnite!
Nailed It! Spain,An absolute treasure 💗
Nailed It! Spain,I can still hear the theme song.
Nailed It! Spain,I can still hear the theme song.
Nailed It! Spain,"Oh jeez, we watched this in high school Spanish class."
Nailed It! Spain,I love this show!!
Nailed It! Spain,I literally never watch Spanish things because I can’t understand them completely and most of them my family watched I didn’t really care about but I was fine with this one and “la familia peluche”
Nailed It! Spain,"However, the sketch comedy show Chesperito, ended up having much more seasons. And that would feature sketches involving El Chavo.

That's why there are two or three characters that I never knew on the original full-length program, because they didn't continue in the smaller sketches that aired on Chesperito."
Nailed It! Spain,that episode where everybody is going to the beach except him because he is dirt poor. I'm still traumatized 40 years later
Nailed It! Spain,Is that the show that had the bumblebee?
Nailed It! Spain,"I just got introduced to this series last week actually!!  I’m looking forward to watching more!

That being said, it premiered in 1971, so today is not the 50th anniversary.  You’re off by a few hundred days."
Nailed It! Spain,[Here's the show's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chavo_del_Ocho) for curious Gringos like me who have never heard of it and don't even know what the title means.
Nailed It! Spain,Does this show have that dude in the bee outfit?
Nailed It! Spain,"7 seasons, 311 episodes.  
What the hell constitutes a season?"
Nailed It! Spain,"You seen one episode, you’ve seen them all."
Nailed It! Spain,Did I just see Mexican Jon Lovitz smoking a stogie?
Nailed It! Spain,I hope the creator is burning in hell. What a fucked up show
Nailed It! Spain,Thanks to this show Mexico is the way it is . DISABLE
Nailed It! Spain,"Not to be that guy but couldn't you have just said that it was a hit in the Hispanic world? Spain and Brazil are Hispanic, this also makes Portugal Hispanic."
Nailed It! Spain,I remember going to see Quico. The spinoff .. to the theatre here in Argentina as a kid in .. 2002 or less. There re channels that still transmit it and I leave it on from time to time. While repetitive (episodes from early seasons are literally re executed with other characters in later ones. Same joke. Delivery. Everything) it's still nice
Nailed It! Spain,What is Hispanic America? Do you mean Latin America?
Nailed It! Spain,I watched quite a bit of this show until we eventually got our own washer and dryer.
Nailed It! Spain,Not in Spain.
Nailed It! Spain,This was always on at my abuela’s house in Puerto Rico when I was a kid. At least that’s how I remember it.
Nailed It! Spain,"I grew up in Brasil and used to watch this with my nanny. 
🎵La vem o Chaves Chaves Chaves, todos amigos olhando para TV.🎶🎵"
Nailed It! Spain,Scorchio!
Nailed It! Spain,"Looks like a Mexican ""last of the summer wine"""
Nailed It! Spain,Ninguém tem paciência comigo…
Nailed It! Spain,"I was about to say, the author of Savage Detectives made a sitcom??"
Nailed It! Spain,My friend’s nick name growing up was Chavo
Nailed It! Spain,"This show brings me good memories, I used to watch it when I was 6. It aired at night around 8:00PM on one of the most known free to air channels in Mexico, before El Chavo, SpongeBob SquarePants aired.

I recently watched a couple of episodes and I personally didn’t find it as entertaining as I used to, some of the humor haven’t aged that well but that’s something you can expect from a 50 year old show."
Nailed It! Spain,"Is it still? I grew up watching it. I don't have kids, but I find it hard to believe that my nieces and nephews are aware of any of Gomez Bolanos creations."
Nailed It! Spain,I can still hear those gem curtains jingling.
Nailed It! Spain,Also amazing how the BR dub was kinda its own thing while keeping the spirit of the original and still managed to be iconic in it's own right.
Nailed It! Spain,"""Revenge is never good, it kills the soul and makes it grow old"""
Nailed It! Spain,"Definitely a one of those ""Ok, hear me out..."" moments in history."
Nailed It! Spain,"Actually, he lives in the number 8 apartment."
Nailed It! Spain,"""there's doña florinda, a single mom let's her kid play outside while she drinks some coffee with her son's teacher. don ramon a single father without a job and oh the landlord is the bad guy"""
Nailed It! Spain,"Of course, the other stories that are told with the same characters are pretty cool. And introduced to us, of course El Chapulin Colorado! ￼ The red grasshopper! ￼ The stories involving the two brothers were country bumpkins always getting in and out of trouble or funny. I also enjoy the stories involving ￼ the two ￼ burglars were never really good at it. Towards the end they got rid of that and they just put them in charge of a hotel and funny Hijinx ensued."
Nailed It! Spain,FBI: Go on...
Nailed It! Spain,"For the güeros:

Revenge is never good, [it] kills the soul and poisons it."
Nailed It! Spain,on dios 😮‍💨
Nailed It! Spain,oh my god! i haven't heard that since maybe late 70's but i immediately recognized it. this show was our childhood.
Nailed It! Spain,My parents still use that phrase every now and then lol
Nailed It! Spain,¡Fue sin querer queriendo!
Nailed It! Spain,"It’s originally a song from a french musician, one of the first explorers of synth music. 

It’s called “The elephant never forgets” by Jean-Jacques Perrey."
Nailed It! Spain,Youtube
Nailed It! Spain,Dominican Republic here. Late 80's kid. Everyone one and their mother watched this show here. It is truly legendary and it still holds up.
Nailed It! Spain,"A Brazilian TV show once gave the actor a square ball, he later said it was one of the best gifts he ever got."
Nailed It! Spain,"Maybe you’re thinking of this one?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chapul%C3%ADn_Colorado

Same main actor."
Nailed It! Spain,"Actually '73 is El Chavo's debut as its own T.V. series, before that El Chavo was part of Chespirito's sketch comedy show. When the series got cancelled Chespirito revived his sketch comedy show and integrated El Chavo in there.

As a sketch, El Chavo lasted until 1992 when Chespirito decided he was too old play an 8yo, plus the age meant they couldn't do El Chavo's slapstick humor as they used to be."
Nailed It! Spain,[deleted]
Nailed It! Spain,"They basically had an anthology of different shows with the same cast members. It started with El Chavo and El Chapulin Colorado. Later on they added El Chompiras, El Chaparrón Bonaparte, Dr. Chapatin, El Chambon, (see a pattern?) and others. They even made a movie and a sequel called El Chanfle."
Nailed It! Spain,Mames
Nailed It! Spain,Actually it’s more because of Futbol
Nailed It! Spain,"pretty sure brazil and portugal wouldnt consider themselves spanish, which is the meaning of the word hispanic"
Nailed It! Spain,They should have said in LATIN AMERICA and Spain cus Brazil = Latin American/do not speak Spanish so not Hispanic. Portugal = European/White. Spain = Hispanic/European/white. This is why I tell people to use the term Latin American instead cus it includes people that don’t speak Spanish but from the same regions of the americas.
Nailed It! Spain,Callate pendejo
Nailed It! Spain,No. But yes and no and no.
Nailed It! Spain,"Brazil os not Hispanic, we speak Portuguese. Portugal also speaks Portuguese... Hispanic refers to the language, and as hard as it may seem to believe, Portuguese and Spanish are two different languages."
Nailed It! Spain,I believe it is the America that speaks Spanish.
Nailed It! Spain,"Hispanic America are the countries that speak Spanish, Latin America are the countries that speak a Latin derived language.

The main difference would be Brazil, since they speak Portuguese."
Nailed It! Spain,"Was until 2020. The series has been off the air globally for almost three years because of a copyright dispute between the representatives of the original creator and the TV network. But until that year, they showed episodes of the series literally every day here in brazil, with great ratings. Everyone loves this show here, even after 50 years"
Nailed It! Spain,"On top of the cartoon that is more recent as the other commenter noted

The merch market is big for this. Plushies and shirts and stuff 

It’s still big in Los Angeles so it might be a location thing since we have many Latinos. Households where grandmother or grandfather are still in the picture. The kids like the slapstick.

Like once a year a circus comes to town with a character’s name attached to it. Kinda funny how that works out. “El circo de la chilindrina”, or “el circo de kiko “"
Nailed It! Spain,It’s actually been turned into an animated series so they might’ve actually watched that
Nailed It! Spain,I knew it was big in Brazil but I didn't realize how big it was until I saw Neymar dressed up as one of its characters.
Nailed It! Spain,"It didn't have a number initially, the 8 was a reference to the channel that broadcasted it in Mexico. It was changed to being his apartment number once it gained international traction, since every country had it in a different channel."
Nailed It! Spain,Well I stand corrected.  XD
Nailed It! Spain,"Don Barriga is never really portrayed as a bad guy tbh. If anything, he is often the victim and never really has plot lines about him being evil or greedy."
Nailed It! Spain,"But those at least made sense.  In terms of premise, you have a show about a bumbling hero, one about inept burglars, and one about a homeless child who gets beat, verbally insulted, and every now and then they feel bad and give him food.

This is the show family show that became the most popular and continues to be loved by most of the country, and I find that extremely interesting."
Nailed It! Spain,"Thank you for this. I’m learning a lot about this show today, when it used to be just some stuff on in the background at my grandmas house or friends parents houses. Hell yeah."
Nailed It! Spain,What a strange and avant-garde choice. I would love to see a Behind the Chavo episode about the process to land on this song.
Nailed It! Spain,OK I was close
Nailed It! Spain,"El Chapulin Colorado was its own show. I read once, the Simpsons writers were holed up together to develop scripts. They had writer's block, so they turned on the television. The television only got broadcast TV so there weren't many channels. They watched El Chapulin Colorado on Univision, thus Pedro Chespirito (Bumblebee Man) was born."
Nailed It! Spain,Europe seems fine
Nailed It! Spain,The origin of the word comes from the Roman Province of Hispania. The province encompassed modern day Spain and Portugal.
The Untamed,"Because, contrary to what movies and TV would have you believe, encounters with large predators are quite rare, especially in the lower 48. I've been an avid camper and backpacker for 30+ years. I have had exactly one encounter that gave me (very slight) cause for concern, with a mountain lion.

Seen plenty of coyotes, though. But they're about as dangerous as squirrels. I've seen a few rattle snakes and water moccasins, but never close enough to be in any danger. Also black bears, but again only from a distance.

Frankly, raccoons are the sketchiest creatures I've run into. They're bold and can get aggressive when trying to get at your food.

I would *love* to see a grizzly or a wolf, from a safe distance of course, but I've only seen their scat and tracks."
The Untamed,"There is actually an episode of Survivorman in South America in which Les Stroud sees and is stalked by a leopard or jaguar, I can't remember which. He ends up leaving his camp to find safety in a village because of it.

The other shows have camera crews, so I imagine animals just avoid groups of people. Some of them are also kind of notorious for not really going into the bush very far. 

Also Bear Grylls is known for faking some stuff."
The Untamed,"Animals avoid humans in pretty much every case unless they're starving. So yeah, a bunch of people with cameras and lights and vehicles are not likely to run into much."
The Untamed,[deleted]
The Untamed,"Doesn't Naked and Afraid and Dual Survival have camera crews and whatever crews with them? Only one who would be in real danger, is the only one who actually survives on his own, Les Stroud. Damn, I need to watch Survivorman again. 

When it comes to safe areas, I was just watching Dual Survival and they had plenty of lions and other animals around them, but as I said, they also seem to roll with a crew, so I'm sure there were people with guns with them too. Same goes with Survivorman man and safe areas (not the crew part), with animals wandering and with some thicker forests he goes into, it's quite impossible to make it actually a safe area. "
The Untamed,"You should watch Alone on the History channel. It’s a lot like survivorman, contestants survive alone in the wild with the camera and recording equipment that they have to film themselves. The last contestant left wins half a million dollars. It’s the only competition show I like and it is the best survival show since Survivorman. But, contestants are constantly encountering bears and cougars. Every single season has two are three contestants tap out of the show because a bear shows up to their camp and night. It’s some tense stuff, and my favorite contestants from the first season stayed in his tent with a knife and a flare because there was a mountain lion outside his tent pacing. He was talking to the camera hoping his voice would scare it away. One of the best part of the series, you should check it out"
The Untamed,They obviously groom and scout the area beforehand. 
The Untamed,"Actually for survivor man, he has encountered numerous dangerous animals . Here in Alaska, a bear came to his housing one night and tried to get into it while he slept. But for a of those shows, there is a much easier answer: Because they pick areas where the animals are not.

Most of those shows don't tell you that they are in protected park areas where there is often lots of traffic by people and animals often avoid those areas. Also, they often pick areas that there are few if any predators. For a person like Les Stroud, he also researches and prepares for each show about six months before shooting. That gives them the chance to find out about wildlife in the area. Many times he has done areas where there is little to no dangerous animals. Also, most of the shows had a production crew which keeps them safe by having numbers. And even if they encountered an animal, it would most likely not make the shows. 

Most animals are actual scared of humans or don't care. A few will have a curious nature. Snakes and spiders could care less and only really strike if they think you are endangering their lives. And most bugs aren't poisonous, but do carry disease which they are vaccinated against before leaving of course. 

And then there is a show like survivor which is just...fake as all get out despite what people think. Between the crew, the ""contestants"" and everyone, there is enough noise to keep most animals away. And if you want to know, Bear Grylis is all fake despite what you may think. he goes out, shoots and then goes back to the hotel for the night only playing up the survival angle. So I hate to say it, but most of the Survival reality shows are complete fakes. "
The Untamed,"Years ago I used to camp at Balsam Mountain off the Blue Ridge Parkway. The rangers had camp fire circles every night called Bear Circles. Warned about bears in the campground. Had tall pipe poles at every campsite with forks at the top like an old coat rack to hang your food from. Not even toothpaste or chips in the tent because the bears could smell it. They had broken into cars regularly when food was in them. Kinda spooky, but a great place to camp "
The Untamed,Scope the area out beforehand. Also predators probably don't want to go after humans when there's a bunch together in one area.
The Untamed,Because TV is fake.
The Untamed,They're actually rare to come across?
The Untamed,Based on a true story. 
The Untamed,"Clue, it’s not fucking real !"
The Untamed,Because they are all fake and scripted to sucker soccer moms?
The Untamed,"Closest encounter I had was in Florida, we had a couple bear cubs run through our campsite. I'm sure mama bear was nearby"
The Untamed,"I was hiking a trail on the Delaware water gap when i saw a bear about 50ft away, and he saw me too. We stared at each other for a minute and I, being the idiot that i am, slowly took out my camera and took a photo. Then I slowly continued down the trail, never taking my eyes off the bear until i was a safe distance away. "
The Untamed,"I have more bad luck with opposums they tend to be dumber then coons and more aggressive in my neck of the words, "
The Untamed,Idk man I knew a girl who was killed by coyotes while hiking so I'd say slightly more dangerous than squirrels. 
The Untamed,Damn that kinda gives me chills about the leopard. Imagine seeing it a few times eyeballing you. Just wondering when it'll come to kill you. 
The Untamed,"Yea, and when he did his Alaska stretch, they wouldn't let him go out there without a rifle, cause of the polar bears.

Thing is, most animals want nothing to do with us."
The Untamed,Along with the camera crews are local animal trackers/spotters/guards for insurance purposes.
The Untamed,Survivorman also encountered lions in Africa and had to use the burner from his hot air balloon to scare them off. And I think I remember a bear getting close to him in Alaska too.
The Untamed,"> Also Bear Grylls is known for faking some stuff.

I wonder if he faked pooping out all those worms."
The Untamed,[deleted]
The Untamed,"> Having people die in your country is generally bad for business and PR

Well, at least if it's someone of any note.  
Tourists however are usually stupid and some losses are to be expected."
The Untamed,"Is suvivorman better than any Bear Grylls show? He was fun to watch at first a while ago but it’s getting more ridiculously staged. One time he jumps in a frozen stream on purpose and strips and is trying to tell the viewer the dangers of keeping wet clothes on but you suspect he has a heated blanket ready for him two yards away after they cut away. I like naked and afraid because every couple is legitimately starving for protein and struggling from the get-go. They make it clearly known they can’t interact with the crew unless it’s a medical emergency (one woman had severe hypothermia and had to be airlifted out) but they also do remind the viewer the crew is nearby at all times so it’s no trickery like Grylls. 

Edit: Happy cake day /u/ummhumm"
The Untamed,"> bear cubs

I'm sure that increased the pucker factor, lol."
The Untamed,"That is pretty much a normal way to deal with a black bear, just show respect and don't show fear. They're lazy as hell 99% of the time. Was walking with my gf in NW Jersey in a field and we happened on a relaxing bear in the tall grass, maybe 30 feet away. It stood up, looked at us, and we backed away slowly and it went back to sleep and that was that."
The Untamed,"I was dubious of your claim, but apparently coyotes *have* been known to attack people, although it's extremely rare and has overwhelmingly been attacks on infants and small children.

I've seen countless coyotes over the years and have never once had an issue with them, so...TIL, I guess. :/

edit: sorry about your friend."
The Untamed,Except of course for Polar Bears.
The Untamed,"I live on Vancouver Island, in B.C., and we have lots of black bears. We see them all the time but rarely do they ever attack anyone. They're just trying to survive, they really don't want to tango unless they feel they have no other option. Like 90% of animals will flee at top speed when they see people, especially if it's a region in which people hunt. We're pretty efficient at murder, I think most animals know this."
The Untamed,"Survivorman is actually him alone in the wilds. Sure, they've given him a basic tutorial on what's eatable in the areas, what to expect in there to begin with and all that, but it's him alone, for 7days. He doesn't get food, besides some candy bar here and there to begin with and his equipment is usually salvaged from what he came with. Like when he got estranged with a broken motorcycle, he just stripped what he could possibly use from the cycle. 

He even drags the cameras back and forth to get the ""travel shots"" from a bit of a distance, which has tricked some people who've only seen youtube clips of the show, to think there's a crew hopping along too. No, it's just him doing extra work to get better shots. 

Add to this, since it's one guy for 7days, Les is also a really charming fellow and it's just nice to listen to him talking about this and that and trying to stay positive and productive when the energy levels just drop lower and lower. 

But yeah, I honestly rank Grylls show pretty much the lowest of the shows I've watched simply because how staged it is and how outrageously stupid advice he gives now and then. So, my word isn't the best one to take about this. Survivorman all the way still. 

Also, the show is easy to judge by just watching the first episode, since it stays pretty much the same, with just locations and starting gear (quite little at best) changing. 


"
The Untamed,"Yeah, the cubs themselves i wasnt too worried about,  it was the mama bear nearby that i couldn't see was what I was worried about"
The Untamed,Did you have to change your pants afterwards though?
The Untamed,[unfortunately it did happen](https://www.google.ca/amp/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.779304) 
The Untamed,"> we’re pretty efficient at murder, I think animals know this


Not tigers. Those fuckers will actively hunt people."
The Untamed,"Yeah, saw that come up repeatedly when I started googling. You knew her? Sorry, man. :("
Daybreak,It's so good!  Would've loved another season.
Daybreak,I so enjoyed that show and sucks it got cancelled.
Daybreak,"I was bummed and surprised it didn't resonate with more folks.  I thoroughly enjoyed the show.

Edit : reso ate to resonate"
Daybreak,"One of the cutest shows ive seen in awhile. I thought it was super watchable, great characters, and shockingly dark. This and Julie and The Phantoms was why I gave up on Netflix."
Daybreak,"well now I want to see Zack Morris and Screech fighting Imperator Furiosa and her newest recruit, Mr Belding"
Daybreak,One of the worst show I watched all the way through.
Daybreak,The protagonist was very cute and charming.
Daybreak,"I really enjoyed that show as well. I was wanting more seasons, but oh well that's Netflix for ya!"
Daybreak,Really fun show. Making a post-apocalypse show into something fairly upbeat.
Daybreak,Awesome show. Would have loved more.
Daybreak,"Isn't it great 74% of Netflix TV shows get canceled after the first season.  

91% get canceled after the second season.  

100% of those percentages I just mentioned were completely made up on the spot but they sound accurate.  

The real sad thing is they are so negligent with their actors that they use half these people were in totally different TV shows before they had any idea what was happening with a season 2 of Daybreak.

They had some great IP with Daybreak, lots of unique concepts that make the writers for The Walking Dead franchise look like imbeciles.(comic and games were on another level compared to the show)


But yeah get used to that with anything that's on Netflix if it's made by Netflix. Unless it's dripping with nostalgia or bursting at the scenes with a fantasy world that's just screaming for some dirty fan fiction kids are it's going to be canceled after one or two seasons. 


Edit: 

Here's a recommendation.  

Hunters on Amazon Prime is pretty good. Only two seasons but it looks like it was designed that way.  

Imagine Guy Ritchie got some cinematic ideas from Quentin Tarantino and they wrote a story about this group Jewish people in the '70s who brutally hunt down some juice that were given asylum or used false identities to melt in with the public in America... And we can't be having happy Nazis living the American dream now can we.  

2nd season just came out I haven't seen it yet but it is the last season and they knew that it was going to be the last season from what I hear they made it pretty good it's not like it just leaves with a bunch of cliffhangers again that's just what I read I haven't seen the second one yet."
Daybreak,I really liked it till the end when his girlfriend took control. He should have just kicked her the f*** off the platform if I remember correctly.
Daybreak,canceled? is it worth watching without an ending?
Daybreak,"I think there was too much zombie stuff released in the same time, I'm not sure. I remember not being interested in it/semi-interested at the same time, but I never made the click until about two days ago.

Definitely enjoyed the 4thWall-breaking style. Not sure how many episodes I got through, but I forgot I started that.

Cancelled Netflix, but still have some weeks left to view. Finished my last movie an hour ago and couldn't think of what to put on until this thread came up."
Daybreak,"I don't know who the audience was supposed to be. Its 80s throwbacks can't have meant much to most people younger than 40. But its characters were all annoying teenagers doing annoying teenager things, repellent to older viewers. Instead of having something for different groups and achieving a broad appeal, you seemed to need to fit right at the centre of a particular Venn diagram to enjoy it."
Daybreak,"I mean, this basically happens"
Daybreak,"> Isn't it great 74% of Netflix TV shows get canceled after the first season.  

> 91% get canceled after the second season.

There is zero chance that this is true."
Daybreak,"Yes, there's enough of an ending to make it very worthwhile.  The styles of the episodes are fantastic."
Daybreak,"Yes.  The major stuff tied up nicely.  There was some stuff that was left open but not a big deal.  And it was a good, enjoyable show but not so great that I'm that upset with the cancellation."
Daybreak,"That is definitely fair.  The zombie genre is and has been way over saturated for a while now.  

I agree, I thought the jokes and the style were just fresh enough to differentiate it.  I can understand how it didn't hit for everyone, though.  I am really into all horror from the greats to the cheese, and so I was a ready-made fan almost, hah.

Hope you enjoy it, might as well get the most of your account before it's gone.  If you have any recommendations of must watch shows on Netflix that are off the beaten path, let me know.  Cheers"
Daybreak,"Hey, to each their own, to me, it felt fresher than most of the zombie/apocalyptic shtick that was everywhere at the time.  I am quite a bit younger than 40, and the jokes were landing for me.  I am a big horror buff, though, and have watched tons of 80s through current horror so maybe that helped.  

You certainly aren't alone in your thinking as the show did bomb with the general audience."
Daybreak,"I'm in my 40s and enjoyed it. I didn't mind the ""annoying teenagers."" I thought it was an interesting and fun take."
Daybreak,"Also younger than 40 (I'm 30), but I basically grew up with a lot of 80s stuff thanks to my parents. I thought the show was great and fun. I watched it on a whim after initially writing it off initially due to zombie-fatigue."
Daybreak,"31, watching with my 57 year old mother.

We're both enjoying it, and she dislikes sci-fi, although I repeatedly force her into consuming it to wear her down.

It's fun. She's also worried about catching 'the gay', but hasn't seemed the least bit bothered by it in this show. It's just so casual, that she hasn't been bothered.

It's great."
Daybreak,Dan Harmon called Peacock the Greendale Community College of streaming platforms in a public interview days after they greenlit his movie. Fantastic
Daybreak,I hope John Oliver is available for a professor Duncan appearance
Daybreak,Jeff. *Winger.* You son of a bitch!
Daybreak,"Harmon:

>“I think that Donald is coming, based on word of mouth, but it’s just the deal isn’t official or wasn’t official. It would be difficult to really commit to doing this thing without Donald. So I believe he is coming back. I think if there’s names missing from a list, it’s because the names that are on the list, their deals are agreed upon enough that it’s OK to say they are on the list, and anybody that’s not on a list, it’s just not the case yet. So there is nothing official about anybody being out.”"
Daybreak,My emotions. MY EMOTIONS!!
Daybreak,*Troy and Abed in the moovies*
Daybreak,"If he doesn’t come back—and i know it would be controversial, they should just recast him. I know Donald was integral but i really think that they could get that childish gambino guy to play the role and it would be just as good."
Daybreak,That’d be nice.
Daybreak,I mean they always said the movie would always be up to Donald’s schedule. I know they always said like a joke but can tell they probably wouldn’t do a movie unless they had everyone.
Daybreak,*Daybreak Intensifies
Daybreak,"I really want Donald Glover to come back. I also really want Paget Brewster (Frankie) and Keith David (Elroy) to come back as well. They’re not currently listed in returning actors from what I saw but honestly they were amazing additions.

Edit: got Frankie’s actor’s name wrong despite attempting to google it beforehand 🤦‍♂️"
Daybreak,"I watched [this essay](https://youtu.be/vDIye1TeNw4) today that makes the case the most interesting duo on the show was Abed and Jeff, and he makes a great point. 
 
That being said, much like the Re-Pilot episode of season 5 they need to reestablish everyone to a place where they still can evolve in some way in the movie. It's not an easy task, but I am here for it!
 
I just hope we finally get to see inside a Dildopolis store."
Daybreak,"Everybody talking about Donald, but I really hope Yvette Nicole Brown also reaches a deal. She’s as integral to the show as Troy was."
Daybreak,"I hope he does.  Not only just because, but I think it would also show ""I don't think I'm too serious and cool for a goofy character"" type side.  I've watched that Fulkerson since Derrick Comedy and there was clearly a flip at some point.  Which is fine of course.  I just think returning to this type of role after Childish Gaminbo and Altanta would really show his humanity.

EDIT: Fucker autocorrected to Fulkerson and I was gonna change it, but I like it now."
Daybreak,It better. And I want to see a Pierce Force Ghost as well. And Duncan needs to show up as a recovered alcoholic that is now the host of a tv show
Daybreak,"Years ago Glover made this movie called Mystery Team and it is very, very funny."
Daybreak,In a really weird way….  I really want them to somehow get Chevy back for at least one scene…
Daybreak,[deleted]
Daybreak,DonG lover
Daybreak,TROY AND ABED IN THE MOOVIE
Daybreak,THAT WRINKLED MY BRAIN
Daybreak,"there's no way he's not in it, everyone in the cast kept saying for years that outside of funding the biggest obstacle was getting donald back. no chance they're finally doing it if he's not involved in SOME capacity."
Daybreak,This is that same John DiMaggio deal where they rely on the fans badgering him to do it until he takes less than he’s worth?
Daybreak,Cool. Cool cool cool.
Daybreak,"“Troy is back, he’s much more mysterious, far more attractive, and for some reason has Grammy and Emmy awards, but he’s back!!”"
Daybreak,"What about Chevy? Separating the art from the artist, Pierce was the funniest character and in my opinion the show never really recovered after losing him"
Daybreak,What about Chevy Chase?
Daybreak,"Gambino is a mastermind, fuck a bitch to pass the time"
Daybreak,Eli5: why would he not be able to come back?
Daybreak,"If it's not full cast (maybe even including Chevy Chase somehow), what's the point?"
Daybreak,*swallows massive grain of salt*
Daybreak,Donald Glover will be replaced by Chris Pratt playing Troy.  He is so cool!
Daybreak,"I want to see him come back, but playing Earn from *Atlanta*. The running joke is that everyone's confusing him for Troy, and he just thinks they're being racist as hell."
Daybreak,We really need Donald Glover imo. The show misses its heart without him. Its like the one scene where Troy walks in on everything on fire without him
Daybreak,it better!  What is a community movie without Troy and Abed in the morning
Daybreak,Anyone else thing Peacock is gonna fold before the movie is released?
Daybreak,"Just recast him with Danny Glover.







🎶 Troy and Abed too old for this shit. 🎶"
Daybreak,Bring Chevy back.
Daybreak,"I get donald glover is busy and all that, but it would honestly be a pretty shitty move on his part not to come back for a least a few scenes in the movie."
Daybreak,Any word if Frankie is coming back?
Daybreak,Guessing no Chevy though. They should just replace him with Danny Devito as Frank Reynolds.
Daybreak,You literally cannot have the movie without him it will tank big time
Daybreak,[deleted]
Daybreak,"I hope we get everyone but Chevy Chase. I mean EVERYOOOONE. 

(Although, if they do decide to bring Chevy back, I’d like them to do the whole Spirit Advisor trope - except he’s there to infuriate Jeff and call him gay)."
Daybreak,What about Chevy chase?
Daybreak,"They need to get Pierce back.... He was the funniest character in the show and really completed the group.

He could easily come back from the dead and say it was all a prank and can't believe how little they cared or something."
Daybreak,please add chevy even just for a few scenes it just feels different without the whole cast. they can put him in a flashback like walter white scene in elcamino
Daybreak,"*Community* is my favorite show of all time. I've seen it way too many times than I would likely admit irl Although I'm not the type of person to be an obsessive fan of anything, *Community* is the closest thing I have to me being one. I watched their reunions and table read which might a normal thing to do for the fan base but to me this is really going out of my way to do things.

So, forgive me if I get things wrong from being not being super involved and informed. The vibes I got from *Donald Glover* throughout the live reading was lack of enthusiasm. It seems to me like he felt obliged to do it but internally had moved on from *Community*. I get that he's successful and a busy man but *Ken Jeong* has a lot of things going for him too and I am assuming his schedule is tightly packed just as much as *Donald's* if not more. *Ken* not only showed up but he was excited and invested. He has a podcast thing with *Joel*. *Alison Brie* is also quite successful and had *GLOW* going on at the time of table read. It's not about even showing up per se. It's about showing up enthusiastically.

My take is for *Dan Harmon* and most of the cast, *Community* days hold a special place in their hearts and it's very likely that that's the most fun they had on any set. I am not getting that level of reminiscence and emotional connection from *Donald Glover* from the way he acts. Maybe he had better memories for his other projects like *Atlanta*.

If he decides to be in the movie, I want him to do it because he really wants to and not because he feels pressured by *Dan*, the cast and the fans.

Is it just me?"
Daybreak,Original cast or GTFO
Daybreak,I would much rather have Donald glover than Chevy chase
Daybreak,Any word on Chevy Chase?
Daybreak,What about Chevy?
Daybreak,What about YNB tho? I haven't seen anything about her returning and if that's the case it'd be a damn shame. She was the heart and soul of the study group.
Daybreak,Nah Chevy Chase would be the big pull.
Daybreak,"if they dont they should ask Childish Gambino, they look similar..)"
Daybreak,"BRING BACK CHEVY CHASE


He got a RAW fucking deal and somehow he's the one everyone hates."
Daybreak,Why are people so hyped by this? Every popular American TV show turned to shit the moment the execs got greedy and decided to make a needless film from it.
Daybreak,If it doesnt include them all then why do it
Daybreak,I can’t wait. #sixseasonsandamovie
Daybreak,Translation: If Donald’s ego will allow it.
Daybreak,Worst character in the show tbh
Daybreak,Him not coming back for the series finale was bullshit. Acting like he was too good to make at least an appearance.
Daybreak,I wouldn't even bother watching it if Donald glover isn't in it...
Daybreak,If Donald Glover isnt in it I don’t want it. Guy was the heart and soul of the show
Daybreak,If Chevy Chase is in the movie I will not go see it. I do hope they can get Donald Glover on board.
Daybreak,Surely he has a single day free somewhere where he could come in for a shoot. I'd be happy with 5 minutes of Glover.
Daybreak,Now that’s a man who know how to tell a lie.
Daybreak,You know what. I don’t care anymore. I’m knee deep in like a dozen more things. Shit or get off dudes
Daybreak,Troy is essential.
Daybreak,Thank God. I literally wouldn't watch it without him.
Daybreak,Donald Glover is an ungrateful dispshit if he doesn't come back.  His music is garbage and Atlanta is overrated nonsense.
Daybreak,"I can’t be the only one that finds Joel McHale opposite of funny. I couldn’t make it through 2 episodes. Does it get better and less focused on him? 

His follow up to Tiger King was so cringy. I can’t put my finger on it."
Daybreak,Today I learnt that Donald Glover is still alive
Daybreak,Donald Glover is the most overrated entertainer ever
Daybreak,"I liked Troy and Donald Glover when he was in community. When he went on his own and became a Kayne level idiot, I could care less if he returns and would actually prefer he didn't."
Daybreak,It's possible. We just need more answers
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Ugly Delicious was amazing so I'm excited for this
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",">	In other food TV news, Roy Choi and Jon Favreau’s excellent cooking series Chef Show will return to Netflix this fall with a new batch of episodes.

Also fantastic news."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Love chang's perspective and Ugly delicious was a great approach to examining food culture old and new. The satire bits were gold. Super happy to learn that chef show is coming back too.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Is that Gillian Jacobs?
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Is Chang trying to pay homage to Bourdain? The description of this show is close to what he did on his shows.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Netflix food documentaries are basically the reason I have it still
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","The caption for the photo is, “Gillian Jacobs and David Chang in ‘Ugly Delicious.’” So, maybe?"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Aww man, Britta’s in this?"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Could you recommend me the best ones?
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",I don’t remember her in ugly delicious
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Chef's Table - their most popular by far. docu series about high end chefs around the world and how they change food and make it into art (these folks are usually michellin star types). Lots of subtitles due to it being worldwide. 1 hour episodes that follow the chefs and their inspiration, origins, and creativity that goes into their food

Salt, fat, Acid, heat- Chef Samin explores 4 key pieces to cooking basics and different uses for them. also comes with recipes from her and her friends that utilize the key ingredient. 1 hour episodes I believe.

Ugly Delicious- David Chang explores food and the impact that it has on culture and community. Explores some pretty interesting concepts (Asian immigrants that have lived in the southern US for generations for example and the mixing of asian and southern cuisines). 1 hour episodes

The Chef Show- Jon Favreau and friends make food and talk about food and movies. Half hour episodes, but quite entertaining. also comes with recipes and tons of guest stars.

Cooked- Docuseries by Michael Pollan. Explores the role of 4 primary ways of making food and how different cultures use different methods for making food. 1 hour episodes

Flavorful origins- food from various regions of china and the ingredients that are unique to the regions. Short episodes with subtitles, and rather straight forward

They also have a ton of actual documentaries (there's one for soy sauce, whisky, and Sake for example) that I haven't gotten to yet, but are also really great."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Didn't she go with him to eat wings or something in LA?
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Somebody Feed Phil?
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Wow thanks so much. So much to look forward to
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Yes
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",They shoot for 16-18 hours 6 days a week so it’s easy to have an off night.  In addition the dinner service is a couple hours but they just show you the couple instances where they mess up.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Gordon forbids instant-read thermometers just because it makes for more drama.

Every kitchen uses instant read thermometers. They are a tool, not a crutch."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",[deleted]
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","The producers look for a very specific type of ""chef"" when they cast for the show, they are looking for people who have worked in and even managed professional kitchens but not actual fine dining. Also who have inflated egos and who overestimate their actual cooking skill, preferably with emotional maturity deficiencies.  These producers have figured out there are plenty such people working in food service, and that they the are the perfect set up for the exact type of drama they want to create on the show.

There is a huge difference between working in a run of the mill, ""nice but not fancy"" white table cloth kind of place, and working in a place that has a Michelen star type of reputation on the line. 

Don't get me wrong, all kitchen work is demanding and oftentimes just plain hard, but it really is a whole different ball game working at the highest level of fine dining, where you're expected to hold yourself and everyone around you to the highest possible standards in everything you do. It takes years to fully acclimate to that environment, and even then it is incredibly stressful, daily. In Hell's Kitchen they try to make people who imagine themselves to be seasoned pros and try to acclimate them to that world in a matter of days, and predictably the meltdowns ensue.

No, the episodes are not staged but the dramatic blow ups are highly engineered."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Its more that its edited to portray things a certain way
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","In the defense of Gordon Ramsay, I do feel as though some of the excessive drama is staged, especially in the latter seasons, but having been a line cook for most of my life, there is a BIG difference between most commercial restaurant kitchens and those of fine dining establishments. 

While I've only worked in hotel kitchens throughout the DMV, I did spend a week in an actual fine dining restaurant in New York and the level of service was on an entirely different plain of existence. 

Even with my experience, there was a much higher level of service and perfection wasnt expected, it was demanded and when I did make mistakes, they spiralled throughout the entire team. 

It was like being a part of a machine and having one bad rotation that then completely threw off the rotation cycle both metaphorically and literally."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I'm convinced that all cooking competition shows have producer gremlins. Someone who accidentally lowers or raises the temperature of an oven, removes a needed tool, or makes sure there's only one container of a necessary ingredient to go around.

Not exactly a script, but definitely a way to manufacture drama."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","This also seems a bit sped up probably. And a lot of these chefs are not experienced. Some are but others have only worked a couple years in kitchens. If you are throwing in the pressure, the speed, the lack of help I don’t know why you think people trying to compete with others would fail sometimes. You are also comparing a 10 dollar omelette which doesn’t even get checked probably to a 150 dollar steak which have to meet his standards."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",It’s real but manufactured competition to create tension and drama. So they don’t get all the tools and are deliberately placed in very difficult situations.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","* Dinner service apparently lasts a lot longer. Like hours while serving hundreds of dishes. The camera only catches the moments that they screw up.
* Different kitchen and appliances may play a role. You are cooking in a completely alien environment compared to usual, and even the same recipe can have wildly different result depends on the heat setting etc
* Lots and lots of pressures. Competitors are locked in a dorm with no Internet and ways to contact the outside world (understandable so they can not simply leak the results etc). They also can not contact their family. Accompanied with being bombarded by GR, it happened. 

Also I think it's part of the producer effects to specifically pick certain participants with high ego and what not."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",It’s not one service u see. U see a week or month of service and usually they have a couple thing of each of the chef to pick over. The whole idea is for tv drama but also works to see how bad each chef will get. It is still a job competition too
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I ain't no bitch, chef"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Trained on other menus, with more room for error, more options to correct mistakes, simpler dishes, etc...

Obvious the show is exaggerated for effect. Ramsey over-fixates on small issues because it makes good tv, but I still believe that not everyone knows how to make risotto, or properly cook Halibut. Working at IHOP doesn't teach you have to nail a scallop."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Yes, it's staged, in the sense that the people running the show manipulate the contestants, the situations, and the editing to produce the most drama.

Even though it's called ""reality TV,"" there isn't that much that's real about it."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Everyone here has mentioned the grocery list of reasons why it's likely staged. What I just want is for reality television to get its head out of its ass already with the kayfabe shit.

For those unfamiliar with wrestling lingo, kayfabe refers to staying in character. In the pro wrestling industry, it was standard practice up until the late 90s that performers had to stay in character in outside media as well as pretend any ongoing storylines are honest to god reality. Consequences could be severe for anybody who breaks kayfabe, as the industry was fiercely protective of the perception that pro-wrestling is a legit sport. Most people knew it was scripted, of course, but it was often hard to tell at times because nobody really knew.

That's where reality tv is at right now. We all know it's fake, but they still have their heads stuck in the sand pretending we don't. Get rid of all the stupid non-disclosure agreements where you can't talk about behind the scenes stuff even after the airdate. We know about wrestlers keeping razor blades in their wristbands, I want to know if the rumours of remote-controlled appliances are true."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","u/c_rookie - you want to address this? I wouldn't blame you if not, LOL."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I've always felt it was fake, or at least partially. I think there are two real candidates that Ramsay picks then the rest of the chefs are cast to fill a role, much like Big Brother. They add drama with fake scoring of team based challenges, I think a lot of the outcomes from challenges and service are all planned out in advance and they stage things to help the producers narrative play out. 

Just my personal feeling I get when I watch it."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","everyone is staged. Hells Kitchen isn't the worst but it is one of the biggest. 

Ramsey picks 2-3 out of the list of everyone, then they bring in the rest. Then they go though the show. All of the appliances are 'remote controlled' go with me here. They can turn the stoves off or put the temps in the pizza oven from 400-500 in a second. You see this a lot to build drama. For example scallops. Anyone can cook them but can anyone cook them when the stove get's cooled down without anyone noticing it or heat it up and watch the fire start. Remember, how the spaghetti pot sometimes isn't at a boil and Ramsey yells? Donkey the stove isn't even on but they said they remember it. Yeah. 

It's silly stuff like that. They are always watching on the cameras and after the two weeks, they make a show out of it. Sometimes Ramsey has to reshoot something or you can pick his voice when he has to redub something. Usually, his back is to the camera when it happens. 

Then there is the chaos of calling the tickets. Some of the non-three people have never worked a line in their life. Tickets get called and Ramsey knows which ones are confused... read it back and poof, drama. 

It's not like they can't cook. It's that it's cut on the floor to look like they can't. 

If you watch the food network shows they are better at it but silly stuff still happens. 

I honestly know about all the BS but I still love watching Hells Kitchen. Usually you can pick the top 2-3 out after the third or fourth episode but it's fun to watch them do the dance."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Tv fake? No way
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",It's fake. A 3cstar Michellen restaurant and not a single hair net
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Because capable talented chefs would make for bad tv. I think I stopped somewhere around season 8 when i binged.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I’m sorry are you seriously asking if a reality show is staged?

How stupid are you lmao"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",you can walk right? why arn't you an Olympic marathon runner? it's basically just fast walking right? are you the dumbest walker on earth? why can't you win an olympic gold medal in walking fast?

Modern culinary arts students study many different aspects of food.\[6\] Specific areas of study include **butchery, chemistry and thermodynamics, visual presentation, food safety, human nutrition, and physiology, international history, menu planning,** the manufacture of food items (such as the milling of wheat into flour or the refining of cane plants into crystalline sucrose), and many others.\[7\]  


>Does anyone know if the show is ridiculously staged or do they legitimately look for the worse chefs possible?

this is *next level competition.*. it's the exact same as any other ""bake off"" or ""fashion off"" or ""whatever off""..  the losing team in the championship is usually not the worst team possible.

&#x200B;

>There are ihop Chefs who can compete with busy breakfast and lunch rushes,

there are lots of people who play basketball all over the country.  very few are NBA starters.

let's not pretend **cooks** are the same as **chefs**.

perhaps you're not aware.. but in the Championship of restaurants.. (chefs only)

they pay people to go all over the ***world*** and eat in restaurants 275 days of the year.

NOT one is an iHop.

The North America inspection team is on the search for a restaurant inspector based out of New York City. What does the job entail? ""The MICHELIN Guide Inspector anonymously inspects restaurants and hotels for the MICHELIN guides and determines their suitability for inclusion in our selections in North America and relevant classifications."" **That means up to three weeks of travel a month and a minimum of 275 inspection meals per year.** (Thankfully the company provides fitness membership reimbursement to help offset all of that eating.)

these are all the First Place Winners.  The United States has 14 total. there are 142 in the world. they don't have a Grand Slam Breakfast. chefs spend their careers trying to get ""a ring""

"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","They require the cooks to make everything to-order, and eliminate a lot of shortcuts that any sane chef would use."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","All reality TV is staged to different degrees, some completely, some partially. Assuming Hell’s Kitchen is only partially staged you have to realize these chefs are learning a new kitchen, equipment, head chef, recipes, and stations while filming long hours and barely sleeping which helps nudge the drama along. Also, not all of them have experience in a high volume, busy restaurant. 

And don’t forget, editing can make you see whatever the show runners want you to."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","One-stress of competition. Two-working with those you really don't know, who are competing against you, in a kitchen not your own, doing plates, not your own."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I mean of course it's staged. When they do the challenges it always (99% of the time anyway) comes down to the last dish or whatever to see who wins. Really??? There is NEVER a blowout by one team??? Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the show but that aspect of it always irritates me on every episode."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","As with ~~most~~ all ""reality"" TV, if it isn't outright scripted, it's mostly staged and the drama and difficulty is contrived to be more than it really is."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I'd add that they are thrown at random stations and swap the menu constantly. Yeah, I can see how someone would make 2-3 mistakes over the course of a night (which is often enough to get sent home)."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Most reality shows follow the same basic rules:
- Select people with personalities that are considered aggressive or abrasive.
- Keep them stressed out and sleep deprived, or occasionally drunk, to keep emotions and simple mistakes at an all-time high.
- Give them tasks and give them a time limit that is extremely difficult to meet.
- Watch the TV magic happen."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","when  i bought one for the first time about a year ago it was a lifechanger.. is that pie done in the middle? Before I'd over cook things to 'make sure' and now i stab it, the pumpkin pie filling is 200F and i'm just like yup that's it."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",I remember he told one of the chefs not have one and I remember my girlfriend who was a chef at the time literally saying why? A lot of those things are pretty common now in steakhouses to save on waste. The touch and feel technique is more of a showman thing.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","This gave me a rage flashback. When I graduated high school my parents were pushing me pretty hard to do some kind of further education, so I picked cooking school. At the time the school was accredited and had a huge rep for being the Place to Go, but I had a really bad time there for several reasons. But I remember that our chef would have us make things like a genoise cake, and he’d tell us we couldn’t use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because “that’s not how real chefs do it.” (Wut)

Eventually I caught on that they actually just didn’t have enough mixers for all of us to use one and I started to get suspicious.

Anyway the environment was crazy toxic overall and I dropped out after about 4 months when my mental health absolutely tanked. My parents were maximum disappointed in me, but I got mad vindicated when the lawsuits against the school started rolling in a few years later, and it was eventually shut down after being repeatedly sued for its false claims about the success they could provide you with if you went there. Which made sense because they would get you internships after you were there for maybe 14 months, and when I quit I was working in a Papa Murphys, and a guy got hired at the Papa Murphys as his internship from the school."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I saw a recipe video of his a few days ago.  The dude was making pasta and said in the video ""first you start with the most amazing water"" and I was like I don't think hes really a chef."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","There have been some past contestants that've talked about how the producers did all they could to fuck with the contestants. Like keeping them standing around for hours while the get enough footage of the food, how they contestants were sleep deprived  so they were constantly on edge. 

Add in the idea that there's a single dramatic person that stirs up trouble that lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6, I wouldn't put it past the producers from telling Gordon and the others ""Keep this person around"" and feeding the judges small guidances. It's definitely not staged but it's definitely not some ideal situation where you just have to be a good chef."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","This is something the other main posts are missing. The episodes are heavily edited, and things are sometimes out of context, stitched together, and shown out of order. If you really pay attention, you can see that the dinner service footage is sometimes not shown in proper order, a lot of times to make it look like someone's reacting to something that happened they're trying to make look like was a big deal when it wasn't."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Does the DMV have good kitchens?  I assumed if anything it would just be cafeteria and vending machine food.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Its a 5-6 hour service that gets condensed into a 20-25 minute segment of the show. Pretty much all of the mistakes get put in the show and it really isn't a lot of them for the overall night but there is a ton of pressure to do good and Gordon really puts on the pressure for every single mistake. 

It's also very stressful because its so fast paced. The show is only filmed in a few weeks. The services are usually every single day, sometimes they skip a day but it's almost always all filmed within 5 or 6 weeks and they are working 12-16 hour days every single day"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I totally agree with you on this. Being from the UK, I often see the US reality shows and think how unrealistic and over dramatic they are compared to the ones produced over here. 

It was at this point when I realised that all ""reality"" shows film for 4 or 5 hours a day, and for a week, or a month. Then they just hand pick all the most dramatic and exciting/interesting footage that they imagine will keep people watching, you can imagine how much content ends up on the cutting room floor and how many times people have arguments or screaming fits at each other. 

Same with the talent shows on TV when they have the crazy nutjobs on, you know they were already aware of this before letting them on, so why do it? Just for views, much more interesting than boring people who are talented."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","I did a lot of restaurant kitchen work back in college and for a while afterwards, so I have a good idea of how the back of the house actually works. It amuses me no end to watch Hell's Kitchen because a lot of the contestants look like they'd struggle to make eggs and sausage for the family on a Sunday morning."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Even fucking Dr. Phil uses methods like this.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Exactly, just shake up the coke bottle til it explodes"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","That’s unsafe. You need the pumpkin pie to be over 212 for safe consumption.   You gotta boil that sumbitch

"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",">he’d tell us we couldn’t use stand mixers to whip the egg whites or yolks because “that’s not how real chefs do it.

Lmao I don't get why schools impose such artificial limitations on students. It's like a programming class that says you're not allowed to use code libraries. But in a professional industry time is money, and everyone uses a library if they can."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","> lasts the entire length of the show until the top 5-6,

that must be why in the final rounds it gets so professional"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","It's also been stated that the producers and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen, like turn off/change the heat on a burner/stove, hide ingredients, move things from where they left them, etc."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","He means the DC, Maryland and Virginia corridor. Not the Dept. of Motor Vehicles."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Considering I've worked in the cities of D.C, Baltimore, Alexandria and Hyattsville, I would say that assumption is entirely wrong. 

Several of the hotels and restaurants I've worked at in those cities have been highly rated and while not fine dining, the kitchens were rather well to do in most respects. 

I only jumped around because I cant sit still and being young at that time, I wanted to learn everything from everyone. 

Only reason why I remain at my current job is because I'm the only Black female chef there and I'm arrogant enough to say that I can cook circles around my colleagues."

"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",">and crew will outright fuck with them in the kitchen

Um, isnt there any sexual allegations in this regard? They should outright sue them because of this."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","DC, Maryland, Virginia."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",I think they thought Dept. of Motor Vehicles lol. As a Baltimoron myself most people that aren't from around dunno DMV🤣
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Oh…. I seriously thought you worked at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  Now it makes sense.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","It was a season 6 contestant, Tek Moore."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","Two contestants, Jen Yemola and Tek Moore, both stated that a lot of the drama was artificially created (and that Gordon Ramsey was fed lines through an ear piece).

But really, it's common in reality television."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","""fuck with them"" means mess with their heads - so if someone leaves the paprika on their station, someone on the crew will grab it and move it to another contestant's station, for example"
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",Corrected.
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner","You're fine mate, I really need to get out of that Marylander habit of not spelling out that acronym."
"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner",The idea of certain dmvs having high end fine dining is pretty funny.

The Gifted,"Season 2 was much better. The show got more interesting as it went on, but I think it lost too many viewers for Fox to keep it around."
The Gifted,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show and was sad when it was cancelled.

I thought season two was good but it ends with a cliffhanger."
The Gifted,"yes it's worth watching. If you enjoyed S1 then S2 pretty much improves on it(for the most part), but be warned it's much slower, and focuses more on character along with plot buildup. It doesn't really leave many loose ends, as towards the last few episodes they tie up as much as possible in order to set things up for Season 3(S3 was going to be very different from the first 2 seasons). I didn't really like the ending myself, yea shit goes crazy but it felt rushed and contrived, then again i'm somebody who liked the slower elements of the show when it focused on those Xmen themes, so your mileage may vary.

&#x200B;

btw, you'll probably get a better answer on r/TheGifted**/.**"
The Gifted,"It's a very average show.  I remember very little of it.

Season 2 ends with a strange tease for the future, but it wasn't interesting enough for me to be bothered that it'll never get resolved.  I remember the rest of the story being resolved enough though."
The Gifted,"The show never had the budget to do the story it was trying to do.
S2 was ok, but nothing all that spectacular.

None of the Mutants powers were really all that awesome.

The whole thing was just a big whatever."
The Gifted,"Season 1 was really good, but I thought Season 2 was awful."
The Gifted,"It was fun, ferdacast"
The Gifted,I liked it.
The Gifted,Season 2 following the Emma Frost clones was sooooo much fun. They should have made the show solely about them
The Gifted,I read it draaags over 16 episodes but when stuff went fish it was crazier. How’s the ending? Big cliffhanger? Or stuff tied off?
The Gifted,Man the amount of conflicting views on this show and its seasons in this post are crazy LOL.
The Gifted,Not really a cliffhanger. There’s a tease for a potential plot for future seasons but nothing interesting
The Gifted,"Ok, cool. Thanks."
The Gifted,The X-Men the Animated Series theme song ringtone was a cute touch. 
The Gifted,"""I will sue this school into oblivion."" Best line of the episode."
The Gifted,I guess some bullies did not watch *Carrie*. 
The Gifted,That bully should die for that haircut alone.
The Gifted,"I like that they're keeping the comic's ""mutie is the mutant n-word"" thing from the comics."
The Gifted,"It was a good pilot. 

A few standout characters and performances, like Lorna, Marcos and Lauren. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the CGI was.

I'm intrigued to see where it goes. Hopefully, the characters don't get annoying farther into the season."
The Gifted,"Alright, I like it. It's not Legion amazing, but it's pretty cool right now. Hope it doesn't decline and turn into some mess of a show. "
The Gifted,[deleted]
The Gifted,"So far, so good.

Well-paced. Decent acting from the teenagers--even the bullies did what they were supposed to, be wannabe-Crabbe and Goyles.

Looking forward to more.

Oh it's back."

The Gifted,This feels more like an Xmen comic more than the movies.

You know, Baron Von Strucker and all."
The Gifted,I can identify with Lorna. Stephen Moyer has been infuriating since his days on *True Blood*.
The Gifted,"wtf The anti-mutant force has the phone number of the leader of the underground mutants?

Overall, I really enjoyed this pilot. I love how there's no dumb family drama and instead the family actually communicates with and loves each other."
The Gifted,Stephen Moyer still looks like a Vampire
The Gifted,That ringtone!
The Gifted,DA NA NA NAAAAAAAA NA NA
The Gifted,The new iSentinel X looks pretty neat.
The Gifted,"Well, that was decent. Pretty solid, especially for network TV. What has me hooked more than anything is Matt Nix running this show. I loved Burn Notice. 

Here's hoping it stays good, improves over time and in a season or two I am loving it like I love Agents of SHIELD last season. For now, there isn't any character I am really latching onto to, and I am not exactly sure how much the premise (D-list mutants running a mutant underground railroad, running from Sentinels) will hold up. "
The Gifted,"Ok you guys this premiere was 5x better than that intolerable 2-hour Inhumans premiere. I mean of course it's a little unfair to compare them, since Bryan Singer directed this. Cast for this show is promising, those two kids gave excellent performances. I just love the feel of this show more.
Also, was anyone else annoyed by the musical score in Inhumans? It was very distracting to me and some of the sounds seemed ill-fitting to the scene. 
Anyway, looking forward to the rest of the season! "
The Gifted,"Well, I'm intrigued. Seems solid all around, and has potential going forward. I'll be back next week."
The Gifted,"I really liked the show. The family is very likable and tight knit. The kids especially are great. Not a bunch of whiny gen z types. 

Love that Jamie Chung doesn’t seem to age. She looks like she’s 17 years old somehow "

The Gifted,Who was that gal that got locked up? Was she one of Magneto's daughters? 
The Gifted,"So which of the many timelines does this show take place in, I wonder?"
The Gifted,"Man, this Carrie remake is really taking a lot of liberties with the source material. "
The Gifted,"Wait, was that fucking [Eye Boy](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Trevor_Hawkins_\(Earth-616\))?"
The Gifted,Really? Nice ringtone. 
The Gifted,Well so far I like this show 
The Gifted," i thought this premiere ep was excellent! when it ended i actually didn’t want it to end (which is a rare thing to happen with me and most tv shows these days). i could have watched more and more. everything from the storyline to the acting/actors to the pacing of the ep was close to perfect (also something i rarely say about tv shows these days).
my favorite part of the ep was Blink. the character was freaking cool as hell in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but wasn’t in most of the film. i’m glad she’s going to be utilized more/better in this show! can’t wait for next week’s ep!"
The Gifted,"Post credits scene was pretty neat and unexpected. For a second I thought it was an actual commercial. 

I liked the episode but I'm not sold yet. A little dull and I didn't really connect to the characters that much. But I'm going to stick with it a bit. "
The Gifted,Funny how in a show about mutants I was actually most impressed by the robots. Those little spider things were legitimately threatening. Normally that's where weak CGI would poop all over a show.
The Gifted,"This might be the Logan timeline? X-Men disappeared= Professor X killed them all? I wouldn't mind having TV X-Men like how we have Tv Flash and movie Flash. Would be nice for them to be in the show. 

Logan timeline would be depressing because everyone being dead and knowing 99% of these characters will be dead from infection in a few years would suck."
The Gifted,That was a nice normal family argument. 
The Gifted,Will give it 3 episodes to try if until then it doesn't grab me not for me then
The Gifted,All this made me want to do was watch Heroes season 1 again.  It was decent and it has potential but to me it seemed like a worse version of the first episode of Heroes.  
The Gifted,Got to love zero tolerance policies!
The Gifted,"Feels really, really weird rooting for a Strucker. 

THAT RINGTONE!

It's so refreshing hearing the x-men mentioned and Mutants, just wish the MCU could do the same. "
The Gifted,Logan timeline or House of M shit?
The Gifted,Stan Lee!
The Gifted,[deleted]
The Gifted,Why even bother borrowing names of existing Marvel characters if they aren't going to have anything in common?  P.S. Blink was my favorite: cool eyes and flashy powers.
The Gifted,Really enjoyed this more than i thought i would
The Gifted,It was pretty good reminds me of that short film Stephen Amell did think it was called Code 8
The Gifted,"Booooooooo I couldn't watch this live, really wanted to. Liked it, didn't love it, but hey, Stan Lee! That ringtone! Amy! All good things. Can't wait for next week. Hope we get more Polaris."
The Gifted,"Pretty good pilot, much better than Gotham's pilot. And now it's got me interested in Legion"
The Gifted,"Missed the first few minutes, what was the story with the woman who could control metal? "
The Gifted,Damn cops always make everything worse.
The Gifted,"ctrl+F ""X's Lounge""

Disappointed, internet."
The Gifted,The ending was like the A-Team for mutants.
The Gifted,I can't unsee Marcos as Oscar Isaac 
The Gifted,What's with the color grading on this show? It's distracting
The Gifted,Garret Dillahunt is back on TV!
The Gifted,Not bad as long as they keep the cliche's and random family drama(like when the blonde girl whatever her name is just started crying about some random thing that happened years ago with no context beforehand while explaining how she was a mutant to her mom. That was basically just drama for the sake of drama) 
The Gifted,"I personally think that Super Power v Super Power(Mutant v Mutant) shows will always be better than Super Power v Humans shows in terms of the level of intensity and quality of action in them. However, for what it's worth I thought this was a solid opener despite not expecting much beforehand and debating whether or not to even watch the show. I definitely think it deserves the chance to be explored some more so i'll give it another chance next episode.

In terms of my opinion about the two different types of antagonists mutant shows have, I would say that for example although this show is good I think a show like Legion is just on a whole other level because well for one; the scales of how powerful people are but more importantly two; it's realistic in portraying how the government shouldn't be able to pose a threat to people as powerful as David Haller and also it is much more suspenseful to see mutants fighting eachother because there's a lot more of that ""what could happen feeling"" rather than when I watch the latter-style shows it's more like ""how much can they really do"".

"
The Gifted,"So...Lorna being that age in the current day?

You GET IT, Sir Ian!"
The Gifted,"I liked the pilot, hopefully it doesn’t get too predictable as usual with these kinds of shows"
The Gifted,Not as good as Legion but pretty entertaining. Good first episode.
The Gifted,"So correct me if I'm wrong. This show exists in the dofp timeline right after mutants were outlawed. And before sentinels became the big world destorying menace? That's why blink is in it but as a rookie and thunderbird the first as well?

Or is it more akin to the Logan timeline which would explain why mutants are currently outlawed and the X-Men are nowhere to be seen. Also would explain that it was the mutstn underground who was in contact with x-23 and the other kids and help them across the border

I'm lost"
The Gifted,I couldn't watch this live. Is it any good?
The Gifted,Way way better than Gotham. 
The Gifted,"I get a very Heroes'esque vibe to it. There's a lot of parallels. The high school setting, the families, Claire and HRG. With the father hunting other mutants but protecting the daughter.  And the son is the overpowered mutant (Peter Petrelli) but doesn't know yet how to control it."
The Gifted,[deleted]
The Gifted,"The pilot was okay.  Okay enough for me to keep watching for now. CG was so so, the spiders looked cool but the abilities looked a little cheap especially the shield.

Actors are okay-ish some better some worse. both teens were good but the women who got caught in the beginning was pretty bad.

Story wise I really liked the whole Sentinel service idea.Ill keep watching and see where its heading once the first storm has withered because we dont really get a feeling of where this show will be heading. I dont think they can do the whole on the run thing forever. I also hope they dont turn this into a save the mutant of the week kind of show but I dont think so."
The Gifted,"Is there a continuity with Legion, so that you must  watch Legion before watching this?"
The Gifted,So didnt really explain why the Sentinel guys have so much authority. I know its classic a x-men gov agency but yeah...
The Gifted,"I'm wondering if this show replaces the events of the present in DOFP movie. Instead  of the super sentinels from Mystique's blood, it is a less severe but still deadly future for the mutants. Kind of also what they explained would happen to the timeline in DOFP."
The Gifted,"Just watched the show. Not bad at all. As others have stated it reminded me of the comic back in the day. 

To those who seem concerned with which timeline this is in, don't put too much thought into it. Infinite universes infinite Lorna Dane's infinite Ricks. This could have any number of interactions with other characters from the other TV shows/movies and still be set in its own timeline. 
"
The Gifted,"This was a completely different show than I remember the trailers presenting it as. They showed it as a fairly boring looking domestic family show about dealing with the issues of finding out one of their kids is a mutant. This was like a proper X-men show, much better than I was expecting. "
The Gifted,"The biggest complaint I have about this show is the name. Maybe I'm just getting old, but I keep forgetting what it's bloody called. Took me far too long to find this discussion thread.

Other than that I thought it was a good start, and I'll be giving it a go."
The Gifted,Bryan Singer loves screaming characters. 
The Gifted,The hideout looks like where Doctor Strange’s cape was. 
The Gifted," I'm so excited they're having Sage in this! She's such an awesome yet obscure character, and it's nice she has some role in a show. "
The Gifted,Put the daughter in a bikini and you will have a hit.
The Gifted,That. Was. Amazing!
Love by Chance,They picked up Tuca and Bertie so why not?
Love by Chance,"It sucks as I thought it was one of the better animated shows on Netflix. Really liked the last episode with Reagan having to decide on what to do. One of those emotional episodes that hits you, like Futurama's Jurassic Bark.

I do think the show was marketing poorly, I recommend it to friends who love shows like Rick and Morty and they had never heard of it.

Would love it to get picked up elsewhere.

I've read this is going to happen a lot now, as Netflix management are going to start operating more like a business, apparently looking cut back on their spend on shows and being brutal on cutting shows."
Love by Chance,"It would be a great fit for AS or Hulu, I really hope it gets a second life somewhere. I think AS is owned by Warner/Discovery though, and they've been absolutely brutal lately too."
Love by Chance,I don't see why not. Hulu and Amazon are also probably contenders.
Love by Chance,I can't imagine Warner Brothers Discovery picking up anything at this point.
Love by Chance,"I hope someone picked it up, love this show. Decided to check it out when the first part came out and instantly knew I would like it. Was heartbroken when I heard the news that the second season got canceled."
Love by Chance,"I hope so! I think it'd fit in well on Adult Swim (assuming a certain somewhat doesn't swing the cancel-hammer on it like he's done to a ton of other animated shows). There'll be comparisons to Rick and Morty no doubt, but I think the show has a separate enough identity that it can work. I won't get my hopes up, but I would be very happy if this news was revealed."
Love by Chance,If rumors are to be believed; they're in communication so anything is possible
Love by Chance,They did that before Discovery and Zaslav rolled in tho...
Love by Chance,"If I paid for Netflix, I would consider not paying in protest."
Love by Chance,[deleted]
Love by Chance,">If rumors are to be believed; they're in communication so anything is possible

Link?"
Love by Chance,"Facts, you got a source where you hear they are in communication ?"
Love by Chance,"So people are asking you for a link/source, I’m guessing you don’t have one, right?"
Love by Chance,Do a quick google for precisely *why* Tuca and Bertie got cancelled.
Love by Chance,"I mean that’s gonna do jack shit once if you think about it. If everyone who bought Netflix for inside job cancelled their subscriptions, it wouldnt even do a dent in the amount they make from other shows."
Love by Chance,Oops Warner Brothers Discovery.
Love by Chance,"French adult swim said they would look into it:

https://twitter.com/RikrioTastroff/status/1613146841226289152

but I think the IJ team is already looking for new work"
Love by Chance,"You're confusing it with when the show was first cancelled by Netflix in 2019. Back to Inside Job in 2022 - WBD is not in the market of buying shows, they are even selling what they've produced for themselves."
Love by Chance,"I think this has enough sunk cost to go till season 4, and then promptly get canned."
Love by Chance,"The two can easily co-exist and don’t seem to cover the same material.

The movies probably won’t be out until the show’s final season if not later."
Love by Chance,"I mean...yeah? What is the head of the studio supposed to say otherwise? She'd be fired if she was doing interviews, claiming the show was doomed and everything is a disaster."
Love by Chance,>And then something happened that the ring did not intend.
Love by Chance,"Does anyone know how well the series is doing?  I don't ever see it talked about, a la The Last of Us or The White Lotus."
Love by Chance,"Literally everyone when Lord of the Rings movies came out, even my mom who would never in a million years read the books or any other fantasy genre stuff: Did you see Lord of the Rings yet? You HAVE to see it.




No one at all, even the most hardcore fantasy nerds I know: Did you watch Rings of Power?




I had to google the title of that TV show to write this, that should tell you how that shit show is going.


Edit:  I get it's not completely without fans, but to act like it's in any way a hit is insane. It cost an astronomical amount of money to make for a show no one will remember in 5 years. It's an undeniable failure."
Love by Chance,Who else peaced out of Rings of Power forever the second that Galadriel tried to swim back home from elf heaven? That has to be one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes ever committed to film.
Love by Chance,"Remember when every episode included at minimum one speech per episode, each less inspiring than the one that came before it? It was like a reverse Bill Pullman from Independence Day, it was kinda hilarious, even the people listening in the show looked bored every time."
Love by Chance,No Jennifer you don’t
Love by Chance,"And that's coffee all over my laptop. Thanks, Jennifer."
Love by Chance,"Warner are going to have for fantasy lotr on film and GOT on tv if it all works out.Good combo. I hope they do get to do the films and it turns out great. Plan it out properly.

Also hoping the dune 2 and dune sisterhood hbo max shows are great and a hit.

Amazon will be fine either way. I know the show is a bit hated in these parts but its a solid base so far. They can definitely up the pace and improve on what they have built.  At the very least the budget, production values and Score will carry hard. Amazon in general seems to be going hard for big shows recently with fallout, possibly god of war, mass effect and blade runner all coming later."
Love by Chance,"Fan love? Do they mean actors paid to look like fans?


This show is an insult to Tolkien and actual fans."
Love by Chance,I'm curious to see if Amazon will retrench ROP to be... good?
Love by Chance,yea maybe she should be fazed cause that first season was hot garbage
Love by Chance,"The producers of RoP are still trying to pretend it was a success? I wouldn't say it was the biggest flop recently, but it absolutely failed"
Love by Chance,"Genuinely surprised at the hate this show got. It was definitely in my top 10 seasons of last year. 

It wasn't perfect, of course. I found the ""Mordor"" text reveal super jarring and out of place. I thought the first episode and the finale were weaker than the rest of the season. 

But overall I found it really beautiful, exciting, and different!"
Love by Chance,"Anyone ever think about, I don't know, coming up with an original fantasy setting for movies or TV?"
Love by Chance,"
The show was so terrible that the new movies can only help. People will get excited about the world, will want to see more, and will put up with the shows terrible writing and character development."
Love by Chance,"Do you though? 

RoP had good number 100% because of the franchise, if you just make bad content that will not last indefinitely. Kinda like Star Wars."
Love by Chance,"Oh, yeah. Everybody *loves* your show."
Love by Chance,"> One of Salke’s defining moves at Amazon was to secure television rights to the same literary works, which she achieved at great expense. **The first season of Amazon’s “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power” premiered in 2022 with** a big global marketing push and critical acclaim — as well as **a reported budget north of $450 million for the first batch of episodes.** Previously, **Warner Bros. pushed out two massively successful film franchises with auteur Peter Jackson beginning in 2001. Those films grossed over $5 billion at the worldwide box office** and brought home **a best picture Oscar for one of the entries.**


> **“We’ll see,” Salke told Variety when asked how much “LOTR” would be too much for the market.** “We love our original series. We’re extremely proud of it, and invested long term. So, we definitely think there’s enough fan love to sustain ours for a long time.”"
Love by Chance,Watching this right now really really hard for me to get past episode 3 but gave it another try and now I’m liking it. It’s not perfect or anything but it’s entertaining
Love by Chance,The problem with the show isn’t that it has competition it’s that it’s not that great
Love by Chance,Huge lord of the rings fan. Rings of power had its issues for sure but I fucking loved it.
Love by Chance,Still think it was stupid to have us wait 2 years for season 2 rather than film 1+2 back to back and have the wait for season 3
Love by Chance,Glad to hear they are sticking with it. I really liked the rings of power series. Slow burn but loved the buildup to the finale.
Love by Chance,"Not anymore, I expect.

But I guess time will tell."
Love by Chance,"The way the narrative is stuck in slow motion (season 1 was basically entirely backstory) I wouldn't be shocked if season 4 was the big climax anyway, with 5 planned to be all falling action"
Love by Chance,By the time season 4 comes around I can guarantee the thought of canning the show won’t be in consideration at all
Love by Chance,"I think that their line of thinking is: ""*We are still better than Zazlav*""."
Love by Chance,As opposed to being fired because the show IS doomed and everything IS a disaster.But that's Hollywood: failure goes UP.
Love by Chance,"I feel like on the scale of ""The Witcher"" to ""House of the Dragon,"" the public is lumping it more in the Witchening camp. 

I don't think it's anywhere near that much of a lost cause, but I do think it'll have work twice as hard in season 2 to convince people otherwise."
Love by Chance,"According to Amazon 4th Quarter Results, It was viewed by 100m individuals with a watch time of 24 billion minutes.

[Source](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2023/Amazon.com-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-Results/default.aspx)

How that relates to expectation or Subscriber growth they didn't go into."
Love by Chance,"It's Amazon's most watched show ever, but that's not exactly a high bar and the network has been cagey as to its actual numbers. They've spent far too much money into it to cancel it. Unless someone on the inside leaks, we'll likely never know."
Love by Chance,Well those are newer but I'd say it's been a dud as far as entering the public consciousness goes.  Amazon butchered both rings of Power and the Wheel of time shows imo.
Love by Chance,"It’s terrible lol. Terrible writing, super slow pace to start, and the story feels randomly slapped together. They made Galadriel as a naive stupid girl instead of the wise badass elf that she is supposed to be. Overall terrible show for people who love Tolkien’s work."
Love by Chance,"It's apparently their most watched show and is beating things like The Boys, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, or Jack Ryan which all did decently well so I'd say it's doing pretty well."
Love by Chance,I watched a couple of episodes right after seeing the LOTR extended editions. The gulf in writing and acting quality was huge. Reacher is the best show on Prime for me and it likely cost less than the costume budget for Rings Of Power.
Love by Chance,"It was the only non-Netflix show, along with The Boys, to make Nielsen's annual top 15 streaming list.  It's a huge hit for Amazon (as the hated The Terminal List and The Wheel of Time are). 

This sub has serious problems accepting that the opinion here is not necessarily validated by real data. Just like twitter, this is a closed bubble. Possibly this comment will disappear with negative votes, but the reality is that it was as or more successful than House of the Dragon and The Last of Us. 

No one was more successful than Yellowstone, though (another truth this sub can't stand)"
Love by Chance,"I feel like reddit is weird when it comes to shows.  Reddit hivemind either hates a show or loves it.  Sadly I feel like reddit disliked ring of powers more than liked it, so the only time you would hear about it on here is if it was something bad."
Love by Chance,"That was my thought as well. People that don't know much about LOTR or could care less about anything other than it being a fun story probably watch it. 

From what I've seen, it is the people that grew up loving the LOTR books, talking to their friends about the lore, anecdotes about Tolkien and CS Lewis, WW2, Elvish...those are the ones that hate the series with a passion, but that group is probably pretty small."
Love by Chance,"My nerdy friends and I talked a lot about it, from admiration to criticism to speculation.

Get out of your bubble, man."
Love by Chance,"I remember there were lines all the way out of the cinema for the LOTR films, every session was full in a way I haven’t seen in a long time. I think the original avatar was the last time I saw similar"
Love by Chance,Haha spitting facts up in here! I 100% agree
Love by Chance,"2001 when streaming platforms didn’t exist and social media was a tiny fraction of what it is today

2022 when there are dozens of entertainment outlets all producing quality IP every single week"
Love by Chance,I was literally asked this weekend if I'd seen it when I met up with some old friends
Love by Chance,You being out of touch tells us nothing
Love by Chance,Our whole family loved the show. There’s a lot of people outside of the Reddit circle jerk that feel the same.
Love by Chance,[deleted]
Love by Chance,Part of me was wondering WTF were the writers thinking. But then I realized that they weren’t thinking and are just terrible.
Love by Chance,"To me, that scene is emblematic of one of the show's worst issues: fake tension.

There are so many scenes that are shot like something that's supposed to be tense, but what's going to happen is so painfully obvious and it's dragged out *so much*.

It's the beginning of a ten hour show and we know Galadriel is around in LOTR, of fucking course she isn't going to leave Middle Earth and she's going to jump off the boat.

So many scenes like that, where they shot it like a tense moment but you 100% know what's going to happen because you've seen movies before and/or it's a prequel to one of the most famouse stories of all time.

Like the elf guy getting the orc blade close to his eye. OMG, what is going to happen to this main character? Oh, he was saved a moment before being blinded? No shit.

Are they gonna make the three elven rings? They are? No shit!

Is Galadriel going to join Sauron? She isn't? Who would have thought!

Rings of Power is so painfully bad.

Edit: Added thoughts."
Love by Chance,"That horseback riding scene just took me out, and not in a good way. I have a handful of episodes left to watch but I just can't be bothered."
Love by Chance,"Idk, I can imagine an elf not having too much of a problem swimming long distances.

I didn't really have much issue with the show. I watched maybe six episodes and then kind of forgot about it. I keep meaning to finish it but just haven't been bothered. The thing is, it just never had much of a hook besides being LOTR. The entire time I was... Whelmed. It was just very mid-tier."
Love by Chance,"I watched the whole thing but she is the more unlikable main character ive seen in a while, by the final episodes i was actively rooting for someone to kill her"
Love by Chance,"So funny, that's exactly when I stopped watching."
Love by Chance,Yep that’s exactly where I noped out
Love by Chance,[This scene?](https://youtu.be/gIrIK6Z8ybg)
Love by Chance,"when you start with the rock and ship one it can only get better, in theory. Then you have Galadriel's amazing rendition of one of George Formby's best, ""You have not seen what i have seen when I'm cleaning windows"" and you just want to burn the world to the ground"
Love by Chance,"They are indeed going all in on genre shows but I hope they really get some good writers/showrunners. Their last attempt Peripheral had a huge budget but absolutely middling writing that completely let it down. I don't understand how skimping on scripts in mega budget shows helps. I really hope they get better because most other streamers, including HBO, are backing off of many big budget genre shows."
Love by Chance,I'm an actual fan and I quite enjoyed it. Read through the main series every 2-3 years and have read The Silmarillion twice.
Love by Chance,"I'm a Tolkien fan, a stupidly obsessive one with the reddit history (complete with pathetically obscure Tolkien reference of a username) to prove it and I like it well enough (not all of it, eg anything Sauron was a big meh, but enough) ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Didn't even get a Kit Kat. Fuck off with the 'actual fans' gatekeeping twattery."
Love by Chance,"> I found the ""Mordor"" text reveal super jarring and out of place

that made me laugh pretty good. the guy asks a question and just walks away as if he saw the title and got his answer.

Felt like a video game cutscene moment"
Love by Chance,"The show is gorgeous. The music is great. The acting is fine. Just the dialogue and plot are terrible. 

Really the show should just ignore everyone else and follow the elf and the dwarf. The only cast members with chemistry and fun to watch. Make them meet up with the other characters on their journey."
Love by Chance,I'm not surprised but the hate people hold towards any show like this is genuinely weird.
Love by Chance,lol why would anyone downvote this comment?
Love by Chance,"Fantasy is an absurdly expensive genre to produce, especially with audience expectations these days that TV shows should look just as good as movies.

Not much chance of studios dumping hundreds of millions into projects that don't have built-in audiences or name recognition."
Love by Chance,because audiences don’t care as much about original IP
Love by Chance,"It’s bizarre, it’s super slow in most parts, but then they skip past the creation of the rings in like 10 minutes."
Love by Chance,"The show is planned for 5 seasons. So, yes."
Love by Chance,"We'll see. This is not even unique to this show. Almost no huge budget streaming genre show has gone past 4 seasons, 5 at max. And I really doubt this will break the trend."
Love by Chance,"You know this show will probably outlast Zaslav's term at WBD, lol."
Love by Chance,Alex Kurtzman has just entered the chat
Love by Chance,"a female boss getting fired? Not going to happen today, and certainly not on Amazon, the most diverse and inclusive place in the universe according to themselves"
Love by Chance,I wonder if they actually care about subscription gains like the rest do. It’s an entirely different value proposition.
Love by Chance,"Clarkson's Farm had higher viewing numbers in the UK than Rings of Power. The UK being the birthplace of Lord of the Rings.

I love this little fact."
Love by Chance,"... except it's not. First two episodes were, and then viewership tanked. It didn't even make the Nielsen Top 15 streaming shows of 2022, and was number 15 in Top 15 Original Streaming BEHIND The Boys at number 11."
Love by Chance,Do you think it is potentially an awards show contender?
Love by Chance,"I liked wheel of time more, but that’s probably because I haven’t read the books"
Love by Chance,ok
Love by Chance,"I think starting the story on a Galadriel who has been shaped by the Great War is a interesting idea that actually kinda fits in with Tolkien's own life experience. But for that to work we needed to also see the Galadriel we would come to know within the character and their writing just didn't have the nuance to deliver that. Galadriel is allowed to be impulsive and angry, but she also needs to be able to access a sort of grace and instead she is unlikable and rude."
Love by Chance,Wasn’t the boys the most watched Amazon original last year? Maybe I’m misremembering the title of the article.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,This was a great read.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Delta state was the shit!
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,It was on both actually
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I'm so glad shows are resuming production!

  
SPN wraps for good next week, though, which makes me a little sad."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I did see filming happening downtown Vancouver the first week of August, on the steps of the Art Gallery. I wondered what that was..."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"In a perfect world, Aaron Sorkin would do a Star Trek show about Federation politics.  Literally a Star Trek: West Wing show."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Ages ago I watched a tv show called The Bermuda Triangle.  The premise was simple.  A group of passengers on a boat get lost in the Bermuda Triangle and every week end up in some weird alternate universe.  This was late 1970s - early 1980's so the special effects weren't great and I'm sure the budget was pretty limited.  I think with today's budget and technology you could make an excellent series with that premise. I think rather than week by week, I would keep each season in an alternate universe for the sake of telling a more interesting and developed story. 

Second thoughts:  Watching The Great has me thinking there are a lot of historical dramas and comedies we could be exploring - lost Roman legions wandering through Spain or Britannia, Vikings in the New World or some Native American centered stories."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I'd like to see a story about a boy and his dog who roam through the countryside doing good deeds and drinking beer.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"More portal fantasy type shows, or shows where characters are suddenly in a strange situation and cut off from others. Kinda like alice in borderland, the society, under the dome, and Gone by Michael Grant. I love shit like that"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Modern day Cassandra (prophet in The Iliad who nobody believes.) Could go a lot of directions with this. Most obvious would be some kind of police procedural where she knows who committed the crime but no one will believe her, so she has to resort to creative and morally questionable means to see that justice is done. As she gets closer and closer to crossing the line, she must contend with doubt over whether her gift is really accurate or she is simply delusional. The situation becomes more complicated when she meets someone who actually believes her… or at least claims to."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"* When **The Hateful Eight** movie was coming out. I thought it was gonna be **Clue** but in a cabin in the snow. It wasn't.

But I think that would be a good miniseries. People dying left and right till only two remain. Mystery. Short and sweet. Be fun.

Or something in general like Clue. People arrive and slowly there are fewer ;)"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I would like to see an adult animated reality show series similar to Drawn Together, but I'm a competition for a big budget reboot. The competitors would be the 90s TMNT superhero shows like Street Sharks, Mummies Alive, Biker Mice, Skeleton Warriors, etc. Want to see what they were up to since their shows ended, what they villains have been up to, whether or not the teams even want a reboot."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I’d like to see the Wicked series of four books turned into a miniseries. The author did such a great job of expanding the Oz culture and showing its adult side. Not an adaptation of the Wicked musical, but rather something more faithful to the books."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I want to see a comedy series about a ghost hunting show, where the ""hosts"" truly believe in ghosts, and the show is about their producers and production crew keeping up the act.

Like, you have the crew shaking the hosts' tent at night to make them think it is being accosted by angry spirits."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,What if the Chosen One doesn't want to?
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I'd like to see a reboot of Sliders or anything else that involves people going through different dimensions.

More historical shows that aren't based on the same exact properties or historic figures.  Give us historical romance that isn't Jane Austin.  A royal historical fiction drama taking place in Ancient China (Wu Zetian's story is crazy) or Africa.  A story following a soldier or officer and their family who moved from war to war in the 1700 and 1800's when England (and the US) was basically at war with someone all the time, sometimes multiple countries (A British officer going from the American Revolution to Waterloo)."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I think Wild Wild West could be readapted for streaming or cable tv, big weird sci fi steampunk western buddy action comedy with lots of gadgets. Find a balance between cases of the week and serialized story elements, do better than the movie."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Alternative History: Confederates win the war - either a Confederate US or a US/CON dual-state scenario set sometime after the war has concluded. 

Or Germans win WW*1* alternative history.

---

Sleepless is a noir novel. I have not read, but:

""Set in California in a dystopic alternate present, the novel portrays a world wracked by a sleeplessness pandemic caused by a prion. About ten percent of the population are infected, and, unable to find sleep, die painfully within a year. Society is on the verge of breakdown, and armed bands have turned much of the U.S. into a war zone.""

----

I'd also like to see Equilibrium, or the weird emotionless-type society given a TV series. That concept required more thought than could be condensed into a 2 hour movie. We could skip the gun-fu too."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Isekai Cartoon except main character is believed to be the prophesied destroyer of worlds.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"a show about the leadup to the French Revolution (1789) - it would follow Louis XVI & Marie Antoinette, Robespierre, Danton, Necker, Lafayette, and of course Napoleon.


or a couple season show following some members of the French Resistance



An anthology series following the different animals in war - Wojtek, Sergeant Stubby, Rags, Cher Ami, and others.


A show about Tammany Hall.


A show about the Carthaginian Wars, focusing on Hannibal Barca and Hannibal."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Maybe it's just me, but I really want someone to revive/reboot the unique and insane mixture of Western, Spy, and Science Fiction (perfect storm of '60s tv genres) that was *The Wild Wild West.*"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I want to see a Mass Effect TV show, mainly, but we're apparently getting that.

For revivals, I would go with a new Columbo series of TV movies, where they get Steve Carrell to play Lt. Columbo and make him look like an absolute idiot... only to completely destroy the killer's case and show he's only faking it."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I'd like to see another show like the Americans, loved the premise, didn't love the execution"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Not really a premise, some shows with asexual main characters would be nice. 

I've always wanted to see a well done drama about a Japanese internment camp. But it just seems American media has so little interest in this dark period of history. There aren't even many movies about it."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"if I had billions I'd make a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen show covering every damn chapter to the very end, exactly as its written, no boxes to check and no sugarcoat. Extreme, but awesome"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I'd like to see an adventure show where the consequences for each character are based on a dice roll like in a roleplaying game. So the writers are determining what's going to happen to each one and suddenly they roll a critical against the main character and then he does a 1 etc.
  
Too bad, you'e no longer in the show. Talk about uncertainness!"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"So I remember Walking With Dinosaurs being on the BBC when I was younger. I've thought a lot about that, narrated like a nature documentary, but with cgi dinos. 

And I've thought about companion pieces to big franchises, sci-fi or fantasy, that are like... Nature documentaries in fictional worlds.

In the Star Trek universe the planet of Berengaria is apparently home to creatures not a world away from classical Earth depictions of dragons... So I'd love a miniseries along the lines of ""Star Trek: Dragons of Berengaria""

And it's hybrid drama/mockumentary, of a team of Federation xenobiologists exploring Berengaria's wilds, chasing down and producing a nature documentary on these creatures."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Show following the Wars of the Diadochi. Cast Alexander for one episode and have him die in the pilot. Then just follow the historical narrative after that. It's a pretty balls to wall, game of thrones sort of clusterfuck. Plus you've got lots of interesting characters to cast: Eumenes, One Eye, Perdicas, Ptolemy, Olympius, Antipater, Alexander's sisters and half sisters, etc."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"we need more tv show natural disaster series 

also an accurate anthology series depicting moments in US history...every one is extremely cheesy or has Alec balwdin as the narrator"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,A show where first cousins fall in love and date but they have to deal with the taboos in their family and society.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,There never been really good or accurate show on the American service industry. The closest we’ve gotten is waiting (always sunny and below deck honorable mentions).
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,[Long March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March) historical drama.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Murder Mystery set in Medieval India. I'd like to see someone solve a mystery without using any tech or scientific knowledge after the 1400s.India because personal bias
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Oh yeah, I'd love that. If for nothing else to explain exactly how politics works in the Federation.

My favourite version is the idea that each planet has its own governments who they elect and generally get the final say on what happens on this particular planet, but from them they chose  representatives who serve in the federation government and from whom the president is elected."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Star Trek would be the perfect medium for Sorkin to do his idealistic shtick instead of the real world where we know better.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Already made a test pilot:  The Expanse.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,how about a show where the Aztecs land and colonize Europe?
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I assume you've seen the magicians?
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Have you seen slasher on netflix? There's a season that's like that
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Clue could easily be an anthology type series. Each season can feature a new cast and a new mystery. But that's similar to what Rian is doing with Knives Out right now.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Check out Wellington Paramormal! Not exactly what you want but very funny.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I would love to see that, but I've come to accept the Wild Wild West could only have come out of the sixties, a time when science fiction, western and spy fiction was loved in equal measures."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,The adventures of Brisco county jr was very very good if you’ve seen that
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"> Alternative History: Confederates win the war - either a Confederate US or a US/CON dual-state scenario set sometime after the war has concluded. 

HBO was gonna make that show but got cold feet after Twitter had a shitfit."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"> Alternative History: Confederates win the war - either a Confederate US or a US/CON dual-state scenario set sometime after the war has concluded.

That'd be a pretty interesting concept. Like the early 1900's with the country still split between the Union and Confederacy and slavery still being legal in the south."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I really don't know why this hasn't been made. It's such an incredible story. You can throw the Haitian revolution in there too
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"One ace is/was on HBOMAX’s Generation, more of an ensemble tv show than singular lead. Cancelled however had a good run, enough finality to recommend."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Have you seen the terror?
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Check out Harmonquest.. kind of what you are pitching. Maybe a bit too literallyan RPG, but you get fun animation and acting to go with the dice rolls."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"There’s a show called “Noughts and Crosses”,which takes place in England several hundred years after it was colonized by Africans."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Read my mind, I was even thinking WWW should have Carlton Cuse as a potential show runner because of his great work with Briscoe County Jr."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I remember the shitfit, but I don’t think that’s what canned it. D&D’s Netflix deal closed in 2019, which basically ended the show."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Why didn't Twitter have a similar shitfit to Man in the High Castle or Plot Against America?

Wait until they hear about Babylon Berlin S4"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Are you referring to the War of Northern Aggression? /s
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Harry Turtledove writes some good alternate history fiction.  Guns of the South was an interesting take on an alternate Civil War outcome.  His work would probably be slaughtered in our current 8-10 episodes per season formats.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"D&D were were tapped to do it, but ultimately it never happened

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_(TV_series)"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,which one
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,How about Briscoe County The Third? And his nemesis/partner prince fedora.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,I almost forgot that those two circus monkeys were involved with it.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,What Netflix shows have come out that was produced by that D&D studio?
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Because the US has an ugly, complex history with slavery and that legacy is still felt today"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,The War against Goddamn Yankees
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Guns of the South is a great book but it does have the problem of glossing over the crimes of the confederate leadership. On the other hand his southern victory series has the confederacy ending up as bad as the nazis. So your miles may vary on how delicately he handles the topic.
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Sorry, French revolution."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I’d gladly take more. Trying to think of any tv stars who have the chin to play Briscoe the third, Enver Gjokaj maybe or somebody younger."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Nothing yet,but they’re producing “The Three Body Problem” for Netflix. I don’t think they will be writing any episodes though."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"And so does Germany with the Nazis. We still see Babylon Berlin, Downfall and many nazi-era stuff.

A Confederate alt-history show would be genuinely interesting."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,it would be so good
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I was gonna say luka from community and then googled that name you wrote. We are clearly on the same page. 

I could see maybe a bookem woodbine or a Morris chestnut type as the lord bowler character."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I don’t think you comprehend that the issue of **race** in America is a fraught one. With conservatives pushing back against things like [Critical Race Theory](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05) and disproportionate police brutality on people of color still happening, it was very tone-deaf for Weiss, Benioff, and HBO to consider it."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"in The Plot Against America good guys still win in the end tho, the difference is that the show is a bit more vague about it than the book.
 
so in TPAA ""alternative history"" basically is a 3 year hiccup."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I think that being able to explore themes regarding the crimes of the confederacy in a pseudo modern context could potentially add to the discourse surrounding such a fraught topic. Shoving it under a rug won't help anyone .In hindsight Weiss and Benioff probably don't have the tact, or knowledge in general, to pull it off. But that doesn't mean the premise doesn't have merit."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"I would still watch a Confederacy victory alternative history series, and I would still support one being made."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Babylon Berlin will get grimmer and darker.

And Man in the High Castle is pretty bad.

I also would like to see a Russian language serial based around the Revolutionary period ie: Babylon Berlin style, and the idea of a prospective show not being made because people might protest and boycott that is sad."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"you know what i would like to watch? that show Aaron McGruder pitched as a response to HBO's Confederate. 

> Hailing from Peabody winner Aaron McGruder (The Boondocks) and Will Packer (who’s produced everything from Straight Outta Compton to Girls Trip to the recent remake of Roots), Black America takes place in a world where the North won the Civil War, but the process of Reconstruction resulted in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama being given to freed slaves, who formed their own nation, New Colonia.

https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/1/16076200/amazon-black-america-hbo-confederate-civil-war-alternate-history"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Yup. That sounds cool too.

Did you think I would be a hypocrite and object to that?"
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"no, just every time i hear about that show D&D were developing, my mind gets set on *Black America*."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,Hooch is crazy
Mighty Little Bheem: Diwali,"Every official announcement/trailer.

The Yard,Mirror?
The Yard,"""Not available in your country"" 
Its a good things there's 3 channels that do have it in my country."
The Yard,"You really need that versatility in a sex rock.  You don't want to be fumbling around your rock drawer trying to find the right rock while making love.  Get yourself one, maybe two nice multifunction rocks that can handle any style of love making."
The Yard,YESSSSSSSSSSS
The Yard,Easiest way to watch in Canada?
The Yard,Should I watch the series or the movie first?
The Yard,Why would anyone geoblock a trailer?
The Yard,"i hate it when you guys post trailers from the official FX channel, they are blocking it everywhere, even with VPN i can't watch wtf [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klm17jMPacc) is a working one for everyone else"
The Yard,Bat! 🦇^🦇 ^^🦇
The Yard,Taika Waitiki is absolutely fantastic.
The Yard,"And fucking Emily in Paris is nominated for Best Comedy?

The Yard,"Not just today, it's in my best comedy of all time list, probably even in the top 5. 

It's up there with Community and Arrested Development for making me laugh out loud through multiple re-watches."
The Yard,It’s possible that I’m beginning to like this show more than the office…
The Yard,Collin Robinson finding a rival in the office is maybe my favorite comedy storyline ever.
The Yard,"I just watched the I.T. Crowd for the first time, I want more goofy humor and Matt Berry! Gonna rewatch WWDITS now"
The Yard,The writing and acting are brilliant
The Yard,"Can’t in Australia , isn’t available on prime"
The Yard,"Are s1/s2 anything like this promo? Because I found this promo to be the most forced farce I've ever seen which completely takes me out. I would have thought based on the reviews it would be more organic, but maybe this promo is just a one-off?"
The Yard,"Serious question, I tried watching this, I think second episode had the main cast riffing local municipal politics and I just couldn't get into that kind of humour. Does it get better or it's same overall?"
The Yard,"Just regular, boring human Jackie Daytona?"
The Yard,I can't get enough Matt Berry. So glad this is coming back soon!
The Yard,Jackie Daytonaaaaaaa
The Yard,I never learned to drive a car. Which is a shame because that thing cost a fortune.
The Yard,"All Americans need to jump on the matt Berry bandwagon, he's got another show coming soon set in the USA. He's incredibly famous over here"
The Yard,"Season 3 has another episode in that vein, but it won't be Jackie Daytona."
The Yard,"If I learned anything from Flight of the Conchords, it's probably Australia fucking with you guys."
The Yard,And filmed in Toronto
The Yard,"Doesn't matter where the director is from, it's produced by an American company. I do find it silly to block trailers though."
The Yard,"Do you mean Jackie Daytona, regular human bartender?"
The Yard,"I'm looking for a vampire named Lazlo, owes me money. 

Sounds like a wacko, a real son of a bitch. 

If I find anything out I'll contact you  Jim the vampire

The Yard,"Movie first, then series. Prime you right up for when S03 comes out."
The Yard,There is no real connection between the movie and TV show other than concept.
The Yard,Season 4 pre production starts in a few weeks.
The Yard,Mockumentary
The Yard,"there's two seasons of a TV show, too!


go enjoy"
The Yard,"Honestly the show is just as good, Jemaine Clement is a genius"
The Yard,"If you enjoyed the movie, you will love the show. The characters are far more developed and interesting IMO."
The Yard,It was always on Hulu.  Are you thinking of Wellington Paranormal?
The Yard,Yes
The Yard,"yeah.. I didnt really liked the beginning, but it quickly turns into being great and constantly funny"
The Yard,"The first few episodes are pretty much the same jokes from the movie.  Then after that, it becomes its own glorious thing."
The Yard,You didn't laugh hysterically at the Werewolf fight at the end of the second episode?
The Yard,Fu-king guy...
The Yard,Colin is my favorite because the shit he does reminds me of people I know and it really is fucking draining.
The Yard,"No Guillermo, only vampires"
The Yard,"The Dream Team, baby!"
The Yard,"Colin is definitely a ""grazer"" type feeder. Always taking just a little to keep him in peak performance."
The Yard,not for me. (NZ)
The Yard,"Absolutely, might have to take your advice and do another rewatch myself before S3 starts!"
The Yard,Absolutely. I slept on this show for too long. Then binged it and was so upset there was only two seasons. Hyped for the new one now.
The Yard,"It's a show by Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords, who also made and starred in the film version. You can see his humor all through it. Flight of the Conchords is right up there on this list too (I'd also add The IT Crowd)."
The Yard,You and me both! Community and Arrested Development are two of my all time favorites as well.
The Yard,I love those shows. What do you like about this show?
The Yard,"If What We Do in the Shadows goes beyond 3 seasons, i hope the quality stays eveb, unlike the 2 shows you mentioned"
The Yard,Mentioning Community and Arrested Development is not a great way to get me to watch this show...
Interior Design Masters,Is it as wholesome as The Great British Bake Off?
Interior Design Masters,I'd say it's more like Trading Spaces but with a competition element thrown in. The judges can be a little bit snarkier but they're usually not saying those things right in front of the contestants.
Interior Design Masters,"""Don't say GoT, hate it, can't stand it."" Really lol. You're not making this easy ya know.

If you like that type of set design (regal looking) then I suggest the following:

- The Crown
- Rome
- Medici: Masters of Florence"
Interior Design Masters,Mad Men. It sometimes hurt to see other period pieces now.
Interior Design Masters,Westworld 
Interior Design Masters,"> Medici: Masters of Florence  
How is it?
"
Interior Design Masters,Now this is kind of embarrassing; I actually haven't seen much of the show yet to honestly say but the sets seem pretty regal and that's what the OP was looking for.
Interior Design Masters,"That's sort of consistent with the impression I have of her from listening to her commentaries on the GoT DVDs. She doesn't sugar-coat her opinions to the extent that most actors and actresses do, which is refreshing."
Interior Design Masters,I really like Lena Headey even though I've never seen GoT. She's done a lot to fight against partial closure of one of my local hospitals. It's great she hasn't forgotten where she's from :)
Interior Design Masters,Can confirm. Haven't gotten any roles lately due to lack of flirting.
Interior Design Masters,Shame shame shame

Interior Design Masters,"I was a personal assistant for an former a list actor for 2 years and he said to any young girl that asked for advice was ""don't end up on your knees in Weinsteins jet"" and he was only half joking. "
Interior Design Masters,It's okay Lena. You were born to leave a mark on the world as Cersei. And you certainly have. 
Interior Design Masters,"There's a documentary called [""Searching for Debra Winger""](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318049/) in which [multiple A-list actresses](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318049/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast) tell variations on this story, over and over again."
Interior Design Masters,"I remember reading an article a few years back that Megan Fox had to ""flirt"" with Michael Bay to get her role in Transformers by washing his car in bikini? Lena's revelations isn't all that surprising, it seems as if the nature of the industry still hasn't changed much."
Interior Design Masters,"“There are a lot of vipers in this industry, people who only have their own interests in mind... You all grew up with Savile — Jesus, it must have been devastating... There is a darkness in the underbelly — if you can imagine it, it’s probably happened.”

Interior Design Masters,Have you seen her in Dredd?  Have you?  That women absolutely destroyed that role. 
Interior Design Masters,She is a total badass. Her characters in 300 and GoT are amazing.
Interior Design Masters,"Well good for her but truth - Hollywood probably doesn't care. As a small time indie filmmaker, I can put out a casting call and have so many responses to choose from - and that's a low budget short film. I can only imagine what it's like to be an established producer - unknown or first time actors/actresses don't stand a chance in the system."
Interior Design Masters,She's such a brilliant actress that I almost hate her because of Cersi Lanister... But then I remember she's acting 
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,"No way.  The worlds of acting and modeling couldn't possibly be shallow and largely focused on sex appeal, could they?"
Interior Design Masters,"My girlfriend is a model and aspiring actress and this just makes me feel like shit. 

Edit: thanks for all the great advice everyone "
Interior Design Masters,She should name names.
Interior Design Masters,"My girlfriend works as a line producer and had a director essentially say ""sleep with me or you're fired"" . She left the project that night. Being a woman in film is fucking terrible.  "
Interior Design Masters,While I don't like Cersei I sure as hell like Lena Headey.
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,">that Hollywood casting directors often choose female cast member based solely on their sex appeal as opposed to acting talent

Was there ever any doubt? Almost every woman on tv, in movies, and on news programs is pretty. Did anyone, ever, think that was a coincidence?"
Interior Design Masters,I just realized that Game of Thrones has two Sarah Conners.
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,So you're saying that Megan Fox and Jessica Alba isn't talented actors.. dammit here I thought they got chosen for their acting skills.
Interior Design Masters,A lot of women and men are forced to sleep with sleazeballs in power in Hollywood to get roles and it's absolutely disgusting. It's definitely sexual abuse and some kind of action needs to be taken against it. 
Interior Design Masters,Then she did the right thing. Get the roles that she can actually work for and f*ck those Directors.
Interior Design Masters,"Me too, Lena. ME TOO."
Interior Design Masters,Came expecting game of thrones drama left happily disappointed.
Interior Design Masters,The casting couch is a real thing. 9 out of 10 A-listers most likely took a mile of dick before getting put in a decent role.
Interior Design Masters,This thread is unbelievable. You guys think getting employment should have a sexual component? Norm or not that's degrading as fuck.
Interior Design Masters,"I wonder when Ms. Headey said ""flirting"" she actually meant ""fucking.""  

Casting coaches exist.  

Maybe not to the extant they once did.  

I remember hearing a story from the 60's when a Miss (forget which state, but middle America,) was supposed to be on Hollywood Squares, or a show like that, and she came into the room and laid on the coach and asked something like, ""When do we start?""  

If I remember correctly, the guy was gay, so he laughed and said, no need to do that here.  

One thing that will get you roles, or lose them, is nudity.  

Too many examples to name for females.  "
Interior Design Masters,"""There’s a real pressure on women to be beautiful and skinny""

Yeah, because Chris Pratt totally became Star-Lord by remaining overweight."
Interior Design Masters,"So uh this pedophile stuff, how do we fix this? Kill all the baby boomers and restart society please."
Interior Design Masters,This thread makes me sad.
Interior Design Masters,"> Headey, best known for her roles as Cersei Lannister on Game of Thrones and Queen Gorgo in 300

Please, Judge Dredd is her #1 role."
Interior Design Masters,"This title is slightly misleading and mentions nothing about Lena being happy about it.

>When asked if she thought not flirting with directors ever cost her a job, Headey stated, “Yes, and I’m very happy I didn’t.”

"
Interior Design Masters,I'm glad she landed the role of Sarah Connor. She nailed it!
Interior Design Masters,Good god these comments are terrible.
Interior Design Masters,She will always be Sarah Connor for me. Terminator s.c.c ftw.
Interior Design Masters,"Unfortunately this is not the least bit surprising. Hollywood has been notoriously perverted and unfair to women for its entire existence. I'm glad Lena Headey was able to take a stand and still become well-respected and fantastic actress.

Sexism still persists everywhere and it's beyond fucked in this day and age. We all know better and it just keeps happening."
Interior Design Masters,"Just had a thought. It's really hard to draw the line between genuine friendliness and acting like a professional co-worker. 

Some will see that friendliness as them taking advantage. And those who do stay stoic towards any of their superiors or even under them. Others will maybe take the friendliness seriously, and that usually helps those who do act like them. Be it as a act or it's just how they are, friendly people, there is usually a high chance they get a step up than those who refuse to act that way.

I know that in the acting industry, it usually is the latter. Sadly... 

Sigh. Humans are such fickle beings. "
Interior Design Masters,ITT: casual sexism
Interior Design Masters,Certainly seems flirting would help an attractive woman's case - as it does in every other aspect of life.  Not sure how you could specifically identify that as the reason roles were lost though.
Interior Design Masters,"Its ironic that her character in 300 had to sleep with that traitor dude in order to get Sparta to go to war.  But props to her, fuck the managers, directors, and anyone that prays on young adults trying to make it in Hollywood. "
Interior Design Masters,The insecure male is in my top 5 worst people in the world.  
Interior Design Masters,But she got GoT
Interior Design Masters,Shame! Shame! Shame! (ring ring)
Interior Design Masters,"""Look at this. Look at what they make you give."""
Interior Design Masters,"The bad news is: She lost roles cause the directors were shallow assholes.

The good news is: She doesn't ever have to work with directors that are shallow assholes.

Conclusion: worth it????"
Interior Design Masters,"Not surprising...I remember an interview with Milla Jovovich where she says she wasn't originally the main character of the Resident Evil movie series. It was only after she spent an entire night ""talking"" with the director that it was rewritten. The director and her ended up getting married.

Doesn't take much to connect the dots."
Interior Design Masters,"How does she know that's the reason?  Sure, the casting directors may take those tapes home, but I think it's a bit presumptuous to say *that's* the reason she didn't get a role."
Interior Design Masters,Drop dead gorgeous - with principles.  Good for her.
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,So she's implying that her colleagues are getting jobs because they flirt and she's not getting them because she doesn't. How does someone quantify something like that. 
Interior Design Masters,"How does she know she lost the role for that reason could be the casting director didn't like her or her audition
"
Interior Design Masters,I wonder if any male actors have been turned down for not putting out. Riddle me this; Why wasnt Danny Devito cast as The Amazing Spiderman? Hmm?
Interior Design Masters,I guess I'll take her word for it then? 
Interior Design Masters,It couldn't possibly be that she just had some bad auditions.
Interior Design Masters,"Yes, I am sure it has nothing to do with the other actors also being very talented."
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,"Yeah, well she also got really rich playing a role that she got in large part by being attractive and super sexy.  "
Interior Design Masters,"Nothing to see here, just another reddit thread filled with people making excuses for sexism. "
Interior Design Masters,So the directors really expect her to be Cersei Lannister lol
Interior Design Masters,Felicity Hartford-Fuckwell?
Interior Design Masters,Tell me again why she can't be near Bronn (Jerome Flynn)? 
Interior Design Masters,"""says"""
Interior Design Masters,"I believe this article to be very well written.

I did not get the feeling that the directors were trying to obtain sexual favours from actresses for personal gratification.  I didn't read it as ""Scummy guy wants hot girl to be cute and sexy for him or she doesn't get the part, period."" I got ""Directors knows that that kind of appeal is almost a requirement to get people to watch, so he has to look for it in casting.""  Definitely possible to lose roles for not doing that.

That is the struggle and frustration they're talking about.  Acting I presume can be one hell of a dirty profession, and maintaining professional decency while also knowing you have to excuse fuckability and relatableness, and how well you balance the two affects your career... that's some tough shit."
Interior Design Masters,I feel her pain. I too was denied because I didn't put out. 
Interior Design Masters,That title is a bit misleading lol
Interior Design Masters,"No way, Hollywood is sex driven?!"
Interior Design Masters,"In other news, water is wet."
Interior Design Masters,Title is misleading AF
Interior Design Masters,"Having rich parents and/or connections is far more important to getting major roles than flirting with directors.

Not saying it doesn't happen and there isn't corruption and taking advantage of people in the acting industry.

However, in a competitive world like this where you can barely make enough to get by or make millions the desperation, fear, and panic in lesser known actors make them easy targets.

Sadly the majority will never say anything about this, since anythings worth it to land that dream role and up your career.

Lust, greed, corruption aren't just things that exist in the GoT's universe, but in ours as well."
Interior Design Masters,[deleted]
Interior Design Masters,"I can guarantee that other actresses who have lost roles to her think they didn't get the part because they didn't flirt like Lena did.

"
Interior Design Masters,"Their loss. Besides game of thrones I thought she was great in Dredd. I dunno how much she was paid to do the scene in Game of Thrones where she walks naked through a crowd throwing shit at her but I just thought ""Goddamn thats brutal to do."" That just looked like it took some actual guts to do."
Interior Design Masters,Luckily the roles she has landed have been some of the most badass female roles of the past few decades.
Interior Design Masters,Tough shit.
Interior Design Masters,Tough to prove a negative
Interior Design Masters,hollywood is and has always been skeevy
Interior Design Masters,Yeah. I've lost business opportunities for not kissing ass. Seems it worked out well for both of us in the end. 
Interior Design Masters,"I can't remember who, but I recall reading an article with a male actor saying similar things about directors for them as well. 

Like when a director is telling you all about they're ideas in pre-production, they expect you to be like ""Oh man, that's *really* smart!"" and ""That'll be *so* cool I can't wait to see how it looks!"" even though they're not doing anything particularly innovative. 

They're really just getting the actor/actresses to stroke their ego, but I can imagine if the star doesn't play that game they'd say they weren't enthusiastic enough about the project."
Interior Design Masters,it's treason then. 
Interior Design Masters,"Choosing actors on their sex appeal is one thing, creating a hostile workplace is criminal. Coercing young people into sex is grounds for being ground up and extruded onto a sesame seed bun."
Interior Design Masters,But I enjoyed her nude and would be more if she used more slang language while doing sex with jaime
Interior Design Masters,"You people defending hollywood directors for sexually manipulating young women and men are the reason these fucking creeps get away with it.

You do know more than a few of them are pedos, right?

""Oh that's just how Hollywood works""

you know what, go fuck yourselves.

edit: at least a few people have downvoted me for saying pedophiles are bad. the ghost of violentacrez lives on."
Interior Design Masters,"File this under ""NO SHIT"".
"
Interior Design Masters,"I'll laugh when this is another ""news"" story in 20 years, or 40 - if I'm still among the living.

Do people honestly need reminding? You give someone power to decide the fate of other peoples lives, if it is in their best interests they will abuse that power - whether for profit, sex, ego, or more power. 

I feel sorry for all the talented people out there - NOT just the film/model industry that are abused by this. Nothing I can do about it though. Sad"
Interior Design Masters,"> There’s a real pressure on women to be beautiful and skinny.


So what?


There's a real pressure on men to be handsome and low body fat too. That is why Jack Black didn't get cast as Thor. Where's the outcry against the pressure against men as well?"
Interior Design Masters,"""The difficulties women face daily in Hollywood""

It must be hard being beautiful and getting paid millions and millions."
Interior Design Masters,"Its kind of disturbing that so many of the comments in this thread are like, 'Oh yeah, that's just the way it is if you want to get ahead' instead of 'this is terrible - what can we do to improve it?"
Living with Yourself,"Seconded - we binged this pretty quickly, it was good!"
Living with Yourself,"I loved the ""cliffhangers"". A lot of shows are guilty of cliffhangers at the end of an episode, but the clever way they start the following episode still sticks with me since watching it. A very well done show that is less than 3 hours total, so it's pretty much a long movie in episodic form."
Living with Yourself,"It was a solid show and Paul Rudd was great, as usual. I think I read Netflix just quietly canceled it, probably because not enough people watched it.

Also Aisling Bea is hilarious - check out This Way Up on Hulu (which was renewed for another season) or the fifth season of Taskmaster where she was a contestant, for more from her!"
Living with Yourself,The Tom Brady situation is fucking hilarious it would explain a lot.
Living with Yourself,"Not many people have seen his movie They Came Together, and almost everyone I know who has seen it either hated it or stopped watching it. I, on the other hand, think it is one of the funniest movies ever made and is my favourite performance from Paul Rudd. His comedic timing is perfection in it and it is way over the top stupid. Making fun of romantic comedies on another level."
Living with Yourself,Our Idiot Brother on there is pretty great.  Dude from the Lemonheads directed.
Living with Yourself,"Jeff Winger:

To me, religion is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it."
Living with Yourself,I thought it was well worth the watch.  Shame it disappeared into obscurity.
Living with Yourself,The show was fantastic and I’m really sad it didn’t take off. Would have adored a second season.
Living with Yourself,"This was an ok show but it needed a bit more work on the 3rd act.  Wife goes from being grossed out to wanting him out , to automatically getting aroused by him over a webpage.  Better Premise and better movie than this with  similar premise.  Look for Michael Keaton's 
""Multiplicity""  from 1996, it is one of the funniest comedies of his."
Living with Yourself,Didn’t care for it at all.
Living with Yourself,It could and should have been a movie.  It’s pretty slow and doesn’t need to be longer than 2 hours total.
Living with Yourself,Unfortunately it just didn’t quite stick the landing. So there was no real excitement for a second season.
Living with Yourself,I actually couldn't finish it. Didn't think it was that great
Living with Yourself,"Wow, I feel like I see every Netflix original at least 100x in the catalog but I have never seen this one since it came out. Weird af."
Living with Yourself,Watched it when it came out. Hilarious. Spoiler.   Love when Tom Brady  comes out. Hahaha and the fight in last episode.  Waiting for more
Living with Yourself,LOVED this but for me the final episode just totally shit the bed. Great show until then!
Living with Yourself,Aisling Bea is charming as well though I mainly had only ever seen her comedy. This role was a lot more serious for her at least for the first few episodes.
Living with Yourself,This show made me adore Aisling Bea!
Living with Yourself,I wish they had a second season!
Living with Yourself,Holy shit totally forgot about this show. Definitely recommend a look.
Living with Yourself,I liked this show! It had Russian Doll vibes with Paul Rudd charm.
Living with Yourself,"is there any cliff hanger at the end, I don't want to watch something knowing that there isn't going to be a second season"
Living with Yourself,"Even if you don't care for Paul Rudd, the show is just amazing as a sci fi short series. It really answered a philosophical question I had."
Living with Yourself,"I thought it started solidly, but got a bit weaker by the end. Still enjoyed it. It was not what I expected, though, so I think Netflix marketed it poorly."
Living with Yourself,Funny show and great performance- I'd note though that everyone's Netflix is different. Netflix is unlikely to recommend or promote this title to you because you've already watched it. This was promoted on my girlfriend's Netflix a month or so ago. Prompted me to keep watching on my account.
Living with Yourself,Completely forgotten about this show. More than half way through and it just stopped being interesting.
Living with Yourself,"I thought it started off strong, sort of fell apart by the ending episodes, and didnt deserve/need a second season.

But it's worth a watch."
Living with Yourself,I feel like it’s so difficult to act with yourself. Like you have to act while no one is there and then do the same thing again from the other angle. It’s such a difficult task and not many actors can pull it off. Legend with Tom Hardy had this exact problem and it was pretty awful.
Living with Yourself,"Counterpoint: this show was okay but never delievered on its premise and abandoned its more interesting potential plotlines. Rudd and Bea are pure charm in most circumstances, but they had all the joy sucked out of them by the execution."
Living with Yourself,It was so good! I had honestly forgotten all about it but I remember loving it when I watched it. Paul Rudd is insanely talented. Great watch
Living with Yourself,"I loved it, except for the segment in Episode 7, I think you know what I’m talking about. It was a jarring comedic tone shift. Otherwise great story and acting"
Living with Yourself,Just binged this because of this thread. Great show. But the ending was anticlimactic for me. Not sure if they wrote it expecting a second season.
Living with Yourself,Does he say “look at us” because if he does I am in.
Living with Yourself,"If you like Paul Rudd, you'll love him in this clip from his latest movie:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5le9sYdYkM"
Living with Yourself,My wife and I say the same thing. Any person that isn't in board with Paul Rudd isn't the type of person we want to hang with.
Living with Yourself,Why is there so many Reddit boners about Paul Rudd lately?
Living with Yourself,huuuh? My buddy and I love paul rudd but this show is such an awkward departure from his usual comedy. it was awful.
Living with Yourself,I couldn't finish it
Living with Yourself,This show was a victim of Netflix's release policy of dropping everything at once. Everyone who binged it talked about it for like 3 days then it was kind of forgotten about
Living with Yourself,Not everyone likes Paul Dudd.
Living with Yourself,">I had a hard time finding it even when searching for the exact title.

You can praise something you like without having to resort to these lies"
Living with Yourself,Paul Rudd has the most punchable face in Hollywood
Living with Yourself,Are they going to make a season 2? I feel like Season 1 was awesome but it is mostly a big setup for what could be a really cool premise to a series.
Living with Yourself,Dont do it! Its a cliffhanger ending and netflix will cancel it!
Living with Yourself,Waiting for the second season
Living with Yourself,My brother despises Paul Rudd because he saw him on the streets of NYC and Rudd refused to wave. Now my brother leaves the room whenever I put something on with him in it.
Living with Yourself,honestly I cant even watch Paul rudd's shit anymore because people on reddit suck his cock so much.
Living with Yourself,I dont like Paul Rudd. So dont assume everyone likes him.
Living with Yourself,Don’t know who that is
Living with Yourself,"I’d check it out if it wasn’t paywalled by yet another streaming service.

I’d just like to buy it. But you’re forced to pay a subscription just to watch one show."
Living with Yourself,"Paul Rudd is one of the most consistent, solid working actors. He's been in SO much stuff."
Living with Yourself,The wire is great to slowpoke
Living with Yourself,Paul Rudd also killed it on Hot Ones (you tube show) Never knew that guy can crush spicy food.
Living with Yourself,Did they not do season 2 yet? I loved this show but had since forgotten about it.
Living with Yourself,My wife and I just didn’t care for it.
Living with Yourself,"Your post reminded me that I had watched this a couple years ago. It was easily binged, but ultimately felt really forgettable - sorta emphasized by the fact that I had forgotten about it until I saw it mentioned just now. I remember wanting to see the ending, but ultimately just kinda going ""Huh"" and moving on. IIRC the last episode was sort of anticlimactic? Obviously  it didn't leave much of an impact on me, either positively or negatively. I definitely wouldn't call it ""an amazing comedy drama"" or say it had ""superb performances,"" but it's enough to hold your attention for a while."
Living with Yourself,I forgot I watched this
Living with Yourself,I only lasted 2 episodes. It was abig time snoozer : / Rudd was good tho
Living with Yourself,I didn't like it.
Living with Yourself,I loved it.  No second season?😫
Living with Yourself,Already have. Still waiting on season 2
Living with Yourself,Now tayne I can get in to
Living with Yourself,"Was so good, I think I watched everything in two sittings."
Living with Yourself,I like Paul Rudd well enough but I love Aisling Bea! I'll have to check it out
Living with Yourself,I watched it just for Paul Rudd
Living with Yourself,I watched it just for Paul Rudd
Living with Yourself,I swear Netflix took this off my list
Living with Yourself,"I watched it right away a while ago. It was very much like Paul Rudd. Funny and worth seeing.

But then after...I'm pretty sure it was a long slow remake of a Harold Ramis, Micheal Keaton movie Multipicity."
Living with Yourself,Anyone know if they're making another series?
Living with Yourself,I have absolutely no idea who Paul Rudd is.
Living with Yourself,I watched it when it came out. I saw Paul Rudd and just clicked on it and binged all the way through. Great series!
Living with Yourself,I loved this show so much!
Living with Yourself,YOU’RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME!
Living with Yourself,"I love Rudd and enjoyed the show, but it was rather odd."
Living with Yourself,"I did when it came out, because I love Paul Rudd. And I really enjoyed it."
Living with Yourself,"Thanks for bringing this back into my conscious memory, it definitely deserves a rewatch"
Living with Yourself,He is the funniest Avenger
Living with Yourself,Just watched the first episode... WTF? I like it. Thanks for the suggestion.
Living with Yourself,Was a great show!
Living with Yourself,Putting it on now. Thanks.
Living with Yourself,Such a great show. Watched it in one day. So great.
Living with Yourself,"I love Paul Rudd. 

How Paul Ruddy is he in this?"
Living with Yourself,I been waiting for season 2 but i doubt it's happening
Living with Yourself,"Wait, if someone likes Paul Rudd they should be watching things that he acts in?????? Golly, every single person who likes him has been doing the opposite! You are amazingly talented to figure out something so important that no one else had. The world thanks you for your brilliance, there has never been and shall never be a smarter person than you."
Living with Yourself,"Hold up, is Paul Rudd seen like a universally loved or something? Huh, go figure..."
Living with Yourself,It was decent. Decently weird and entertaining enough to watch all the way through.
Living with Yourself,Wanted to like this so much but it was a massive letdown
Living with Yourself,"I was visiting my sister and BIL shortly after it came out when it was still featured on Netflix. We figured we'd watch an episode or two to see if we liked it, then take episode by episode. Next thing we knew, we'd watched the whole show in one night."
Living with Yourself,Does the series finalise the story or does it end on a cliffhanger for a second season that didn’t exist?
Living with Yourself,Rosalind is a nightmare.
Living with Yourself,[removed]
Living with Yourself,"Quick question then, if it's canceled, does it end okay to not need an S2?"
Living with Yourself,"Had to explain this to my girlfriend, but it was brilliant."
Living with Yourself,Pretty hilarious that he would agree to feature in a situation like that as well lmao
Living with Yourself,"I'm pretty sure anyone who didn't like it just didn't know that it was a parody from David Wain/Michael Showalter (the guys behind ""Wet Hot American Summer"") and was just drawn to it because of the actors."
Living with Yourself,You could say that again
Living with Yourself,"I think all David Wain movies are just not for everyone. I'm a huge huge fan. The State, WHAS, Stella, Role Models, They Came Together, Wanderlust, all hilarious. I've been watching him since the 90s and his surreal style puts a lot of people off."
Living with Yourself,It's a terrible movie but Paul Rudd and the rest of the cast are so good that it makes it entertaining.
Living with Yourself,Evan Dando is directing? I have to rewatch that one just to check out the music.
Club 57,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn’t on your list, but I guess it’s not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler’s List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Club 57,Interesting to see containment show up.
Club 57,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don’t matter for them at all.
Club 57,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Club 57,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Club 57,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Club 57,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it’s clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Club 57,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Club 57,Damn didn’t realize Ozark hadn’t been renewed yet
Club 57,How about movies??
Club 57,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Club 57,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Club 57,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Club 57,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Club 57,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it’s great
Club 57,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Club 57,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Club 57,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Club 57,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Club 57,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It’s bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character’s name is “John B” and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Club 57,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Club 57,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Club 57,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."

Club 57,He write it at the end of his post.

Club 57,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Club 57,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Club 57,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Club 57,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Club 57,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Club 57,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

Thank you for that other correction"
Club 57,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."

Club 57,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Club 57,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Club 57,[deleted]
Club 57,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Club 57,Pretty much the whole first season of Dark ;)
Club 57,"The overall mood is the complete opposite of cozy but the second season finale of Hannibal, 'Mizumono', uses rain to great effect."
Club 57,[deleted]
Club 57,"Interesting list. 'Hurricane Neddy' was the first Simpsons ep that came to mind, & you triggered me with *Down With Uniforms* - the episode is called 'Team Homer.'"
Club 57,Alright
Club 57,Do you count live sporting events?
Club 57,"Awesome list, ""Pull up a barrel!"" is also an amazing rainy episode from SpongeBob."
Club 57,"of course not lol it literally says as far as I know, which means as far as i've seen"
Club 57,"hahaha my b, i'll fix it"
Club 57,I didn't for this list!
Theory of Love,Say what you want about Big Bang Theory in the later seasons the casting all around was pitch-perfect. The chemistry everyone had is one of the big reasons the early seasons work so well. The chemistry Johnny and Kaley had is what made the relationship seem authentic and not hard to believe at all. Also I'll always say the three leads taking pay cuts so that their other cast members could get bigger raises and a bigger piece of the pie is one of the most selfless things I've ever seen in Hollywood.
Theory of Love,It’s always interesting to see romantic chemistry from a show translate to real life. I guess it’s a real testament to good casting
Theory of Love,Wait what?
Theory of Love,I swear that Johnny Galecki came out like 10 years before this show was made. I was really surprised to see them dating but maybe it was the Mandela effect.
Theory of Love,I had no idea. Or maybe I used to know and forgot.
Theory of Love,[removed]
Theory of Love,"KALEY CUOCO - THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT - ORIGINS? 
Was Kaley Cuoco's role as a flight attendant/CIA spy based on that of a real air hostess/CIA spy in the seventies? Her name was Vivienne Templeton and she features in Beyond Enkription in #TheBurlingtonFiles series of fact based spy novels. 

If you're a Kaley Cuoco fan and interested in flight attendants living double lives just like Kaley, best read Beyond Enkription, the only novel to be published to date in TheBurlingtonFiles factual espionage series by Bill Fairclough. Look out for Vivienne Templeton who in real life was not only what was then described as an air hostess in Haiti Air Inter but also a CIA operative in Haiti and the Caribbean. 

Vivienne was based in Fort Lauderdale working under the cover of being an air hostess who moonlighted by managing holiday lets in the Bahamas and Florida. The Burlington Files series is based on the gripping true story of a genuine spook, Bill Fairclough aka Edward Burlington whose MI6 codename in real life was JJ. Critics herald it to be just the stuff epic films are made of.

Coincidentally Kaley Cuoco who stars in the Flight Attendant actually looks a lot like the real life flight attendant/CIA asset Vivienne Templeton who featured in Bill Fairclough's spy novels in The Burlington Files series. See TheBurlingtonFiles + Everipedia websites for photos of Vivienne in the seventies. Beyond Enkription is a must read for espionage illuminati. 

See https://theburlingtonfiles.org/news_2021.09.26.php + https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/vivienne-templeton-1.

Do look up the authors or books mentioned on Amazon, Google The Burlington Files or visit https://theburlingtonfiles.org and https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/bill-fairclough and read Beyond Enkription."
Theory of Love,"Jim Parsons is a top tier actor, glad he's been able to find good success outside of TBBT. Same for Kaley Cuoco with The Flight Attendant, always felt like Penny and Sheldon were the strongest parts of the show"
Theory of Love,">Say what you want about Big Bang Theory 

I will, it was terrible. Goddamn especially if you were a minority and a physicist."
Theory of Love,"Are we really at the point now where we're pretending that this show was funny at any point in time? It's not that it was bad in ""the later seasons,"" it was always completely devoid of comedy."
Theory of Love,Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys is another pairing that translated to real life that I love
Theory of Love,"Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter from dexter got married, and divorced throughout the run of the show. They played (adopted) brother and sister so kinda funny to think about, but even stranger was after their divorce their was a subplot where their characters had a weird attraction to each other."
Theory of Love,Jesse plemons and Kirsten Dunst from Fargo!
Theory of Love,Eliza Taylor and Bob Morely from The 100
Theory of Love,"kutcher and kunis, though in the show, it wasn't as much of a relationship and she ends up with Fez"
Theory of Love,"Maybe it was Sarah Gilbert's coming out that confuses you. She and Galecki had roles in ""Roseanne"" and actually dated in front of and behind the cameras for a while."
Theory of Love,I believe that was Jim Parsons.
Theory of Love,"He played a gay guy in the movie  ""The Opposite of Sex"". Maybe,  that's what you're thinking.  (Gawd, I LOVE that movie!)."
Theory of Love,"these rumors appeared after his roles in which he played gay men. But in his life, Johnny constantly met only with women, after Kaley he had a 3-year relationship with Kelly Garner and there were other girls. He has a three-year-old child.  Johnny leads a secretive lifestyle, if Kaley hadn't told reporters about their affair, no one would have found out."
Theory of Love,"I honestly thought the same, but I think this is a case where everyone was constantly insinuating Johnny was gay, and he never said anything to dispute it. Especially at the time, that kind of reaction to gay rumors was pretty much seen as confirmation."
Theory of Love,[removed]
Theory of Love,[removed]
Theory of Love,She is also great as Harley Quinn :)
Theory of Love,"Sheldon carried the show for me probably, but I'd say the same of Dwight on The Office to some degree too. Some people say the show died with Michael leaving, for me it would've died if Dwight left."
Theory of Love,Parsons was soo good in The Boys in the Band.
Theory of Love,"What success has Parsons had outside of it?  As far as I know, he's just doing VO for Young Sheldon, which is almost the same thing."
Theory of Love,The Flight Attendant was great in Season 1 but became laughably bad in Season 2. They should have kept it to the first season as it would have been perfect then.
Theory of Love,"And if you were really a physicist (or worked in academia at all), it was likely one of your favorite shows. No show before it has ever satirized the day-to-day of academia quite as well."
Theory of Love,Plenty of Nobel laureates seem to like it well enough to do cameos
Theory of Love,[removed]
Theory of Love,Believe Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead(the girlfriend actress) are together from Fargo season 3 as well. Only found this out because I was just recently watching it. Weird.
Theory of Love,They are so great in that show! I was happy to see them together.
Theory of Love,They killed him dirty
Theory of Love,"No, I knew about Jim Parsons. It's probably me misremembering it, but I swear I looked him up a decade after Roseanne and saw that."
Theory of Love,"It's strange that you thought that. Because Johnny was constantly dating women, after Kaley he had a 3-year relationship with Kelly Garner. After Kelly Garner, he had several other relationships, short and long. He just doesn't advertise his novels."
Theory of Love,She's very good in HQ
Theory of Love,It is hard to compare The Office to a show with a laugh track.
Theory of Love,Dwight carried those last 2 seasons hard
Theory of Love,He was in Hidden Figures
Theory of Love,He got nominated for a golden globe and an emmy last year for Hollywood
Theory of Love,"Agree, that second season didn't hit as well, which was unfortunate."
Theory of Love,The uni deans were brilliant
Theory of Love,"Yeah and it got people interested in science to even a slight degree.

The show gets a lot of crap but it absolutely, imo, helped pave the way for nerdom to become as acceptable as it is today."
Theory of Love,"Because they're starved for attention

To be a Nobel laureate in physics  you typically have to be an old person and rewarded for research you did in your youth"
Theory of Love,So instead of dating apps I should ask Noah Hawley to cast me in Fargo? Sounds good to me.
Theory of Love,"Ewan and Mary was a weird one because he cheated on his wife with Winstead, but then they'd broken up pretty badly by the time they appeared together again in Birds Of Prey."
Theory of Love,The issue with that was he was asked why hadn’t he defended himself after all the gossip that he was gay and he came out saying he wouldn’t need to defend because that’s nothing bad or something to be ashamed about so why would anyone come out to deny that like if he was being criticized.  Maybe that’s why
Theory of Love,Ditto.
Theory of Love,[deleted]
Theory of Love,They're married with a kid now
Theory of Love,"there was def a weird period of time where if gay marriage or gay rights was defended by someone in media, that person was seen as gay unless they immediately denied it and even then the rumors would persist. I remember the same with former football player Brandon Ayanbadejo. Used his platform to advocate for gay marriage and so many either hated him for it or thought he was gay cause how can a straight man defend gay marriage? very weird times"
Theory of Love,Lol you're not seriously downplaying someone getting nominations in categories in the 2 biggest awards in the TV industry lmao
Theory of Love,"Happened to me in real life.    I was very into the cause of gay marriage.     Many people assumed I was lesbian, didn't even matter that I had a husband and a child."
Theory of Love,[deleted]
Theory of Love,"At most 20 male actors get a Golden Globe television nomination each year out of every show released in the US. That's hardly ""lots of people getting nominated"""
Theory of Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Theory of Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Theory of Love,People are so stupid.
Theory of Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Theory of Love,Good. What a POS.
Theory of Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Theory of Love,What a gross thing to do.
Theory of Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Theory of Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Theory of Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Theory of Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Theory of Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
Theory of Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Theory of Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Theory of Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Theory of Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Theory of Love,Good. Fucking loser
Theory of Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Theory of Love,Who and who?
Theory of Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Theory of Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
Theory of Love,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Theory of Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Theory of Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Theory of Love,Never heard of him.
Theory of Love,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Theory of Love,As he should. If not more…
Theory of Love,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
Theory of Love,[removed]
Theory of Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
Theory of Love,Nasty bastard
Theory of Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Theory of Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Theory of Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Theory of Love,Link?
Theory of Love,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Theory of Love,Lame.
Theory of Love,Remindme! 2 hours
Theory of Love,20000 channels here
Theory of Love,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Theory of Love,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Theory of Love,*Sigh*
Theory of Love,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Theory of Love,See ya
Theory of Love,Loozah!
THE UNLISTED,"Generally, if a show isn't renewed within a certain period of time of the last season airing, their contracts with cast and crew will expire and reviving the show would become rather difficult."
THE UNLISTED,"Silent cancelled by Netflix like Living with Yourself, Kingdom, Into the night and many others..."
THE UNLISTED,"Absolutely not. Whenever a  show takes that long,its cancelled. Its 2023 ffs"
THE UNLISTED,It's Netflix. The answer is no.
THE UNLISTED,"That's a shame. Might not have been the best show ever, but I liked it."
THE UNLISTED,Stranger Things S3 was released in 2019 (same as The Unlisted) and the fourth season only released recently
THE UNLISTED,"Season 4 was announced in late 2019, and filming was prolonged due to covid. Meanwhile Season 2 of The Unlisted hasn't even been announced yet after 4 years."
THE UNLISTED,OP should just let it go
THE UNLISTED,"LOL I can let go of that show, it's not like I had emotional attachment. There was just no announcement and they could have atleast said it somewhere."
THE UNLISTED,"It was probably rear projection (cheaper for a TV budget) and someone either flipped the film or they used European stock footage.

THE UNLISTED,"Seinfeld used rear projection a lot.

Recently rewatched the series, so many out of focus shots it was unbelievable. I guess old CRT TVs were more forgiving."
THE UNLISTED,"Bones pisses me off. And it was a 21st century show.

TV can't afford live driving."
THE UNLISTED,The episode in the car park is done with a ton of mirrors. Once you see it you can’t in see it.
THE UNLISTED,That movie is one of the best comedies
THE UNLISTED,Kramer on the fire truck late in the series is hard to watch.
THE UNLISTED,">Can your kids throw 10 marshmallows up in the air and catch them all in their mouth?

This seems kinda rapey."
Second 20s,"Not sure if John Dutton is a villain. He is a ruthless man to his broadly categorized enemies, but he doesn't take land or cattle at the expense of others. That final point is what really exemplifies Western villains.

Beth and Rip definitely qualify on all the villainous points.

Also, 1883 is a better show so far."
Second 20s,"I agree that they're villains, but I think my issue with the show is that I get the feeling the people who make it don't look at them that way. They don't deserve a happy ending, but I suspect that they'll get one."
Second 20s,"I don't think you are wrong in how you describe them, but they aren't really ""villains"", they are conservative hero-fantasies. 

The antagonists of the first season are Native Americans taking advantage of reservation laws to steal hundred of thousands in livestock value and a liberal California billionaire elite trying to attack their way of living. Monica is a woke shrew constantly shrieking about how bad white people are while also being the conflict points separating Kayce from the rest of his family. Jamie, who was sent from the family to one of those damn liberal brainwashing facilities (Harvard) comes back as a giant pussy who the show absolutely loves shitting on. 

I enjoy the show for how ridiculous it is, but the people who enjoy these characters DO NOT see them as villains."
Second 20s,He is not that rich though
Second 20s,"He may not take land or cattle, but he definitely takes lives."
Second 20s,"I agree. Dutton is ruthless, but he is also a good and kind man with strong principals, and those principles lead to bad ideas like the branding. But ultimately, he is a man who is trying to hold on to what his family has built while everyone around him tries to take it. That alone makes him a villain on communist Reddit.

As for 1883, I started that before I had ever seen an episode of Yellowstone, and knew nothing about it. I also know that a country singer named Tim McGraw exists, and I knew he was married to Faith Hill but had no idea he acted, or that he was in the show. And after the first episode I had to look up this badass cowboy to see what else he had done and why I didn't recognize him. I can't say 1883 is better, or that I like it more, but I like it. But honestly, each episode is kinda just more of the same. I'mma need them to speed this journey up if each episode is just going to be river-cattle-more dead germans-kick thief our of camp-""THIS TRIP IS GOING TO GET HARDER BEFORE IT GETS EASIER!!!""

Edit: I just want to add that today's eps of 1883 kicked everything I said above in the teeth. Great episode."
Second 20s,Be stunned if Jamie gets a happy ending. In fact he probably needs to be written off next season.
Second 20s,[deleted]
Second 20s,">they're villains, but (...) the people who make it don't look at them that way

Isn't that modern TV in a nutshell?"
Second 20s,"I get what you're saying, but I don't see much difference between the way they're portrayed and other classic tv villain protagonists (like the aforementioned Walter White and Tony Soprano). Because they're the protagonist we're kind of on their side, we're compelled to root for them (it helps when their opponents are also clearly villanous), but that doesn't mean the writers think they're good people or that they'll get a happy ending.

But then again, the way Kayce and Nate humanize them does push in that direction in some ways."
Second 20s,"Banshee was one of my favorite shows. I revelled in how ridiculous it was. My super conservative friend hated it because it was ""so ridiculous it didn't make any sense"". Fast forward a few years and he convinces me to watch Yellowstone, and I love it, but my friend flipped out when I said that it's funny he likes it because it is just as ridiculous as Banshee. He went on a tirade about how it's mot at all ridiculous, and yes, I'm certain he is just living out his hyper conservative cowboy fantasies.

He's even mentioned that he ""has to fast forward through some parts because they are too woke"", and I can only assume those are parts where native americans just want to exist? I really don't know."
Second 20s,Certainly but haven't all those people had it coming?  They were either trying to steal from him or harm others?  I don't recall him causing harm on those who didn't deserve it.
Second 20s,"Yeah, I find 1883 is already starting to cover the same ground (thieves getting caught and kicked out of the caravan) but it's still fun to watch and Sam Elliot is doing fantastic work as always.  It's really impressive that he's almost eighty years old and can still cast such a presence.  I look forward to seeing the new episode after you mentioned how great it was."
Second 20s,"I was disappointed that they all survived the coordinated attack on them that ended Season 3 going into 4.  Sometimes, the only way to move forward and make the show exciting is to sacrifice one or more characters, and I guess they're afraid to do that."
Second 20s,"The two examples used, Tony and Walt, got what's coming to them. I'm blanking on other examples to be honest.. Got any?"
Second 20s,Is it?
Second 20s,"> He's even mentioned that he ""has to fast forward through some parts because they are too woke"", and I can only assume those are parts where native americans just want to exist?

He is most likely talking about Monica and, to be fair, she is absolutely written to be as uncompromisingly, unreasonably ""woke"" as possible so that conservatives can ignore the already questionable points she is trying to make. There is no chance that the writers wrote the angry wife character trying to stand between the prodigal son and his family while simultaneously hating everything they have as a sympathetic character."
Second 20s,Why are you friends with a dude who fast forwards through a western show because its 'too woke?'
Second 20s,"Beth and Rip are villains in service to John Dutton. Saying he isn’t a villain is like saying that Tony Soprano isn’t a criminal because, mostly, it’s other people who do crime."
Second 20s,"I feel like the show glosses over the real bad things that John does though. SPOILERS UP THROUGH SEASON 3.2 because that's the last episode I saw lol.

Jenkins did not really deserve to die, which I am 100% convinced was what happened at the end of season 1 that they later retconned once the show got renewed. The bully ranch hand who mysteriously ""saw too much"" is debatable as well. The rich brothers in season 2 deserved to at the end, but that's only because the show did a really weird slide from them being powerful/rich politician billionaires into being white supremacist-supporting, willing to kidnap and murder thugs.

Outside of killings though, John is still a pretty bad guy. He is emotionally abusive to his children, shown constantly with Jamie (who he doesn't even love for some reason) and even with Beth when she is wailing in the house drunk but he ignores because he needs her to be the evil bitch she is. Also, the branding thing is pretty crazy, how many people watching this show do you think are against stereotypical gangs while cheering on this actual gang? Not to mention the mark is kind of described as a second chance for criminals who would otherwise have no place in society, but it makes absolutely no sense that Rip would have been in trouble for what he did."
Second 20s,How about one of the employees that was not branded?
Second 20s,Vic Mackey on The Shield.
Second 20s,Why would you use that as a metric of who to be friends with? That's weird.
Second 20s,Beth and Rip are working for John who has taken the justice in his own hands.
Second 20s,"Oh yeah, he got away for sure good point. The rest not so lucky but the main culprit did. Another great show lol"
Second 20s,Buffy the vampire slayer
Second 20s,"My mad fat diary should be WAY higher on the list, and while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

There are also some good ones you missed, My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education, or as odd as it sounds on the surface... Buffy the Vampire Slayer"
Second 20s,"No Wonder Years, Party of Five, Dawson's Creek, or Degrassi?"
Second 20s,My So Called Life.
Second 20s,are oc and one tree hill not qualified?
Second 20s,Watching Sex Education on Netflix again during quarantine.. give it a watch
Second 20s,"Probably not the same tone or era, but Anne with an e is pretty good."
Second 20s,Thanks for the list but your taste is wayyyyyy off from the type of teen dramas I like
Second 20s,Me & my fam likes [Atypical](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=ATYPICAL&jbv=80117540&jbp=0&jbr=0) which is a comedy with angsty moments.
Second 20s,Sex Education
Second 20s,"Not in order 

1. Euphoria 
2. Elite
3. Skins 
4. Sex Education 
5. Gossip Girl
6. Love 101 
7. On my Block
8. American Vandal
9. The society 
10. 13 Reasons why

Second 20s,"I can't believe you've done this.

How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

^(I might finally watch Skins. Not my typical kind of show. Haven't considered watching it since I worked at Blockbuster.)"
Second 20s,why everyone ignore sex education
Second 20s,Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Best tv series of all time. A must-watch for everyone who loves supernatural romance teen dramas.
Second 20s,"> while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

I assume you mean Skins?? Loud and wrong. 2nd Gen > 1s Gen, at least for me. I've seen a few persons who've prefered the 3rd. The whole thing is great. Each gen is like a different TV show. They're similar of course but at the same time unique in their own different ways. 

> My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education

I considered them all. If the list was Top 20 they'd definately be there, along with Veronica Mars.

Never seen Buffy but I kinda get the impression it's a supernatural series with teen drama elements as opposed to being a teen-drama at heart."
Second 20s,exactly!!! I just finished rewatching and it's definitely I'm the same league as skins and skam. three of these are quite possibly the best in their genre. like ever. I'm so passionate about this trust me
Second 20s,"Degrassi was the shit


I watched pretty much the whole thing on youtube a few months qgo, from junior high to season 10 of next generation. A lot of it was bad, but i enjoyed the majority of it"
Second 20s,"You're mistaken if you believe I've seen every teen drama ever made lol. 

I've only seen My So-called Life from those you listed."
Second 20s,never seen em.
Second 20s,yea ive seen it.
Second 20s,nope.
Second 20s,"Skins is really good actually, give it a go."
Second 20s,"> How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

why, what did i do? 😶😕"
Second 20s,Oh no Buffy is absolutely a teen drama. All of the supernatural and horror elements work to service the teen drama stories in some way or another. I implore you to watch it OP.
Second 20s,lol elite makes the list but not sex education. Elite season 1 was good but damn it got chessy so fast.
Second 20s,Just stop after the first generation
Second 20s,Just trying to help you avoid crucifixion with some sarcasm. :)
Second 20s,"Naw, Buffy is definitely a supernatural series first and foremost."
Second 20s,can't. too long. don't have the time.
Second 20s,Elite season 2 is far better than season 1. Sex Education is also very cheesy. Élite is a soap.
Second 20s,The second gen is good too. The third is not
Second 20s,We can agree to disagree on that one.
Second 20s,"Generation 1 is brisket from Terry Black's in Austin, TX... 2 is dumpster diving at Arby's on Sunday night... Generation 3 is a raw sewage leak"
Second 20s,"Ha, this is reddit, sir.  We need to disagree viciously!

Anyways,  I'd say only the first three seasons have a concentration on coming of age stories and even then many of the stories don't really map well to that experience (for example, most of Angel's season 2 arc)"
Second 20s,"Bahahahahahahaha 😂😂

I guess I do see where you’re coming from - but the arc where Angel/Buffy sleep together and all of a sudden he’s uninterested and also literally evil....sounds like every boy I dated in high school."
Second 20s,"That's sounds rough. Sorry!

I think the seed of the idea is applicable but the actual specifics don't track well.  I.E.  needing to kill you're murderous boyfriend or having your gypsy friend research cures."
Second 20s,"lmao no it’s ok it’s quirky.

Okay yeah no I get that!! I should add that I haven’t rewatched it in full for a little while so I’m arguing based off memory and my brain thing is more like a bowl of spaghetti hoops at this point than a functioning organ but I guess the show was more fluid than I remember!!"
Second 20s,"MASH.  The show hit the television sweet-spot of allowing for more mature story-telling while coming in at the tail end of people having three networks to choose from.  No show will ever get the ratings that its finale had, nearly half the entire US population, meaning also that no modern show, no matter how good, will  dominate conversation as much as MASH did while it was on the air."
Second 20s,"In terms of pure global penetration, I think MASH, Friends, and Seinfeld have all been broadcast in hundreds of countries. "
Second 20s,"Sesame Street, I think it has more global appeal."
Second 20s,"IN terms of success...Friends. It still makes a billion a year in syndication. And each actor gets 2 percent or...20 million a year since the show went of. To me, the most famous and successful show is and always will be MASH. It reshaped the way comedies could be shot and made. And not only that, it has the highest rated episodes of a TV show in history and no other show has even come close. The only thing that ever beats it is the Super Bowl and that is just for the commercials, not the actual game.

If we are talking a show that has had the most cultural effect, Seinfeld. It had just endless references that made it from show to pop culture to everyday life. I do like telling people not to be so much of a soup nazi. "
Second 20s,"It could be Friends  ""The hit series continues to generate massive revenue and makes Warner Bros around $1 billion every year. That means each cast member pulls in around $20 million every year"" [https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-much-money-does-the-cast-of-friends-make-for-reruns.html/](https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-much-money-does-the-cast-of-friends-make-for-reruns.html/)"
Second 20s,It seems noone mentioned Dr.Who so here it is. It has ran for more than 50 years spawned three(?) spinn off shows (with questionable quality) and has much more broad following than Star Trek.
Second 20s,"The thought of Seinfeld being filler is absurd. It was absolutely groundbreaking when it aired, and holds up very well to this day. It might seem like filler to you because every sitcom afterwards tried to capture their magic. 

Lots of people, myself included, consider Seinfeld their favorite show. Friends is probably more successful though. "
Second 20s,Spongebob Squarepants is up there.
Second 20s,"All in the Family, spawned multiple successful spinoffs and made politically topical comedy shows and non-white characters and casts commercially viable. If you look at the wave of sitcoms right before it, you can piece together the allusions to issues and subcultures viewers were curious about and that broadcast news was doing great job reporting on at the time, but that scripted programmers couldn't directly reference for fear of censorship based on anticipated public outcry."
Second 20s,"Mash, Friends or Seinfeld I guess. It's hard to compare shows from different eras. All of those have a much greater international reach than Simpsons. "
Second 20s,I love Lucy or MASH
Second 20s,"Hm, it really depends how you define most famous/successful and really ""TV show."" For instance, Mickey Mouse and Looney Tunes are both mostly theatrical shorts, though a lot of people know them from later television shows, with Mickey being known more for Disney's legacy than his original shorts. 

> I don't think it has that huge a following today or internationally.

This is also an interesting issue, as it's hard to gauge ""all time"" and then limit it to current appeal. Going back to my previous point, The Flintstones are often remembered more for the legacy than the original prime time cartoon. There are also shows that just continue to exist, such as Twilight Zone, even if a lot of things from them or the overall demand is much lower.

> Dunno about Seinfeld ... yeah it's popular but does anyone really consider it their favorite show?

This becomes even harder when you compare things like cultural impact. While I can't speak on other regions, there are a lot of terms and things I continue to see people say that might not have started with Seinfeld, but certainly got big because of it. 

These include things like shrinkage, doubling dipping, the dance (it was featured in Destiny not too long ago), serenity now and much more. Maybe it has to do with the people I talk to and things of that nature, but outside of the will they/won't they stuff, I don't really have anything that I associate with friends or see referenced. Even if it makes a bunch of money, I wouldn't say it has the same impact as Seinfeld or The Simpsons. 

"
Second 20s,The Simpsons for sure. It's gone on for too long but there's something admirable about its long-lasting appeal. In its prime it truly embiggened the smallest man. 
Second 20s,"I would vote for Buffy The Vampire Slayer. A perfect blend of drama, fantasy, comedy, horror, style and music."
Second 20s,Gunsmoke
Second 20s,Friends by far.... while I understand some other opinions friends is the most successful show ever. Play the fucking song and find one person that doesn’t clap.... I dare you. Try it... try it! 
Second 20s,I think Friends takes the 1st place prize.
Second 20s,The evening news. It's on nearly all the channels!
Second 20s,The Office
Second 20s,What about GOT? Seems a year ago that's all folks could talk about....
Second 20s,I Love Lucy
Second 20s,I think this is generational. Like if you’re a boomer sure this is true but for gen x and even gen z I think a  more ubiquitous experience had to be friends. I think that might be the last time that happens too. Because now we have so many different ways to access to shows that you’re never going to have such a captive audience again. Or at least not for a long time.
Second 20s,Baywatch I think beats them all in terms of countries. 180.
Second 20s,"Do kids still watch Sesame Street? But yeah, 49 years on the air is nothing to sneeze at.

You might be right though - Sesame Street is probably similar to the Simpsons in that it's popular around the globe, and has extreme longevity for a TV show. And a lot of things about the Simpsons are particularly relatable to Americans and not so much to people from other countries."
Second 20s,damn thats crazy
Second 20s,"Holy crap that's insane. What's funny is I've only watched a handful of episodes of Friends, and while I could list off the names of most of the characters I can't remember at all what their personalities are like.

That's probably the TV equivalent of someone who doesn't know Darth Vader is the villain in Star Wars, lol.

I think Friends has a lot of transgenerational appeal. It's been on for a long time, but the era it's from (90s/early 00s) has not dated that much, so you have people anywhere from little kids to people in their 60s that enjoy it. Plus it's set in New York, and everyone can relate to plots centering around friendship."
Second 20s,"I never really cared for cringe humor I guess. Seinfeld is the reason we have shows like The Office and Parks and Rec, which most people adore but I personally don't care for. To each their own."
Second 20s,Seinfeld is very much in the conversation for greatest tv show of all time
Second 20s,"There are so many people that consider Seinfeld their favorite show, but I'd bet many of them aren't Reddit's typical demographic. "
Second 20s,"You think so? I mean yeah it's popular, but I'd still say it's kind of a ""cult following"" type of popular. A really huge cult following, but the humor doesn't appeal to everyone, and there's probably a lot of people who have never watched it. I think pretty much everyone has seen at least one Simpsons episode.

Also - do you mean the British or American version? I'm assuming the American one right?"
Second 20s,"I think Game of Thrones has a large and very dedicated fanbase, but appeals mostly to a relatively limited demographic. Most parents wouldn't let their kids watch it, and I don't think there's a lot of elderly people who enjoy it (though I could be wrong). Plus you have to be pretty high in openness to appreciate some of the plot lines, which involve incest, child murder, etc."
Second 20s,"Yes, liking a show is definitely generational.  I was 11 years old when MASH ended and never really liked it.  I've also never watched an episode of Friends and I loathed Seinfeld... 

This answer is for ""all time"" though and I don't think Friends beats MASH.  As popular as Friends was (and I fully agree, it was), it just never had the sheer numbers that 80's sitcoms had, its final episode only drawing 63% of the viewers that the final episode of MASH had, 22% of the US population at the time, as opposed to 45% of the US population watching the finale of MASH.  It absolutely has everything to do with how many networks and other shows were on at the time as you said which seriously, probably makes Friends' (and Seinfeld's) numbers equally impressive... But using a single data point of finale ratings vs population (because I'm honesty too lazy to go deeper into this debate 😊 ), the only television that's going to ever compare with MASH is The Super Bowl."
Second 20s,"It airs in 120 countries and there have been something like 20 international adaptations too. I watched a PBS show about it years ago and they actually work with locals to develop the show with characters, locations and themes tailor made for that country and the people. Not sure if it’s still the same now with the HBO deal though. "
Second 20s,"Oh no, I have to disagree... Friends is *extremely* dated and the jokes do not hold up well at all.  There has already been a sizable "" what were our parents thinking, with Friends"" backlash among generation z bloggers."
Second 20s,"It was kind of a joke, but its just a great show in general imo"
Second 20s,"That's fascinating! I'd be very interested to see some of the versions of the show that people in foreign countries come up with. 

I wonder if the show is more popular abroad now than it is in America. When I was a kid in the 90s Sesame Street was still very popular, but already in decline because kids had more alternatives (in particular Nickelodeon). I'm guessing it probably does pretty well in countries that still don't have a lot of TV channels. 

I personally didn't watch it much growing up although I do remember it being on TV fairly often."
Second 20s,"Yeah, I agree. My uni class recently analysed Friends compared to modern sitcoms, and I realised that there is definitely a *lot* of content that would probably be frowned upon in today's climate. It was great for the 90's, and I can definitely see the appeal it still has now, but a lot of the gay jokes and Chandler's dad in particular would *not* be regarded highly today."
Second 20s,">Friends is *extremely* dated and the jokes do not hold up well at all

Agreed. Am old enough to have watched it first run, although I didn't for various reasons. Tried to watch it when it came on Hulu a couple years back. 

Couldn't even get through half a season. I think shows that try to be cool and trendy at the time of their first airing age especially poorly. 

I think there must be some nostalgia factor with the older generations still watching it. I find it hard to believe it's picking up lots of new fans. 

"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"> “The Cybergate Opens” hits Nickelodeon at 8 a.m. ET/PT this Saturday, April 27.

The most surprising thing is that they still make shows that premier on Saturday mornings. No idea Sat AM shows were still a thing.

EDIT: just looked into it. The power rangers episode is preceded by an hour of spongebob reruns, and is followed by an hour of spongebob reruns. Does anyone else think it is odd the only show that isn’t spongebob on Nick Saturday morning is a new episode of power rangers? Is there a reason for this scheduling?"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Power Rangers finally ran out of ideas and is just doing Beetleborgs now.

Edit: woosh..."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,">Does anyone else think it is odd the only show that isn’t spongebob on Nick Saturday morning is a new episode of power rangers? Is there a reason for this scheduling?

Null hypothesis: Nickelodeon hates power rangers, and is purposefully scheduling it like this as a giant middle finger to people who still like the franchise."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Because nick has no other shows worth airing besides spongebob. Loud house is pretty good too but they dont have 15+ years of reruns to pull from. Really sad how nick has done basically nothing in over a decade.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Kids don't watch broadcast TV, at all. They will watch it wherever it is that current Power Rangers streams (a Nickelodeon app?). It could be aired at 3am on a Wednesday and it wouldn't really make any difference."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,They were produced by the same company.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,">woosh

We got your joke, it's just not funny."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Or transformers beast wars
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Power Rangers is a rip off Super Sentai. It uses their footage.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Nick's horrible with scheduling with non-spongebob programs. Legend of Korra fans were pissed when they couldn't air the last few episodes on TV but could do two hour blocks of the yellow guy nightly.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Fuck yes!  Beast Wars!
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,adaptation ≠ rip off
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Do the kids that watch it these days even know who the classic rangers are?
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I'm just glad an old Ranger other than Tommy is getting the spotlight.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Just to remind people that Austin St. John did not become a gay porn star. He became a paramedic in the mid atlantic.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Aw sheeeeeeit.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Do they still use Japanese footage or have they just started making the whole thing stateside with Japanese inspiration?
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I haven’t watched power rangers since a kid in the 90’s why does this look worse graphics wise. The cgi is horrible
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Ugh I’m so nostalgic for power rangers I’d wish they’d make them just a little bit more mature, like how some of the earlier seasons were."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Hell yeah Jason is the best
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Didn't he gay bash the blue Ranger?
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Some might because they may have watched old episodes on Netflix. Or maybe the parents who watch it with their kids? 

I know my friends kids love power rangers and know all the originals."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"They don't really need to. For kids it's ""cool an old Ranger is coming back"" and for adults this could actually mean something to them and get some to tune in for an episode or two."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,They aired a “remastered” version of the series after with new effects before Saban got it back. That was a few years ago but still recent enough.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Here here!  Now give me Kimberly!
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,He runs a store now selling power rangers merch at a fair price.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Huh, so that wasn't just a rumour at a few schools? I wonder how far reaching that one was. I heard it my school and I've had a few people I know in my adult life make jokes about it but this is the first time I've seen it on reddit. It's almost kinda impressive how far some rumours went in the 90s before the Internet made it easy to fact check. This feels almost ""Mew's hiding under the truck in Pokemon Red""-level."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I thought he drove a Gaybulance and did emergency porn rescues?
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"It'll always be a mix, but a good chunk is still Japanese footage. It's just harder to tell now that the film quality is about the same, unlike way back in the early seasons."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"The current seasons uses very little Japanese footage compared to other seasons. For the most part it is just the Zord fights and the finishing moves, almost all the other fight scenes are New Zealand made.

Also the footage for the crossover would be based of a film of the Japanese show, and we can see in the roll call there are different ranger colours and the quarry they used is different."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,They still use Japanese footage.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Yeah, I preferred it when it was almost all practical effects and rubber suits."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Nostalgia goggles my friend.  Do you wanna know what the evil dark rangers looked like?

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/e/e6/Dark_Rangers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091004043410"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,At this point I think its a stylistic decision.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"The comics are fairly adult, and a season about 10 years ago (Power Rangers RPM) was the most mature Power Rangers has every been, Madmax meets Power Rangers and a nice touch of government slavery to tie it all together."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,No. David Yost (Billy) said that none of the Rangers or other actors gave him flak. It was the crew.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Yeah Rangers benefits greatly in the streaming age
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Well they did show the pink and blue MMPR rangers in that line up.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,/s
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Can you warn me before I click on a link I don’t remember them at all but thanks for the nightmares. I clearly remember movie and some stuff from first season.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"they had kimberly's replacement back a couple years ago and made it canon that tommy the green ranger married her, so i think theyll probably just bring her back again"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"There is a rumour going around that they are actually members from Power Rangers Megaforce, they are able to turn into other rangers."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"You sure you wanna remember the movies?

https://www.horrorgeeklife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bad-megazord-zyuranger.jpg"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Ahh okay, Cat?"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,The fact Power Rangers is still mostly put together from old footage of a Japanese kids show blows my mind. It must be super cheap to produce.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Not gonna lie, these are my least favorite PR costumes ever. I'm super interested in what the battleizer looks like though."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,They should wear battle armour like the master chief 
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Those costumes look awful to wear
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Except they haven't. What do you think the bottom half of their suits are like?
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,It was much older footage way back in the day. Now it's footage from more recent seasons of Super Sentai. This one is based off a 2012 season of Super Sentai. There's also much more original footage than there used to be.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"This series will actually cost more, due to how most of the suits have been destroyed from the Japanese version. So they had to recreate the suits."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"It can be a bit more expensive which I see this one being as the main villains aren't people in monster suits for the original series. It's human looking villains who don't transform and fight in human form which kind of leaves them with three options. They either somehow edit around them, dub over them (Which barely worked back in MMPR), or just recasting and reshooting a lot of action scenes."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,[Got you covered.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/powerrangers/images/3/32/Buster-pcred.png/revision/latest?cb=20140214182058)
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Ironically the leather switch for that season was to appeal to western audience, Go-Busters was an homage to power rangers such as call the robots zoids"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,they're pleather pants.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"This season is actually fairly old, it was made back in 2012. So when Beast Morphers is released about 7 years old footage"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,">>It was much older footage way back in the day

Zyurangers last episode aired in February of 1993, MMPR premiered August of that same year. 

Even if we add in the use of Zyu2 footage rather than Dairanger, they never really fell behind. Ohranger for example ended in February of 96, Zeo premiered in April.

Really theyve been furthest behind because Disney cancelling the show and then Saban taking a year to bring it back. It's given them some breathing room though, because now they're not tied to the latest season and having to make it work. 

For example, Sentai has a history of making it's car themed Sentais very silly. Carranger involved lots of puns and villains that transformed by buying food from a local vendor, their grunts were neon/pastel colored octopus creatures that did slapstick. Turbo, the ranger series based off it was ridiculed for failing to adapt the series in an effective way and led to the franchise being on the verge of cancellation. (This is the series that famously involved the rangers nearly being killed by being baked into a giant pizza)

Go-Onger, likewise, had an environmental message and starred a team that lived in an RV and fought pollution themed villains who used puns and haiku in all their fight scenes. This time, it got adapted into Power Rangers RPM, which used what footage they could and then mostly filmed an original show that starred the last remaining rangers fighting to save the last human city after a robot apocalypse. While the more intense setting is often attributed to it's high standing in the fan base, I personally think the fact that they had to little footage to use is what saved it. There's no long drawn out megazord fights, it's just ""monster gets big, call the megazord, use the finishing move and done"", so instead you get lots of world building and character interaction.

So by having a buffer on seasons, they can instead choose to skip a year if they want to use another seasons footage. They already skipped the season this year is using (Go-Busters) because it had terrible ratings in Japan and the following season was Dinosaur themed, which is always a sure win. They then chose to skip the year after the Dinosaur theme, ToQger because it was themed around trains and imagination, and instead went with Nininnger, a ninja themed Sentai. They've got back to re-use Go-Busters because of the 4 Sentai Seasons they have available, Animals and Spies are their best bet as opposed to

-ToQger, the afformentioned Train theme

-Zyuohger which is themed around Animals and cubes (also a likely candidate for a mid season upgrade season if Hasbro to decides to continue Sabans pattern)

-Kyruanger, which is themed around Astrological signs and is a logistical problem due to all 12 signs having a ranger."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"I think this is the only time I've liked the battleizer costume more than the original lol. Seriously, they just look like [skydivers](https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PowerRangers-BeastMorphers-GoBusters.jpg)! (And their silver ranger looks like bad Daft Punk cosplay)"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"> (This is the series that famously involved the rangers nearly being killed by being baked into a giant pizza)

*And just to make your day complete/YOU MIGHT GET BAKED INTO A PIE*"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,That's actually Space Sheriff Gavan; he shows up for a crossover episode in Go-Busters.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I don't know what most of those words mean but I love them!
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Power Rangers takes its footage from a Japanese line of shows called Super Sentai that is essentially the same thing. When it comes to the west, they splice in western actors and make their own stories around the action footage. (sometimes filming new footage)

The studio that makes the Japanese shows (Toei) also makes other lines of shows, each focusing on different things. ""Gavan"" is the main character in ""Space Sheriff Gavan"", a show that aired in 1982. The franchise it belongs to has been off the air since like 97. The character reappeared in a few episodes of the Japanese show this season of Power Rangers gets its footage from as a tribute for its 30th anniversary. So the suit is very of its time since they didn't wanna change the classic appearance.

You can get a better look at the Beast Morphers suits here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EkN6pZFA2k"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Interesting. So he probably won't be in Beast Morphers, right? I know they usually don't have things that reference Sentai seasons that weren't Power Ranger seasons. Plus, Ninja Steel is the Power Rangers anniversary so that wouldn't be a reason either."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Yeah, the show's got no point of reference in the US, so it'd be weird to have him in there.  His appearance was also a sort of promotional thing for an anniversary movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UewNDYfTdA

But again, no point of reference for Americans, so it's probably not being ported over. The Japanese series is 50 episodes, Beast Morphers is gonna be like 25 or so, definitely room to cut stuff."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Dude was a staple on the convention circuit, seemed to genuinely love the fans he interacted with. RIP"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,That's very sad to hear. I have great memories as a kid watching the Power Rangers and the Green/White Ranger was always my favourite. R.I.P
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Suicide as well, man that's sad.

He was my favourite power ranger. Doesn't mean much I suppose for an adult in his mid-30s but this guy was everybody's favourite. Entertained millions and millions around the world in who knows how many languages."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Holy shit. There was a rumor about this last night on twitter and I was hoping it would be false 😞
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Damn, this is a rough one. Grew up on the OG power rangers and I went trick or treating multiple years as the green/white ranger as a kid 

Also had the dagger flute toy. He had the best mech too.

RIP to the best OG ranger

His intro to the show was awesome to watch when I was a kid. I thought he was such a badass."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"It may have been one role, but his performance as the Green Ranger was basically the first antihero I was ever introduced to, and what a journey that character went through. At Uni, one of my communication paper's (subjective point presented as objective) arguments was that the Green Ranger was undoubtedly the best Power Ranger. 

It was a joke, but it was inspired by this dude's badassery. 

Rest in peace, Jason. Thank you for...everything.


edit: for anyone wondering I did get an A on the project and got a few laughs out of my class. The intention of the assignment was essentially to turn a silly subjective opinion into a straightforward argument presented as fact."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Always seemed like such an upbeat guy at conventions. Just further proof you never know what’s going on with people.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Dude was my childhood. Such a sad loss, I’ve heard mixed things about him over the years but he always seemed to appreciate the role that made him a legend to 90s kids, and did everything he could to keep that type of content going. 

Saw him fight in a local MMA show about a decade ago, and lemme tell ya: even though he looked nothing like he did in the 90s, it was one of the coolest experiences for a former Power Rangers super fan to see my childhood hero actually in a real, legitimate fight. 

Rest in Power, JDF."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,FUCK. We are all hoping the other site was just some bullshit but TMZ is always on the money with the deaths.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Speaking as someone very involved in the fandom, he had been going through some things. But what I mistook for a midlife crisis must actually have been something far more serious"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"it's tragic that this happened just as the MMPR cast were about to reunite for the show's 30th anniversary.

even tho JDF wasn't going to be in that (as he was supposed to have been busy filming his own project, Legend Of The White Dragon), it's gotta be very hard on the returning actors to get back together with this in mind. (Austin St John's arrest a while back probably doesn't help much either)

people in the Power Rangers fandom had recently began to take notice of his increasingly erratic behaviour, such as refusing to be involved in Power Rangers in any capacity (even though he had made appearances as recently as 2018), apparently so that he could work on LOTWD with Bat In The Sun (which most people wrote off as an ego-driven vanity project), and also a couple of strange things he said and did in his convention appearances and personal vlogs. In hindsight, these were all likely signs that something was off with the guy. Yet another instance of no one really knowing what was happening until it was too late."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"90s kids are having a rough time this past month with Aaron Carter, and now Jason David Frank. I’m so sad."

Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Rip greatest ranger of all time. Him coming back as the White Ranger was top 10 greatest moments of childhood.
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"All I wanted for Christmas was a White Tigerzord and my mother could find it nowhere. Then, Christmas Eve, she was buying something else at a department store and saw one sitting on the counter. Someone else had just returned it and she bought it immediately. Best Christmas ever. She still tells that story often - it was her Christmas Miracle.

RIP Jason David Frank - you were my favorite Ranger."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"First Batman and now the green ranger, my childhood is hurting."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,That's so awful. Ultimate Power Ranger. RIP man
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Rest in peace, Jason. You have no idea how many lives you’ve positively influenced, like mine!!!🥹"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,[deleted]
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"First Kevin Conroy and now JDF. 

Man. This hurts the soul. Practically my childhood in the 90’s."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"This has me in tears. Such a huge part of my childhood and life, as a millennial this is probably the first “Big” celebrity death for me. I used to come home and watch power rangers every day after school… 

So sad that this happened, can’t imagine how his kids are feeling. RIP to one of the few genuine people out there."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I had a chance to meet him at a fan signing a couple months back and he took the time to speak to every fan for a couple minutes or so. He seemed so excited to be able to branch out with his new movie and was looking forward to the future. This sucks. RIP
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,NOOOOOO
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,You gotta be kidding me
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"I am gutted. I am sad. I feel for his family.

This guy was my childhood. I started Kindergarten when MMPR premiered. I never experienced anything like the green ranger saga, and never did again. Effortlessly cool, he came across as kind in the show, there's a reason he's so revered in a character sense.

When he showed up for the karate tournament to fight Jason, and you saw how accomplished JDF was in martial arts, it was really impactful.   His speed and technique was on a completely different level compared to the rest of the team, and I think the only person to come close is Jonny Yong Bosch.  The unmorphed fights were always my favorite.   

[This video has a great selection of his unmorphed fights, I linked to the timestamp to my favorite. He's just so fast.](https://youtu.be/BmM7lXCA1XI?t=233)

JDF's impact, my continuing fandom, the resurgence of the Tommy character in the comics, JDF's continuing support, it has really made the last five or six years as a on original Power Rangers fan amazing. The joy of being able to relive that childhood and some of those memories are something I will always cherish. And he was firmly behind so many of the various projects, and seemed eager to participate. 

Hope he gets to rest now."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Ugh. This makes me so so sad. Power Rangers was like my personality growing up and JDF was a big part of that. RIP
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"**Jason best quotes**

>I try to motivate people and inspire them, to let them know that they're not alone.

>I have high standards I hold myself to, besides Christianity.

>I have always been a martial arts fighter; it goes to back when I was eighteen.

>If you live day by day and do the best you can, then you'll have a great future."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,Only 49 too. RIP to the GOAT
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I’m still not over Kevin Conroy’s death and now another one of my biggest childhood influences is gone..
Power Rangers Beast Morphers," Jesus Christ this stopped me in my tracks. Jason is one of those people you don’t expect to die this young. I was wondering if this was another Chadwick Boseman situation or just a tragic accident, but the comments say it was unfortunately suicide. He must’ve been going through some extremely hard times. He will be missed dearly by the Power Rangers community, even by those not in the community anymore. 

 Such a shame that this happened so soon to the 30th anniversary. Maybe the surge of love and support could’ve helped delay something like this or prevent it :("
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"RIP Jason David Frank. Whenever I check his IG page, he’s always smiling and embracing fans, and looking forward to the next convention. He truly loved his role as a Power Ranger. This man inspired millions of children, teens, and young adults. It’s sad to lose another good one, we’ll miss him and love him!"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Tommy as the Green Ranger was my introduction to the ""I Can Fix Him"" mindset I'd adopt for my dating life."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"Damn, first Kevin Conroy and now the Green Ranger.  90's kids getting hit hard this week."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"When I was a little girl I had a crush on Tommy. I remember being so sad that his Power Ranger toy was sold out at both K.B. toys & Toys -R-Us.

All they had left was the Blue Ranger. I was so disappointed that I had to go home with Billy instead."
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,"I get laughed at for always saying that Turbo is my favorite iteration of Power Rangers, but that movie hit theaters RIGHT as I got to be the movie-going age.

I was in middle school when Dino Thunder came on. Initially, I didn’t really care about Power Rangers anymore, but Tommy being a main character/mentor to the new rangers as well as becoming the Black ranger really drew me back into it. That whole series was incredibly well done.

My brother is a much bigger Power Rangers fan than me, and I know he’s really feeling this one too. RIP JDF"
Power Rangers Beast Morphers,I remember the episode when Tommy lost his Green Ranger powers. I also remember making my dad late for work and us late for school because I had to see through to the end of it. And I very clearly remember crying at the end.

Grand Blue,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Grand Blue,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Grand Blue,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."

Grand Blue,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Grand Blue,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Grand Blue,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Grand Blue,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Grand Blue,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Grand Blue,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Grand Blue,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Grand Blue,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Grand Blue,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Grand Blue,🙂💕
Grand Blue,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Grand Blue,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Grand Blue,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Grand Blue,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Grand Blue,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Grand Blue,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Grand Blue,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Grand Blue,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Grand Blue,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Grand Blue,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Grand Blue,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Grand Blue,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Grand Blue,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Grand Blue,Quarry should have been more entertaining than it was.
Grand Blue,"Yeah I loved the idea, and the people involved and their previous projects, but for some reason Quarry just didn't stick with me. Watched it all but hardly remember it."
Grand Blue,"It sounds like in some places you just missed the point entirely. 

Jet was a character designed to morally challenge the main characters. His motivations, hatred of the Fire Nation, were correct, but he went so far out of his way that regular people were being put in harm’s way. It makes our main characters re-evaluate their conflict and their own actions.

Aang’s blue tattoo isn’t because he’s an Avatar, it’s because he’s an air nomad, and most people really don’t care to notice him. Whenever they go into enemy territory, where people *would* recognize him, especially towards the end when he goes to the Fire Nation, he wears a disguise or hides himself.

Zuko and Azula’s character arcs are really well done by the end. Azula went completely crazy as a result of wanting to be desired and praised by her father (which was never going to happen), and Zuko learned to move beyond hatred and anger and found forgiveness in his heart. He finally moved past his own self-hatred like Iroh pleaded with him to. Their final Agni Kai isn’t just a big explosive action scene, it’s representative of an internal battle for Zuko, as he’s fighting against someone that is as ruthless and angry as he used to be. Katara saving the day & helping Zuko is also representative of her finally forgiving him instead of resenting him for what he had done. They finally became true friends in that moment. 

Both Zuko and Aang’s stories are mature. Aang’s people are dead, he’s a child, oh and by the way he’s been told his whole life how he has to save the world or else it’ll die. He acts childish as a coping mechanism for the unbelievable stress of being “the chosen one” at age **10**.

Sokka’s plans are oftentimes stupid and don’t work at the start, hence why nobody listens to him. His entire character arc is learning to be a good soldier, but an even better leader. By the end of the show, his plans work and are even the key to saving the day a number of times. He *is* the comic relief character, but it’s because he has to learn to grow up and stop “playing” soldier. By the end he is a mix of funny and serious in a way that he wasn’t before.

The magic system IMHO is liked because there is no “best power”. Every power is balanced, powerful, and yet weak when confronted with other factors, and even the most powerful abilities like lightning-bending are extremely dangerous and could kill the user. It’s also a visually exciting system as it combines magic & martial arts, leading to visually stunning moments.

Finally, the finale of the show is literally the culmination of everything it’s set up. Aang has finally mastered the elements, and Ozai is in his most powerful state thanks to Sozin’s comet, which is always how the show was going to end from day one. The “life-bending” from the Lion-Turtle isn’t a deus ex machina, it’s a skill the character learned in an earlier episode that was not shown to the audience to make for a great reveal. If Aang had life-bended without the island episode & Lion-Turtle setup, then it would’ve been a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his taking away of Ozai’s bending is hugely impactful, because he finally found a way to stop him without killing him, as everyone told him he was supposed to do. Life-bending itself isn’t without consequence either, TLA & Korra both show that it is a grave and irreversible punishment, but it shows that Aang has grown to be mature enough to accept that he has to do what needs to be done, but does not need to go overboard. 

You don’t have to like it, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but to post this haughty word salad of a post on here and then to tack on the “I can name ten animated shows far superior” at the end just makes it seem like you’re farming for outrage. Like it or don’t, but don’t come on to Reddit and act like you’re some trailblazer for having an opinion."
Grand Blue,It's pretty good for being a kids cartoon
Grand Blue,"I used to think it was overrated too.

Then I watched it."
Grand Blue,Its actually one of the best written cartoons of all times with an extremely well thought out story arc that incorporated a rich backstory with characters with clear motivations that is very hard to duplicate. Almost every character and location is a full fleshed out idea and could be its own show.
Grand Blue,"I’ve seen it mentioned that Combustion Man didn’t stop because by that point it was personal. Having lost a group of kids twice already he wanted to take them out. 

An Earth bender could have taken out the Fire Nation capital, but perhaps they want minimal collateral. Fire Nation works just take everyone out, but that doesn’t mean other nations would. 

Admiral Zhao vs the fish. They were the moon and the ocean spirit. They’d taken on a physical form on Earth so by killing the moon spirit, Zhao effectively broke the moon and water bending. 

Wood is not a bendable item. That was the whole issue with that jail cell

Azula had hinted in The Island (or whatever the episode was called) that there were skeletons in her closet where she says my own mother thought I was a monster. Then there’s the whole party scene that happened where she opens up to Ty Lee. After The Day of Black Sun she comes after Zuko. You can argue there that she has begun to slip. Then there’s The Boiling Rock where she loses Mai and Ty Lee and then Sozin’s Comet where the one person she had also leaves her. That all leads into her paranoia and her collapse

Jet was being blinded by his hatred for the Fire Nation, going after the innocent. His crew were trying to tell him that sometimes you should let things go. Katara and Aang were too naive that she trusted him when she shouldn’t have

The Great Divide wasn’t that good. However, spiders in real life can climb vertical objects. Avatar doesn’t have real life animals in it (other than the Earth King’s bear , Bosco) so who knows what they can do. Also, you’re complaining about realistic physics in a show where bending and spirits exist

As for Ozai, didn’t they have a whole scene where they realised the guy is just a normal looking dude from his baby photo. That was probably to show that anyone can end up a bad guy. The episode where there was that dance party was more of the same really. Showed that not everyone in the Fire Nation is bad.

Downvote guy and the turtle was pulled out of nowhere

Katara did ruin the Agni Kai but I’ve heard it said that by attacking Katara, that’s where Azula lost. She broke the rules

Which of Zuko and Aang’s story is childish? One deals with genocide and the other abuse. Nothing childish here"
Grand Blue,"You raise some good points. For example, the deus ex machina ending is definitely a popular criticism of the show. It helps that Korra does a good job using it, and it fits into the themes of Atla. But it's definitely a valid criticism.

What isn't though is the vast amounts of minor nitpicks you have about the show. It's not that it's exactly bad to have them, but they take up too much of your argument, they are really minor details that every show has, and especially a lot of them can easily be explained in the show itself. 

The wooden cage criticism is especially bizarre. The fire benders know it's prisoners are earth benders. It makes complete sense to lock them in there for the time being. That season has also shown many times that other nation bender's live in the fire nation. So I'm not sure why you're confused they have wooden cages. 

Boom man is another example. I'm not sure how more obvious the show can make it that he has a personal vendetta again the gang. 

For future reference I would stay away from nitpicking. It's really hard to do correctly and just weakings your overall argument.

Also you should definitely try checking out Korra it's in my opinion a way better show. While the overall show is not as consistent as Avatar. It does a lot of more interesting things in its characters and plot than Avatar ever attempted."
Grand Blue,Hello 30 yo guy who just found out Avatar.
Grand Blue,"Eh, I'm a fan of Avatar and I think it's overrated. In terms of children's cartoons (90% of which are trash & have no thought put into them), it's the GOAT, but I don't think it's the best show ever made. I don’t even think it's a masterpiece."
Grand Blue,">  I can name 10 right away that are far superior.

Yes, do that, at least this post will give me a watch list then."
Grand Blue,"I agree with you in regards to comedy, it falls in to those constant anime tropes. That was my only criticism."
Grand Blue,"I enjoyed it. It was definitely a kid's show as you never truly felt that the main characters were in peril.

You're right about Azula's turn to crazy being a 1 episode thing - it came on fast like in Game of Thrones when Dany turned evil for reasons to wrap up the show.

I still enjoyed it for what it is."
Grand Blue,[deleted]
Grand Blue,"Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale. Once Mai and TyLee betrayed her she became increasingly paranoid and stressed. So much to the point her bending style changed. Notice as early as the southern raiders she started using closed fists when firebending. She never did that anytime else prior, it was always two fingers. Also, her facial expressions and the things she was saying were definitely out of character. It progressively got worse until she started hallucinating and then having a full breakdown after losing in the finale.

You’ve seemed to have missed A LOT of detail in this show overall and made some very bold statements that indicated you didn’t really pay attention or understand a lot of the episodes or characters.For example somehow you think Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol. Or even questioning why combustion man didn’t stop when Zuko ordered him too…. like dude Team Avatar had already injured him by that point and it was personal. Besides, the fire lord would’ve rewarded him far more than Zuko ever could have. 

Therefore, I don’t think your judgment can be accurate. Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe. But your opinion is your opinion I guess. And.. that’s all I’m going to touch out of your essay lol."
Grand Blue,"I think they HAD to be able to look at the eclipse, so that they could know when it was about to end and be prepared for the fire nation soldiers getting their powers back.

It's about knowing how much time you've gt in such a critical mission."
Grand Blue,"I guess you are right about Jet but he should've been in series longer or atleast his death should've had more impact.

And I can see your Katara not listening to Sokka, but he has had great plans too.

Katara had already forgiven him, there was an entire episode dedicated towards that, that doesn't justify the moment she stole from Zuko and my problem isn't that Azula became crazy but she did it in like one episode, having authority can possibly make her crazy but not so fast.

I know Aang's childish he's 10. I'm just saying the feel and tone of his story doesn't flow well with Zuko's many times.

Yeah still not a fan of bending, Earth Bending just felt way too OP for me.

Spirit bending is dues ex machina, It literally fits perfectly in the definition of a dues ex machina, Aang has a conflict what do we do? Conveniently gets a power that allows him to win without killing Ozai, not only has Aang already killed before this conflict just came out of nowhere. Aang didn't went out to learn it or anything, he just was swept away and he got it from the turtle, he just got it. Keeping it a surprise doesn't make the moment better. Just because we saw scene with Aang & lion turtle doesn't mean it's not a Deus ex machina anymore.

Here's a video that might explain it better 
https://youtu.be/jdBnR_Dx4ow

And farming for outrage really? Anyone with different opinions than you is farming for outrage now? I literally gave the positives of the show at first and never called it a horrible show, even if I had I can have my opinion that a show is garbage or a masterpiece, and I literally gave reasons on why I think it's overrated unlike what people at r/unpopularopinions do"
Grand Blue,"Yeah I agree, but it's not one of the best shows ever, it isn't even one of the best animated shows imo"
Grand Blue,I used to think it was great. Then i watched it and didn't like it.
Grand Blue,Opposite for me
Grand Blue,"I watched twice(One alone, one with my girlfriend), yeah is one of the best cartoons produced ever in America, but that shows how bad the system is.  


Personally, I wouldn't say is a 9.2 in imdb, maybe a 8.5 at most, but even stuff like regular show is better than Avatar."
Grand Blue,If this is one of the best written cartoon there must not be that many great cartoons then
Grand Blue,"Combustion man was literally doing that for money and Zuko told him he'd pay more.

Jet was a good character that could've been fleshed out so much more, he just died and no one remembers him now.

Wood isn't bendable but you are in """"fire"""" nation, do you still don't get the problem?

IDC what Katara did that was Zuko's moment, not hers. Didn't Zuko just learned a pure form of fire bending? So that shouldve been used.

Zuko's story is mature while Aang's story is childish, they are just having fun meeting fun characters and occasionally running in problems.

The turtle thing and his conflict just came out of nowhere."
Grand Blue,"That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts but does many things right, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably

And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters"

Grand Blue,"> The magic system annoyed me as they turned into wizards and not martial artists.  
  
The show convincingly portrays bending as an extension of a bender's limbs rather than simple spellcasting. It even showcases different bending styles (compare Toph's bending to the average earthbending, or Azula's bending to Zuko's)."
Grand Blue,"Harry Potter actually did start very weak but it got better and better, really kicked the high gears from Prisoner of Azkaban. It's one of the best ya series out there and has many great characters.

Chosen one trope can work but didn't in Avatar for me."
Grand Blue,">Most of this is so wrong lol. But I’m only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale.

I guess, I don't remember lol

>Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn’t mean to be actually funny lol

No, he was always meant to be a comedic relief it's so obvious & Yes Sokka was cringey too. I like him but his comedy is just not upto the mark.

>Also… Appa didn’t fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe

I meant to say, It 'feels' like Appa moves really fast and the scale the show never convinced me the scale of the world at all."
Grand Blue,Makes sense tbh
Grand Blue,Jets death is one of the best scenes in the show.
Grand Blue,And  m night shyamalan is a stealing a living
Grand Blue,I think there is a lot of great adult cartoons to compare Avatar to now but at the time it was like comparing avatar to the Simpsons clearly there is a jump in quality. We have a lot of shows like avatar now both live action and cartoon but for a time it was really something special
Grand Blue,there aren't
Grand Blue,"The wooden jail cell was made to hold earth benders in. Similar to the metal ship prison and water bender prison, the fire nation was prepared to deprive other benders. Air benders couldn't be cut off so they killed everyone. 

Jet is the only character we encounter that died, I wouldn't say he is forgotten. He was a major representation for the increasing danger they faced. 

Zukos ""pure form"" of firebending is redirecting lighting, which he uses to save Katara when Azula attacks her. Because he almost doesn't make it, he still takes a major electric blow and if Katara didn't step in azula would have killed him. 

And as for Aangs story being childish, his 12. Him having to grow up too fast and being reluctant is a main plot point."
Grand Blue,"They wouldn’t use a wooden cell for a fire bending prisoner. They’d use something like the cooler at The Boiling Rock. 

Katara wasn’t smart in that Agni Kai, that is true. 

Perhaps downvote guy is in denial? Actually he was unaware until he found out a few episodes in. He got mad about it and the whole Avatar State happened. Then later it’s shown the Avatar State scares him so maybe he didn’t want to go to that place emotionally again? Also, different personalities between Zuko and Downvote Guy. One desperately wants approval from his father and what he feels is rightfully his, believing his nation is the best due to propaganda (…what a great lie that was. They hate us - Zuko, Day of Black Sun). 

The other, very much a kid and didn’t want that to change (Why didn’t you tell us you were the Avatar? Because I never wanted to be). See how the other monks’ treated him when it was revealed he was the Avatar? How decisions were being made for him by the adults. He didn’t want that responsibility so he wanted to hang on to the good times. 

I don’t think Aang takes a human life at any point in the show."
Grand Blue,">And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

I mean the show does do that. It has Zuko run up to him saying[""the mission is off"", ""I won't pay you if you continue"", and ""I'll pay double for you to stop.""](https://youtu.be/TbiqQecHzKo?t=201) As I said, I'm not sure how much more obvious they could make it.  

>Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters

Sure, and those are valid points. But it makes it hard for others to get to those points after you bogged everything down with nitpicks.

>That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably.

Yeah, I definitely think you will appreciate Korra. It's very in line with that idea. It doesn't always succeed but when it does those moments are way better than anything found in Avatar."
Grand Blue,"They all hate you because dissenting opinions are frowned on here. Even when as thoroughly explained as yours. Personally, I never got the hype either. I got a few episodes in before realizing that it was only a show intended for small children, and I wasn't the target demographic. Based on the Reddit hype, I had wrongly assumed it was more an all ages show. Not that all ages couldn't enjoy it, but it's specifically geared towards children."
Grand Blue,90% of these shows came out after avatar or weren't airing in the US at the time. This is like saying Romeo and Juliet is not as good as twilight.
Grand Blue,Just running across this thread. Clone Wars is not even the best Star Wars cartoon. It doesn’t even come close to top 10 cartoons of all time.
Grand Blue,I think you just really like sci fi.
Grand Blue,[deleted]
Grand Blue,Which meant nothing for the show
Grand Blue,I've heard season 4 didn't happen because of his movie lmao
Grand Blue,"Well in my opinion: the tom and jerry show, courage the cowardly dog, dexters laboratory, Craig of the creek, then ren & stimpy show, invader zim, ninjago, the amazing world of gumball, any looney tunes show, adventure time, the regular show, apple and onion, spongebob squarepants. So basically what im trying to say is: there are"
Grand Blue,Standard is pretty low then
Grand Blue,"Yeah so you are making a jail in fire bending nation only for water benders? Who aren't even gonna be there?

Yeah idk wasn't a fan of Jet.

I'm not saying Aang is childish I mean he is, but his story and Zuko's story felt very different like two different shows. 

Zuko's pure form isn't lightning he didn't go there to learn lightning redirecting, he wasn't able to produce fire efficiently, he didn't see colorful lighting there he saw fire"
Grand Blue,"You dont think Aang took any human life??
Well https://youtu.be/PYmLKzgLbUo"
Grand Blue,"Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

And yeah maybe you are right about the boom man, He was an actual threat lol like Azula which Aang never defeated, so unbelievable that Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series."
Grand Blue,People are downvoting because they are not thinking of the show in the context it was created. I can't think of many things before this time on American TV and especially for children come close to avatar.
Grand Blue,"“A few episodes in.” So…. the episodes before it even touches on grieve, misogyny, war, dishonor, genocide, or any of the characters developed / any world building happened…. wtf? It’s literally only childish for the first 8 episodes. There’s a reason it has a huge fanbase with a wildly varying demographic."
Grand Blue,Wtf is this argument? I think these shows are better who cares if they came out in seperate years & 3 of these came before avatar so 30%
Grand Blue,"If your argument is a comparison, its probably a bad argument."
Grand Blue,I like fantasy much more
Grand Blue,"I mean it's ya and I'm 18 so yeah maybe, but I think HP got more mature as it went on that's why people like it so much, you stopped at book 3 but that's when the series gets even better maybe it's not for you."
Grand Blue,what do you mean? It meant a lot in the show. I think you might have been doing something else while watching this show.
Grand Blue,"Season 4 didn't happen because the story was over.

It was always planned as a 3 season arc"
Grand Blue,Did you comment to a thread that is over a month old? Also did you ignore all the points I made and listed shows that share none of the ground breaking things I stated?
Grand Blue,.....dude idk why your writing like an ass again but you wrote like 2 pages of the show. You have a little bit of a strange hard on for this show.
Grand Blue,"Yes. Fire nation specifically created the water bending jail and rounded up all of the south pole bender and brought them to the fire nation. The do similar things to earth kingdom benders. The wood was to stop earth benders. Iirc they knew that team avatar was in the fire nation at that point but I imagine it was meant for general earth nation benders that may attack the main land. 

If you're talking about when Zuko meets the dragons, he didn't learn a new form of firebending, he learned a new source within himself to replace his original, rage and anger. He was never going to produce flames like the dragons. He uses what he learned from them the remainder of the series. Im talking about when Iroh teaches him how to handle Azulas lightning."
Grand Blue,Forgot about that. You got me there. Unless that’s the Ocean Spirit doing stuff
Grand Blue,">Idk atla fans hate that series too much. Maybe someday I'll watch it.

They also think an overrated show is the best thing ever. What do they know, in all seriousness though, it's up to you if you wanna watch it. I'm just recommending it.

>Ozai isn't even in top 3 best villians of the series.

Yeah, Ozai's my biggest issue with the original series. He is a pretty boring villain and Mark Hammil hams him up too much, ruining any fear factor he could've had.

That's another thing Korra thankfully fixes."
Grand Blue,Context doesn't make a show more enjoyable though. Just because a TV show was good for the time doesn't make it any good now.
Grand Blue,I can
Grand Blue,hahah someone is a little grumpy. You know you don't need to like everything everyone else likes?
Grand Blue,It also matters a lot when things come out. actually.
Grand Blue,.....What? Hahaha
Grand Blue,What did it meant? At the end?
Grand Blue,"Hardly, there was plenty of story to be told and they even continued doing it in the comics which have been releasing since 2012"

A Year In Space,"**'The Last of Us' Casting Process**

> Gabriel Luna: **Well, casting for The Last of Us ended up being a pretty rapid process. They had some interest, and my team called over and asked if I was interested. And, of course, I was.** It’s a wonderful project with great people involved. **Shortly after they mentioned they were interested, I started playing the first game just to have a sense of the story and to get a handle on the character.** My approach is to always prepare as if you have the job, in the event that you might get it.


> Gabriel Luna: **And then they asked if I’d be willing to throw something down for them, so I made a tape with one scene from the game and one scene from the first episode.** And shortly after that, Craig Mazin, Neil Druckmann and Carolyn Strauss wanted to talk. So, all in all, it was a six-day process from the time they were interested to the time they offered me the role. 


**Playing Tommy**

> Gabriel Luna: **I felt it was important to play through it and get a true sense of what Jeffrey Pierce had done with Tommy’s voice and performance capture in the games. So as I played through it and familiarized myself with Tommy, it became more and more evident that we were in the same channel, energy wise, historically and culturally.** There were a lot of similarities there. After Craig and Neil watched my tape, they told me that they saw the soul of Tommy, and I started to understand what they were saying as I was being introduced to Tommy. That said, knowing the place where he was born and raised, it felt pretty natural to play him.



> Gabriel Luna: **What’s interesting is we talk about him like he’s a real person. Having been created 10 years ago, he has a history with the fans and a place in the gaming space, character wise. So you approach it somewhat like a biopic about a person that exists in life.** I tried to absorb what I believed to be important and what the gamers are going to hope for in a true translation of the game."
A Year In Space," “Having been created 10 years ago, \[Tommy\] has a history with the fans and a place in the gaming space, character wise.""

I haven't even seen this yet but if this is the attitude he takes, it is no wonder people are saying it is a hit."
A Year In Space,TIL: Tommy was played by the actor who played Ghost Rider in Agents of Shield.
A Year In Space,Glad he's getting big roles. Maybe mcu will keep him as ghost rider too
A Year In Space,Personally I would love if the show filled in some of the bad stuff that Joel and Tommy had to do to survive the intervening twenty years.
A Year In Space,[deleted]
A Year In Space,"Haven't seen him in anything else before, but man he killed it as Tommy."
A Year In Space,"This guy is Tommy 

He was really good"
A Year In Space,"""So you approach it somewhat like a biopic about a person that exists in life.""


Great way to look at it.  You then end up with a character that has been proven to work within the intended universe.  Not a reinterpretation that seems to be struggling within it's own reality."
A Year In Space,I'm glad he played the game before even being cast. He showed initiative and was willing to go straight to the source material to better inform himself
A Year In Space,I didn't realize that was him. Nice!
A Year In Space,Is he related to Diego luna?
A Year In Space,Come on Kevin. Give this man his own Ghost Rider show.
A Year In Space,Without spoiling anything. I’m excited to see how he approaches Tommy becoming more ruthless later in the story.
A Year In Space,"""Y'all got any towels or anything?"""
A Year In Space,[removed]
A Year In Space,Seems like everyone really did their hw for this show. That is really nice for the fans of the game.
A Year In Space,"I really thought this should have been two separate episodes.  It seemed like everyone disagreed with it me, but then I listened to the official podcast and Craig Maizin literally talks about how this should have been two episodes."
A Year In Space,Oh yeah. He was the Ghost Rider.
A Year In Space,Forever sad his Ghost Rider show got cancelled :c
A Year In Space,He was a pretty good Terminator in Dark Fate also.
A Year In Space,He was great as an undercover DEA agent in the 2014 action series 'Matador'.
A Year In Space,"His voice is spot on for Tommy, though it seems like he's going to have a more youthful take on the character. A little early to tell after just one episode, but I'm really pleased with all the casting."
A Year In Space,"Man, >!Tommy was fucking terrifying in the game. That section when he starts sniping dudes to try to get to Abby was fucking insane. He's so nice usually, so seeing that was messed up!<"
A Year In Space,"TLOU2 has to be the most consistently spoiler-tagged piece of media I’ve seen on Reddit. Even when some people are ragging on it hard, they tag the spoilers or refer to events vaguely.

I haven’t played it yet, so it’s very much appreciated."
A Year In Space,When they get there my big hope is that >!they'll tell the sniper section from his point of view.!<
A Year In Space,[removed]
A Year In Space,"He sounds exactly like Jeffery Pierce (the guy who played Tommy in the games) in the show. I swear, I thought he was dubbing him due to how similar they sound."
A Year In Space,Seeing where Tommy >!ends up in TLOU2 !< will give Gabriel so much to bite on in terms of character growth and range as the seasons progress.
A Year In Space,"That’s what’s so exciting for me as a fan of the game; it genuinely seems to be the attitude of the whole cast and crew, and it absolutely leaked through in that first episode. The attention to detail and character work, along with the extra depth added, were all absolutely on point."
A Year In Space,"I'm a *big* fan of both of the games for their ability to move me and make me think and feel things. Even if I didn't want to think or feel them. Even if I disagreed with them. I still appreciated the games for what they were. A powerful and moving story full of flawed, hurt, and scared people.

I was certain that the show wasn't going to do TLoU justice, and that it wouldn't hit the same notes as the game did.

I was wrong. It's *the* *best* adaptation I've yet to experience. Shit, the first episode is pretty much a frame for frame, and both Pascal's reserved gruff demeanour, and Luna's laconic delivery are almost perfect depictions of Joel and Tommy. And Ramsey as Ellie is amazing. Ashley Johnson did a fantastic job bringing Ellie to life and giving her depth in the games, but Bella Ramsey has captured Ellie so well I now have a hard time visualising the original depiction in my head.

Now, I know it's early days yet and we only have the first episode, but I can't help get the feeling that every single person working on this show respects the source material for what it is, and not what packaging it came in originally. And it shows.

I'm no longer hesitantly excited for this. I'm just plain excited. For those of you that don't know The Last of Us story, please, for your own sake, go in blind.

And mind that 35 minute mark. It a doozy."
A Year In Space,"He was already a fan of the game by the time he started working on the project, as was the showrunner Craig Mazin. So I guess just like Henry Cavill he basically imitated the voice of the character as closely as he could.

By contrast, Bella Ramsay was apparently told not to play the game so it didn't inform her performance too much, but from the little that I've seen from the game she embodies Ellie perfectly in voice and attitude alone so I'm thinking she didn't listen to them and at least watched extensive cutscenes lol"
A Year In Space,"They announced at one point he was getting his own Ghost Rider show, but I haven't heard about that in a while and I assume it's dead. 

But it would be dope to have him show up in the next Doctor Strange, or maybe Blade, even if just in the after-credits to tease a Midnight Suns something-or-other.  Get Ghost Rider, Blade, Dr. Strange, maybe Elsa Bloodstone, Jack Russel, and Ted to round out the lineup."
A Year In Space,His voice is so spot on. It’s almost uncanny how accurate it is.
A Year In Space,"Yes, amazingly so, in the games Tommy behaves in a way that screams ex-military without it ever being confirmed I believe. Luna’s performance has that same way of carrying himself and they put in the sticker on his truck to confirm that detail and flesh him out. Combined with the voice being almost pitch perfect Gabriel Luna is absolutely representing and embodying the role"
A Year In Space,"He absolutely is an accurate representation of the games. As are all of the cast so far, I don’t wanna spoil anything but I’m looking forward to the way they develop him in future episodes."
A Year In Space,"We see a bit less of Tommy in the start of the game compared to the show, but definitely an excellent representation of the character. I loved getting a few more scenes with him, which provided a lot more context about his character, his relationship with Joel, and the events that lead to them meeting up the night of the outbreak to try to escape the city together. Really fantastic performance by Gabriel Luna too, IMO."
A Year In Space,"He's pretty perfect as Tommy. 

Looks absolutely nothing like Tommy, but once they cast Pedro Pascal they had to cast someone who could be seen as Pedro's brother. 

He does sound exactly like Tommy, though.  Both Pedro and Gabriel grew up in Texas, so I guess it's not surprising that they know how to sound Texan."
A Year In Space,"He is *by far* the closest to the games of the show cast. Voice, mannerisms, and body language is just spot on."
A Year In Space,"Other than changing the characters from White to Latino, Tommy and his brother Joel from the show are pretty much identical to their video game counterparts. 

How Show Tommy has acted and behaved is very similar to how Video Game Tommy acted and behaved up to that point in the story."
A Year In Space,"Physically, no, but I didn’t care about that bc Pedro and Bella don’t really resemble Joel and Ellie anyway. However he’s definitely nailed his voice, cadence and general demeanor."
A Year In Space,"I don't want to be mean but Tommy in the first game is kind of a nothing character, the show is already handling him inherently better lol. No sane person would  have intense sentimental value over his OG role"
A Year In Space,"So far, yes. But we don't really see a lot of Tommy in the beginning of the game so we have to see how he looks in later parts of the season"
A Year In Space,"Surprisingly, they aren't. They do look alike, besides the skin color. Their head shape and their eyes sort of look similar."
A Year In Space,Most badass character in the MCU besides Punisher imo
A Year In Space,It’s messed up that we’ve had two ghost riders in the last twelve years or so and neither of them are confirmed to be a part of the MCU
A Year In Space,"Definitely, *Dark Fate* unfortunately wasn't as good as I had hoped it would have been, but it wasn't due to him, he was great."
A Year In Space,Is that show any good? The ratings are pretty terrible
A Year In Space,On god I didn't >!catch on that it was Tommy until they either showed him or outright said it and I flipped my shit.!< God that game is so good moment to moment.
A Year In Space,"I hope in the show they show the transition more, it seemed pretty sudden in the game."
A Year In Space,I'd try to play it before watching the show. The reason it's so controversial is almost entirely due to how viscerally you experience the game.
A Year In Space,"It's a great game in my opinion. Very realistic, gritty combat and a fairly risky style of storytelling. 100% worth your time to play it when you get around to it"
A Year In Space,">!I think that section works much better not knowing it’s him until after it’s basically over. Having to go through what is a pretty grueling and terrifying section only for it to be revealed that a character the player likes is entirely responsible takes that section to the next level!<

>!That along with the Ellie fight are my favorite parts of the game due to how effective they are at role reversal. Being on the other side of what you’ve been directly doing to people for the entire game makes you realize how fucking terrifying the “good” guys actually are!<"
A Year In Space,"I feel like when adapting the second game they could do a lot more with Tommy. I liked his arc in the second game, but there’s still a lot that I want to see during that timeframe, especially if Gabriel Luna is playing him. 

It seems that the first season is having Tommy play a somewhat more important role, but time will tell if they continue with that."
A Year In Space,"IMO you've nailed it when you say its about the attitude of the people working on the project. When they see the IP and their main thought is to give it justice instead of trying to make it better or even worse, rewriting it."
A Year In Space,It definitely helps the creator/writer of the game is the co-showrunner and even writes and directs a few episodes.
A Year In Space,"So I finished it last night. It was ok. From the perspective of someone who knows nothing about the game, it was a little boring but the acting kept me in. Whether or not it will continue to, is tbd."
A Year In Space,"I keep hearing about this show, but I've never heard of the game until now. Is this still worth watching as someone unfamiliar with the game?"
A Year In Space,They cancelled his ghost rider show. And thankfully- it wasn’t Kevin feige produced so it woulda been in the same limbo as lots of those other pre Disney plus marvel shows
A Year In Space,That show was a casualty of the transition from Marvel Television to Marvel Studios. I think they will be bringing him back eventually though.
A Year In Space,"Yeah, I actually had to look up if they just cast the voice actor.

Which they actually did do for Marlene, interestingly."
A Year In Space,"Yeah, it really had me questioning whether he was the game's voice actor. I *knew* that he wasn't, but it had me doubting myself how close the voice was."
A Year In Space,Was Joel ex-military too? That would explain his ridiculous skills.
A Year In Space,Gabriel was even born and raised in Austin where the 2003 scenes are set.
A Year In Space,"Yeah. And Pascal doesn’t really look anything like Joel. But if they nail the essence of the characters, I don’t really care"
A Year In Space,"The movie ended up being kinda ass, but he was a pretty badass Terminator too, I thought."
A Year In Space,He was awesome.
A Year In Space,"You must be a fan of Cosmic Ghostrider, then."
A Year In Space,I thought everyone was good in Dark Fate with the exception of the lead actress that was essentially the new John Connor.
A Year In Space,"It was a fun action series, a good mix of spy action & soccer team drama that didn’t take itself too seriously. Both Gabriel Luna & Alfred Molina were great. 

Unfortunately, the show aired on El Rey network & it didn’t get the necessary public exposure. The weird thing that the show was originally renewed for a second season, but couple weeks later, El Rey network ""unrenewed"" it."
A Year In Space,"I'm curious if they'll split TLOU2 into 2 seasons, and flesh out each half of the game. >!I feel like the show would benefit tremendously from spending more time with each of the cast, so we see more of Jackson and WLF. I would move the golf incident to halfway through the season after audiences have a chance to bond with the new characters, and tell Days 1-3 chronologically instead of the convoluted narrative they settled on. The back half of TLOU2 deserves *so* much more depth than what we got in the game.!<"
A Year In Space,"""Listen. I didn't take 3 years of college to write someone ELSEs story. I know I've been given this IP, but I'm going to rewrite it to my own. I also don't understand the original story in the first place, in fact I hate it, so I'm going to write it in a completely different direction than what made it popular in the first place. Oh, and remember that cool character you liked? He's a bumbling idiot now. I thought it would be funny"" - way too many live action adaptions"
A Year In Space,"I said this to another commenter the other day; people who have played the game can see the first episode is sticking to the source material and so are mega hyped from it, but from an objective viewpoint, I think the second half of the episode is a little boring for a first time viewer. A lot of worldbuilding and set up. 

For me the events in the game that correspond to the second half of this episode are by far the most boring part of the whole game; it’s basically the tutorial. The main focus of the whole thing is the dynamic between Joel and Ellie and the situations they’re forced into, and they’ve only just met, the real story’s barely begun.

Although I must say, I think they nailed the tension in the pre-infection scenes, I loved the way they done that. If the show continues to adapt the way they have so far, basically everything from here on out will keep topping itself."
A Year In Space,"Yeah definitely; the show basically adapts the events of the game and adds extra scenes for detail, so you don’t have to be a fan of the game or anything to get what’s going on, the show sets up everything on its own and can very much be watched as it’s own thing"
A Year In Space,"Oh yeah it was also for Hulu, it might have been as lame as the Hellstrom series they did over there."
A Year In Space,"Marlene's actress was an actress before getting cast in the game, so easy transition. Plus, as she put it, aged into her role"
A Year In Space,When Tommy was on the phone from jail he sounded so much like the game's VA.
A Year In Space,Tommy's actor is in the show. Obviously not as Tommy though
A Year In Space,"I don’t believe he was. He had Sarah when he was around 16 or so, and the mom was never really in the picture since they have virtually no pictures of her in the house."
A Year In Space,I'm talking about the Agents of Shield Ghost Rider.
A Year In Space,Hell yeah
A Year In Space,"Same. Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna were fantastic but (and I can't even remember the actor or character's name any more) the new John Connor character wasn't great, and the actress couldn't do anything to elevate the material."
A Year In Space,spy action and...soccer team drama? what
A Year In Space,Convoluted?
A Year In Space,"I watched it yesterday without having played the game and will say it very much felt like the run around meet everyone learn how to interact with the world, navigate and use items part of a tutorial just in tv form."
A Year In Space,"Well. Since people are going to downvote for a fucking opinion, instead of using it how they are supposed to (does the post contribute to the discussion) i will say what I wanted to say: big fat fuckin' nothinburger that wouldn't get a second watch from me if it weren't carried by the ok writing, and the amazing acting. Repeat. Big. Fat. Nothin. Burger.

AKA, it was not good."
A Year In Space,I'm happy they did this. I love Anna Torv but I wish they'd kept Annie Wersching
A Year In Space,"Interesting that they didn’t want Annie Wersching for Tess. She’s an actress too, and basically the same age as Anna Torv"
A Year In Space,Most voice actors are also actors.
A Year In Space,"Same with Joel and Ellie's VAs, though they've been keeping coy about their role."
A Year In Space,"He would have been 24 when he had Sarah, maybe 20 at a push if the show has aged Sarah up a few years. Remember he's 36 and Sarah definitely isn't 20."
A Year In Space,Read the rest of their comment.
A Year In Space,"‘Matador’ is ‘Covert Affairs’ meets ‘Ted Lasso’ 

In the show, the CIA suspects that the owner of a professional soccer team in LA is involved with drug cartel & other shady groups. They recruit an undercover DEA agent, played by Luna, to infiltrate the team as a soccer player & get info from the owner of the team."
A Year In Space,"Yes. TLDR, no spoilers: Part 2 tells a big section of the story backwards in a way that removes all the tension and prejudices the player against getting attached to certain characters. It introduces certain pacing and character development problems that wouldn't exist at all with a conventionally told narrative.

 >!Jumping away from a cliffhanger moment to spend literal hours going over a banal love triangle where 2 of the characters are already dead is meaningless, plus the jump from the cliffhanger to the extremely slow paced Owen and Mel bit denies any resolution to Jesse's death. The game killing off characters then trying to make us empathise with them with lengthy flashback sequences grinds the naturally ramping tension to a halt, plus since we know they're all already dead, we're not going to get attached to them. Pity, remorse, empathy, sure, but not even a chance of an attachment like with Ellie and Joel. Imagine if they started the TLOU show with the golfing incident - would we have cared about the characters then? That's essentially what they did for Days 1-3 and much of Abby's story. The narrative structure they picked prejudices the player against forming bonds since there's no tension in their outcome.!<

I just don't see how the method of storytelling they opted for would be any better than starting S2 with separate Jackson and WLF storylines that converge around episode 4, then the rest of the season being Day 1-3 chronologically. That way it maintains the tension of the story, without the tedious pacing problems of 3 hour flashbacks inside flashbacks inside the middle of the climax."
A Year In Space,"I'm all in on Anna Torv as Tess after watching the premier.  Hell, I think the entire cast is spot on."
A Year In Space,"And they altered the in-game Tess model to look more like Annie for the remake, too."
A Year In Space,Who's to say... could be scheduling conflicts.  Could be Annie doesn't want to play the same character again.  Multitudes of reasons.
Mimi and Lisa,"“Yes, I’m gonna marry a carrot”

Mimi and Lisa,"Heyheyhey, it's that actor in Maximum Overdrive!"
Mimi and Lisa,"She was really good in Dead Like Me but my favorite of her roles was City Slickers. ""It was in his car! And I'm not a little girl, I'm twenty!"""
Mimi and Lisa,She was also on the sitcom [Herman's Head](https://youtu.be/2O7YloHUes4)
Mimi and Lisa,Isn't she the midwife/nurse who helps Betty give birth in season 3 of Mad Men?
Mimi and Lisa,"She will forever be Ophelia from The Legend of Billie Jean for me. 

Loved her then, love her now."
Mimi and Lisa,"Oh, Yeardley Smith from the true crime podcast Small Time Dicks [and nothing else](https://youtu.be/1S8YMBFda6U?t=8)."
Mimi and Lisa,She totally looks like she’d talk like Lisa Simpson
Mimi and Lisa,"Rewatched a lot of Simpsons this year and came to the conclusion that Yeardley is very underrated as a voice actress. The rest of the cast gets a little more glory because they voice hundreds of characters and she only does the one, but there’s such a range of emotion in Lisa that to me is very unlike any other character on the show.

[You are Lisa Simpson](https://youtu.be/1igmzkmTv6U)

[BABOON!](https://youtu.be/6HYk3R2WedQ)

Famously they had Julie Kavner do the scene from the movie where Marge tapes over the wedding video over and over again in order to get the right weight of drama from the character. I’d be willing to bet that if that were a Lisa scene, Yeardley Smith would have had it down a little sooner because she does similar things throughout the show a lot more."
Mimi and Lisa,"https://youtu.be/xZMuBfuv1iA

Iconic"
Mimi and Lisa,"She was on Mathnet from 1987

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJDz7Py6cvA&t=1860"
Mimi and Lisa,I loved her on Mamas Family
Mimi and Lisa,"Jfc, there needs to be a moratorium on New Years Day of using celebrity images in articles that are not announcing their deaths. My heart just skipped a beat!"
Mimi and Lisa,"She was good (when she was VERY young) in her arc on Square One TV (Mathnet). I'll never forget her saying, ""here, catch!"""
Mimi and Lisa,She hosts a great true crime show called “small town dicks” & I think married one of the co-hosts?
Mimi and Lisa,Holy shiite didn't know she was married to **Detective Dan!!!**
Mimi and Lisa,She also has a solid podcast
Mimi and Lisa,Scientologist.
Mimi and Lisa,Scientologist scum.
Mimi and Lisa,Dirty work!
Mimi and Lisa,"Weird fact, but she was the voice of the droid at Jabba's palace that was assigning R2 and 3PO jobs. This was the Return of the Jedi radio drama and not the film. Her voice is heavily modified, but it's her."
Mimi and Lisa,Does no one remember her as Miss Gross from Teen Angel? Just me? Okay.
Mimi and Lisa,She's so cool.
Mimi and Lisa,I thought that said Lisa Simpson and meth.
Mimi and Lisa,"Randomly, she was an EP on a 2020 horror thriller called ""Alone"" that I recently watched. About a lady being stalked while driving for a move. Wasn't half bad, but her name as EP stuck out."
Mimi and Lisa,She's in Jingle all the way as the woman who gives Arnold her number along with a Booster doll he bought.
Mimi and Lisa,Love the long sigh before she says that.
Mimi and Lisa,That whole episode is insanely quotable
Mimi and Lisa,"Her pleading/annoying delivery of ""Cuuuurtis"" throughout that movie is engrained in my brain."
Mimi and Lisa,The clerk from city slickers
Mimi and Lisa,She looks 15 and 45 in that movie
Mimi and Lisa,WE MADE YOUUUUUUUUU
Mimi and Lisa,City Slickers is one of those movies I’ll watch whenever I see it on. Doesn’t matter the part I’ll watch it. I just love that movie. Part 2 wasn’t as good but I’ll watch it too if I see it. But part 1 is one of my favourite comedies of all time.
Mimi and Lisa,I came looking for someone to mention this. “Gooooodd party.”
Mimi and Lisa,I think Hank Azaria is also on it. Both Simpsons alum.
Mimi and Lisa,And guest starred on [Mama’s Family](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0640623/)
Mimi and Lisa,Thanks you so much for this .  I have been trying to remember the damn name of that show.
Mimi and Lisa,I wasn’t appreciated this [reference](https://youtu.be/jQbF-PwpBw0) in the  Simpsons.
Mimi and Lisa,Jesus what a blast from the past
Mimi and Lisa,"Yes, it is."
Mimi and Lisa,"“Cause he’s a fucker, that’s why.” Edited to add she actually played Putter, not Ophelia."
Mimi and Lisa,I think it was in an AMA that someone asked her about that movie and she hilariously responded with an apology for it
Mimi and Lisa,And fired her best friend out of sheer greed.
Mimi and Lisa,Was a cool podcast until she ditched her friend out of greed. Money does shitty things to people
Mimi and Lisa,*town
Mimi and Lisa,"I just posted about this before scrolling down, glad someone else called this out
Here, catch!"
Mimi and Lisa,The Keek!
Mimi and Lisa,Yeah she is married to a cop from the shitty police force in my town. Our cops are extra scummy here.
Mimi and Lisa,"That’s Nancy Cartwright who is the voice of Bart and a lot of other characters

Good try tho"
Mimi and Lisa,"You're thinking of Nancy Cartwright who does Bart's voice.

Yeardley Smith does Lisa's voice."
Mimi and Lisa,"""...is you dead??"" My family quotes that all the time."
Mimi and Lisa,For me it’s her blood-curdling scream.

Mimi and Lisa,That’s the waitress
Mimi and Lisa,"my siblings & i still semi-regularly shout “if hate were people, i’d be china!” to each other."
Mimi and Lisa,"on a way off side note, it took me a few years before I realized 3 of the 5 main Simpsons stars had roles in the ‘98 Godzilla movie"
Mimi and Lisa,Oh wow I missed that episode. Thanks for posting that!
Mimi and Lisa,"I unabashedly love that movie. Its cheesy and silly and ridiculous but man the cast is just so fucking charismatic. Helen Slater was second only to Elizabeth Shue in terms of charming badassery.  

She has nothing to apologize for."
Mimi and Lisa,[deleted]
Mimi and Lisa,"Yeah, noticed after I posted but too lazy to change."
Mimi and Lisa,Joined the Church of Scientology in 1991. She gave them 10 million smackers in 2007.
Mimi and Lisa,Oh shit. My bad.
Mimi and Lisa,"Damn, the Scientologist are all over Hollywood."
Mimi and Lisa,"Yeardley has been linked to the cult though, having given them millions of dollars at various times."
Mimi and Lisa,"Yup. She fired Zibby, who didn't say much on the podcast, but actually was the one who researched and found the cases they reported on. I still listen, but it hasn't been as good since she kicked her out.

https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-simpsons-yeardley-smith-aka-lisa-simpson-accused-of-screwing-her-bff-out-of-small-town-dicks-podcast"
Mimi and Lisa,"Yeah, I thought she did both Bart and Lisa until today."
Mimi and Lisa,"Remini has left the scientology church in 2013 and has been pretty active since then against them. She was in it since she was 9, don't think she can be entirely blamed for it since she'd been brainwashed at such a young age, if anything it's great she got out of it."
Mimi and Lisa,"That they are.

On one of the episodes of her show, Leah Remini talked about the folks at scientology pushing her to try to get Kevin James into the group and even back then she realized that wasn't going to fucking happen."
Mimi and Lisa,"I don't see how the part before the comma connects to the part after it. A woman who has done over 700 episodes of a popular TV series is a millionaire? You don't say.


She's also on record praising psychiatry and seeking help for her own issues from professionals and it helped her greatly, which would pretty much be close to the number one thing someone tied to Scientology would not publicly do."
Mimi and Lisa,This article made me unsubscribe finally. I agree it hasn’t been as good as the beginning when Zibby was still on the show.
Mimi and Lisa,[deleted]
Mimi and Lisa,Leah Remini has nothing to do with The Simpsons.
Mimi and Lisa,It seems like the biggest benefit is that you get connected to others in Hollywood. Could be your way in the door? Scary recruitment tactic.
Mimi and Lisa,Typo. Fixed.
Mimi and Lisa,"What really upsets me is the gross way that Yeardley lied to their audience, claiming that Zibby quit."
Mimi and Lisa,[deleted]
Mimi and Lisa,You are correct. I must've had a serious brain fart here.
Mimi and Lisa,I love The Peripheral and some of Gibson's other books. Although I need to go back to Neuromancer. Excited for this!
Mimi and Lisa,Westworld is only getting one more season it’s really easy to follow idk what you’re talking about
Mimi and Lisa,"*The pair are still tied to Warner Bros. Discovery through “Westworld,” though the show is awaiting word on a fifth (and what Nolan says would definitely be final) season.*

Still in conversation with HBO executives over a renewal for that 5th season. Be a travesty if HBO pull the plug without giving them the chance to wrap the story!"
Mimi and Lisa,We could be in for a great first season. Then we can dip out.
Mimi and Lisa,Not sure I want those two heading anything after how Westworld panned out lol.
Mimi and Lisa,"I really hope Westworld comes back for the final season, but alas it's looking less and less likely."
Mimi and Lisa,It's so drab
Mimi and Lisa,Who’s the left actor on the photo ?
Mimi and Lisa,"Why do all the overhead shots show massive urban sprawl, while simultaneously pointing out extremely low population density?

Seems dumb as shit and hyper-fake."
Mimi and Lisa,"Honestly, Season 2 was a bit easier to follow when you binge it (Week to week was a pain in the ass), especially when paired with Season 1. But 3 onwards was...bad. Basically, once they left the park behind it was a struggle to keep watching the show (Haven't seen 4 yet)."
Mimi and Lisa,At least they got to start 2 other stories before they ever wrote 1 good one.
Mimi and Lisa,Considering the dismal ratings... I don't think too many people will be crushed. It is odd that the show hasn't been renewed. My guess is that HBO is ready to pull the plug
Mimi and Lisa,It’s *Carnivale* all over again…
Mimi and Lisa,Someone hasn't seen person of Interest
Mimi and Lisa,"You do know Nolan and Joy aren't the showrunners of *The Peripheral,* right? [Scott B. Smith](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0809895/?ref_=fn_al_nm_0) and [Greg Plageman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0686388/) are."
Mimi and Lisa,"But they're not the showrunners of *The Peripheral.* [Scott B. Smith](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0809895/?ref_=fn_al_nm_0) and [Greg Plageman](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0686388/) are. They're EPS on the project since it's being done by their company, Kilter Films, but they're not writing it."
Mimi and Lisa,"It's pretty impressive what they did with Westworld, creating a narrative literally impossible to follow, not even a fucking criminal investigator could puzzle that shit together. After season 1, yeah, good. Season 2? Oh you wanna get twisty? Motherfucker I'll show you. Fucking hell, weekly episodes and I had no idea what was happening as I was watching it. Time jumps and skips just happening randomly. Even chess players didn't have patience or focus to follow the plot."
Mimi and Lisa,"IMO, season 3 is the weakest with Season 4 being a bit stronger; I think if you liked season 2 you should check out season 4.

I’m with you on the first two seasons (I even liked it when it premiered) and never really understood the hate."
Mimi and Lisa,Watching Dolores and Maeve slow walk T-1000 style killing everyone the entire season got old quick.
Mimi and Lisa,You don't think the first season was a good story?
Mimi and Lisa,"Nobody watches established shows live anymore. I do believe, given its massive budget and the calibre of talent involved, HBO would have cancelled Westworld if they weren't happy with the numbers. It does have a huge fan base and it will only generate new viewers for years to come if it gets the closure and resolution it was supposed to.

I think they'll give it a season 5."
Black Money Love,"Most of of Patrick Sommerville's (Maniac, Station Eleven) shows are really hard to describe, let alone market.  They depend almost entirely on word of mouth.  Particularly with Station Eleven, the marketing just made people mad because they didn't get anything like what they were expecting."
Black Money Love,this show is fantastic! i’ll be really disappointed if it doesn’t get a third season.
Black Money Love,"I can call you Mary. And Mary when you call me, you can call me Earl"
Black Money Love,"The name of the show is actually Call Me By Your Earl, common misconception."
Black Money Love,[deleted]
Black Money Love,Enjoyed season 1 but can't see myself following it past that. Can't explain it.
Black Money Love,Slow moving sci Fi is a hard sell
Black Money Love,"I only watched it for Cristina Miloti and she’s great in it but I can kind of see why people didn’t lose their mind over it and it didn’t get a lot of hype, the writing is very mundane and the concepts aren’t mind blowing or anything, it could be a lot better

I saw there was a second season, still need to check it out"
Black Money Love,"I’m always following this subs calendar of show coming out. Every time I saw Made for Love I thought it was another crappy reality show despite the fact I watched the first season and really enjoyed it. 
 
On top of the name there isn’t strong marketing or interview articles to get posted here to drive interest."
Black Money Love,"It’s one of my favourites,an interesting take on the human experience."
Black Money Love,"Honestly, I can only watch Cristina Milioti as a women in distress so many times"
Black Money Love,"I quit watching after a couple of episodes. The show wasn't bad at all, just fatigued by stories about gaslit women, I guess."
Black Money Love,I just finished season two. It was very good!
Black Money Love,This show is sooo bonkers it is great! So many different layers to it like peeling onion layers and finding a gumball inside.
Black Money Love,For me each new episode got harder and harder to follow. Can’t say I loved the whole Zelda thing either.
Black Money Love,"watched the first season, don't care for it. if this show appears to have gone under the radar, it is probably because a lot of the people who have watched it don't care for it either."
Black Money Love,"It's a good show, but it consistently has inconsistencies that can be jarring, and some truly unnecessary elements that don't serve the plot or add to the characters, but at the same time it does have some brilliant moments, so it's definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it. 

Oh, and it does seem like it has good long term potential. IOW, it has a lot of room to get better (unless it gets cancelled before that happens)."
Black Money Love,"Maybe it's the name. I thought itvwas a housewife sitcome and it was a completely different show. 

It's kust awesome."
Black Money Love,I really like it! It’s strange and interesting at the same time. I like what they did with Byron’s character in season 2 and after the finale I really want to know what happens next!
Black Money Love,Watching the season 2 finale right now after a few episode binge! Great show.
Black Money Love,"I am honestly tired of the oppressed woman regaining freedom scenario, so no thanks"
Black Money Love,I really tried to enjoy it and watch it in the background and it’s not terrible by any means but woah boy it drags some times
Black Money Love,"My wife and I loved the first season so it is queued up. ~~But really Amazon sucks at marketing.~~ 

edit: my bad. Didn't realize it was just licensed in Canada to Prime."
Black Money Love,The reason I noped on it the first time was that it seemed like a rehash of her black mirror episode. Ended up loving it though.
Black Money Love,"Actually, I think the answer may partially be the lead actress: she has a rabid fanbase, from my understanding, but is not everyone's cup of tea, and that may prevent the show from getting more love. I know that's not the answer you are looking for."
Black Money Love,Thanks for the recommendation. I like the actress from Black Mirror. Will give it a try.
Black Money Love,"So, have you watched/heard of Severance?

If you like Made for Love, you’ll probably like Severance"
Black Money Love,The first season was good but the plot is not something that needs to be a second season. Especially considering the source material. Feels like its being carried by a bunch of 🤪 characters now.
Black Money Love,"Just cause you like it doesn’t make it good, it’s sitting at a 6.9 on imdb. An 8 or over is normally something you need to watch"
Black Money Love,Blame Ted Mosby.
Black Money Love,People are too busy jerking off to the latest Star Wars/Marvel show to pay attention to anything else.
Black Money Love,I watched like four or five eps and couldn’t get into it
Black Money Love,I want to give it a try because Cristin Milioti is great and should be a much bigger star but there's just so much to watch and so little time.
Black Money Love,I know I watched S1 and enjoined it but I barely remember anything about it. Hesitating on s2 cause I’m not sure if I need to rewatch s1 first. Glad to hear it’s good though
Black Money Love,The opening episode sort of put me off. I might try it again.
Black Money Love,It's on Amazon Prime in Canada. I have Crave and don't see it on that.
Black Money Love,Coz there’s 500 shows out this year.
Black Money Love,"It sounds kinda shitty, is all."
Black Money Love,"Every description of it just confused me, but people were enthusiastic, so I finally looked into it and saw the 94 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating and started it yesterday. Finished and I'm rewatching the first season now."
Black Money Love,I loved Station Eleven but I am always hesitant to recommend it because it is so unusual.
Black Money Love,Station Eleven was marvelous.
Black Money Love,"damn, maniac is one of my favorites that Netflix has produced.  I'll definitely be checking out station eleven and made for love, thanks!"
Black Money Love,Damn I loved Station Eleven! I’m trying to think back to what the marketing even was—what did people think the show was about?
Black Money Love,"I liked Maniac, even if the ending was weak. Didn't realize he also did Station Eleven. i guess I should check it out."
Black Money Love,"> Particularly with Station Eleven, the marketing just made people mad because they didn't get anything like what they were expecting.

Station Eleven made me mad because I'd rather die of a deadly pandemic than have to spend my post-apocalyptic future with fucking *theater kids*."
Black Money Love,Station 11 was so damn good
Black Money Love,Is the season 2 out yet?
Black Money Love,"I'm disappointed that I didn't know there was a second season. I just went through this with another show, too. HBO needs to do a better job of letting me know these things!"
Black Money Love,"~~It got renewed!~~

apparently it has not been renewed nor has it been cancelled"
Black Money Love,Dooo do do do. Doo do do dodo.
Black Money Love,Probably *[My name is earl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460091/)*
Black Money Love,"S2 is actually even better, not more of the same."
Black Money Love,"I had the same experience with Master of None.

I watched the first season, really enjoyed it. Haven't watched more because more isn't needed for me. That season sated my interest in the characters and the story that I feel absolutely no need to continue watching."
Black Money Love,Yeah the show is a chore to watch and therefore I dropped it.  Well done and good premise but I just do not enjoy it.
Black Money Love,Season 2 is non-essential. It goes for more emotional beats but misses the mark every time.
Black Money Love,"Marketing is terrible 

and yes you are right, the name is AWFUL 

it sounds like a reality show! what were they thinking?"
Black Money Love,"Same. Didn't even finish the first season. Something about it just wasn't very entertaining, but I can't put my finger on exactly why it didn't work."
Black Money Love,"This sub thinks anything on HBO Max is incredible and perfect. Someone in another thread got upvoted for saying every HBO Max show is better than anything Netflix has ever made. Not just HBO. HBO *Max*.

IIRC they even mentioned The Flight Attendant by name. Which is a good show but hardly amazing, ""must watch"" TV."
Black Money Love,It's on HBO.
Black Money Love,"Cristin Milioti? I've a few things she was in but I really enjoy her, what kind of bad fans are we talking?"
Black Money Love,"eh, imdb is not the end all be all, ESPECAILLY for tv shows 

there are a ton of really shit tier shows above 8 on that website."
Black Money Love,"Imdb scores are wildly inaccurate and subject to brigading.

Look at He's Expecting, a Japanese drama about a man getting pregnant. The show is tepid and unmemorable, but I wouldn't say it's bad, just okay. Imdb users have review bombed it to 1.9(something about Elon Musk I don't actually know). 

The same logic applies to Rotten Tomatoes, ""good"" is universally subjective and everyone's tastes will vary. Besides, if you're only watching and liking the things you're told to watch and like, you may have a bigger issue you need to deal with."
Black Money Love,Well 94% on RT is good even if it’s average score of 7.2/10 is less impressive.
Black Money Love,yeah marvel/disney/star wars is like the herpes of the entertainment world
Black Money Love,And that is the correct answer.
Black Money Love,I have no less than 4 people who I recommended it to (and usually appreciate my recommendations) who either noped out of it in episode 1 because it dealt with a pandemic or in episode 2 because of the radical shift in tone. I don't know how to explain to them that it's worth sticking with.
Black Money Love,Who would have thought a tuba-only rendition of Midnight Train to Georgia would be so lovely? That stuck with me like the ending of The Good Place.
Black Money Love,Really?  It's an easy rec for me.  You must know some really stiff people.
Black Money Love,"Station Eleven was brilliant until the finale. The prophet guy just walking off into an happy ending with his mom and the 100+ kids he kidnapped was disgusting (and in the book he molested them). Kirsten also had a crappy ending. Yeah, she was finally reunited with Jeeven, but she learned nothing and just stays with the Peter Pan Syndrome and repressed trauma gang."
Black Money Love,And because it falls apart.
Black Money Love,"A lot of people were expecting either The Walking Dead or The Hunger Games because that's the only context they have for post-apocalyptic fiction.

The trailers didn't give the impression that it's anything like that but they didn't give any indication that it's a show about the importance  of art and found family in recovering from trauma either.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPm52rq8CZA"
Black Money Love,"I never even saw any marketing for it at all, I only watched it coz the book had been on my list for awhile"
Black Money Love,"Hah. I enjoyed Station Eleven but this made me laugh. I remember in some parts, specifically with the younger girl, Alex I believe, I was like, this is over the top and cringe. But then I remembered the theater kids from when I was young and thought, actually, this is spot on."
Black Money Love,"Sarah annoyed the shit out of me. Definitely reminded me of some of the more pretentious theater kids I knew in school, and since I was in choir I interacted with them a lot."
Black Money Love,Made for Love?  yes.
Black Money Love,Wow I watch HBO Max all the time and I’m upset I didn’t know until right now too
Black Money Love,Where have you read that? I can't find anything about it being renewed.
Black Money Love,"That's good to hear. I've been putting off watching it.

Now I only have 6 other shows to finish before I get to it."
Black Money Love,"Personally, I felt S2 was much weaker. Certain new aspects were interesting, but even then I saw it done better with Severance."
Black Money Love,"Season 2 is *really* good though, like it's a bit different than season one and has Aziz, the character, traveling trying to figure himself out. It also gave me an obsession with *Un anno d'amore.* A decent part of the season is him in Italy learning stuff. It's cool

I did not enjoy season 3 that much, just watch 2 lol."
Black Money Love,"That feeling is definitely spot on for Season 3, but S2 was excellent and very different than S1."
Black Money Love,It's based on the book with the same name. It is a bad name for a show though.
Black Money Love,I go on HBO Max damn near every day and I've never even heard of this show and I'm super intrigued now.
Black Money Love,"same, didn't finish first season even though in theory i should like it. the whole premise of the show seems ""smart"" but then the show is just some stupid raunchy slapstick. doesn't the dad marry a blow-up sex doll or something ? and that's a recurring plot point that gets featured repeatedly. just didn't care for it."
Black Money Love,"I'm with you. Saw the first episode. Felt like torture-pron. 

I really hate how that's become a genre that likes to masquerade as other genres."
Black Money Love,"Totally agree, it just wasn't entertaining"
Black Money Love,The Flight Attendant felt like the show dragged on for far too long.
Black Money Love,"Well that's weird since I watch it on Prime.

Black Money Love,Himym fans still hate her (for no good reason) but that’s actually how i discovered her and started wanting to watch more stuff she was in
Black Money Love,Tell me about it. Call Me Earl isn’t even on imdb. /s
Black Money Love,There’s always exceptions but it’s a rarity. Made for love wasn’t brigaded it’s just ok
Black Money Love,RT is trash for TV scores. It already had flaws with movie scores but their TV scores are useless. So many mediocre shows have 100% scores because of the way TV reviews work.
Black Money Love,I had the same issue with recommending The Leftovers. People go into it expecting a sci-fi show like The 4400 or a mystery to solve like Lost. It’s really neither.
Black Money Love,"It's an HBO prestige drama that just happens to be set before and after the collapse of society.  It's not really about that.  In recommending it, I stress the themes rather the content.  I also don't recommend it to anyone who would have zero interest in seeing a free production of Hamlet playing in a park next to their home."
Black Money Love,"Okay I gave up after episode one because I really liked it but episode two felt like an ode to theater kids lol, but I’ll take your advice and try it again. I really liked the first episode."
Black Money Love,Watched the whole thing and liked it but didn’t love it. The concept seemed better than the execution and I feel like I got my fill of the show with how season 1 ended
Black Money Love,I stayed for Lori Petty. Worth it.
Black Money Love,"To be fair, the traveling musical and whatnot didn’t totally do it for me. The best parts of the show IMO dealt with modern life"
Black Money Love,And the cover art too gives you absolutely nothing
Black Money Love,"Theater kid, hippie commune kid and first generation post-pan. 

It was also probably the first time the actor did anything on screen with an American accent.  Playing it a bit over the top might help disguise places where she struggled with it a bit.  There's one scene where she hits the word ""trauma"" really hard.  The vowel sounds on that one are pretty different from the British English pronunciation."

The Lies Within,Mr Robot season 4.  Also Chernobyl.
The Lies Within,The Terror S1 is sublime.
The Lies Within,Chernobyl gets my nod.
The Lies Within,The Expanse season 3.
The Lies Within,"Was the first season of Westworld within the last 5yrs? If so, that's my pick simply because of how fun the water cooler chat effect was. Going on reddit or twitter to read about peoples' theories. Was great.

If it's older than 5yrs then I'd have to pick Severance. Brilliant concept pulled off almost perfectly."
The Lies Within,Succession season 2 is a masterpiece.
The Lies Within,"The Expanse (season 3)

Better Call Saul (Season 5 and 6)

Ozark (Season 3)"
The Lies Within,Severance Season 1.

The Lies Within,Dark seasons 1 and 2
The Lies Within,What We Do in the Shadows season 1

The Lies Within,Derry Girls
The Lies Within,Ted Lasso S1
The Lies Within,Succession season 3
The Lies Within,"Halfway through Season 2 to the end of season 3 of the Expanse. 

Imo one of the greatest seasons in Tv let alone Sci-fi."
The Lies Within,The Bear
The Lies Within,Watchmen needs to be in discussion for sure
The Lies Within,Fleabag S01
The Lies Within,Devs might be up there I think.
The Lies Within,"For drama my favorites are either The Leftovers S3, Twin Peaks revival or Better Call Saul S6. While there's still great TV, we are obviously out of the golden age of TV and simply in the peak TV era. Those are the only ones that felt like they reached the heights of golden age shows, besides maybe Watchmen.

Overall I shocked myself when I realized I would actually go with a comedy on this one. I think the single best overall season of TV since '17 is Atlanta S3."
The Lies Within,I thinknchernobyls single season may be my favorite of all time
The Lies Within,"Watchmen- the best single season show since Freaks and Geeks

Perry Mason - probably 2nd

Finished Severance today and I think it is good, but still gestating on it

Umbrella Academy Season 1 was stellar

Andor is peak Star Wars

Succession is probably cheating

The Good Place season 1 or maybe 2 or I don’t know, they were all great"
The Lies Within,Dark season 1 (really any of the seasons but I think 1 sets everything up so well and each episode is so engrossing to watch).
The Lies Within,"Ted Lasso S1

The Mandalorian S2

Bluey S1

1883"
The Lies Within,Arcane season 1
The Lies Within,"True detective s1, westworld s1 or are they older...?"
The Lies Within,"*Succession* season 2 and *Derry Girls* season 1. Not enough people give Derry Girls their due, the pilot episode is genuinely one of the best pilots I've ever seen.   >!I mean, that whole scene when they kill the nun??? Gold.!<

it's too early to say *Andor,* but just know I really want to say it, if only because they shot on real locations with beautifully constructed sets instead of the warehouse egg thing."
The Lies Within,Severance
The Lies Within,"Mare of Easttown 

Sharp Objects

Bad Sisters

Fleabag S2

Stranger Things S1"
The Lies Within,Station 11
The Lies Within,Star Trek Strange New Worlds 1st season. Which is all the more amazing after years of Discovery and Picard dunking on the original ideals of the Star Trek franchise.
The Lies Within,Bojack Horseman
The Lies Within,Better Call Saul S5 & S6
The Lies Within,Banshee.
The Lies Within,The hounting of the hill house. Not just television one of the best i watched in the last years.

The Lies Within,Invincible.
The Lies Within,"- Fleabag season 2
- Bojack Horseman season 6
- Better call saul seasons 3, 5 and 6
- Severance season 1 
- Succession season 2"
The Lies Within,"The Leftovers S3 was Spring '17, so just outside the window, but that would have been the top 

Therefore my choice is Chernobyl followed by The Americans S6, Sharp Objects, Succession S2, and The Expanse S5"
The Lies Within,S1 Severance
The Lies Within,S4 of the Magicians. Quentin’s arc was perfect.
The Lies Within,"Mindhunter

Loki

Wandavision

Helstrom

Homeland Season 8"
The Lies Within,"Arcane. Just a masterpiece of storytelling and animation. Everything about it was perfect.

Cheating mention. Westworld S1 came out 6 years ago, but I just saw it, and it was a ride. Everytime Delores was on screen I felt like my heart wasn't ready."
The Lies Within,Jack Ryan S01 would be up there for me.  Sneaky Pete S01 was also pretty solid.
The Lies Within,"What I’ve come to realize reading this thread is there are a LOT of epic shows.  I’ll try to add some I’m not seeing (completely agree with all the others mentioned):

Fargo S3

The Lies Within,I really loved Daredevil S3. That may be an unpopular opinion idk
The Lies Within,One of the Ozark seasons
The Lies Within,"This past season of Succession was amazing (although I’ve loved all of them so far). Siblings becoming unraveled, back stabbing, and the ultimate betrayal by the Father. Amazing dialogue and acting."
The Lies Within,Star Trek: Strange new worlds season 1 premiered last year and it was a real return to classic Trek story of the week format. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The Lies Within,"Haunting of hill house. It was just so well shot and thought out plot wise. Combined with the ending made it complete. The dread, tension and anxiety of the whole season is lifted and comes to a satisfying conclusion. I'd say the best conclusion in all of tv.

And Midnight Mass. I'd throw in as well because its also a mini series by the same writer and director."
The Lies Within,Succession. The White Lotus.
The Lies Within,Both seasons of Mindhunter
The Lies Within,Succession

The Lies Within,"Squid games, rings of power, Mando, running with wolves."
The Lies Within,the wire season 4
The Lies Within,"I'm sure I'll get downvoted because many think it's overrated, but as a horror and creature feature fan, I'll be damned if 'Stranger Things' Season 4 isn't one of the best damn things I've watched in some time. The character development was awesome. The main villain was so much better than any other season. The storytelling had me gripped the entire time. I couldn't stop watching."
The Lies Within,Pokémon
The Lies Within,"I know I sound like a broken record, but The English. It was the first show since Fleabag that reminded just how much I love television. Don't get me wrong--there are a lot of TV shows I've loved since Fleabag, but there are just some shows that are so special they reinvigorate your appreciation for the medium."
The Lies Within,"*Dead to me* with Christina Applegate trying really hard with her MS.

 Super emotional season and I highly recommend it."
The Lies Within,"Ted Lasso, all of it. A perfect series ."
The Lies Within,"Absolutely no love for Better Call Saul on Reddit?? 

BCS Season 6 was a masterpiece imo"
