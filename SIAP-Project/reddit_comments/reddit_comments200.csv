TV Show,Comment
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Sweety dahling!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"La Croix, sweetie. La Croix!"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Pats: Darling, you are a fabulous, wonderful individual.

Eddy: Oh, thank you.

Pats: And remember, I've known you longer than your daughter..."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I've only seen one episode. The one where they do cocaine, but they later find out it's fake. 'We've been up all night playing bloody ping pong for no reason!'"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Being from neither country, I've always thought that watching Absolutely Fabulous and then watching Sex and the City is the quickest way to get solid understanding of the basic differences between UK and US culture."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I rewatch this every couple of years, my partner hates the show so much."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Gin  and Tonic Eddie!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I‚Äôm going to be thin, 
I‚Äôm going to do thin things 

Story of my life."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"""I'm going around again!""

Still makes me laugh. Patsy on that ski lift with a bottle of wine in her hand."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I still repeat this mantra whenever I'm feeling like I'm packing on the pounds: ""This is not my fat. This is fat from another lifetime."""
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"What do you want? A statue?! A big, fat, ugly, armless statue?!

....  I've got arms!"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I love this show, my spouse and I quote it pretty often. The episode where Saffy puts on a stage play to portray her childhood trauma and Edina and Patsy end up taking it as a huge compliment is SO good."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I totally missed this show as I was very young when this was peaking. But then I discovered Kath & Kim years later and that filled the ditzy duo hole. The Aussies snapped on that one lol.  AbFab better or same vibes?
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I wish they would stream this show on Roku or Pluto or something.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"God I need to do a rewatch again. These idiots never fail to make me laugh, especially bubble. Patsy and Eddie are gonna go on my future tattoo sleeve"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Nobody remembers sapphire and steel.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"‚ÄúOne more face lift on this one and she‚Äôll have a beard.‚Äù

I aspire to be Patsy. 

Sadly, Ab Fab is also responsible for cursing us with the pathetic attempt to recreate an American version, ‚ÄúHigh Society.‚Äù  But if you‚Äôre not going to commit to well written jokes about drugs and sex then it‚Äôs going to be crap."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Wheels on fire, rolling down the roooooaad!"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I just like it when Eddie is in hospital and is seemingly hallucinating Lady Penelope at her bedside.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I remember how cool I thought I was cuz I had an abfab T-shirt in hs
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I adore this show.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,This show really symbolises the 90s. The economy was on fire and the cold war was over.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I‚Äôm chanting as we speak
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Still my favourite comedy tv series
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I loved the role reversal. Saffy was the responsible one where her mother and Patsy were the wild ones, living for the next party. This is one of my wife's favorite shows."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,This show is a guilty pleasure of mine. These two are hilarious.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Ah, I love modern entertainment 'journalism'. It's just a constant stream of articles from 25 year olds talking about how we've all forgotten about a very famous show that came out 25+ years ago."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Great show
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Such a great show!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I grew up watching this with my dad. It‚Äôs still just as hilarious.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,">	Im chanting as we speak

LOL the most famous line for all Buddhists and meditators. 

And it was actually said by the inspiration for Edina Monsoon, publicist Lynne Franks"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Preaching to the choir **sweetie**

I think you buried one of the leads regarding this show though understandable since it pertains to the DVD's.

It seems like it's been decades since I watched the DVD outtakes on repeat with tears and snot running down my face, I have never since laughed so hard.

Comedy gems and genius all around."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I was partially raised on this show so it has always held a special place in my heart. Thankfully my mom is like neither of these women.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Love Ab Fab and Kath & Kim. In that genre gotta check out Gavin & Stacey. The supporting characters are brilliant!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,One of the GOAT
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Money! Keys! Passport!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I was obsessed with AbFab in the late 90s. It would air on Comedy Central daily and watching episodes became a compulsion.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,You little bitch troll from hell!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Season 1-3 was PERFECT. Season 4 was hit and miss. Season 5 was unwatchable.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I used to love the show, until the one christmas special where Edina strikes a toddler in the face. I just couldn't watch that show anymore after that."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Oh no I used to love it but it's not aged well at all.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,The movie was good.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,They have always reminded me of my mother and her best friend when I was growing up. It wasn't fun to live with that but I loved them all the same.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"This show always came on in the afternoons in the summer on comedy central in my childhood. I never got into it, I was too young to ""get it"". Maybe I should give it another try."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Vueve!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,the same can't be said for the mid-90s american rehash High Society
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Gautier, darling. Names, names, names."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Can I have the house?
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I‚Äôd also recommend watching their respective versions of Shameless
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Yep both shows follow vain, spoiled, misguided, social climbers who give horrible advice and invite constant ridicule for the abysmal decision making their characters exhibit. One treats these characters as role models, the other does it ironically, treating them like the joke they are."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,HOW?!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Oooooo gin and tonic!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,‚ÄúSmall Opening‚Äù even the title still makes me laugh. Best ep ever!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Where are my dippity bix?

The wedding with Sharon and the horse hair switch is a seminal moment in television history."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I would say they‚Äôre both just as funny as the other
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I feel like Eddie and Patsy are closer to the English equivalent of Prue and True.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Look at me Kim Loook at MOOIII
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Just Watch says it‚Äôs on Hulu.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,It's on BritBox.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"It‚Äôs on Hoopla, you can log in and use that with a library card (if your library supports it) for free."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,i do the bloke from The Man from UNCLE and the woman from The New Adventures wandering around empty sets scared the absolute bejesus out of us as kids
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I hate you! Just when my life hit a good patch, along you came, you miserable piece of flesh. You should've ended up in the dust bin! The incinerator was too good for you! You know, when I heard that Eddie was pregnant, I told her to abort! ABORT, ABORT, ABORT! I said ""Chuck it down the pan!"". I said ""Bring me... a knitting needle!"""
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Best notify my next of kin, this wheel shall explode.

Saffy certainly has awoken a fetish in me for uncomfortable nerdy girls in huge sweaters."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Mariane Faithful!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,You WERE fucking cool!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,The new episodes aired on Monday nights. I LIVED for those nights and would laugh until my body hurt.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,That one S5 episode where Edina brought home the wrong baby is a classic for me amongst the earlier ones.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,But that wasn't played as a joke - it was the final straw and made Saffy throw them out of the house (quite literally in Patsys case ü§£)
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I think you can say that for many 90s comedies though. Comedy mocks modern culture. 

Hence why when we watch it 30 years later, we go, 'ugh, were we really like that?'"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,And The Office
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,At least AbFab is funny!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,He just hates them says they are annoying. It‚Äôs ok I can watch this on my own.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Cool. I'll give it a go
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Aha, I get you."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Jane Turner is amazing ...le sigh. A real comedic genius.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Yes it was great!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,The way Patsy cries after Saffy slaps her is seared into my brain.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,False
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Yeah I can't imagine Game On has dated well!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"AbFab is fuckin hilarious. At least they realised acting that way was something to be made fun of, not admired. Still holds up today. SATC is horribly dated now."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"That's kinda the point? Patsy and Eddie are awful people, you're not supposed to like them"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Gabon.  Gabon.  Is he from Gabon?
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Hey. You had an Ab fucking Fab t-shirt!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I hated SATC and still do. They took themselves seriously as something to aspire to.
As horrible as Patsy and Eddie are as people, I would take them anyday over the SATC foursome."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,That‚Äôs what makes me *love* them.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,That doesn't make them *entertaining*. I hate this show so much.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Oh for sure, he just actually hates them."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I wish there were legitimate ways to watch older episodes without forking over $100 for a DVD collection. I dunno how they attract new viewers if there's no way to catch up on storylines. I understand all the way to the beginning would be crazy, but even being able to access the last couple decades on a streaming service would be cool."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,The show hasn't been the same since they killed of Dr Drake Ramoray
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I haven't watched the show in decades, but I'll always have a fondness for the 80s era - Bo & Hope and Steve ""Patch"" Johnson, Eugene and Calliope, Shane the spy, evil Victor Kiriakis.  Marlena and Roman.  Good stuff."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Everyone jokes but shows like this remind me of my grandma watching when she would stay over when she was getting to the end. Makes me miss her a lot
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I miss when it used to appear on nbc
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,I can hear the opening narration forty years after my last sick day from school.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Fantastic news.

The show continues to be enjoyable and somehow is funnier than more shows on TV, comedies included."
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"I stopped watching at season 54, is it worth coming back to?"
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Is Marlena still possessed by Satan?
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Peacock has breathed new life into the soap genre.
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,...or *was* it!?!!
Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,[deleted]
Valentino,It was odd how he would vanish for multiple episodes at a time last season.
Valentino,"His character is good so I'm happy with this, I just hope his need to prove himself isn't diminished after he finally was proven innocent of his friend's murder because it was a good trait of his.

I do want to see more Rookies, hopefully Nolan gets one soon."
Valentino,is this a really good show?
Valentino,Good to hear. I was hoping this would happen.
Valentino,Probably a matter of budget/scheduling. He was a last-minute addition to the season after the actor who played Jackson abruptly quit the show just before Season 4 was about to air.
Valentino,"since nobody answered you i will

it‚Äôs got good plot lines, and it imagines a world where cops are just paragons of virtue, plus the action is pretty good too.

overall i like it, but it‚Äôs not gonna win any awards"
Valentino,"Well its not a genre defining classic and some of the episodes can be a bit silly.

But its got a good cast, full of likable and interesting characters who play off each other really well, fun stories that keep you engaged and every so often it does a really sincere episode.

I'd definitely recommend it if you like mostly like hearted police procedurals."
Valentino,"Not really good. No.

Does not address the moral compromising of policing.

It manages to be both woke and have weekly gunfights. 

Even SWAT is better."
Valentino,"I'm glad we will see more of him. I'll miss the character of Jackson, and his chemistry with Chen and Nolan since they were from the same class, but I've really liked Thorsen, and he's had an interesting story."
Valentino,"I don't understand Titus Makin Jr.'s decision to leave this lucrative job, the guy has been in one NCIS episode and two shorts since departing the show."
Valentino,‚Äúquit‚Äù
Valentino,He wants to focus on his music career I think. He is a pretty good singer but hasn't really put much out even since leaving the show. His character was really good and he was a good actor. It's a shame they killed his character so there is no chance of him even coming back
Valentino,Yup. That's what it's called when you leave the job you're contracted to do.
Valentino,"I guess so. 

Music can't be as lucrative as this though.

This show has had two black actors abruptly quit. I find that odd."
Valentino,"Not always. There are rumours that it wasn‚Äôt his decision, which is why there was a PR blackout afterwards. Usually the show‚Äôs PR would line up several interviews with media outlets for outgoing cast."
Valentino,I know someone who works on the show. he left with no notice and left them hanging. They had to do reshoots and rewrite quite a lot of the season because of his leaving. They probably haven't done anything like that because of him leaving so abruptly. They would likely have done something like that is he told them even a few months ahead of time
Valentino,"> Makin Jr. has yet to publicly address his exit from The Rookie. However, in conversation with TV Line, The Rookie showrunner Alexi Hawley shared he had no option but to kill off Jackson as [**Makin Jr. decided not to return**](https://www.newsweek.com/rookie-season-4-why-titus-makin-jr-leave-jackson-west-dead-1632918)"
Valentino,So I'm assuming Gumball is safe.
Valentino,Inb4 complaints about art style.
Valentino,"But they can't bring back Thundercats or Green Lantern's animated series, Fucking hell"
Valentino,Uhhhh....How do we tell him?
Valentino,EWWWWW CALARTS I HATE CALARTS
Valentino,This is from yesterday but it doesn't look like it's been posted on this sub yet.
Valentino,At least it doesn't have that stupid Cal-Arts Style! I want to watch this! 
Valentino,Woah I instantly want more
Valentino,I do too. I want more people to check out this pilot. 
Valentino,I agree I loved it
Valentino,Because its better than the other stuff on Cartoon Network. OK KO was beloved by animation fans but viewers couldn't care less about it. This was due to the show not getting any reruns. Because Teen Titans Go and Gumball are the only shows they air nothing else gets an opportunity. Trick Moon could have been a great show but CN only air the 2 moneymakers. The network is screwed the moment TTG ends because then it will become a zombie channel only airing reruns.
Valentino,"I could said the same thing about Learning with Pibby. At least with Trick Moon, I actually loved the pilot through and through. Pibby? Not really. The concept may sound ""interesting""(for a lack of better word), but the cliche fanservice crossover aspect, try-hard dark and gritty nonsense, and this whole Creepypasta thing turns me off. I really don't understand why it gotten so popular."
Valentino,[removed]
Valentino,"Cable TV in general is dying. Most people get their content for streaming. CN could care less about ratings on the linear channel, because the views they'll get from HBO Max streams will even it out.

In any case, TTG and Gumball reruns have loosed up considerably, there's still plenty of other decent shows on CN right now such as Craig of the Creek, Mao Mao, and Victor and Valentino. I don't see why Trick Moon should be hailed as this masterpiece when in reality, it was a mediocre pilot for a neat concept."

Valentino,"Dude. Just link to [the schedule](https://www.comic-con.org/cciathome/2020/programming-schedule),  so folks can get the full schedule and youtube links!

Better yet, link [the Television tag](https://comiccon2020.sched.com/tag/Television?iframe=yes&w=680&sidebar=no&bg=no)."
Valentino,Some people don‚Äôt want to click but thanks.
Valentino,This is a bad idea
Valentino,Still too much *Teen Titans Go!*
Valentino,[deleted]
Valentino,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
Valentino,so what would be a better idea to you?
Valentino,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
Valentino,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
Valentino,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
Valentino,more scooby doo
Valentino,[deleted]
Valentino,was that supposed to be funny?
Valentino,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
Valentino,this entire post is a joke no?
Valentino,[deleted]
Valentino,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
Valentino,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
Valentino,"Murphy's problem is that he's trying to pass off his art as horror. But really his work is its own genre, all the exploitative cliches you mentioned have no business in the horror genre. His shock and awe methods are a fictional genre of its own.


I will admit that I don't hate it like you in fact I like it. I do hate that he calls it ""horror."" He should've just called it ""American Story"" and it would've been more accurate. "
Valentino,"I get it. 

You don't understand what 'horror' means. "
Valentino,"I actually agree with most of this, but with the caveat mentioned elsewhere in the comments: that the underlying complexity here is in identifying the genre.

I watched S1 and loved it. Great stuff. S2 got weird and I quit watching, for many of the reasons noted here. I came back and gave it another chance during Hotel, and did not take long to tire of it.

I think the context needed here is that horror is a genre that continually evolves in a society, in a way that many others don't. Murphy strikes me as very similar to Clive Barker - I reckon this sort of story-telling is as much cathartic as it is anything else. I do agree that Murphy's use of LGBT characters and themes is *weirdly* exploitative and I don't understand it. But maybe that's cathartic for Murphy too, in some way. It's not really that off-putting for me. I just don't get it.

I'm not into either of them, but they don't make me angry, haha. I know many, many people who really like this show. Different strokes for different folks."
Valentino,"I don't hate it. Him and his team of writers have genuinely good ideas and have proven that they're capable, and he's capable of exceptional storytelling(see Normal Heart and People vs OJ Simpson). Every season of AHS starts out promising, but it always ends up going off the rails. Hell Roanoke would have, for its flaws, been the best season if it had only been six episodes.

Overall I think the problem is that he has to much creative freedom and the hype and acclaim have gone to his head, so nobody is able to ground him.

It happens to the best of them: David Lynch, Tarantino, and even Tim Burton to give some examples of when full creative freedom isn't always a good thing without a strong right hand person to reign them in."
Valentino,"I do. But it's not well made horror. It's cheap exploitation at best that hides behind a socially liberal facade. It's not liberal and empowering at all. It's insensitive actually

Usually there are 3 rules for horror.

1. The innocent must suffer.
2. You must taste blood to become a man(metaphorically speaking)
3. The guilty must be punished 

What's the point of having no payoff at the end at all. Or if you just want to scare people don't be so cheap and blatant about it, and be more consistent.

"
Valentino,"I don't think he'll ever be able to top S1, everything about it is perfect. The story, the actors, there isn't an over the top emphasis on sex/gore.  I loved the air of mystery in the season and every episode kept me guessing on what was going to happen next, I just don't get that feeling from any of the others but I keep watching hoping he'll be able to draw me back in like he did with S1."
Valentino,Never heard those rules and I'm a lifelong horror fan.
Valentino,"See this interview with Sam Raimi. Skip to 1:30

https://youtu.be/Xrj5oQtodCc"
Valentino,So Raimi sets the rules for all of horror as a genre? That's a lot of power for a guy who made exactly one decent horror film.
Valentino,Not at all. Listen to when he starts talking 
Valentino,"Sorry I can't take him seriously. Get me something from Carpenter, Craven, Blum then when can talk."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Just watched the Night Court episode of 30 Rock :(
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Judge Stone called Mac up to the big courthouse in the sky. RIP Charlie.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Rip.

Someone tell Mr. Plinkett."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,The episode where he takes his shirt off and reveals that he is ripped was super funny
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"It is so sad, at least a couple times a week, we say goodbye to actors from the 70s and 80s.  People we invited into our living rooms each week, people who became a part of our lives.  I think in the back of our minds, we think of these characters living on for ever and then we face the reality that they are gone.  RIP Mac.  The universe has called you to hand it the file on the next case.  Sleep in peace."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Such a great straight man on Night Court but I love those episodes where Mac has a serious part in the story - Vietnam issues or relating to Qwon Lee. We know Mac is funny and serious but he has 3 dimensions and was an interesting character that Charles Robinson alone could bring to life and make so enjoyable. God rest ye, sir, and rest well."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,[deleted]
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Charlie Robinson was a large part of the reason Night Court was such a great show. RIP Charlie.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Man.   I hate getting old.   We keep losing all my favs.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"I mainly knew him from *Night Court*, but he turned up in stuff all the time in the years since, and I always liked to see him getting work. I had been hoping to see him in that *Night Court* sequel series."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Rest in peace, Mac. I can still hear you voice in my head when I say ‚Äúyour honour‚Äù."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,/r/redlettermedia in shambles
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,F Cancer.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"I would imagine most people on reddit probably would know him from the ""that's a penis"" gif rather than night court."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"That's a penis!

RIP good sir"
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Frick, Night Court was my favorite show growing up.  My first TV crush Christine Sullivan!  RIP Mac!"
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,That sad. I was hoping to see him in the reboot.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"He was also on the CBS tv show ""Mom""."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"RIP Charles Robinson. I loved Night Court as a kid, watching it on syndication. The addition of Mac was the start of Night Court getting better, being Harry's best friend."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"random fact - night court had one of the tallest male casts in a sitcom.  harry anderson - 6'3"", john larroquette - 6'5"", charles robinson - 6'2"", and richard moll - almost 6'8"""
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Am I blue? Aint these tears in my eyes telling you.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"He was surgical with deadpan deliveries on that show. Hell, so was the guy who played Bull and the woman who played Roz. That show was stacked with talent."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Damn. Mac was the best. The semi-voice of reason in the madcap antics of Night Court, a vastly underrated show. 

Rest easy."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,What a good fit in Night Court he was.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"(Deep sigh) 
I hate being at the age where all the actors in TV shoes I watched growing up in the 80‚Äôs are dying. 
May you rest in peace knowing you made so many laugh and smile."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,I was fortunate enough to run into him at an audition a couple of years ago. Afterwards I caught up with him and told him how much I appreciated the show and his work on it. His face lit up and he seemed very moved by the compliments. Sad to see another one go. ‚òπÔ∏è
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Loved him on Night Court. RIP.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Night court saved me during Covid. Papa Bless.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP old friend.  Court is adjourned.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Damn... He played Mr Munson on Mom, where his character had cancer. This sucks"
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP I loved that character. I am old and I used to watch night court all the time. It was one of the best shows and it still holds up. He was really funny
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,They are filming the pilot for the Night Court reboot either this week or last week. That's a shame he won't be able to make a guest appearance if it gets picked up
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Man what a bummer.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,üòû
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,I just watched the episode of 30 Rock he was in last night.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP Mr.Robinson. I loved your character on this show.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"This is sad news , use to love watching that show . I liked the character he played , great actor . Will be missed üôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP! You were a big part of my childhood when I used to stay up late and watch Night court with my mom.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Rich Evans grieving
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"I watched every single episode of Night Court when I was a kid. Mac was great.


Charlie Robinson. Thanks, man. RIP."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"""Oh my dear lord ...."""
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"""I saw that water fountain incident, sir..."""
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Hopefully whoever was agitating his dots stops now.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Quon Le!
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,I was just watching Night Court earlier today! This news sucks! RIP Charles!
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Damn. Right before the reboot too
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Night court was on my ‚Äúmom‚Äôs passed out in front of the 13‚Äù b&w tv‚Äù playlist for years. Love it.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Damn! Just damn.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,No one tell Mr. Plinkett
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP. Such a great character on Night Court
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP to a legend
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Good night Mac
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Hilarious in that role. Also an underrated show by this time. Very few dud episodes, if any. RIP, brother."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"I‚Äôm just old enough to remember reruns of this show and even now it‚Äôs enjoyable. It was fun when Bull bought a home from my parents, he was super friendly and cracked jokes when talking with them (house was on Lake Arrowhead in Southern California and he randomly came up to the door to ask about it).  

Rest In Peace Charlie."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Aw man Mr Plintekett won‚Äôt be happy to hear this
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"I just finished the first season of The Guestbook three days ago. I watched the entire season in a day after realizing it starred Mac from Night Court and Laverne from Scrubs. Two days ago I looked up Charlie Robinson because I knew Harry Anderson had passed, and I was so relieved to see that Charlie haven‚Äôt yet. This hits really hard."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Mac‚Äôs gone to rejoin Judge Stone in the courtroom. Give Harry our regards, Charlie. We miss you both."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,RIP to the That's a Penis meme
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Is it weird that I randomly thought of Night Court today?
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"First Harry, now Mac"
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"He was also in the series ""The Guest Book"" season 1 (and one episode of season 2) a few years back. Good show. Looks like it is on Hulu now. 

RIP Mac."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"Also the star of this meme:

https://tenor.com/view/charles-robinson-penis-thats-apenis-himym-how-imet-your-mother-gif-4703463"
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,All the 80s heroes are dropping :(
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Such great memories of this show and I can still hear his voice right next to Harry
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Things like this always put things in perspective. He got his start in the 1960s and70s. It seems like ancient history for me but there are plenty of people who were there and experienced that time first hand. As time moves on we‚Äôre slowly losing all these people who experienced a world so different from today. Wish I could talk to my grandparents who‚Äôve passed on who were around then.
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,"That is so weird, I just watched the episode of House he appeared in yesteday. I was trying to remember where else I saw him and remembered he's the ""Thats a penis"" guy from How I met Your Mother. I'm going to stop looking people up so I don't kill anyone else."
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,That's a penis?!
Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie,Is this show streaming anywhere? I wouldn‚Äôt mind watching old episodes

Voices of Fire,">Bedrock catches up with the Flintstone family two decades later, with Fred on the brink of retirement and 20-something Pebbles embarking on her own career. As the Stone Age gives way to a shiny and enlightened new Bronze Age, the residents of Bedrock will find this evolution harder than a swing from Bamm-Bamm‚Äôs club.

Cast:

* Elizabeth Banks as Pebbles
* Stephen Root as Fred
* Amy Sedaris as Wilma
* Nicole Byer as Betty
* Joe Lo Trulio as Barney
* Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam."
Voices of Fire,"When someone inevitably comments ‚Äú*Who wanted this?*‚Äù

It is I. I wanted a Flintstones animated reboot. 

Jetsons next, please, though that is overdue for its live action treatment that‚Äôs been collecting dust in Hollywood for ages."
Voices of Fire,"Sounds like an interesting concept. I'll check it out. I hope the art style is similar to the original style and not some unique off putting hybrid. 

>Joe Lo Truglio as Barney

I'm sold."
Voices of Fire,Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is absolutely perfect casting
Voices of Fire,Wasn't Seth MacFarlane trying to develop a Flintstones reboot at one point?
Voices of Fire,Stephen Root is amazing.
Voices of Fire,Is this based on the comic where [Yabababadoo](https://loginportal.funnyjunk.com/comments/I+greatly+enjoyed+the+flintstones+comic+_3630d2d2c835f69a58fe8575740d3a76.jpg) is a nonsense phrase to help veterans deal with trama from the war?
Voices of Fire,Amy Sedaris is a national treasure. I will watch anything she is a part of.
Voices of Fire,"Whether this turns out to be good or not, if you are a Flintstones fan, you absolutely owe it to yourself to read the DC comic by Steve Pugh!

It's such a truly fantastic retelling of the story and creates a very nuanced and much more interesting Bedrock."
Voices of Fire,"I hope they take inspiration from the recent Flintstones Comics, which really delved into modern issues as reflected in the weird Paleolithic pastiche of The Flintstones universe. [Like Fred's pals Adam and Steve.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1sb55) 

[Or this infamous panel.](https://external-preview.redd.it/XahAdnM9U9vhLUmGkHlK3IRQw3jDzOlfSVl31KuVzyU.jpg?auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2449c02c1798f8941b05266f8386e7fe515a9aa) 

It's a fantastic satire."
Voices of Fire,Hire Mark Russell!! His 12 issue comic series on them is GOLD!
Voices of Fire,Elizabeth Banks and Manny Jacinto as the adult pebbles and bambam makes so much sense in a way I really can't explain.
Voices of Fire,Alright. This sounds really cool.
Voices of Fire,Of wow it‚Äôs happening. Last time I heard of a flinstones reboot it was sarah underwood on attack of the show on G4 announced that Seth MacFarlane was going to run it. Then right after that Kevin Pereira made a fun adult comment that went over my too young boy brain.
Voices of Fire,"Hope it takes some inspiration from the 2010s DC Comics reimagining of the Flintstones, which I recommend people check out."
Voices of Fire,Yo that cast looks bonkers! Bortles!
Voices of Fire,This is something I didn't realize I wanted until I read about it LOL
Voices of Fire,"> Manny Jacinto as Bamm-Bamm.

Dope."
Voices of Fire,Now I've got that Ram Jam song in my head.
Voices of Fire,Wow that‚Äôs a pretty talented/funny lineup behind the voices
Voices of Fire,"I have nothing against it personally, but why is it okay for other races to be cast for a white role (disclaimer: I‚Äôm not white), but when a white person plays a non-white role (like the Simpsons cast, for example) people are ‚Äúoffended‚Äù?"
Voices of Fire,Seth McFarlane had this reboot ready to go and they shelved it at the very last second.
Voices of Fire,I really hope there is some Boyle Boys' love between Fred and Barney.
Voices of Fire,"I smell another ""Velma""."
Voices of Fire,Didn‚Äôt  Seth MacFarlane work on this for years?
Voices of Fire,"let me guess, Fred and Barney are dumbasses and Wilma is the real empowered deal"
Voices of Fire,Predictions on who is gay? I‚Äôm going with bam bam.
Voices of Fire,Ok this is what we need
Voices of Fire,I was wondering if anyone would revisit this property soon and here we are. Interested to see how it turns out.
Voices of Fire,‚ÄúIdk cast the latino as bam bam‚Äù
Voices of Fire,More trash ü§Æü§¢
Voices of Fire,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lZAqlx_9lv0
Voices of Fire,Of course Wilma is voiced by a black woman.
Voices of Fire,Just please don't Velma it.
Voices of Fire,I hope this doesn't replace The Great North.
Voices of Fire,"is it going to have horrible modern flash animation


also nicole byer so totally does not seem like Betty at all"
Voices of Fire,[removed]
Voices of Fire,How?
Voices of Fire,"This is going to be another Velma, right?"
Voices of Fire,You had me at Lynn and Charles Boyle as Fred and Barney.
Voices of Fire,This is still a thing?  I assumed this had died years ago.
Voices of Fire,I remember Seth MacFarlane wanted to be involved in this.  Almost Sade he isn't.
Voices of Fire,"If you want to do an adult oriented (Bit of a misnomer since the cartoon was Primetime in the 60s) Flintstones, they should go with the comic DC put out a few years ago."
Voices of Fire,You know I'm kind of interested in the premise. A technological shift from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age? I dunno that sounds like an interesting jump start.
Voices of Fire,"Solid as hell cast there.

 Now they just need to toss in Paul reubens as the great gazoo."
Voices of Fire,So is this before Bamm bamm and pebbles had a kid?
Voices of Fire,Were the bronze and stone ages only 20 years apart? üòú
Voices of Fire,You had me at Amy Sedaris.
Voices of Fire,Holy shit Manny Jacinto as Bam Bam is an awesome casting choice.
Voices of Fire,Stephen root as Fred is an instant sold for me
Voices of Fire,I want a continuation of the Harvey Birdman Flintstones.
Voices of Fire,"I‚Äôm honestly surprised how long it‚Äôs taken for a true to form reboot. This premise looks interesting, but just making a modern take on the original feels like a nobrainer. It‚Äôs not like sitcoms ever went out of style."
Voices of Fire,"Jetsons would be cool, that 60s retrofuturism and so on... I know people have this head canon of them being in the sky and the earth being a dead zone beneath.  I think that's a bit too much, but I like the idea of other cities being the future as envisioned by other decades.  So we have an 80s cyberpunk city, a 30s deco city like Metropolis, a Y2K silver/aqua fluid organic type of city, etc..."
Voices of Fire,"Also, Seth MacFarlane. He's talked about it a lot, and I'm guessing he's sad he's not involved with this"
Voices of Fire,We need Danny Devito as Mr Spacely.
Voices of Fire,They‚Äôve been trying to make this for a long time. It was attached to Seth Macfarlane. I think he used to talk about it in interviews.
Voices of Fire,"They need to make a live action Jetsons ASAP, while Danny DeVito is still around to play Mr. Spacely."
Voices of Fire,"""Who wanted this?"" is the dumbest (whatever it's called... *trope statement*?) that has ever existed.

Are creators supposed to poll everyone before they create? Fuck off

The most awarded movie in cinema history,  EEAAOA... did anybody want that?"
Voices of Fire,"There are a lot of shows you can justifiably ask, ""Why?"" This is not one of them."
Voices of Fire,"Yeah, but one true to the original, no?  Or what are you hoping for?"
Voices of Fire,"This appears not to be a reboot, but a sequel."
Voices of Fire,"Joe Lo Truglio and Nicole Byer being Barney and Betty is inspired. And manny jacinto as their son?

Cue the vince mcmahon meme"
Voices of Fire,"""Every time I have a problem I hit it with a club and scream out my own name and just like that I have a new problem."""
Voices of Fire,"Oh man, Bam Bam figured it out? This is a new low."
Voices of Fire,Oh dear heavens it's Jason.
Voices of Fire,"""BORTLES-BORTLES!"""
Voices of Fire,"yes, amazing casting"
Voices of Fire,Very inspired casting.
Voices of Fire,"Apparently part of the reason it didn‚Äôt pan out was because he couldn‚Äôt figure out how to distinguish Fred from Peter Griffin. Not that he *wanted* them to be similar, he genuinely didn‚Äôt seem to know Fred acts nothing like Peter to begin with. That should tell you everything."
Voices of Fire,"That fizzled out about a decade ago.

He doesn't seem interested in making animated sitcoms anymore."
Voices of Fire,Thankfully that didn't work out. Don't think we need the Flintstones with rape jokes.
Voices of Fire,Yes
Voices of Fire,"The link is broken, but I don't believe it's based on the recent satire series."
Voices of Fire,"Have you, by chance, seen [The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Funtime Hour?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drunk_and_On_Drugs_Happy_Funtime_Hour)"
Voices of Fire,Exit Stage Left the Snaglepuss Story is also a phenomenal examination of McCarthism and its effects on the theater industry and I'm not even joking
Voices of Fire,What an odd tone. Is there comedy in between or is it just straight up serious/dramatic the entire time?
Voices of Fire,"I've been reading the series recently and it's been fantastic. Really good satire about everything from capitalism, consumerism to PTSD. Highly recommend."
Voices of Fire,">Homo Erectus

Brilliant."
Voices of Fire,Literally only clicked this thread to see if someone mentioned the comic. Great little series.
Voices of Fire,"The issue that most people have isn‚Äôt that voice actors can only voice characters that are the same race as they are. The issue is that in an industry that is predominantly white, even the few POC roles that exist often go to white actors."
Voices of Fire,Isn‚Äôt it for a voice role?
Voices of Fire,because white people bad
Voices of Fire,Because white actors aren‚Äôt underrepresented in media. Now can people stop asking this question?
Voices of Fire,"I'm still wondering why if a character is biracial, it's not okay for a whole white person to play the part, but it IS okay for a whole black person to play the part."
Voices of Fire,That was my first thought too. Like isn‚Äôt this supposed to be racist now?
Voices of Fire,"The secret is no one really cares about that either. Most of it has been voice actors voluntarily stepping down. 

I dont think just about any regular person cares."
Voices of Fire,I mean that would be just like the original...
Voices of Fire,"So, The Flintstones then."
Voices of Fire,"Too easy. Actually it will be revealed that Barney and Fred were, uh, more than friends all this time."
Voices of Fire,"It's one thing to be racist, and another to be so racist you can't tell the difference between latinos and someone who's chinese-fillipino."
Voices of Fire,Jfc y'all can't even get your fake outrage right.
Voices of Fire,"Yea that‚Äôs actually a solid spin on the original. Turn Fred & Wilma into Boomers who don‚Äôt get new tech.

What do you mean you drive without feet now?"
Voices of Fire,"Relevant

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyu4u3VZYaQ"
Voices of Fire,The Great Gazoo is honestly not even one of the top 10 stupidest things on the original show. Everyone just ignores that there's a Bewitched crossover in it for no apparent reason.
Voices of Fire,oh hell yes I need Pee-Wee Herman as Great Gazoo
Voices of Fire,"""Don't do that. Don't make me hope"""
Voices of Fire,"They were 0 years apart.

But the Bronze Age was not 20 years away from the dinosaurs."
Voices of Fire,"No, but they also didn't celebrate Christmas and have talking elephant vacuum cleaners during the stone age."
Voices of Fire,"I mean it depends what you mean, parts of the Neolithic age was technically.

Of course due to lack of safe travel in those days and scarcity of resources, you could cross from the stone age into the bronze age and back again, over a span of maybe two hundred miles."
Voices of Fire,Your dead to me can opener!

Mismatched,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Mismatched,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Mismatched,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Mismatched,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de L√©a (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de L√©a is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

rating: 6.7 out of 10"
Mismatched,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Mismatched,Severance show
Mismatched,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Mismatched,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Mismatched,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Mismatched,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Mismatched,"I don‚Äôt care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn‚Äôt have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it‚Äôs fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Mismatched,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Mismatched,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Mismatched,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Mismatched,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? üò©

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Mismatched,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Mismatched,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. üòÖ 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."

Mismatched,"Anyone else laugh their ass off when Torres randomly broke cover and went ""You're under arrest!"" Only to get totally bodied lmao"
Mismatched,That is NOT America's Ass
Mismatched,"I really enjoyed it, and previously neither character came close to being my favorites in the MCU.

I like that Bucky isn‚Äôt miraculously back to normal after his Winter Soldier ordeal, but he isn‚Äôt completely broken, either.  I liked his snarky interplay with his therapist.  She is a good foil for his stoicism, and learning that she was a soldier too helps ground her as someone who isn‚Äôt looking at treating combat PTSD from an outsider‚Äôs perspective.  While it isn‚Äôt an unfamiliar trope for a killer to secretly bond with the family of their victims, I think Bucky‚Äôs age adds a new level of nuance to his friendship to the elderly man.  Like Cap before him, he shares more cultural references with senior citizens than the young woman he dated.

I also liked seeing Sam‚Äôs personal life and learning how rough it was for people during the blip, and how society didn‚Äôt magically reset after everyone returned.  His conversations with his sister felt very relatable, and I liked the reference to not having Stark level wealth.  Like Spider-Man, he is an everyman who has to worry about the bills as well as saving the world.  I wanted to smack the banker!

Falcon‚Äôs aerial action scenes were very well executed, especially how they showed the versatility of his wings.  I don‚Äôt recall them being used as a shield before, so that was cool!

I am so glad I stayed away from spoilers because seeing US Agent show up at the end was a fun surprise.  Looking forward to next Friday!"
Mismatched,"I hope Batroc and his crew buy a rival charter boat to go up against Sam and his sister, and that's the primary source of conflict this season."
Mismatched,Not gonna lie. If the Smithsonian had a Captain America exhibit I would very much go.
Mismatched,When they showed the new Captain America‚Äôs face. üíÄüòÇ
Mismatched,I hope one of these Flag Smasher folks declares Thanos did nothing wrong at somepoint.
Mismatched,Watching Bucky trying to enter the dating world with an old soul is hilarious. I know the Winter Solider parts are flashbacks but is it bad that I find that scene super hot and cool.
Mismatched,"All the trailers made this look like the TV version of Hobbs & Shaw, so I was pleasantly surprised by the show's tone. Much closer to The Winter Soldier than Fast & Furious."
Mismatched,"I am not gonna lie, Flag-Smashers ideology is kinda interesting."
Mismatched,"Thought it was a great episode. I do have to say, with Falcon‚Äôs wings being what they are (able to convert into a shield), isn‚Äôt actually having the Shield going to be a downgrade in practicality for Sam? 

Anyway, Bucky is so good, glad to see both him and Sam getting fleshed out and having actual lives. 

Also excited to see what Wyatt Russell gets to do. I hope there‚Äôs more to it than just ‚Äúthe new Captain America is an asshole and needs to be punched after five episodes‚Äù. It‚Äôd be more interesting if he‚Äôs a relatively decent person, I think. Maybe like .. Christ, what‚Äôs his name, the phony superhero and temporary Shield director from Agents of Shield from like S4. 

The logistics of the Steve thing are .. slightly more baffling now. I guess he told the Government that he‚Äôs old as fuck and retired now and they chose to cover it up? But yeah, no shit there‚Äôd be conspiracy theories. ‚ÄúOh yeah, so uh, Captain America quit‚Äù I just assumed they would‚Äôve faked his death, but they don‚Äôt talk as if he‚Äôs presumed dead.

Also, I have to assume beyond character building, the therapy is going to have a pay off in a scene where Zemo tries to use the code words on Bucky again and it challenges his emotional fortitude. Anyway, that‚Äôs all my speculation for today. Very excited to see where it goes."
Mismatched,Bucky wearing that mask to prevent covid spread pre covid pandemic
Mismatched,"Loved that opening action scene. Very movie quality. Also, pleasantly surprised by all the character work in the rest of the episode. It‚Äôs honestly a little refreshing to see some realism in an MCU property. Sam‚Äôs money troubles, Bucky‚Äôs PTSD and trauma mixed in with the guilt of what he‚Äôs done. And both of their struggles to adjust after being gone for five years. Bucky got the real raw deal out of that though. Imagine being brainwashed and used as an assassin for 90 years and then finally escaping it and getting your mind back only to fucking cease to exist for five years. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm thrilled to see where this goes."
Mismatched,"Maybe it was the helmet, maybe it was intentional but anyone else think this new ‚Äúcaptain‚Äù/us agent has an incredibly punchable face?"
Mismatched,"I'm not passing judgement on the show overall, it would be silly to as it is only the first episode, but this episode did do one thing that alleviated one thing I wasn't sold on.

That first action sequence really sold how effective Sam can be in battle. In the films where he was a supporting character, he also served a support role for the most part in battles, kind of on the peripheral. It was great seeing him on his own not just with his wings but also kicking ass in close quarters combat against multiple opponents. The mismatch in skill set is the big reason why I wasn't so sure about Sam being the new Cap but they pretty much made it clear from the get-go in this episode that Sam is actually an all-around badass beyond just the wings."
Mismatched,Stop trying to make MarvelStudiosPlus a thing. It's not gonna happen.
Mismatched,Ok well I liked that it took its time with the characters and seemed subdued in it's explanation. The reveal of who Yori was I thought well done. I like that we're seeing a more day to day issue of the consequences of the movie while things are happening in the background. I wonder how they're going to balance the character stuff that seems day to day so far(which I like a lot) with the Flag stomper people and the new Captain America.
Mismatched,"Obviously New Cap't is Mephisto under the mask, right?"
Mismatched,This series is already handing out cameos like people wanted in Wandavision
Mismatched,I didn't really like this episode especially the sections with falcons sister and family it all seemed really forced idk we shall see
Mismatched,"I enjoyed it.

Spoilers abound and I don't know how to hide them.

 It started with some high octane action to tease you with what this show is capable of, and then we get down to the characters. Despite being another comic book show, it's a pleasant display to show that, while they are Avengers, superheroes and the world's saviors, they are still completely human, complete with broken psyche full of guilt, or financial hardships after an ""unprecedented"" event. Really makes the character more relatable, and thus making you care about them.

The bank scene floored me. Like even though he saved the world, he can't get approved for a loan. Didn't realize that the Avengers do their work for free, and really everything was held together by Tony Stank.

And Bucky. Oof, that's a big burden he's carrying. How easy it was for him to make amends on an ex-Hydra government person. Yeah, no problem, they were a bad guy. But how the heck do you even begin to say sorry to your friendly neighborhood grandpa for killing his son? Damn he doesn't have nightmares alright, he's just reliving his guilt. 

All in all, great start. Some people might complain it's too slow. I welcome it. I'm sure there's going to be more action packed scenes. But it's still a nice change of pace to show that there's more character than flashy tent pole cinematics to these Marvel stories.

Also, [me at the end](https://i.imgur.com/mNIsBTB.png).

Edit: Things"
Mismatched,"I had high hopes but after watching the first episode I'm more confused than anything. 

Why was the film stock so grainy? Why were Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan recast with Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn? What was the deal with all the cocaine? 

I'm just so confused."
Mismatched,"Felt like a pretty solid first episode. I was looking forward for main characters to get together again already, but oh well. I just hope that the financial situation/loan issue is not a really big part of the show."
Mismatched,"Quite enjoyed it, but just give me Daniel Bruhl already."
Mismatched,Damn that was really good. Not messing about with the budget either it genuinely does look like a film.
Mismatched,"‚Äúthey think the world was better during the blip‚Äù

‚Äútrust me, it wasn‚Äôt‚Äù

wow really?"
Mismatched,"""This is a picture of my son. My son who disappeared. You don't know anything about my disappeared son, do you James? You don't think he was murdered by a cold assassin with long greasy hair, do you Winter Solder? Do you think the greasy hair assassin still has nightmares of my son? My disappeared son? My son who might've been killed? Good thing you don't have greasy hair, James. You're a good man who never assassinated anyone, including my missing, probably dead, shaky handed son"""
Mismatched,"For everyone who didn't enjoy Falcon's boat subplot, I thought it was fine. 

Anthony Mackie is from Louisiana himself (I think Sam Wilson is from New York in the comics) so that must have been something they threw in for the actor.

I liked seeing Wilson's family, especially his sister, since this show seems to be setting up that Falcon is going to have to reclaim the shield, and we didn't know much about Wilson before this, so I can see his sister being the one to give his character some added depth and motivation."
Mismatched,"I liked it. I wasn't crazy about it, but I think Wandavision and Justice League have me primed for more high comic book weirdness than this one is interested in selling.  I'm sure I'll love it once the plot gets rolling a bit more, and for Zemo and Agent Carter to show up.  *Captain America : Winter Soldier* is one of my favorite MCU movies. This series is clearly aspiring toward's that movie's vibe, which really works for me. 

This also does a good job establishing Sam and Bucky as characters independent from Captain America. They were always good sidekicks, but I don't know if cared about their struggle beyond whatever witty banter they provided. I'm much more curious about seeing Sam try to live up to Steve's legacy and Bucky trying to escape his horrible past than I would have expected when this project was announced.  Very curious to see where it goes next."
Mismatched,"I guess I missed something cause I totally thought Batroc was dead in Civil War, yet here comes Georges St Pierre kicking ass. 

Loved it and excited to see the world expand post blip while actually dealing with Bucky‚Äôs PTSD and Sam‚Äôs struggle. Also, please bring in Bucky‚Äôs cat. If we can get Pizzadog in Hawkeye we can get Alpine in F&amp;WS

Edit: Winter Soldier not Civil War. I got confused with Crossbones and Lagos."
Mismatched,[deleted]
Mismatched,I wanna know what was the budget of the first 10 minutes üòÆ üòç
Mismatched,"This therapy session is deep, god damn

Keep workin on yoself Bucky, you got this"
Mismatched,"Wow....that opening sequence was fantastic. One of the best action scenes Marvel has done. Really like seeing the ordinary lives of Sam and James. You don't get to see the heroes struggle much in the movies, but seeing James in therapy haunted by his past makes his character seem more real.

Great premiere. Love the look and feel of the show, very cinematic and it definitely has that espionage feel to it. Looking forward to next week."
Mismatched,Rico Rodriguez with the Bavarium wingsuit and grappling hook looks pretty good.
Mismatched,Bro that new Captain America looks like a dork wtf
Mismatched,"They really picked their storylines from Anchorman and Ron Burgundy's ""The Human Torch was denied a bankloan"" but switched it out to Falcon"
Mismatched,"I enjoyed this but I‚Äôm now realizing how, I guess, emotionally attached I got to WandaVision and its weirdness. I miss it, now that we got much more of the mystical side of the MCU and as a Wanda fan lol. Anyone else feel this way?

I am excited to dive deeper with Sam and Bucky, interested to see where it goes!"
Mismatched,[deleted]
Mismatched,"I thought this was great. The opening sequence was superb and really showed what Sam is capable of. It looks and feels cinematic. I liked seeing Bucky dealing with his emotional trauma, and trying to make amends. I'm surprised to see so much negativity about the boat sub-plot, as it gives Sam some much-needed character background and helps us see his struggles in and out if the suit. I'm surprised that Sam and Bucky didn't interact, but I trust we'll get there and it will be worth the journey. The reveal at the end gave me thrills, though I wish they had used his other alias."
Mismatched,"There are problems with the loan denial plot. Compare this to spiderman 2. That's more believable because Spider has a secret identity, he's considered a criminal by many, Spider feels guilt about exploiting his superpowers for money after Uncle Ben died and he can get only shitty jobs because he has to spend time being a superhero.

Sam doesn't have these same problems. The first thing we see is not him delivering pizzas, but working for the government as a very specialized soldier. Even if he's not part of the armed forces, he's a mercenary, so he should be getting paid a lot. But apparently in the show he isn't.

It's a disconnect. The audience sees him doing a very complex stuff without a secret identity, with government agents, like Rhodes and the other guy who got beat up complimenting him. Then he struggles for money. Why not ask for more money from the US government? I'm not even going to go into the ask money from friends, I'm not sure who he's friendly with besides Caps. Why not ask for a raise from your employer / client? He's an elite soldier, he should he getting a colonel's payment at least. Probably much more, being a mercenary.

Maybe the bank teller was racist against him in not accepting his contracts as guarantee for the loan, but still, why doesn't he get the money hy himself considering his pay grade?"
Mismatched,"Gotta be honest lads, an Avenger being turned down for a bank loan is not the most compelling storyline. Don't care much for his family either

The rest was top notch though"
Mismatched,"That was a damn satisfying episode in terms of character work and MCU world building, especially a post-blip world. Got some sweet Falcon action at the beginning too."
Mismatched,"The line that the woman Bucky went on a date with said about ‚Äúwe have a word for widow, and orphan, but what do you call someone who lost a child?‚Äù was almost verbatim something Brenda said on Six Feet Under. Are there other examples of this same sentiment anyone can think of? It feels like a cliche when I think about it, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve heard it anywhere else."
Mismatched,The Human Torch....errr....the Falcon was denied a bank loan.
Mismatched,"Boring, boring, boring. So disappointed."
Mismatched,It‚Äôs good to know that Sam does work for the USAF pro-bono. That whole penniless Avenger plot was such nonsense üòÇ
Mismatched,"I just couldn't get into Sam's story. Would have liked to see more of Bucky, so much potential there."
Mismatched,"First 15 minutes is pure US military propaganda lol

How Sam have money troubles, hes one of the most famous people on the planet. Surely he can get money doing literally anything lol"
Mismatched,"No joke, why can't Sam just ask Pepper for a small loan? She's got billions from Tony"
Mismatched,"That's was a deeply satisfying episode!!


A gorgeous opening sequence (also, a nice cameo from Georges St-Pierre), great character work and a nice WTF at the end.

A great setup for what could to be a great season. Super stoked!"
Mismatched,Thought it was a very interesting choice to have 90 minutes of Sebastian Stan saying the nword to the camera and Anthony Mackie standing behind him nodding along
Mismatched,"I was suuuuuuuuuuuuper hyped for this show and this was better than I expected. Why? Because it was about character. It lets us sink into who Sam and Bucky are *now* and what they're dealing with and what their struggles are and that they are largely disconnected from each other and most people. It's setting up pieces for the plot as well but the character work is what really got me, especially Bucky's guilt and conflict over what he did to Yori's son. Knowing he has to eventually tell him what happened but not being able to bring himself to do that. This is exactly what I wanted from this show and it delivered on that. 

That's not mentioning all the lovely supporting characters like the therapist (loved that scene!), Torres and Sam's sister (I missed her name) and the great opening action scene. It was very clever having Sam face off against a character we've seen Steve fight before."
Mismatched,"I like the characters, the actors, and the concept, and the opening sequence was fun, but I don't really get why so many studios and streaming companies now seem to think that writing is an afterthought for big-budget productions. Looks like the writer and executive producer for this show has written a whole five episodes of television in his career (for Empire) and... it kind of shows? I just found the dialogue clunky and overly on-the-nose, and I thought the episode dragged a bit despite the fact that I wanted to like it."
Mismatched,"I enjoyed it quite a bit but there was just a little too much boat and loan discussion for my taste.

Also how did the bad guys fly a wing suit while holding another guy faster than a dude with a jet on his back? This was before it got broken by him being shot in the thruster too"
Mismatched,Meh. The whole Louisiana small-time boating business needs a bank loan fell very flat.
Mismatched,"Ngl, I felt like the flying squirrel scene was outrageously contrived. Like it was just way too perfect a sequence that fit Falcon's wheelhouse way too precisely.

It starts with the hijacker pilot seeing a dude outside. Ok. Funny. The guy behind him doesn't believe there could be a flying guy outside, despite Iron Man/Patriot being things everyone knows about. Fine.

But then they have squirrel suits? On top of the disbelief about flying persons outside?

And it's their go-to getaway just in case someone exactly like Falcon herps into their plane like that. It's great to have plans, don't get me wrong... but seriously?

And I feel like the wings breaking and plottastically fixing themselves in the nick of time felt outrageously convenient. Falcon didn't do anything to solve the problem. The problem just stopped existing buhcuz rerouting. How cool.

As you can tell... I could complain."
Mismatched,"Goddamn the whole first 10 minute is action packed. The only sequence you‚Äôd only see on blockbusters. 

That‚Äôs a $150 million mini series for ya."
Mismatched,"I‚Äôm seeing a lot of hate about the boat subplot, but I think it‚Äôs a good metaphor for the broader story.  The two of them are arguing over what to do with a family heirloom, their heritage. Do you keep it around to memorialize the past, or sell it to secure a better future?
It looks like they were reading their August Wilson."
Mismatched,"That boat sub plot is stupid and a very poor attempt at ""normalizing"" Falcon.."
Mismatched,"Stop trying to make /r/MarvelStudiosPlus happen, op (which you also moderate, BTW)

This is the subreddit for the show. [r/thefalconandthews/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thefalconandthews/)"
Mismatched,Decent episode.
Mismatched,"Pretty solid. Only big gripe is boat storyline which I just cannot buy at all. Actually liking most of the side characters a fair amount, though some noticeable bad accents going on when they speak in foreign languages"
Mismatched,"So the funeral scene made me think about something.

If Steve is dead, does that mean they told everyone he went back in time and died of old age?  Or did they make something up?"
Mismatched,"For those complaining that Sam is an Avenger and his friends could give/lend him money, that's not how it works even in the comics. Peter Parker has saved the world countless times yet often struggles to get money and worked as a school teacher. Clint Barton lives a normal life in an apartment complex and isn't wealthy. Scott Lang was a thief. If everyone's troubles could be solved by taking handouts from Stark, their stories wouldn't be very interesting. That isn't to say that the boat plot is flawless, but that yes, it's believable that he doesn't have money. This is only a few months after the Blip and the banker seems more concerned with his lack of income for the past five years (which is ridiculous but then again I'd also believe that banks would be that stingy). This is only chapter one, let's see how it plays out."
Mismatched,"I find it so weird that the bad guys wants to.. unify the world in peace? I understand the concept of the means don't justify the ends and that those people use terrorism, but still it's just a weird optic that they went with that concept as something bad."
Mismatched,"So are these shows all gonna focus on an issue now?

Wanda was PTSD (how that word was never mentioned in the show is a miracle) and this seems to be guilt and depression so far."
Mismatched,These fuckers can't miss anymore can they? Marvel has become an absolute machine.
Mismatched,[deleted]
Mismatched,I really like the first episode. It was grounded and felt very personal at times. The struggle of characters were believable and expanding further the universe. It's good to see that little people exist in the MCU and have their own problems that are related to the events of the movies. Like the administration hell resulted by Thanos' snap.
Mismatched,"It was okay. Liked the action scene. Would have been nice for the people that were speaking french, to be french, they had giant accents, but it's whatever. Always love to see GSP. I liked Bucky's story more, but the final minute got me really interested into Sam's story, so fair play. The pacing is a bit too slow for my liking, and it might turn some people off. 


 Also I hated so much the close up angles they kept doing. They zoom way too close, for way too long. I get the effect they tried to do, but at some point it just got hard to see. Couldn't see the performance at all."
Mismatched,As a woman I'd like to declare this weasel looking guy is not my Captain America
Mismatched,"As a black person, I really enjoyed Sam‚Äôs family subplot. To see him interact with his family and community and the use of AAVE throughout the episode was super... comforting. They do a great job of not whitewashing him. 

I feel like the people who don‚Äôt like it are probably the same ones who didn‚Äôt laugh when he said ‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt play with these white folks.‚Äù üëÄ But that‚Äôs a convo for another time."
Mismatched,This was a great premier! And Bucky with short hair is superior
Heart & Soul,"Man, reading the headline he was rushed to hospital from a heart attack was worrying as fuck. So glad he's still here."
Heart & Soul,"This man is a treasure. I'm grateful he's still around, and he seems profoundly changed by what he went through. There's a depth to his interviews post health scare that I find very endearing."
Heart & Soul,That was already a year ago? I felt I just read that 2 months ago
Heart & Soul,"One of my favorite artists, from comedy to action to drama he connects with me"
Heart & Soul,Well we feel unworthy of his acting so it all balances out
Heart & Soul,I heard he has every classic car
Heart & Soul,"""Only two things I know about Albuquerque - Bugs Bunny should've taken a left turn there. And give me a hundred tries, I'll never be able spell it.""




Dude is an absolute gem and we're lucky he wants to entertain us."
Heart & Soul,[Don't blame the dildos!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGm0-bfPS8A)
Heart & Soul,Better win a damn Emmy this year!
Heart & Soul,I heard him talking about the whole thing on NPR. One of the staff during filming had a defibrillator in her car only because she went to return it to a friend but they weren't home. He's extremely lucky
Heart & Soul,Everyone talking about his acting and passing over the fact that he has been responsible for bringing new comedians up since the 80‚Äôs. From Jon Stewart to Jack Black to Scott Aukerman to Tim and Eric. Not to mention all the stand ups he promoted. His last tweet before the heart attack was telling people to see someone do standup. He‚Äôs a behind the scenes one man hype train and every comedy fan today owes him a bit of thanks.
Heart & Soul,Legend
Heart & Soul,"I‚Äôd heard his physical prep for Mr. Nobody saved this dude‚Äôs life.

Truly thankful he‚Äôs still with us. Bob‚Äôs a kind gentleman."

Heart & Soul,He better call saul for his medical bills
Heart & Soul,Better call saul is better than breaking bad. Don't @ me.

Heart & Soul,What‚Äôs unworthy is the AMC+ app. Still haven‚Äôt been able to finish watching it streaming on Tv. Oh look and Twitter has hordes of others with the same issue trying to watch it.
Heart & Soul,God bless Bob Odenkirk.
Heart & Soul,[deleted]
Heart & Soul,"I have loved Bob since I was a snot-nosed kid watching fresh DVDs of Mr. Show, and this mister has shown that he‚Äôs capable of making me laugh, cry, gasp, and everything in between. He is a trooper, and I love how many people appreciate him after a decades-long career.

I‚Äôll never gatekeep Bob for those who mostly know him from BB and BCS. I‚Äôm just happy he‚Äôs getting the love and recognition he deserves. Holy hell, he sucks at singing, but he‚Äôs absolutely brilliant. 

I swear if I met him, I would just freeze up and yell ‚ÄúCAR WASH CHANGE THIEF ACTION SQUAD!‚Äù instead of saying ‚ÄúThank you for the absurdity and the relatable belly laughs. There have been a lot of moments in my life where I think ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a Mr. Show reference that fits this situation.‚Äô You truly are King Shit of Fuck Mountain. But stay humble!‚Äù"
Heart & Soul,"I didn't know who Bob Odenkirk was as recently as early 2020 just before the pandemic started, that's when I watched Breaking Bad for the first time ever. 

After BB I continued into El Camino and then started Better Call Saul which is now my favorite show and Bob quickly became one of my favorite actors ever."
Heart & Soul,"His acting is only getting better. Maybe he's a character actor, but TV and many movies belong to an actor like him. I look forward to Bob Odenkirk for many years to come!"
Heart & Soul,"Ahhhh man, I have such a great personal story around this that I want to share, even though it will get lost in here. Bear with me, it's a kind of long one. 

So I did some Extra work in Yellowstone when they came back to filming (in Montana) for season 4. First real, on set, experience. Was great and all, but I do not watch Yellowstone. 

So it got me itching to be on something I watched and loved. Enter BCS. Why? Because I worked in NM already because of my day job. I figured I should find something filming in areas I had easy access too.

I found the casting agency and did the same thing that I did when applying for Yellowstone. Worked. Got a call from the lead casting agent and got placed for an upcoming filming. Figured out the logistics and made it work so my main job lined up with the shoot. 

Day before filming. Aleady went to studio's lab and good to go. No Covid. Good to go. Now just waiting on hearing back from the casting department on where I needed to go and passwords to call sheets and set times. But...nothing. 

By lunch I get a little antsy as we are under 24 hours now and my experience on Yellowstone was that I got call info the night before shooting. I happened to be walking by by a group of police officers. I stopped and asked for a selfish pic with them. They were clearly annoyed, but obliged. You see, I was supposed to play a cop, or some sort of law enforcement type in my booked role. Smart ass me thinks that I will send the lead casting agent an email with the new cop pic saying that I was ""doing research"" for my role. That way it would provoke them to give me the call time and rest of shoot stuff, without looking desperate for an answer as to why I was booked, but had no info yet. 

Nothing. Dinner came and went and still not a single bit of communication. I was actually pretty bummed. I had accepted that something happened and it just wasn't my time to be on a show I loved. Still confused, I sulked to my hotel that I had booked for the night. 

After checking in, I decided to get a night cap on the rooftop patio bar to drown my sorrows. It was when my drink came to me that my phone excitedly vibrated in my front jeans pocket. Finally! The info I was looking for in regards to tomorrow's shoot! That could be the only reason I was getting the buzz notification from my cell. I was wrong.

The buzz was a notification all right. But it was a breaking news notification. The notification read that Better Call Saul lead actor had a heart attack on set and there was no updated info past that. Fuck me.

Bob just had a heart attack that morning and there was nothing more than that. Now I knew exactly why I had heard nothing from the casting department. Here's the deal though....

About 5% of me was ""Ego"" that defaulted to ""Oh fuck, I am not going to get to shoot on one of my favorite shows."". Another 5% of me was also selfish in thinking ""Oh fuck, if he is dead, or dying, there goes any answers to the finality of this series!"". 

90% of me though? Was like most of us and like many of his fans. The emotion that was most prevalent was of true hope. Hope that he was ok and that he would pull through it. Fuck the missed opportunity, fuck the chance at BCS being done. This was truly a great human (can confirm as I did end up getting to film with BOB! on this seasons BCS and he was as awesome as you hear about) and the grief of losing someone like him was real. Just an amazing outpouring of love to him over all the social media platforms. Showed how much people truly loved this gem. 

I know I did. 

That's the first part to that story, but really wanted to share. As it turns out, I was supposed to play the guy cop that Kim drives up to in Episode 9. Where she rolls down the window as she pulls up to them? Yeah, played a way different role months later when I got back on set. That's another story and is related to the picture of me and Jonathan Banks (Mike) that you can find if you scroll far enough on my post history. 

Cheers Bob! We all love you and are glad to still have you rocking in the free world!"
Heart & Soul,Does anyone know the scene he was filming when the heart attack happened?
Heart & Soul,Sometimes I still think what could‚Äôve been if Bob was cast as Michael Scott
Heart & Soul,Bob odenkirk is a true chad and a king. You can tell from watching him he‚Äôs just a genuine humble great guy.
Heart & Soul,"Unworthy of the heart attack, too.  
No more heart attacks for Bob."
Heart & Soul,"Honestly? Nothing but respect for the man. He went from comedy duo to one of the most powerful and memeable faces on the internet. Not that I don‚Äôt like what he did with Cross, but it‚Äôs a little bit of a Key and Peele situation, you know? The point is, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs here and healthy."
Heart & Soul,"Feel unworthy?!  
  
Dude, he's a fantastic actor. Every time I see him in an interview he seems like a humble, genuine, compassionate person. I've never heard of anyone speaking ill of the man. He's a Hollywood darling, and truly worthy of all the love and support."
Heart & Soul,"We‚Äôre unworthy of your performances, Bob. Keep crushing."
Heart & Soul,i's all good man
Heart & Soul,"Do we know what episode he was shooting, when he had the heart attack?"
Heart & Soul,Reminds me i havent seen ‚ÄúNobody‚Äù yet.
Heart & Soul,I‚Äôm really glad he finally hit it big with this series. He‚Äôs been in so much stuff throughout his career but finally got the real big time and got his due.
Heart & Soul,*Insert BCS theme*
Heart & Soul,They had to use the defib 3 times. Medical professions usually don‚Äôt try after the second try because the chances of bringing someone back in round three is like less than 3%
Heart & Soul,"FYI:  If you haven't seen Nobody, it's totally worth the watch.  Odenkirk is great in it. It's ultra-violent, like John Wick violent, but it's a good movie.

Edit:  As thankfully corrected, I changed the name to the proper movie"
Heart & Soul,Man that's some bad survivors guilt if that's a genuine statement. Hope he doesn't actually feel that way
Heart & Soul,"""I will forever feel unworthy of it.""

Marie: Then kill yourself."
Heart & Soul,I really want for him to be in a Kevin Smith movie.
Heart & Soul,[removed]
Heart & Soul,Got his Covid shots and then had a heart attack like millions of other lesser known people.
Heart & Soul,"If my ex girlfriend sues me, can I use Saul Goodman as a defense lawyer?"
Heart & Soul,Bob Odenkirk sucks
Heart & Soul,">I will forever feel unworthy for it. 

Ahhh. Classic Ralph"
Heart & Soul,He forgot to add god damnit!
Heart & Soul,We love Bob!
Heart & Soul,I really like that guy.
Heart & Soul,Bob is fantastic and was definitely worthy of that heart attack!!
Heart & Soul,I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever seen so many people come together in support of someone the way I did on that day (with good reason)! So so so happy he pulled through.
Heart & Soul,A treasure ‚ô•Ô∏è
Heart & Soul,Side note: less than 20% of heart attack victims survive.
Heart & Soul,I have such a crush on him. He‚Äôs so talented and humble. Glad he‚Äôs okay.
Heart & Soul,A year already? Wtf is time doing these days.
Heart & Soul,"In another timeline we lost him and BCS, insane to think about what we almost lost."
Heart & Soul,He actually owns three unworthies.
Heart & Soul,He‚Äôs done a lot of great work & helps kids like Tim & Erix
Heart & Soul,He deserves all the praise.
Heart & Soul,Heh what a cutie
Heart & Soul,"Mr. Odenkirk, you are indeed worthy of it."
Heart & Soul,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be forever but still a nice thing to say.
Heart & Soul,This is most Mr. Show pic I‚Äôve seen in years.
Heart & Soul,"Imma just throw this out there:
Rogers, Hanks, Ross, and ‚Ä¶. Odenkirk?

I may be reaching, but not too far!"
Heart & Soul,I hope this means he brings back the Hail Satan Network. Been too long between episodes. Why on earth would that show be canceled?!!
Heart & Soul,Bob Odinkirk is the man!
Heart & Soul,Bob is the man
Heart & Soul,I hope we get to see more of Bob in other roles for years to come or however long he wants to do it
Heart & Soul,He should e called Saul
Heart & Soul,We are forever unworthy of your entertainment Mr. Odenkirk. ü´°
Heart & Soul,This guy is nobody
Heart & Soul,"Till this day, the greatest compliment I have gotten is someone saying I sound like Bob Odenkirk."
Heart & Soul,So often i don't think people mean it.  I have no doubt here.
Heart & Soul,Wow! It's been a year already? Feels like a few months.
Heart & Soul,love saul
Heart & Soul,‚ù§Ô∏è
Heart & Soul,This man has done some of my favorite stuff from Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul to Nobody and as far back as Mr Show. Thank you Bob and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre still with us
Heart & Soul,He‚Äôs bloody great.
Heart & Soul,"I was on my way home from a road trip when the news broke over the radio and I kept listening for updates all the way back, which was a long drive. Didn‚Äôt hear Bob was stable until almost home. 

I remember it was the same day that the ZZ Top bassist died."
Heart & Soul,"Great guy.

I remember when he was a guest on Space Ghost Coast to Coast.

I still need to see that action movie he did recently."
Heart & Soul,I love this man
Heart & Soul,"This man's a goddamn performer. I liked him in breaking bad, he was great in BCS, but I'd never expect Nobody to be one of his best roles and my top 5 movies recently. If you feel unworthy, mister Odenkirk, imagine how we feel"
Heart & Soul,I‚Äôve been listening to his autobiography and he is a joy.
Heart & Soul,better call saul headass
Heart & Soul,Love Bob. I'm not living in a van down the river because of him.
Heart & Soul,"Just listened to a Fresh Air interview with him and he sounded‚Ä¶ obnoxiously happy. 

Good for him."
Heart & Soul,Do we know what scene they filmed right before it happened?
Heart & Soul,"I feel so bad for Rhea Seehorn. Can you imagine your close friend and colleague literally fucking collapses in front of you, and then finding out that if he was by himself he would have died?

She seems really nonchalant about it in interviews but I hope she got some help after the fact cause something like that can really fuck someone up"
Heart & Soul,"So relieved he recovered.  I hope he's still making people laugh (or cry, since he's branched into dramatic work) for decades to come because he is so damned talented."
Heart & Soul,"So glad Bob is still alive and him being alive is essentially a miracle and he was very lucky .. if he wasn't filming that day and was in home alone then he would have died.. 

Also enjoying better call saul a lot.."
Heart & Soul,Saul
Heart & Soul,Hope he continues to make a swift recovery.
Heart & Soul,"Don‚Äôt drive drunk! 


But if you do, call me"
Heart & Soul,The season of better call Saul is wild too. If they don‚Äôt absolutely take in the awards at the Emmys I will be legitimately upset. Rhea Seehorn deserves multiple Emmy‚Äôs for her work alone.
Heart & Soul,Your Nobody!  Of course we support you!
Heart & Soul,There's this fucked up old school comedy that I watched called 'let's go to prison' and I was surprised to see bob .. as a lawyer in it. He also directed the movie. I actually loved its sillyness and would reccomend it
As Aventuras de Poliana,Did De Niro just watch Tulsa King and get an idea?
As Aventuras de Poliana,He‚Äôs lining up projects after relatively slowing down since 2017 (as compared to his output from 2002 to 2016). And these projects don‚Äôt seem as bad as the ones from his past two decades. The only downright bad one on the docket is the Geezer Teaser he is in with John Malkovich and Jack Huston.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I‚Äôd rather watch a series about ‚ÄòMr. B. Natural‚Äô. 

https://mst3k.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._B_Natural_(character)"
As Aventuras de Poliana,Every actor does payday jobs once in a while. De Niro probably wants his career to go out on a high note.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I'd rather watch a series about the OG [Mr. Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Natural_%28character%29).
As Aventuras de Poliana,Mr. B‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre hot!
As Aventuras de Poliana,Yeah. And roles for people his age dry up quite a bit so he‚Äôs a bit limited in choices as well.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Well worth noting this article is talking about the Italian Citadel spin-off show. The big budget US version (estimated to cost $250 million for 7 episodes!) finished filming back in July and is in post-production. Additional spin-off shows are expected for India and Mexico.
As Aventuras de Poliana,The girl from The Undoing? Ok I might give this a chance
As Aventuras de Poliana,This entire project screams mediocre flop.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Wow, this is an ambitious project. A U.S based show that itself has a mammoth budget serving as a launching pad for global installments in various other countries, in the local language with ethically correct cast. Intriguing."
As Aventuras de Poliana,Lost me at Russo's. Their work post MCU has been abysmal.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"This show has a pretty stacked cast, I'm definitely looking forward to it."
As Aventuras de Poliana,That's a spicy meatball!
As Aventuras de Poliana,She is certainly pretty
As Aventuras de Poliana,I‚Äôm kinda surprised how she didn‚Äôt explode post the Undoing. She was nothing special acting wise but her look and overall aura is one that Hollywood usually falls over.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Still waiting for these guys to make something worth watching post-Marvel
As Aventuras de Poliana,"one helluva distracting performance, I may add"
As Aventuras de Poliana,Sure has. I enjoyed Grey Man because of the cast but it was nothing spectacular.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Q was not a villain.
As Aventuras de Poliana,mon capitaine
As Aventuras de Poliana,Wouldn't really call him a villain. More of an Anti-hero with humanities best interests at heart.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"unchanged Q cgi deaged john de lancie to Picard ""my word Jean Luc what has happened to you? you're old and a robot? who makes an old robot?"" snaps fingers, q turns old ""there I am old now too...."""
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Q was a dick but not a villain, hell by the end of the series it's pretty much all but confirmed (most) everything he's done has been to help humanity and he's actively working with Picard"
As Aventuras de Poliana,‚ÄúVillain‚Äù is such a shortsighted descriptor here...
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I know I‚Äôm immortal but I‚Äôve chosen to look like the sad air controller  dad on Breaking Bad to mock *your* age, Mon Capitan!"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Q was a jester hero. Excusing his early writing before TNG figured it out, Q was using a goofy character to inspire picard to look beyond the dimensions he was stuck in. He showed him his life was better with its mistakes, inspired humanity out of complacency against the borg, tested their compassion by ""pretending"" to lose his powers, and coached human kind through passing the trial he began in season one.

He showed Riker and the crew that power doesn't make a man or solve all problems, helped data become more human by testing his resolve when he offered him the easy way out. 

Q is a hero, pretending to play the fool.

""it takes a smart man to convince people you're stupid."" -Barney Rubble"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Hearing Picard's voice over after watching Next Gen last night, they are just two different people unfortunately."
As Aventuras de Poliana,Q snaps his fingers and turns Picard into Rom in episode 1. The entire season Is Max Grodenchik playing Picard trapped in Rom‚Äôs body. Marlon Wayans plays the new sidekick.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Hopefully he reverses everything they fucked up in season 1
As Aventuras de Poliana,"**STP:** Hey, check out our new Star Trek!

**(Some) Fans:** Uh, it's kind of weirdly aggressive and cynical for Star Trek.

**STP:** Pff, that's because this is its own new thing, dumb-dumb. You can't judge it based on what the original show was. 

**Also STP:** Hey, it's Riker! Hey, it's Troi! Hey, it's Data! Hey, it's Icheb! Hey, it's Seven of Nine! Hey, it's Maddox the guy who was in one episode of season two of TNG and then name-dropped maybe three other times! Hey, it's the Borg! Hey, it's Q!"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Cool, they're gonna ruin Q too. Oh lemme guess, they're gonna completely assassinate his character and make him completely malevolent and he'll be the big baddie they have to stop from destroying the universe, again. Thats all these new Star Trek shows are. Some baddie threatens entire universe, and the protags must stop him. Annnnnnd repeat."
As Aventuras de Poliana,Wouldn‚Äôt it be hilarious if Q was John de Lancie all this time?
As Aventuras de Poliana,So many people hate Q episodes. I am emphatically not one of those people.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Hopefully calling Q a villain is a mistake by the article writer and not the show runners.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I bet the plot in Season 2 will be they go back in time to pose as someone close to the President of the United States; posting random messages online under the simple moniker of ‚ÄúQ‚Äù, giving rise to a global conspiracy theory that culminates in people storming the capital of the US in a mad mob of zeal and fervor 

I‚Äôve been watching too much HBO lately..."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Oh cool, another thing I know. Surely this will make the show good now"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Q wasn't a villain, but I have no doubts this show will botch him the same way they've botched everything else."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Great. I look forward to more Star Trek fixtures being artlessly smashed into plots about saving the entire spacetime continuum or whatever. My favorite part will be when a hundred identical ships start shooting each other and my brain starts leaking out my ears just as a bunch of characters I either never knew existed-- because they were in a fucking ancillary web series-- or cared about remotely show up in space fighters we never established they could fly to dogfight the other space fighters that are also there, for some reason."
As Aventuras de Poliana,Will he call Picard a fucking cunt because Star Trek is edgy now?
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I hope they retcon the android Picard bullshit and everything else from the first season.

It was Q all along! Ta-da! Now lets gets some proper writers on there instead of the revolving door that ran that disaster."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Can't wait for RLM's Season 2 videos then.

Nu-Trek is dire."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"For anyone who played StarCraft 2: Legacy of the Void, you recognize John  de Lancie's voice immediately as Alarak. His character in StarCraft is like the closest thing we have gotten to the Q levels of snark in the last while, and its amazing: 

https://youtu.be/J3zvVswYsYg

Taunt lines from Heroes of the Storm: https://youtu.be/hQQJSo6e7YU"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Sigh, Q was not a villian"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Hm.

Wonder how they're gonna ruin Q? Guess we'll see."
As Aventuras de Poliana,This would be an awesome announcement if it weren't for the fact that Picard was a garbage show that threw a lot of long-built characterizations out the window for the sake of explosions and edgy language.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I had hoped that Whoopi being back as Guinan meant that de Lancie would be back as Q. Glad it is all happening.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Q was probably the second best thing beside the Borg in TNG and John De Lancie was so iconic. I can't wait for him to show up young then mock Jean Luc in some way before becoming old like him. Hopefully this brings back the old Picard...Stewarts kinder gentler Picard just didn't feel right in the first season. We need the stern yelling at Wesley for fucking up Picard! Who better to bring that out than Q...

&#x200B;

Also bring back Wesley so Picard can yell at him!"
As Aventuras de Poliana,There's going to be a second season? After that terrible terrible first? WHAT?
As Aventuras de Poliana,Guinan and Q confrontation confirmed?
As Aventuras de Poliana,Eat any good books lately?
As Aventuras de Poliana,"You've gotten old Q. Forced to spend more time as a human again?

You're a golem of your own self Picard. Forced to spend another season under bad writing again?

aight Q, its about to be September '87 again, all up in this bitch."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Maybe Q will say to Picard,‚Äùwtf are you doing in this shitty Universe?‚Äù and send him back to the real Star Trek Universe."
As Aventuras de Poliana,It's too bad STP is just so terrible.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Au contraire, mon capitaine! He's back!"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Don't know how many of you are gamers, but I recomend you guys play X-Com 2. It has several voice actors from TNG. Riker,Troy, worf, and Q. Apologies if I misspelled the names. Excellent voice from them all"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Oh You‚Äôre so old, which is weird because you‚Äôre supposed to be basically a God. Oh, and I‚Äôm a Villiam now too."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"You want real no-shit, non cliche BS Star Trek? Go watch NuBSG (or *For All Mankind*).  Ron Moore was the heart and soul of TNGs best, and it shows."
As Aventuras de Poliana,The best Q news in years
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I wish the RedLetterMedia guys would make a short video about this news, I wanna know what Rich Evans personally think about it."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"OMG YES!!!!

I was hoping for Q to make an appearance!!"
As Aventuras de Poliana,This is the best news I've had all year.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I'm only about 3/4 of the way through season 3 on my first complete watch of TNG and even I can tell Q  isn't a villain.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I hope season 2 isn't as awful as 1 was. I would rather watch discovery before I watch Picard again.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Villain? 

I think not"
As Aventuras de Poliana,I doubt even that legend could save that pile of shite.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Fuck ueah, Q is gonna fondle the star trek balls of everyone"
As Aventuras de Poliana,Odds on Q being retconned into something unrecognizable?
As Aventuras de Poliana,Picard and Discovery were so bad I'm ashamed to call myself a Trekkie now.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"""Look Picard.. I'm as old as you!  """
As Aventuras de Poliana,"The trial never ended, mon capitan."
As Aventuras de Poliana,So who likes these new shows. Seems like theyre hated every time i hear them talked about
As Aventuras de Poliana,I trust a garbage show like Star Trek: Picard to fuck this up
As Aventuras de Poliana,Picard was the worst written Star Trek all time and I'm including the 5th movie.  The ending made me lose all faith in the universe as a tv property and this news saddens me more than anything I've heard form ST in a while since it means they'll destroy yet another amazing part of the best series in that universe.
As Aventuras de Poliana,MAKE PICARD GAY YOU COWARDS
As Aventuras de Poliana,Now they can ruin him too.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Sign. Me. Up.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Hopefully for more than 1 episode like most of the cameos in S1.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I always liked Q. I‚Äôll be back for season two.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I know the whole point is to drum up excitement in advance... but sometimes I wish the shows would just let stuff like this happen as a surprise.
As Aventuras de Poliana,I hope this is the Q that has partially changed through his time as seen in Voyager
As Aventuras de Poliana,"""Must you be so ethical?""  - Q to Picard"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"This Q may not have been a villain, but given the present associations of ‚ÄúQ,‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to not think of evil when hearing that name."
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Posting this as my own random fan theory...

In the trailer, the image pans from the model of the *USS Stargazer* to the hourglass, and the sand is falling up -> PS shares that the episode involves profound trauma ->¬†trauma is related to Picard‚Äôs guilt over Jack Crusher‚Äôs death.¬†

¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
As Aventuras de Poliana,GET OFF MY BRIDGE
As Aventuras de Poliana,He'll forever be the guy inside my Compaq Presario.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Never understood why they didn‚Äôt have Q in one of the movies.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Awesome news!
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I absolutely hated the Q episodes, yet I'm very happy this is happening."
As Aventuras de Poliana,I‚Äôm just out here wondering what he‚Äôs gonna do with the B‚Äôhala tablet.
As Aventuras de Poliana,Man I can‚Äôt wait to see rich and mike tear this up.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"I would love to see a plotline in which a cult forms around Q, and then he calls all of his own followers micro-brains.    


In essence, I want to watch John de Lancie rail against Q-anon."
As Aventuras de Poliana,So much YES!!
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Straight up, is the show any good? I'm almost done with Deep Space 9 and I'll need more trek"
As Aventuras de Poliana,"My theory is Q realized humanity was on track to evolve to the level of the Q or even surpass them and that's why they always took interest in humans and even more so now that humans are farther out in the galaxy by the time TNG rolls around...

Q admires humans and is even a little bit envious and scared of what we will become but in his own way he's trying to help"
As Aventuras de Poliana,Well this should lead to some batshit conspiracy theories.
As Aventuras de Poliana,This sounds so promising. Honestly I hated S1. Hoping they make Picard less like a grumpy senile frail old man trying to convince others to help him and more like our next generation captain. Fingers crossed.
As Aventuras de Poliana,"Don't expect a good season if they have the same mediocre writers.  Still though, I'll check it out and pray.   Can the writers watch the original series to see how Q acted?   Is that asking too much?  Can he at least stay in character?"
As Aventuras de Poliana,Q was not a villain
As Aventuras de Poliana,Why will an immortal look so aged?
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,Astonishing living in a world where NBC has no comedies on their fall schedule. Unthinkable even 5 years ago.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,NBC has no fall comedies? That's b-r-u-t-a-l
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,i feel like this would be inevitable after they did the two covid-themed ones for parks and rec and 30 rock (though the 30 rock one was a bad skit to basically just do the upfronts presentation)
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,Look forward to the Mr. Mayor one!
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,Can't hurt.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,I like Mr Mayor and Young Rock but Kenan is super boring. I‚Äôll give it another chance but not expecting much.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"Actually a really solid, not too risky, move ‚Äî especially these shows."
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"The parents company had tried this before... I remember there being holiday episodes of several shows, like Eureka and Psych... 1 year there were like 3 or 4 of them between Syfy and USA, which are both owned by NBC Universal"
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,It will be interesting to see more between-seasons Holiday Specials after GotG? Can you imagine Star Wars doing a canon one with the Disney+ shows? Will Avatar have one?
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,The best Xmas present would be keeping Kenan off the air forever.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,All these shows are hot garbage and I do not know how they got renewed. Seems like there is nothing good on network tv and that Netflix and Amazon Prime are dominating in quality shows.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,This seems to be the bigger headline than the holiday specials!
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"I have a theory that Kenan was planned to be a three camera sitcom but Covid turned it into a single cam because they couldn't get a studio audience and didn't want to use a laugh track. 

That first season, and especially the pilot, looks very multi cam like with their sets and looks like they chose to call an audible with their camera angles because no angle fully showed the sets because then you'd see the empty audience seats as opposed to a complete home. 

I wouldn't be surprised if their second season is able to fully move into a single cam format and the writing will reflect that better."
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"David Caspe is showrunner on Keenan. 

Guy was responsible for Happy Endings.  Anything he does deserves a second or third look."
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"Kenan is a bit boring, but the characters are pretty real. The daughters are strong for child actors. Don Johnson is humorous without being a buffoon. Next season, they need to do more with some of the other actors at Kenna‚Äôs talk show. Fortune Feimster did nothing this whole season."
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,I've always felt like Kenan's brother not being played by Kel was a big mistake.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,I think that the holiday special are something special and we nerd to see them again
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,Or you could just not watch it
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"The show and sets look exactly like it should be a three camera sitcom, but it‚Äôs been a single cam since it was [announced](https://deadline.com/2019/05/kenan-thompson-comedy-the-kenan-show-series-order-nbc-1202611924/) in May 2019 long before COVID. 

As someone who loved Parks and Rec who had a poor first season compared to the rest of the run, and also a fan of Great News that was canceled too early after 2 seasons, I‚Äôm always on the side of letting a show grow into themselves if the premise/cast/talent attached is promising."
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,Thats why the camera kept switching from laughing track sitcom to mockumentary style.
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,Fair enough
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,and happy endings really got going in its second season so maybe keenan needs a bit more time to get going too
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,I gave up on Kenan it‚Äôs really boring I still watch Mayor and Young Rock though
Holiday Home Makeover with Mr. Christmas,"> The show and sets look exactly like it should be a three camera sitcom, but it‚Äôs been a single cam since it was announced in May 2019 long before COVID.

Interesting. Thats such an odd decision to make. If you know your show is a single cam from day 1, then you should have better sets instead of having it feel like some weird hybrid. I guess it was just cheaper to shoot it how they did."

We Are the Champions,"I'm interested to see the cheese rolling bit. It's so stupid, I love it."
We Are the Champions,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
We Are the Champions,The visual of Joel‚Äôs wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.
We Are the Champions,"I like how Troy Baker is listed as Video Game ""Joel"" in the BTS after the episode"
We Are the Champions,there is 100% a very bad reason why david was a teacher before the outbreak
We Are the Champions,"I do like how at first it seemed like they only ate the one guy who died, but then joel finds the whole room full of bodies. so they been at this a while"
We Are the Champions,[removed]
We Are the Champions,Always wondered how a video game actor as good as Troy Baker would do as a live action actor. The answer is good
We Are the Champions,So was the implication that they were eating the girl‚Äôs father in the dining hall? (Among many other people evidently)
We Are the Champions,"""It's okay, I believe him."" 

So badass and so chilling at the same time."
We Are the Champions,[removed]
We Are the Champions,the meat from the soup isn't venison is it...
We Are the Champions,That grown man just slapped a little orphan girl in the face and then fed her her father. Eric Cartman would be proud.
We Are the Champions,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
We Are the Champions,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
We Are the Champions,‚ÄúI made you eat your parents‚Äù
We Are the Champions,the actor for david did a great job
We Are the Champions,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
We Are the Champions,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
We Are the Champions,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
We Are the Champions,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
We Are the Champions,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‚Äòown‚Äô her as his pet at his side. I‚Äôd recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
We Are the Champions,"I‚Äôm seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
We Are the Champions,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
We Are the Champions,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
We Are the Champions,"""Baby girl"" ü•∫ 

Gonna go weep brb"
We Are the Champions,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
We Are the Champions,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
We Are the Champions,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
We Are the Champions,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
We Are the Champions,"Indicative of David‚Äôs character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else‚Äôs

Edit - 4x‚Äôs the cannibalism"
We Are the Champions,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
We Are the Champions,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
We Are the Champions,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
We Are the Champions,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
We Are the Champions,[removed]
We Are the Champions,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
We Are the Champions,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
We Are the Champions,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, ‚Äúbaby girl.‚Äù"
We Are the Champions,I‚Äôd nit pick Joel‚Äôs recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn‚Äôt so fucking awesome
We Are the Champions,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I‚Äôd expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
We Are the Champions,"""I believe  him"""
We Are the Champions,100% that kid‚Äôs dad was the ear
We Are the Champions,Oh yeah. That‚Äôs that shit I like right there
We Are the Champions,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
We Are the Champions,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
We Are the Champions,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
We Are the Champions,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
We Are the Champions,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
We Are the Champions,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season üò¨"
We Are the Champions,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
We Are the Champions,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn‚Äôt others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
We Are the Champions,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay baby girl‚Äù was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, ‚ÄúIn an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.‚Äù And damn if Joel and Ellie aren‚Äôt stainless steel survivors."
We Are the Champions,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
We Are the Champions,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
We Are the Champions,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I‚Äôd just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
We Are the Champions,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
We Are the Champions,Great episode overall. I wish they could‚Äôve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
We Are the Champions,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
We Are the Champions,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
We Are the Champions,I counted 22 stabs‚Ä¶damn Ellie
We Are the Champions,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
We Are the Champions,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
We Are the Champions,If you‚Äôre gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
We Are the Champions,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
We Are the Champions,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
We Are the Champions,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
We Are the Champions,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
We Are the Champions,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
We Are the Champions,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn‚Äôt still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind üò≥
We Are the Champions,"I‚Äôm curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
We Are the Champions,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
We Are the Champions,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
We Are the Champions,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
We Are the Champions,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
We Are the Champions,[removed]
We Are the Champions,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
We Are the Champions,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
We Are the Champions,"As someone who‚Äôs never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It‚Äôs hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I‚Äôve seen in ages, and am loving it."
We Are the Champions,Ellie‚Äôs screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
We Are the Champions,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
We Are the Champions,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
We Are the Champions,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
We Are the Champions,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
We Are the Champions,That went by so fast
We Are the Champions,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
We Are the Champions,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
We Are the Champions,Pretty faithful to the game. Wish that David would have said the line of how is he supposed to explain his broken finger to everyone else. Then Ellie introduces herself.
We Are the Champions,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
We Are the Champions,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
We Are the Champions,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
We Are the Champions,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
We Are the Champions,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay baby girl, I got you‚Äù I AM NOT OK"
We Are the Champions,"Holy fuck that episode was intense. There were so many incredible lines of dialogue in this episode too.

The final scene with Ellie in the dining hall literally had my jaw dropped. The emotion Bella showed as she killed the cannibal rapist preacher was next level. What an incredible actress.

I love how this show doesn't linger on side characters. They introduce them, somehow make us invested in just a few minutes and then move on. They don't spend half a season stuck in one QZ. They don't draw out things like Joel coming back from the stabbing. I absolutely love that about this show."
We Are the Champions,"the biggest twist from david for me its not that he is cannibal or creep r-----. But that he actually worship cordyceps all along, its his God, find god after apocalypse, etc."
We Are the Champions,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
We Are the Champions,Fuck.
We Are the Champions,"Jesus, that was intense"
We Are the Champions,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
We Are the Champions,"I thought it was weird that the fire did absolutely nothing the entire last scene.  Neither of the characters acted like there was a fire and they had a lot of fire cutaways like it was building to something.  After she got out I expected the fire to attract colonists, but they just walked away.  If everything was on fire just for the vibes I think it was done badly."
Survivor,That must be terrifying honestly. Coogan is probably one of the most talented impersonators perhaps ever - imagine meeting him dressed up as your abuser.
Survivor,The BBC can go fuck themselves. They protected him for decades and facilitated in the destruction of children.
Survivor,"The audacity of the BBC to make this programme when they were his biggest protectors. It is unspoken that Jimmy Savile was barred from the BBC Scotland, instead of doing something about it, they all just swept it under the carpet and will now profit from it."
Survivor,"‚ÄúHoodwinked a nation‚Äù.  No he didn‚Äôt, he and other presenters were aided and abetted by many others including staff at the BBC, and members of the police.  PR-washing at its best."
Survivor,"Jimmy makes for an easy 'bogeyman' taking the focus away from others who were complicit in abuse, and covering up abuse, at the time.

Though I do believe too much is made of the King's past 'friendship' with him. The fact remains, Jimmy did a crazy amount for charity. It excuses nothing (maybe in his own twisted mind, it somehow did), but it explains why there was ever any royal connection. Very few have done more for charitable causes than Charles himself. I'll never believe there was any more to it than that."
Survivor,"Reminder that Jimmy Savile was an unofficial advisor and confidant of then Prince Charles

>""Nobody will ever know what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that.

The Royal Family was close to Savile, there is ZERO possibility they were unaware of the allegations.   

Prince Andrew was close with Jeff Epstein, Prince Charles was close with Jimmy Savile, it isn't too tough to figure out why Epstein and Savile basically got away with their crimes"
Survivor,"There‚Äôs no way anybody gets that close to the Royal Family and Prime Ministers without being thoroughly investigated, so MI5 must either be the most inept intelligence service on the planet, or they knew exactly what he was up to, did nothing and helped cover up."
Survivor,"Omg I did not know this was in the works!

Interested in how this turns out 

Really enjoyed the BBC's Early Days of Doctor Who television movie; this is, of course, a horse of a much different color"
Survivor,It's been shelved for the time being. Even the BBC can't be that naive?
Survivor,"If anyone needs eye bleach after this, check out the dueling Michael Cain impressions between Coogan and Rob Brydon in ‚ÄúThe Trip.‚Äù"
Survivor,"This wouldn't have been the first time a comedian has dressed up like Saville and put on the voice. Way back before the news broke to the public, Saville was often the subject for mimicry, mostly in earnest too."
Survivor,The BBC enabled and abetted him.  They helped him molest children.
Survivor,"I mean, how many people who did that are still at the BBC now? It's not a living being, it's an organization."
Survivor,"And the crown.  He was one of Chuckle's best friends.

And it's oh so convenient that they've moved the show to after the coronation."
Survivor,"It‚Äôs like being the person who threw gasoline on a burning house, then coming back when the house had burnt down and talking about how terrible the whole thing was."
Survivor,"This is the truth *right there* not only that, any Brits that grew up in the 70's are righfully shook up about it as he was everywhere in their childhoods and just hearing his voice and seeing pictures of him from that time is unnerving.

And to top it off, they take our money in the form of mandated subscription through the TV license, then spend it on a fucking TV show so we can get horrified about it all over again, while making sure they dont look too badly out of it?"
Survivor,That's what I can't believe! How on Earth will they address this?
Survivor,"The UK‚Äôs power structures have been uniquely influenced and shaped by child abuse, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that the systems built end up protecting the abusers."
Survivor,"This is what this ‚Äòdrama‚Äô is designed to do. Minimize the BBC‚Äôs culpability and part in anything. Minimize the Royal Family‚Äôs culpability and part in anything. Play up the notion that ‚Äòno one could‚Äôve known‚Äô and ‚Äòmistakes were made‚Äô, while ultimately laying all blame squarely on Savile.

Meanwhile the BBC will laud this thing praising the acting and ‚ÄòCoogan‚Äôs spine chilling performance‚Äô, throw a BAFTA at this whitewashing of reality when it comes time and they‚Äôll have their fake version of events firmly implanted in the UK‚Äôs mind."
Survivor,"Blows my mind. Shows you how pathetic the BBC is. Guy was literally groping girls on TOTP LIVE on air. They all knew and did nothing.

At least come forward with a proper public apology before making a show. Or even invest a substantial amount of money into charities against child abuse. If it wasn't already free, I'd recommend everyone to pirate this."
Survivor,How many people currently at the BBC would have been around for any of that? Let alone in power?
Survivor,This is like if O.J. Simpson did a television special where he goes looking for the real killers
Survivor,Their cover up was disgusting but maybe its a move of atonement?
Survivor,"Yeah, that was my first thought as well.

First they profit from him and cover up his abuses, then they profit from a show about his crimes and how they were covered up.

I wonder if the show will explicitly show BBC's involvement.

Edit:My brain is fried today and my writing was ugly as fuck."
Survivor,Also Maggie Thatcher.
Survivor,The man was seen as trusted enough by the British public that British Rail used him for TV adverts.
Survivor,"I think the problem for Charlies is that he is connected not just to this guy, but to his brother Andrew and Epstein. Now, granted, if you actually look into it, he didn't visit Epstein really without Andrew and his visits pretty quickly fell off as time went on, but these are still connections he is never going to quite be able to shake."
Survivor,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/friendship-with-prince-charles-made-paedophile-bishop-peter-ball-impregnable
Survivor,That's what I was thinking after viewing the doc. There's NO WAY this guy's secret life could have been contained without outside help covering it up. And like you say esp with ther Royal Family it would seem.
Survivor,"MI5 allowed a confessed Soviet double agent to take an immunity deal, end up in charge of the royal art collection and get a knighthood."
Survivor,"Everyone of any significance in the British Establishment who came into frequent contact with Savile would have been briefed on the allegations, and the likelihood that MI5 believed them to be true."
Survivor,"dude, read the room üòÇ"
Survivor,It says in the article that you're commenting on that it's not been shelved and looking like a summer premiere.
Survivor,Has anyone actually watched more of the show than that clip? lol
Survivor,"""Yeah, it probably goes 'Hi My Name Is Michael Cain'"""
Survivor,You say that as if the BBC isn't one of the most incestuous media organizations filled with nepotistic legacy hires on earth.
Survivor,[removed]
Survivor,"Soooo, like every US movie about Vietnam?"
Survivor,It's not though is it. Most the people working at the BBC wouldn't have been there in the 70s to early/mid 90s where he was regularly working
Survivor,"Nothing will happen if you simply stop paying for the TV licence, as so many other people have done"
Survivor,How dare drama tackle heavy subjects. It should keep to its lane and do marvel lunchbox commercials.
Survivor,"Hey! I remember him clearly as a child all through the 80‚Äôs, thank you very much."
Survivor,Just look at the culture of elite British boarding schools and universities. [Ritualized sexual abuse and humilliation](https://nypost.com/2015/09/21/david-cameron-put-private-part-in-dead-pigs-mouth-book/) is a stable of English aristocratic culture.
Survivor,"Not free. TV licence required to watch, unlike the coronation which I as a non-licence holder can watch without threat of prosecution. Savile made me abandon the BBC, and later all UK broadcast TV since the weaponisation if racism, immigration, and anti-semitism."
Survivor,"There was an apology. What else are you going to blame them for, your crap memory?"
Survivor,">*They all knew*

Yeah? Who, exactly? Name names"
Survivor,Reminds me of a guy who was on TV when I was a kid here in Canada. I think the show was called Just Like Mom or something similar and the host‚Äôs name was Fergie Olver. Many times he coerced or tricked 10-12 year old girls into kissing him live on air. Totally revolting and he‚Äôs never faced any backlash for it.
Survivor,Vanishingly small.
Survivor,"There's a Norm MacDonald joke in there somewhere, I can feel it."
Survivor,Atonement is a funny word for exploitation and greed.
Survivor,They don‚Äôt profit from the show at all.
Survivor,And the royal family.

* Ted Beston, Radio 1 producer ‚Äî he not only knew, but on at least one occasion ""was willing to act as a provider of a young woman for Savile""
* Canon Colin Semper, producer in the religious broadcasting department 
* Douglas Muggeridge, Former Controller of Radio 1 and Radio 2

There's also George Entwistle, Director-General of the BBC in 2012, who shut down the Newsnight investigation into Savile."

Survivor,"I think I saw a compilation video of this a while back. Terrible but Savile was a different kind of beast. He sexually molested children in their hospital beds (yes, really). The information is all out there, just Google it if you're brave enough. He got off on the savagery. Pure unadulterated evil."
Survivor,"The BBC is a public company, how can it be greed?"
Survivor,How so?

In addition to programmatic and fiscal oversight, about 50% of their job is fundraising. The good ones bring in BIG donors and funders, both through personal connections and their ability to schmooze. 

All that to say $200K is a modest salary for that position in a national agency. They‚Äôre bringing in millions - hundreds of millions a year, and it‚Äôs a tough job on top of that.

Survivor,BBC executives work at one of the biggest broadcasters in the world. Their pay is chicken feed compared to the private sector.
Survivor,"So? BBC will air it and most likely sell it to international markets after that, which is how they make a significant part of their income. 

Plus, having shows that capture people's interest obviously benefits a studio that needs public funding to exist. And they have commercials, of course.

This idea that publicly founded networks make no money is just weird, no idea why people keep repeating it here in the comments.

Networks need shows to keep people watching and justify their existence. This show will likely attract a big audience, hence it will bring profit to the show."

Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
18 Again,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
18 Again,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
18 Again,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
18 Again,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
18 Again,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
18 Again,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
18 Again,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
18 Again,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
18 Again,üôÇüíï
18 Again,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
18 Again,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
18 Again,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
18 Again,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
18 Again,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
18 Again,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
18 Again,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
18 Again,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
18 Again,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
18 Again,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
18 Again,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
18 Again,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
18 Again,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
18 Again,"Dear God, why would 18 million Americans subject themselves to this or the DNC?"
18 Again,"I‚Äôd love to watch for the laughs, but I don‚Äôt want to contribute to their ratings."
18 Again,"What did I miss, more ranting Trumpholes screaming lies?  I'd rather jack off."
18 Again,I presume CMT went dark for the night.
18 Again,"The DNC was actually well produced.  They had good videos produced by Davis Guggenheim, gathered testimonials from regular people, had some interesting roundtables, musical performances, and they kept most of the speeches short.  It was nuanced with a lot of different kinds of people from across the political spectrum.  They touched on a lot of issues and it wasn't all about Biden. 

The RNC... well, the very first speaker called Trump the bodyguard of western civilization and Trump's son's girlfriend, who inexplicably has a prominent fundraising role in the campaign, gave that ludicrous speech on the first night.  You know what I'm talking about. The rest has carried on in a similar fashion."
18 Again,Only the first few minutes are funny.  Then it keeps going and you realize they're not joking.
18 Again,I think one option (if you really want to watch) is to find a live feed on YouTube no one is watching. I see some from local TV stations or small newspapers with 3-4 viewers.
18 Again,I made a joke with my wife that FLOTUS would rip off Michelle‚Äôs speech from the DNC and would go off on how horrible Donald was.
18 Again,"Good call. I don‚Äôt care about all the content, so I find the jokes and sound bites from podcasts and shows I watch is probably enough (I fully admit they‚Äôre liberal echo chambers like Fox News)."
18 Again,"Yeah it's kind of annoying.

The latest It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia episode was just under 17 minutes long. That's the shortest I've seen."
18 Again,"Too many people moving to streaming, television needs to get ad revenue back up. Yachts don't buy themselves."
18 Again,They're giving you less Bang for your buck.
18 Again,"People will claim it's the network being greedy and wanting more ads but actually if you look at the run times since the start it's rarely exceeded the 20minute mark. This includes season 1 where it was 68th ranked show on network TV and should have really been cancelled as only 1 sitcoms on CBS that year did worse ratings (Welcome to the Captain) and also in season 2 where it was still outside the top40 shows. It seems it's a creative decision to keep the show tight rather than a network decision (as they weren't forcing better rated shows back then to go short where there was more money, they also aren't forcing NCIS to dip under the 40min mark)"
18 Again,People *en masse* switch to ad-free streaming... solution?  More ads.
18 Again,[deleted]
18 Again,should all be scheduled...and only one 6-7 minute commercial break in the middle of each 30 minute show.
18 Again,Wonder what year it will be before the first 'half hour show' episode hits 15 mins.
18 Again,"Maybe if it were longer, people would complain about it less."
18 Again,"To be fair, when the BBC air Family Guy and American Dad (mostly on BBC Three), the episodes are only 20 minutes long at absolute maximum, including intro and credits due to the BBC not having ads during shows.

Then again, TBBT is absolute shite anyway and is still 17 minutes too long for my liking."
18 Again,"Yeah I love IASIP but 16 minutes? It was just disappointing despite the episode being great in general.

I went over to the IASIP sub to see if anyone else picked up on it but apparently not."
18 Again,"You know... 17 minutes is a fine length for a show if you are not watching with commercials.  I watched that episode and didn't even notice, but I skipped through commercials on my DVR"
18 Again,"and Cable companies wonder why people are switching to Netflix and the like. 

Id rather watch an 18 minute show in 20 minutes than an 18 minute show in 30 minutes "
18 Again,IDK the less Sunny the better given how low the quality of writing has gotten. There is zero minutes of it on my TV and it is awesome.
18 Again,"People are flocking to streaming exactly for reasons like, but not limited to, this kind of issue. Increasing the amount of commercials is not going to garner more viewers.

Stopping a kitchen fire by burning down the house is not the best solution."
18 Again,"The show is on broadcast TV, unless you're counting the cost of the equipment (and you shouldn't) the show costs an optional 10 minutes of your time."
18 Again,Unless you are talking about in general then no they aren't. Big Bang has always been running at these kind of running lengths even when it was struggling in the ratings. It's clearly a creative choice to keep it tight
18 Again,"The show sucks. The actors are fine and definitely not ""shitty""."
18 Again,"They aren't though. It's a myth that keeps being brought up every few weeks by people who want to push this anti network and cable agenda. If you go and look at the running times you will see that it's a creative decision from the start to keep episodes as lean as suitable, it's not something that's started to happen once it became popular "
18 Again,Cable companies have nothing to do with the ad time sold on network television. People switching are why networks are forced to sell more ad time in order to stay profitable. 
18 Again,"I can't even remember the last time I watched a show and didn't fast forward through commercials.

Maybe live sports?  Even with that, I'll join it 1 hour in and fast forward."
18 Again,"I don't understand the down votes, I agree.   "
18 Again,The problem is even if it was financially viable to put an 18min show in a 20min slot it makes it hard to schedule. And really to be ideal it would need to be 25min slots which really throws the schedules off
18 Again,"I've been using VLC to speed up shows a bit. I watch most shows at 1.23 speed. There are too many good shows now, and not enough time!"
18 Again,...as opposed to the big bang theory?
18 Again,"People over on /r/iasip were complaining too. It's mind-boggling that people think that the writing isn't good on that show anymore... I mean, this season hasn't been as good as the last few, but bad? Totally disagree. Last week's episode was fantastic, and this week's was at least an interesting and novel idea."
18 Again,congratulations.
18 Again,"Since the majority of their operating costs are paid for by selling advertisement blocks I would assume you don't understand what I am saying.  Losing viewers cuts the value of commercial spots.  Operating costs stay the same.  So you have to get more income so you have to monetize more time blocks, as well as any other kind of monetization you can come up with.

Not saying that is what is actually happening but that is what I was saying.  And for the record, there are lots of times they let the house burn down to contain a kitchen fire.  Sometimes things are too far gone by the time you realize whats happening."
18 Again,"I don't even know anyone who still uses an over the air antenna. Everyone either has a dish or cable, or watches streaming video. In my case, several of the broadcast networks including CBS blacked out my satellite provider's access due a dispute with Sinclair Broadcast Group. They later reached a multi year deal, which will certainly involve rate increases for me. Therefore, I stand by my original statement about it being less Bang for my buck.

Now is also probably a good time to mention I actually don't watch Big Bang Theory. I'll just show myself out, thanks."
18 Again,"At first I didn't believe you, so I went and picked a couple of episodes at random. You were right about them keeping it tight. BBT s3e4 is 20 minutes long. BBT s8e22 is 19:19. Now the episodes are clocking in at just over 18 minutes.

They should call this show the Big Crunch Theory if they want the title to be more scientifically accurate. "
18 Again,[deleted]
18 Again,I can't do that with sports. I end up getting to live coverage really fast.
18 Again,"It is amazing how short sports actually are.  I missed a few football games and was able to watch them ""cut"".  Each game was about 40minutes total.  For something that takes between two to four hours to actually televise."
18 Again,And ComCrap has made it to where you can't FF on certain shows -____-
18 Again,"neither do i.

Id rather watch something that i can fast forward through what I dont want to see, than to have to watch the same commercials every 6 minutes"
18 Again,"Other countries have shows that start 10 past the hour or a quarter to etc. 00 and 30 are no less arbitrary than any other time. People would figure it out and with dvrs it wouldn't even be an issue. 

"
18 Again,That just sounds like a horrible way to watch something .
18 Again,"seriously the worst fucking show.. there arent even jokes... just that nerd saying some shit like ""Zelda!"" and a laugh track rolls.. "
18 Again,Actually ad revenue isn't the main revenue stream. For most networks the carriage/retransmission fees are double the ad revenue. Although those are even more directly impacted by the switch away from PayTV platforms
18 Again,"> I don't even know anyone who still uses an over the air antenna. Everyone either has a dish or cable, or watches streaming video.

That sounds like their problem.... "
18 Again,"They aren't even really clocking in at just over 18 minutes now either. I only have the ones on CBS All Access that I can check against for the current season but here are the run times of the 7 they have

* 9x05 18.42
* 9x06 19:12
* 9x11 21:31
* 9x12 18:34
* 9x13 18:55
* 9x14 18:55
* 9x15 19:49

Strangely enough despite the OP claiming it was just over 18mins as shown that episode was almost 20mins long. Every other one is either over 19mins (11 being over 21mins) or closer to 19 than 18 

With comedy as well it's always better it's edited to be tight rather than edited to simply meet a special length. If you ever buy blurays comedies usually come with an extended version and they rarely make a movie better. And those longer episode of The Office were never the high points of being funny, they almost always felt like they were having to put in padding rather than really having an episode that justified that length. Drama is easier to put in padding as a couple of minutes exposition at the start or end doesn't usually make much difference. 

The biggest issue is perhaps the format of US TV, on UK TV they would generally just put some extra ads before or after the show to fill the  extra space with just a single break in the middle but US TV doesn't really do the in between shows breaks, they have to put the ads all inside the show. Maybe if US TV changed and stopped worrying about people changing channel at the end of the show if you don't get into the next show quickly it wouldn't seem as big a problem as it would be ruining the flow of the show less
"
18 Again,"They aren't showing more ads though. Yes the episodes are under 20 minutes but it's been like that since day 1 and the first season was basically a flop. It was the 68th most watched show on TV and was the second least watched sitcom on CBS that year with only Welcome To The Captain getting less viewers. Considering shows that rated much better than it such as How I Met Your Mother and The New Adventures of Old Christine were considered on the bubble that year highlights how poor it was doing. Any other year it would have almost certainly been cancelled but like a few shows the Writers Strike got them a second season. It's second season improved its viewer numbers but only upto #40 which puts it on the bubble. So why exactly were episodes still usually under 20minutes in those two seasons when it wasn't bringing in the ratings to get the best money, they had other shows that an extra minute of ads would do much more use. Season 2 actually had the shortest episode it's had which was 17:47.

The standard running time all through its run has been in the 18-20 minute window, going over that has been fairly rare. 

For the record as well something no-one but me has bothered to do is actually check if the OP is right and actually he is wrong as the runtime was actually 19:47.

"
18 Again,I love the MLB condensed games. Watch every out and hit within 20 minutes
18 Again,Where do you watch them cut?
18 Again,"I saw that ""6 minutes"" and it reminded me of the other night on Jimmy Fallon there was just under a 6 minute block of commercials before Demarcus Ware came on.  Gave it 3 minutes while I did something else, then another minute, and finally watched the last 2 minutes just out of curiosity as to how long the break would actually be."
18 Again,I just tested it.  Can confirm.  Horrible.  110%... was alright.
18 Again,All it means is that people talk and move a little faster. Once I watched a few episodes like that I hardly noticed the difference except in certain shows that are either really action heavy or people talk really fast already. Scandal has a lot of super quick monologues that don't really work well sped up. The only thing that I don't like while doing it is music. Music sets a tone and even a small speed difference makes a giant difference in tone. I really noticed this while watching Jessica Jones. The opening theme is completely different sped up. In the end that is a small price to pay for being able to cut 10 minutes or so out of a drama without losing any content.
18 Again,You brain can adjust to it remarkably easily. I've started doing similar with podcasts and only remember they're sped up when I accidentally hear an episode at normal speed. 
18 Again,The sub for each team will usually have a link up to the condensed game by Wednesday.  I usually watch them on YouTube.
18 Again,I don't now if any other teams do that but the blue jays actually air condensed versions of there games on TV  
18 Again,"How weird. I would hate this. Doesn't it spoil the show? Ruin drama? Damage the carefully constructed atmosphere?

I mean I could imagine maybe speeding through a sitcom, but a drama? All for saving 10 minutes? I'd rather savour the show and what the creators of the show intended."
18 Again,I just know that it would personally drive me crazy. Im surprised it works well for you.
18 Again,Clearly it's a personal thing. I work with video and things being a little off always messes with me.
18 Again,"It was weird to start with, especially movement. any walk and talk looked like they were speed walking. After a few times, I stopped noticing that stuff. "
18 Again,"Understandable, that would send the old trained eye tickin'"
18 Again,"Completely anecdotal but there are some rumblings that the ""permanent host announcement"" is just going to be that they will continue to rotate between Ken and Mayim permanently moving forward so that the show can accommodate her schedule while she continues to film her sitcom. I'm not sure how well received that will be by the fans if that turns out to be true. 

Truly a shit show for the ages."
18 Again,I've missed him. If I can't have Alex I'd at least like to have Ken.
18 Again,Stop trying to make MB happen. We dont like her! At least KJ has Jeopardy street cred.  Give him the damn job already
18 Again,This isn't news to anyone who actually follows Jeopardy. Ken said weeks ago he did more episodes before the end of the season.
18 Again,"Great news! I do not watch Mayim episodes at all anymore, Ken is such a better host I'm glad to have him back."
18 Again,"Yes! I've been wondering (and Googling) about when he'd return. At this point I think we're all just tired of the needless drama and want some consistency and to just enjoy the game without all this crap going on. I don't know why they continue to stretch it out, any help they think it's doing is sorely misguided. Name Ken and be done with it."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Homeland. I still enjoyed parts of later seasons, but Brody's storyline should've started and ended the series in those 12 episodes. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"There was that TV show a while back (edit: *Awake*, 2012) where the protagonist's life split after a car accident and every time he went to sleep he'd alternate between a world where his wife had died and a world where his child had died. It had some interesting ideas at play but as usual with network TV was crammed into a procedural format. The conceit of the show even made the procedural part sort of interesting (having two realities to pull evidence from). It was cancelled due to low ratings after one season. Would've made for an exceptionally interesting limited series that could've better explored the concept in a really compelling way. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Any show with an underlying conspiracy. Orphan Black, Prison Break, and Homeland are the ones I can think of. They usually figure out what the conspiracy was/is in the first season and then get stuck adding another layer to it. And that layer usually has plot holes everywhere."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I'm surprised no-one has mentioned Heroes yet. The original plan for the show was an entirely new cast of characters each season, but when the show was successful in the first season, the cast was deemed 'too popular' to completely abandon. The show was stuck with dead weight like Parkman, Ali Larter's characters, and Mohinder for years."
Beyblade Burst Rise,[deleted]
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Finally I get a chance to say this: ***Revenge***.

I swear to god this show could have been one of the greatest shows of the modern era with better writing.

For those who don't know, *Revenge* was a series on ABC starring Emily VanCamp as the daughter of a framed business executive who was eventually murdered. The show (loosely) focuses on VanCamp's plot to manipulate and destroy the people that framed her father.

The first season got above-average reviews but the show quickly suffered from what I call ""22 Episode syndrome."" The acting was terrific, the plot enticing (if not mildly contrived but what isn't?) but it was not a story built for a 89 episode run.

Thus, season 2 quickly faltered as the writers scrambled to add new mysteries and characters to liven up the show in typical ABC fashion. If it had been knocked down to 13 episodes, the show would've cut out so much filler and would have a series worth going 4 seasons. 

The show had every tool in the world to succeed and I think better writers could have vaunted the story to Breaking Bad levels of good. That might seem like lofty praise but the initial execution of the show, while somewhat soapy, was addicting. As far as my favorite television shows go, Revenge ranks at the top of the ""Could have been great"" category."
Beyblade Burst Rise,Prison Break.
Beyblade Burst Rise,[deleted]
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I don't think it necessarily would have worked well but, Pushing Daisies. Would give anything for some closure on that one. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,Surface. 
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Flashforward suffered from being treated as the next Lost. The premise was amazing, the story could have been neatly wrapped up in one season, and instead we got episodes filled with flashbacks, unnecessary cliffhangers, and a very, very slow pace. I'm not a very big fan of the book, but the finality of it could work very well on TV."
Beyblade Burst Rise,Not a failed show but a limited series of Robert's rebellion would be sweeeeeet
Beyblade Burst Rise,[deleted]
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Let's say for the sake of this question that just because a show is popular and has ratings doesn't mean it ""works"".  I'll assume a show works based on quality. 

With that said I think ""The Walking Dead""  I would argue doesn't work. It could literally go on forever and continue to be boring as fuck minus one or two episodes per season. The best part of this show that benefits from the way it currently airs is Andrew Lincoln as Rick. You can truly see Rick's character development and how he has changed through the seasons. 

Also I would argue a better answer to your question is Fear The Walking Dead could have been an awesome limited series spin off if they really wanted to tell the story of the original outbreak in LA. However as a new full series? After one 6 episode first season they are already into the same time line as when TWD started. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"If I've got your question correctly, I think Wayward Pines would be a good answer. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I really enjoyed 'Journeyman', the concept was great but it dragged a bit. A more concentrated story would have been great."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I would have loved to see Jericho in anthology form. Like each season deals with a different town/city in the US. They could also contrast each town storyline with an ""involved"" person storyline similar to Hawkins. I'm just a big fan of ""realistic"" post-apocalyptic worlds though, so any sort of show that dealt with that in an anthology format would be awesome to me."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Another Stephen King book, I think Under the Dome would have been much better as a miniseries than what CBS has done with it."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"The following, they could have kept the same cast and as a limited series it would have been awesome "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I don't think it failed exactly, but there were some poor episodes of Battlestar Galactica that could have been avoided if they'd stuck to their original format of 13 episodes a season instead of pushing it to 20. I mean, BSG also suffered from the Lost effect of not actually knowing where they were going, but having one third less content to produce would have let them trim filler and ideas that turned out just to not work. 

> It's one of the reasons ""The Hobbit"" failed as a trilogy... excessive padding..

Fun fact: the difference is extremely stark when you look at it from a word count perspective. The Hobbit was about 95,000 words for 474 minutes of screen time (theatrical release). That's about 200 words per minute of screen time. LOTR on the other hand is about 474,000 words for 558 minutes of screen time, or 850 words per minute.

"
Beyblade Burst Rise,I have to agree with OP about The Man in the High Castle.  I was excited for the show but quickly dragged and I had to force myself to finish it.
Beyblade Burst Rise,Sliders! It won't happen tho
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Fear the Walking Dead.

Also add in a less ""we need to fill the diversity quota""-inspired unlikable mean-spirited cast."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Firefly. 

Would've been soooo much better

Edit: joking"
Beyblade Burst Rise,I miss FlashForward
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I loved Flash Forward, great show

"
Beyblade Burst Rise,"""My own worst enemy"". I still rewatch that a lot. Ended way too soon. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,Yeah! It was great. But they didn't get to end it. 
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Virtuality. It's rare to see a pilot that's that good, and to cancel it before they even aired...just painful."
Beyblade Burst Rise,I think that flashforward could have benefit from that format
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I think there's two questions at play. Shows that should have had their end from the beginning with X number of episodes firm. And shows in which it should have been less than a standard 22-24 episode season. Flash forward might be a great example of a show with just enough for one 'full' season. Prison Break and Revenge were two that should have had three seasons, even full ones, and done. Like a three act play. Awake was prefect until the last couple of minutes. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Man, I loved Flash Forward. I agree with your points though."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Walking Dead's kind of drawn out at this point, but imo it would've been great as an AHS-style anthology series. It'd be way more fascinating if we got to see how other parts of the world were affected by the apocalypse..."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"No one has mentioned Life? That Damian Lewis/Sarah Shahi cop show? People, you are missing out."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Deadwood. It went so far off the rails, got very repetitive. If it had been condensed into maybe 2 or 3 six season episodes along the lines of Peaky Blinders, it would have been amazing instead of just pretty good."
Beyblade Burst Rise,The US version of The Office. I think it would have been better if it stuck to the same length as the UK version as it would have told the main storylines such as the Jim/Pam romance without dragging it out. 
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Half of the show was a really interesting high-concept drama. The other half was a procedural with a gimmick.

If it had been done on HBO or FX or AMC and the episode number cut in half, I think people might still be talking about it today, if only in ""What's the best show that no one watched?"" threads."
Beyblade Burst Rise,Still worth checking out? 
Beyblade Burst Rise,This sounds like a much better idea for a movie then a TV show. 
Beyblade Burst Rise,"They also needed to make it easier to tell the two apart. I could pick out the orange and blue tint just fine, but my parents couldn't so they were completely lost. Maybe a facial scar in one or something."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Awake still has the best trailer I have seen for any TV show, I was hooked right from the trailer."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I love this show but we can add How To Get Away With Murder to this. How many times can you really get away with murder or break out of prison before the show goes downhill? Also, this is not a failed show yet (because Shonda), but it only just finished season 2. We can revisit this in a season or two."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Orphan Black isn't a failed show. 10 episodes per season, and going into season 4, there are still a ton of things we have yet to learn. If they can end it successfully with 5 seasons, it would be a great example of what to do, not what not to do. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,I think it was great up until the end of the second season and then they just tried to make it even bigger and crazier and it got derailed.
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Heroes in anthology form would have been AWESOME.

Instead, I gave up midway through S2. Sigh."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I was about to suggest Heroes! First season it was appointment tv for me, second season my infatuation cooled and soon I just lost my patience entirely. Maya with her ""getting upset is deadly to all within an inconsistent range of proximity to her"" was annoying as hell, and yes, the characters from S1 had dull and/or ridiculous storylines. 

I can't keep them straight or chronological, because I only watched when my still-watching-every-episode husband would guilt me into it now and then. The execs/producers/writers attempted to kind of cheat a little by dramatically altering the characters (Mohinder and Hiro, for example) instead of attempting actual character development and growth. Which season had Peter's Irish girlfriend? That ended in a kooky plot hole.

I did sort-of like the first-generation Heroes plot line with all the parents. 

Eh, it's 4:50 a.m. and I keep starting to doze off only to jolt back awake for a fewand am kinda struggling to make sense, and I'm rambling/ranting. But I made my point, which was basically ""I agree."" "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Wait, isn't there another round with new characters coming out soon?"
Beyblade Burst Rise,"eh the only reason it bothers me is because I have to wait a week before more plot develops.

The episodes might have gotten more ""filler"" but honestly it wouldnt bother me at all if I could binge/watch it whenever "
Beyblade Burst Rise,Sadly I have but one upvote to give. If they had stuck to the Count of Monte Cristo revenge arc it would have been awesome.
Beyblade Burst Rise,"> Breaking Bad level of good

I'm rewatching BrBa and I realized something - Breaking Bad has absolutely nothing special in the idea itself - everything is in the execution. If every show was made like BrBa was, it could be just as good. All stories have potential, Vince Gilligan just knew exactly what the fuck he was doing."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I absolutely agree with the idea of making it a limited run.  But the show also shot itself in the foot with likable characters.  After a while, Emily became completely unlikable as she screwed the people around her, and there was no character (a la Jesse Pinkman) to root for.  It was just mean rich people sniping at each other for an hour."
Beyblade Burst Rise,[deleted]
Beyblade Burst Rise,"My understanding was that a limited series (they probably called it a mini series back then) was the original pitch.  But Fox wanted something that would be open ended in case it was popular, which it was.  When you watch the show, there's a point like 12 or 13 episodes in where they *almost* escape but then have to back down and wait another dozen episodes.  That's where the limited series would have had them escape with probably an episode or two after to wrap it up."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"it had more than 1 seasons? man, this is new."
Beyblade Burst Rise,Vaguely recall - was Peter Krause the star?
Beyblade Burst Rise,"The mythology for the show was amazing, but I'm not surprised it wasn't picked up for a series - the mini-series pretty much covered what needed to be covered.  That being said, it seems they could have easily stretched it out into a few seasons worth of television with all the potential backstory."
Beyblade Burst Rise,I just finished rewatching this with my girlfriend over the weekend. One of my favourite TV shows ever.
Beyblade Burst Rise,Yes! So imaginative and quirky and visually appealing! That was a frustrating loss.
Beyblade Burst Rise,[deleted]
Beyblade Burst Rise,">Would give anything for some closure on that one. 

Exactly. With such a premise you have to have closure. 

If you have a family of undertakers, you have to end it with the death of undertakers. If you have two romantic leads that can't touch each other you have to end it with them touching each other and her dying."
Beyblade Burst Rise,But that show handled procedural episodic better than anything in the past decade.  It could go on indefinitely.
Beyblade Burst Rise,was that the sea monster one? miss that one
Beyblade Burst Rise,"And its twin, Threshold, about aliens with Brent Spinner. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"man i loved this show, i still wish i could see a 6 or 10 episode special to get some closure on this thing"
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I was just talking to my friend about this the other day. He's an ASOIAF reader and I just watch the show, but we were discussing how cool it would be if GRRM made a series about the Mad King's rule and the early days of all our favorite characters "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I feel like that story is much better left off stage. It's like Darth Vader's backstory in Star Wars. Half the allure is the mystery and mythic nature of it. I feel like if we found out exactly what happened it wouldn't be as interesting. 

Now Dunk and Egg or the Dance of the Dragons would make a good series. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,[deleted]
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Agreed, I was disappointed that the 4th season wasn't the last season. It would have been great for the series to have ended in 4 seasons since each season has 13 episodes and a deck of cards has 52 cards. I think the biggest form of padding was Season 3."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Yes. My friends all love House of Cards but I just can't stand 50 boring minutes each episode, so I stopped watching it. If it was 6 episodes to a season I would definitely watch it, but 13 episodes is way too much for a show with such a basic plot."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"FTWD is perfect, could have been so much better with a one-and-done season.  

Edit:  Hell, I wouldn't have minded if FTWD took a Fargo approach and if you wanted multiple seasons, just tell different stories, with different characters in different locals... We saw the outbreak in LA, how about London?  Australia?...ect those could have been followup seasons... granted that could have gotten repetitive after a few seasons...but get a good writing staff and I could see even that working. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Going by your criteria, I would like to add Prison Break. One season would have been enough"
Beyblade Burst Rise,I enjoyed FTWD's first season.  It probably would have been even better if they approached it as a 1 season show.  I watched the first episode of the second season and found it boring and predictable.  
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I don't really agree. If they still had Darabont and the same amount of funding per episode as the first season it'd still be fantastic. AMC fucked The Walking Dead, not the amount of episodes. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,It also suffered from the writer¬¥s strike.
Beyblade Burst Rise,"In this vein, I'd have loved to see Caprica trimmed to a limited series and have it be an anthology, with each new season giving more development but moving through the colonies. I think it could have been fantastic."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Oh god, don't get me started on Sliders. Such a good show but goddamn, it went downhill. I can't think of a better way to describe Sliders other than this quote from Sheldon Cooper, ""Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended."""
Beyblade Burst Rise,"lol yeah more and more shows characters are just a list of stereotypes.

Some asshole is just ticking off boxes of ethnicity, age groups and professions. 

"
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Actually, Firefly was originally planned to have a 6 season run according to Wheaton. Serenity basically took the ""last"" season and tried to condense it into a movie. The time-gap between the movie and the show would have allowed Wheaton to either pick up where the show left off if they got a series run (and have it take place between both), or pick up after the movie if that's what the studio wanted instead. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I agree. Seriously. Whedon is extremely overrated fanboy's darling, with idiosyncrasies that ruin it for everybody older than 25."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Firefly was amazing, but I still don't get why they didn't just continue the series like Arrested Development did recently or something "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"they shouldn't of killed wild bill so early. He was a great character. 

Same with Caesar in HBO's rome. "
Beyblade Burst Rise,"While I enjoyed the entire run of The Office (US), I always felt that the story was pretty much over when Jim and Pam got married.  Now that I think about it again, they could have just ended it at the season three finale (in which Jim bails on the job interview and heads back to Scranton to ask Pam out on a date).  That would have been a very satisfying conclusion."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I remember when we got the advance pilots from NBC for the season this show debuted (I work at an NBC affiliate). I really liked this show, but knew it would never make it on NBC at that time."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I loved that show, after the first series I read about what they would have done with it and I honestly think I was happier that it ended. The producers wanted to have him sitting in jail in the reality with his wife, and so start developing a relationship with Rex's tennis coach. It sounds gimmicky just thinking about it."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I think so.

Despite being cut short it still has a good ending."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"As long as you can tell the orange tinted world apart from the blue one easily, yeah. My parents couldn't so they were completely lost."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Watched it the minute I found it on Netflix, works great as is.  Jason Issacs handled such a complex story and character really well."
Beyblade Burst Rise,it's actually written by peter nowalk. although he did start by working for shonda
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I love HTGAWM, but season 2 was slightly disappointing compared to season 1 unfortunately. Hoping season 3 will pick right back up!"
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I disagree, after season 1, they started stretching the plot a lot. Almost all the characters that were supposed to be rooted in the normal world were shoehorned into the new layers of the conspiracy. And the new layers weren't as compelling as the original layer. That then lessened the impact of their characters' motivations in the first season.

Orphan Black did do a better job than Homeland or Prison Break. A much better job. But the show would have still been better served as a miniseries."
Beyblade Burst Rise,It was also a victim of the writer's strike. I'd be very interested a documentary of some sort just tracking all the shows and movies that died or turned awful because of that.
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I don't know if it would have gotten better in anthology format, because they tried that with Heroes Reborn and that sucked. They really did just have a one and done story and they should have stuck with that."
Beyblade Burst Rise,Couldn't agree more with the lack of development and growth. How many times did Hiro temporarily lose his powers during the series?!
Beyblade Burst Rise,"'Heroes: Reborn' just finished airing in January, there's no future plans for the series beyond that."
Beyblade Burst Rise,That's a fair point. I'd agree there was a lack of likable characters although I always found Nolan & Daniel on my good side. Jack was supposed to be the second protagonist of the series I suppose but I always found him the least likable of all 
Beyblade Burst Rise,"And now they're doing a remake or reboot or sequel - I haven't understood what, exactly, but I know a majority of the original main cast will be back. Maybe they'll fix some of the other problems fans have talked about. It's rather an interesting concept - giving it another go, a Take Two, from the top.

Edit: I watched seasons 1 and 2 as they aired, with a  weekly viewing party at my in-laws', and absolutely *loved it*. Once it got deep into the conspiracy stuff in season 3 it became a convoluted, almost farcical mess."
Beyblade Burst Rise,Yep and  Julianna Margulies from The Good Wife. 
Beyblade Burst Rise,"> cliffhanger

Literally, in the case of Hannibal..."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"I've said this to my friends for years. Bryan Fuller is a damn creative writer and it's a shame he can never end shows on his own terms. If I had all the money in the world, I'd fund whatever the fuck he wanted to do."
Beyblade Burst Rise,"Right, I agree, which is why I said I didn't feel like it would necessarily work. But I'll forever be haunted by the lack of any resolution. "

Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,I bet he aired that grievance!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"""YOU DON'T NEED GLASSES, YOU'RE JUST WEAK. YOU'RE WEAK!"""
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I got a lot of problems with you people, and now, you‚Äôre gonna hear about it!!!"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"What always amazes me is how late in the series this episode was. It was only a few months before the show ended! Crazy they were still making iconic episodes that late in the game, just shows how brilliant Seinfeld was."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"‚ÄúThey both shouted a lot, though Frank (Costanza) was a lot less toxic, I guess,‚Äù O‚ÄôKeefe said.‚Äù

Holy hell, how is a father more toxic than Frank Costanza??? When you read the article it makes sense, but watching Seinfeld George‚Äôs parents seemed like Looney Tunes."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I've only ever participated in one Festivus ever and it's the last one I'll ever be in. 

A a group of friends threw one together as a joke and I went along cause why not. 

Friendships were actually damaged that day and I and one other person just sat in a corner watching the carnage before leaving awkwardly."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,I really enjoyed reading about this man's childhood trauma. Glad he shared it with the world.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,I can‚Äôt believe that Festivus is this big cultural phenomenon when in reality there‚Äôs only like 3 minutes of festivus related plot in the Seinfeld episode
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Whoa, that kinda blows my mind! Just seems so fantastical, I thought it never could be real."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,[deleted]
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,">O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs father also coined the term, ‚ÄúA Festivus for the rest of us,‚Äù which ended up in the show. But it had nothing to do with class consciousness or the fight against Christmas commercialism ‚Äî it was about the sudden death of O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs grandmother in 1976.

I never imagined that this term have a sad meaning."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"‚ÄúYou, Kruger.  My son says your company *stinks*!‚Äù"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"When my in laws were planning on moving to a gated FloRida community I joked that they were going to be living the Del Boca Vista retirement life.  

When my father in law put that together with living a petty life they opted for a non community average home."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,I'm pretty sure all the stories in Seinfeld happened irl
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,this episode is one of the funniest. anything related to george and his parents is always a golden episode
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Festivus is your heritage George. It's part of who you are...
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,One if my favorite things in life are when people place Festivus Poles in holiday displays
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"‚ÄúCougar, my son tells me your company stinks!‚Äù

*‚Äù‚Ä¶Oh God.‚Äù*

‚ÄúQuiet, you‚Äôll get yours in a minute!‚Äù"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"So, similar to fetivus my grandfather (also a new york jew) had made up the ""scumbag of the year awards) aka the STY awards, where you would state your case why this person or that person who did you wrong diserived the ultimate award, on occasion, my father would write songs about them, being the musician that he was. I still remeber some lines to ""crazy Steve's lament"" and ""All Frank's Suck"". The award ceremony would take place on New Years eye (or some point between Christmas and NYE) when we would all get together...when I first saw the festival episode I was a child still and I was like oh. They do their version of the STY awards....."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"The local bar used to let us bring an aluminum pole in every 23rd haha

So obviously I watched the episode and something struck me, if frank says he hasn‚Äôt celebrated festivus in years, why did he send George the card?"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,this needs to get to the top of everything
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Hello, woman."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,I would like to have been in the writers room when he told that story.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Spike Feresten (writer on Seinfeld. Wrote the soup nazi episode) just had Dan O‚Äôkeefe on the latest episode of his podcast (Spike‚Äôs Car Radio). He revealed that his father had created other fake holidays, besides Festivus."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,But did he air his grievances?
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,This is amazing. 25 years later and the show still continues to surprise and amuse us. Legendary!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"After that Jets game last night, Festivus couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,That was a fun read. Thanks for sharing it!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I assure you, Festivus is a tradition that is *all too real*. I could prove it, if you like."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,We will be watching tonight in homage to Mr Daniel O‚ÄôKeefe.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"‚ÄúOh I got denim vest checking me out.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, please! Denim vest! He‚Äôs smoothing it!‚Äù"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Dammit! Even Festivus was spawned from a bed of lies!! 
Is there nothing honest and sacred in this world?!?"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I loved Seinfeld, I‚Äôve watched it start to finish about 10 times, but I really can‚Äôt stand George and Jerry‚Äôs parents"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"If he didn‚Äôt want it on the show and kept secret, he shouldn‚Äôt have told them all about it! But thank you for doing so!"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Get this racist out of here
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Yea right
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Probably my favorite episode.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"This is funnier to me because a U.S. Army Colonel who was also an optometrist examining my eyes told me the same thing. She scolded me for being lazy and not trying hard enough. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even squinting, you already gave up.‚Äù"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,It‚Äôs till a holiday.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,A festivus for the rest of us!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I remember reading an article about a defense attorney who was registering his client for incarceration‚Ä¶ Forgive me of the details because I‚Äôm not an attorney and I don‚Äôt recall the specifics or how the court system works or whatever but‚Ä¶ where the form asked for the defendants religion, the attorney, obviously a smart ass, wrote down ‚ÄúFestivus‚Äù. And the clerk registered it. And on that day, Festivus became an actual legally recognized religion.

Note: i‚Äôm lazy so if there are any other Redditor‚Äôs that want to do the research or have specific knowledge of this, please chime in and comment!"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,He sounded pretty gruff about it in the interview on Spike‚Äôs Car Radio podcast.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Nah he just wrote a book about festivus and how to celebrate it.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,I got a lot of problems with you people and now you're gonna hear about it!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,And feats of strengths!

Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,This is how to start a Sprint Retrospective at work.

Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Have you seen the pole, Krueger?"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Best line on the show even better with the full context of him leading up to that line.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Early Seinfeld episodes are a bit more grounded than later ones; the early episodes mainly rely on poking fun at real social situations while they go a bit zany in Season 8-9 after Larry David left the show. But both are great and hilarious
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,My all time favorite Seinfeld line came from this episode. ‚ÄúHey how did my horse do?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe had to be shot‚Äù
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I think the show sort of made a deliberate effort later on to create these sort of iconic, ‚Äúviral‚Äù moments that it had become known for. The show always seemed to have a lot of catch phrases or outrageous moments that just stuck in popular culture, but I feel like in those last couple of seasons they just reeeally leaned into the quotable nature of the show.

The Elaine Dance, Yada Yada Yada, Man Hands, Festivus, etc. are all from those last couple of seasons and are some of the most repeated/iconic parts of the show. The last couple of seasons might feel slightly different, but like you said, it‚Äôs crazy how successful they were even at the end of the show‚Äôs run!"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I noticed this too when I was perusing the Netflix catalog.

Season 9 absolutely fucking *slapped*.  So many iconic episodes right at the end. They went out on a high note for sure."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,wasn't a big part of the show ending because Jerry and others wanted to end it while it was still great? i mean how often does that happen.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"After David left they went balls to the wall and after finding their feet it's pretty much hit after hit. I personally think Seinfeld is the greatest comedy through it's entire runtime, but those last two seasons hit such a perfectly absurd vibe that I don't think any show has replicated"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"The soup nazi, the bottle deposits, the rye, the chicken roster, the summer of George, the yada yada, the sponge, the bizarro jerry, the little kicks, the serenity now, the merv griffin show.

Some fans didn‚Äôt like the late seasons but  they were good in my opinion."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I can‚Äôt believe the writer didn‚Äôt want Festivus for the rest of us, though."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Also amazes me how the festivus scene is just a couple minutes long at the very end. And the episode isn‚Äôt called festivus it‚Äôs The Strike

Heyyyyyy no bagel no bagel no bagel no bagel"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Yeah people rag on season 9 but it has some of my favorites
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Really good point!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,The last season still had so many gems! Obviously the finale was lackluster but overall it definitely ended before it declined
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,It didn't really get popular until 3rd or 4th season. So prob most people who remember the peak didn't even watch a good chunk of the episodes that exist.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"It was more because they decided to cancel it *before* they ran out of good material. They quit while they were ahead, instead of when everybody got sick of it."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Jerry, Mr. Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I know his brother Dan (also a TV writer) and the stories of their Dad are wild. 

Lots of episodes from shows they have written on like The League, Drew Carey, and I believe even Silicon Valley contain references to their family"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,He was apparently a pretty bad alcoholic so while the story is funny in the context of the show I think that man's childhood was sort of a living hell. I can't remember his name but I've heard him do an interview and was obviously going to be asked about this.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"One of my favorite facts about seinfeld's development is that George's father was supposed to be a wimp like george also cowed by george's mother - his wife - and it really wasn't working so the actor improvised a bunch of lines firing back at her ""you're the one who breast-fed him till he was twelve!"" and similar, and it worked so well they changed the character."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,That must have been some doll.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Jerry Stillers delivery of that line is amazing
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Damn. Another redditor in a similar thread said that had to add reconciliation or something. So they got to air grievances BUT for every grievance they had to add a thing they did to help or be awesome during the year. That sounds more reasonable to me.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Can you elaborate? what exactly went down?
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,My friend group has had a pretty fun time with it thankfully. Almost like the purge keeps us from exploding on each other.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Sounds like the correct way to celebrate festivus to me
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Yeah the title of the episode is called the strike and the main a plot is about kramer
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"I think it‚Äôs because Jerry Stiller‚Äôs performance in that episode is so great in an over-the-top way that it really stuck out in people‚Äôs minds. Almost every line that he says in the episode is amazing.

‚ÄúI find tinsel distracting.‚Äù

‚ÄúI GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH YOU PEOPLE!! AND NOW YOURE GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT!‚Äù

‚ÄúA festivus‚Ä¶for the rest of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!‚Äù"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,It hit a cultural nerve.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"It's not that big, they just write articles about it every year."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"In real life as well it was a floating holiday and not tied to a specific date making it ""all the more ominous"" according to the writer."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,It‚Äôs a festivus miracle!
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"Yamahama, it's fright night!"
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,They‚Äôre all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of them.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Trauma inspires tons of art

Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,FYI. Frank Costanza was Italian.
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,What‚Ä¶.?
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"He didn't, his brother did. The producers pestered him about it and he didn't want it on the show, then they basically told him it's going to be in the show whether he wrote it or someone else did, so he gave in."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,"He didn't, his brother did.  Someone didn't read the article."
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Giving it a listen now. Apparently his dad had other made ip holidays too lol
Tattoo Fixers on Holiday,Really good episode this week.

‚Ä¢ Half Bad: The bastard son and the Devil himself"
Dresden,Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip
Dresden,"In recent years: Reprisal, and On Becoming A God In Central Florida.

Reprisal, already set in a strange, retro, alternate-history world retaining aspects from all different time periods - predominantly the early 1960s - seemed to be setting up an even wider, wilder universe than we'd yet seen (the constant background news reports, ignored by the characters, indicating something vaguely Lovecraftian going down in the North Pole; a character shown in decades-past flashbacks who has apparently not aged in the present day; a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to gems possibly being imported from ""other galaxies""). Concluding the first and only season with a shot of a television showing the North Pole on fire seemed almost sadistic.

On Becoming A God..., on the other hand, did at least manage to tell a more or less complete story in its first season, but I loved the characters and its surreal, cultlike world of multilevel marketing scams, and I wanted to know where the next season - which promised the appearance of the main character's long-absent, very disturbed mom - was going to take them. (To add insult to injury, the show had already been renewed for a second season when Covid hit and killed it off. The scripts were all written and everything!)"
Dresden,"""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"""
Dresden,"Bunheads. 

It really found it's groove about halfway through it's season but by then it was too late. 

Unfortunately the season ended with a major cliffhanger that can't be easily fantasized into a happy ending. It wasnt so much left field but definitely needed a second season to flesh out the consequences of.

For all of the valid criticism about the show, it was still enjoyable and distinctively Amy Sherman Palladino."

Dresden,"Karl Urban‚Äôs ‚ÄúAlmost Human‚Äù

Freakin loved that show"
Dresden,"Kings, 2009. 

I feel this show went really below the radar for a lot of people, and NBC fucked up the marketing for this show.

I mean, it has Ian McShane in brilliant scenery-chewing form, a young Sebastian Stan, and is set on a modern world and based on the King David story.

It had a big budget (and it shows) but NBC did nothing to promote it despite the fact that it was kind of set to be a perfect vehicle to market to religious audiences but also alt-history fans. 

It was a great show (albeit with some small faltering missteps) that ended way too early. 

The stylized dialogue and soap-opera elements (for better or for worse, there are elements of it) are something i think would work great in this day and age, looking at shows like Yellowstone."
Dresden,Terriers on fx
Dresden,"The dark crystal age of resistance, i know some believe the same exact thing as i do about my own cancelled show: But ending after season 1 was a real tragedy, the show was great"

Dresden,"The one with Malfoys dad as a cop who wakes up in a different reality every day. 1 where his wife died in a car accident and the other I think his son died?  And there were also crimes he was trying to solve.  It was well done and had some mystery to it. 

The Event. One of those million alien invasion shows. But I liked it."

Dresden,Son of zorn
Dresden,"In the mid-2000s, there was a show on ABC called Invasion.

Ethos,I read it as: Netflix is using an algorithm called ‚Äúethos‚Äù to examine differences between what poor people and rich people/secular and religious people watch. Which I‚Äôd be interested in.
Ethos,"I find it wierd that this series is being presented as if it took upon itself a duty to examine and display the divisions of Turkish society in its reviews. It's just that characters and sceneries are authentic and it includes varying people from different backgrounds to tell its story, it's not a documentary. It attracted this much discussion (here in Turkey) because people appriciated it among the formulized swaths of series in TV or digital platforms (plus Netflix really knows how to promote its stuff). But like everything it's not perfect. Pace is slow and some character's stories left unfinished (maybe they're left to a potential season 2ü§î). Give it a try if you're into different things but I don't expect many non-Turkish viewers to find it that much interesting."
Ethos,Great soundtrack too!

Still interesting, but but quite as inspired to watch as if it was a more relatable country to me."

Ethos,Watching might actually help it become more relatable?
Ethos,"Dude. Just checking your profile and correct me if I'm wrong but it looks like you're from the US. Not to be negative, but there are thousands of docu's if not more of this kind of stuff about the US. Even millions of articles. Making a new docu about this about the US would just be another drop in a swimming pool."
Ethos,Well I'm from Turkey and a lot of things from US is unrelatable to me as well but i have been watching US movies and series since forever. I can say that my experience wasn't bad.
Ethos,Sometimes it is easier to see in others what we need to see in ourselves.
Ethos,"Because fuck being open-minded, right?

It's a show with human beings, how is that not relatable? Or should the show be based on your life to be relevant to you?"

Ethos,It's a show from Turkey.
Ethos,Dying to know what you think your point was supposed to be.
Ethos,Imfourteenandthisisdeep
Ethos,Were you trying for a point of some sort?
Ethos,"It's a pretty good show, way better than average Turkish TV and an average Netflix series. Clearly it's not a prestige show like an HBO series, it's no match for the giants such as The Sopranos or The Wire for example so it's better to set expectations realistically.

Yet I'd put it among the worthy Netflix shows like The Queen's Gambit. Since you're Turkish I can't imagine you disliking it, it's really good. The writing is very solid (the creator is a playwriter and it shows), the direction is competent, musics are fun and the acting is superb. It's not at all nauseating like Turkish dramas with melodramatic writing aiming to induce tears with over the top dramatic score and acting mainly composed of slapstick humour moments or characters needlessly shouting at each other (although there is shouting in this series, it's actually well dramatised)."
Ethos,"Oh come on Turkish TV isn't all that badüòÖ And I'd still recommend this series to you if you speak Turkish or are somewhat familiar to Turkey. Production quality is comparable to it's Western counterparts, cinematography is great and the actress playing Meryem puts out an amazing job."
Ethos,"Watch the first episodes and see for yourself. I haven't watched any Turkish series since I was a child, and I loved Ethos/Bir Ba≈ükadƒ±r. I think it's like Nuri Bilge Ceylan-lite for TV viewers.( Faster, and stuff change rather than stay photographic like in his movies.)"
Ethos,"Very true.

I should have said documentaries aren‚Äôt really my jam.

Honestly, I probably wouldn‚Äôt watch it if it was about the US or Western Europe or Australia or New Zealand either."
Ethos,Not sure why they felt the need to lie when their most active sub is San Diego?
Ethos,"Good point, hadn‚Äôt considered how many others documentaries may already exist. I don‚Äôt particularly care for documentaries in general, so I don‚Äôt seek them out.

I‚Äôve seen papers on rich vs poor and separate ones on secular versus non secular, but not the combo all in one."
Ethos,I feel sorry for anyone who misses out on good entertainment just because they can‚Äôt handle an accent or subtitles. Good entertainment is pretty universal. There is some great Turkish content on Netflix. I really enjoyed the protector. And Miracle in cell 7 was a rare drama our whole family could enjoy together.
Ethos,"You may want to work on your delivery...  a less aggressive /insulting tone would probably get you more positive discussion (and up votes).

I would have gone with:

‚ÄúThe show is actually about human beings, not any one culture. You should try it out and perhaps find how relatable Turkey is to you!‚Äù"
Ethos,"Cringe, I would never even think about watching this cuz why fuckn waste my time?"
Ethos,"It doesn‚Äôt.

I am glad Netflix has lots of content from all over. I enjoy some of it and some of it I don‚Äôt or just don‚Äôt watch."
Ethos,Oh well that is at least more interesting to me. I can live with preachy fiction
Ethos,They're talking about prejudice against atheists... How did you miss the joke?

Ethos,Holy shit yr smrt
Ethos,No. I'm an atheist. The joke is that atheism has entered the chat because there is talk of prejudice against secularism. Not sure why all these downvoted are so butthurt by a joke ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ethos,"It was the middle of the night where I'm at and I was just scrolling Reddit and left a harmless comment.
Nothing to do with being ""edgy"" LMFAO"
Ethos,Those all sound like extremely intellectual options. Nice.
Ethos,"In this particular case no, I'm pretty sure I'm not. This is not something that needs any sort of discussion. Consuming content from different cultures is a good and interesting thing to do.

>Discussion with people who hold different ideas and beliefs is a great way to expand not only their bubble, but yours as well.

Sure but that depends on what the other person's beliefs are. Would you entertain a serious discussion with someone who believes Santa Claus exists?"

Nobody is ""butthurt."" Your joke wasn't funny/ didn't land. I'm also a secular person. 

Downvotes don't equal personal attacks friend. No need for the victim card or the ""nobody else has a sense of humor but me"" card. Both are bad looks in life."
Ethos,"TBH, it reads like a butthurt religious person attempting edginess more than anything else. That's why I assume you gathered so many downvotes. No harm done either way, they are only downvotes."
Ethos,"So based on my disinterest in a documentary, you assume I never consume media or experiences from different cultures?

And you are equating that with belief in Santa? Though on that note, if someone truly believes in Santa and it brings that person joy (especially while not hurting others), then I am all for it. I don‚Äôt have to share a belief to have a discussion."
Ethos,"Ahh, so just because the votes are in the negative means that the joke wasn't funny?
Guess you can't see the basic fallacy in your reasoning.
Just because the votes are in the negative does not mean that nobody found my joke to be funny. It just means that more people cared to downvote it than upvote.
I've watched the vote count fluctuate.

It is funny. Just not your cup of tea, friend-o."
Ethos,Strange. I'm an atheist.
Ethos,">you assume I never consume media or experiences from different cultures?

Never said that.

>And you are equating that with belief in Santa?

Or this.

>if someone truly believes in Santa and it brings that person joy (especially while not hurting others), then I am all for it.

So if someone's crazy but happy you should let them be crazy? I'm afraid I don't agree at all.

>I don‚Äôt have to share a belief to have a discussion.

Only discussing with people that share your belief is basically the definition of an echo chamber. It doesn't make much sense.

This is precisely why I thought encouraging a discussion with you would be pointless. Thank you for proving me right!"
Ethos,"I understand. I am also an atheist. I'm telling you how it may appear to the people who downvoted you. I don't think they were all 'butthurt' christians. 

It looks very much like the sort of comment that you do see from religious folks. Only they mean it in a sarcastic way- apparently you didn't. 

Again, its nothing to get bent out of shape about."
Ethos,I'm chilling üëçüòéüëç
Ethos,The acting is solid as well. The series just makes you realize that everyone in this world is dealing with so many problems behind the scenes.
Ethos,"I saw the ratings in imdb are very high and decided to watch. 2 episodes in and found it surprisingly good! Superb acting, great cinematography, great soundtrack! It is very slow-pacing show though, a drastic difference from most recent Netflix original shows. Definitely recommended."
Ethos,"I love the soundtrack, it was like a modern take on old 70's TV themes and I did like this show quite a bit.  Probably the only Turkish show I have ever watched all the way through, its very well made and interesting in the way it portrays the divisions between rural villagers and urban professionals.  It maybe tied up all of its plot threads a little too neatly at the end and there was a lot of crying in that last episode, but overall a pretty impressive show.   Would recommend."
Ethos,"This show has been a late-ish discovery for me. I‚Äôm absolutely astonished by how genuine the plot, screenplay and acting are. In my life I come across many western journalists, academic and even diplomats who studied Turkey and Turkish language therefore some of them call themselves ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù but I bet most of them never had an opportunity to view the nation from a realistic perspective like this one. Highly recommended."
Ethos,I love Istanbul and will watch anything surrounding it TBH (that includes Dan Brown's awful Inferno). Thanks for the recco!
Ethos,"Yes , yes and yes I'm spreading the word out there. This show is amazing."
Ethos,Little Voice is warm and sweet and I've enjoyed watching it.
Ethos,I need to watch it everything she does is fire.
Ethos,Really rough first episode but got better each episode and as expected the music was great. I liked the cameo artists in the bar as well if you're a fan of that style.
Ethos,This show is right up my alley but I did not like it at all
Ethos,[Literally](https://youtu.be/TuouqKN7kLo)
Ethos,"I dont really agree with most of these choices, but that‚Äôs what opinions are for.

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It‚Äôs been overlooked and it‚Äôs an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
Ethos,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."

Ethos,People mad OP didn't put more mainstream and US shows. It's so stupid. Anyway I watched very few shows on your list ZeroZeroZero was so good I was surprised it didn't get discussed more. I didn't watch the second season of L'amica geniale but the first one was amazing
Ethos,I feel like Dispatches From Elsewhere would be a good addition to this list. It didn't get a lot of pub but it was one of the most earnest and heartfelt shows I'd seen in a while.

Ethos,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
Ethos,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
Ethos,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
Ethos,is OP a feminist?
Ethos,"Great list, keep up the great work"
Ethos,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."

40 and Single,"Can it still be nominated for a 2023 Emmy?

like the second half of the season was in the right time frame for the 2023 Emmys but not sure if half a season counts."
40 and Single,"i felt a bit sad for Odenkirk. I mean all these years of hard and GREAT work, and zero award to show for. almost makes him look like a tragic hero.... like Saul Goodman"
40 and Single,"The Wire, The Leftovers, Bojack Horseman, It's Always Sunny

They don't know what's good and rely on what's popular enough that year."
40 and Single,They meant to give Bob an award this year but got him confused with Kevin Costner
40 and Single,"Like Charlie Day said on the Always Sunny Podcast, it's just fake awards for made-up achievements so the inner circle can pat each other on the back."
40 and Single,it has the critical acclaim but not the popularity to push it through I guess. I know tons of people who loved breaking bad and literally none of them will watch better call saul lol.
40 and Single,Odenkirk lost to Costner? That‚Äôs actually realy funny.
40 and Single,"Awards or not, I‚Äôm just thankful this story was told the way it was. What a special show and group of people!"
40 and Single,"Award ceremonies are a joke over noticed over the years.

Bob and Rhea were robbed, they did outstanding performances this last season"
40 and Single,They didn‚Äôt pay enough.
40 and Single,Who really cares about what the Emmys and Oscars say?
40 and Single,Severance got snubbed too.
40 and Single,"Meh, I used to love the Oscars until I realized how garbage it was. Yes, there are great movies that win. Just like there are great shows that win an Emmy or GG, but the process is garbage and I couldn't care less at this point.  BCS could have easily won in a number of categories, but didn't. It's one of the best written shows in history, not to mention direction and casting. GGs and the Emmies can go fuck themselves."
40 and Single,"There are lots of good shows right now. It'd be fun if there were a more elaborate answer or a conspiracy, but the fact is that Better Call Saul was one of many shows that have great performances, writing, and crew work."
40 and Single,"Because these award shows mean nothing. Like i am shocked that people complain about them. It is meaningless back patting and the common folk slurp it up.

Like honestly: the tale of the princess kaguya did not win a best animated feature. 
Godspeed you black emperor have never won a grammy. 

I mean it is still a popularity competition. Which does make it actually suprising that BCS did not win. Everyone always jerks of to it"
40 and Single,These comments are so dramatic lmao
40 and Single,Politics.
40 and Single,Was Rhea Seahorn nominated today? Who won the category?
40 and Single,It's constantly circle-jerked as being as good as or better than Breaking Bad and people seem to have convinced themselves that this is the common shared opinion upon the masses. It's really not and so far out of touch with reality.
40 and Single,It‚Äôs all fake ass bullshit. Who cares.
40 and Single,"Thats award shows for you. Reminds me of when Mickey Rourke put on a tour de force performance, once in a life time for Wrestler. Lost to‚Ä¶Sean Penn. 

Or Bruce Dern who inhabited his character and and gave him life in Nebraska‚Ä¶Lost to Jared Leto. Jared fucking Leto."
40 and Single,"Wait Austin butler beat Fraser? Jesus that is sad.

Also sorry, Severance is the greatest show people aren‚Äôt watching."
40 and Single,Rhea not even getting nominated is fucking wild
40 and Single,Tbf I stopped caring about award shows completely when Michael Mckean was robbed for his performance as Chuck in S3
40 and Single,"Award shows arent about ""acclaim"" or ""critical recognition"" or anything like that. Theyre a popularity contest. And as much as we Reddit nerds love Better Call Saul, it was like a fraction as popular as Breaking Bad was, whereas Yellowstone's a huge hit"
40 and Single,The show is not that popular and isnt really as appealing to awards folks and media. I never thought it had a good chance and I love BCS.
40 and Single,"Try not to get too mad, this was always going to happen.

The Wire not winning a single emmy is proof that these award shows don't mean shit."
40 and Single,"Because, and I say it as a fan of the BB universe and someone who watched the whole series; It's good, but not as great as Reddit likes to think it is. 

A big chunk of the show was in my opinion  incredibly boring legal drama, and frankly I find both Jimmy McGill and Kim Wexler are very dull and boring characters.

But it's still a good show, very stylish and engaging in many ways, but just not great, amazing or award worthy.

I have though never seen Yellowstone, so I have no idea how Costner compares to Bob in his performance."
40 and Single,"Golden Globes are bought, not won."
40 and Single,"It‚Äôs just not that popular a show, despite Reddit loving it. That shouldn‚Äôt  matter but it really does, especially for awards. Better Call Saul averages 2.2 millions viewers per episode, when Yellowstone (the show Kevin Costner who beat Odenkirk is in) easily gets 12 million. 

For comparison, Breaking Bad, a show that Reddit loved AND was popular with the general public, was getting 10 million in its final season.
That‚Äôs why it got awards."
40 and Single,"For people who haven't seen Better Call Saul, losing to Kevin Costner is hilarious because in the show there's a con they pull where Bob Odenkirk's character pretends he's Kevin Costner to pick up women."
40 and Single,"IDK what the Emmy voting process is like, but if its like the Oscars it requires ""campaigning"".  Bribery, pretty much. Maybe they didn't have enough private dinners and screenings with the people voting."
40 and Single,They already gave enough awards to Breaking Bad.
40 and Single,Because with Hollywood awards it‚Äôs never really about who or what was the best.
40 and Single,Because they are a joke. Next question!
40 and Single,Makes little sense. It was the best show on TV.
40 and Single,Maybe just maybe BCS isn‚Äôt as good as Yal rate it
40 and Single,"Because it is one of those insanely online shows that most people outside twitter and reddit don't care about. There is so much better stuff out there, why settle for a mediocre Breaking Bad spinoff?"
40 and Single,"You know, maybe the show isn't good enough to win something? Every fanbase loves their show and pretends it's the best one... but sometimes we all need a reality check."
40 and Single,"Fuck Kevin Costner, the 'Nickleback' of acting."
40 and Single,Shows made for teenagers rarely win awards.
40 and Single,"Mannnnn.... Unpopular opinion here..

I'm tired of all the unconditional praise Better Call Saul gets and I'm certain it's *SOLELY* based on the fact that it's related to the Breaking Bad universe.

All it has is hours and hours of story telling and dialog and anticipation. Plot is mid. Drama is mid. The anticipation is as dry as British television, climax is genuinely subpar, and there's no real angst or purpose to keep dragging me in or continuing to watch...
The BEST and only good thing that came out of that show was Chuck's downfall. Fuck Chuck."
40 and Single,Yellowstone fresh on ppl's minds
40 and Single,"Golden Globes only matter to the extent that they get stuff noticed.

That said BCS has never been an industry darling even if it was a critical one.

HOTD was probably my least favorite nominee but it certainly had its moments and it‚Äôs fans from both critics and industry which would translate to whatever the foreign press is."
40 and Single,"What a sick joke, the man almost died for us and didn't manage to win a single award smh."
40 and Single,"Because the Emmys and the Golden Globes are popularity contests, not quality contests. And BCS while arguably being the best show of the last decade does not have a very large audience."
40 and Single,"Ultimately well how can I put this without pissing off everyone here‚Ä¶umm‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt that great. I watched the whole show, enjoyed most of it but this is the best example I can come up with when pointing out the differences between an Emmy nominated quality show vs a Emmy award winning show. It really was just that, deserves to be nominated, doesn‚Äôt deserve to win. That may be hard to comprehend for huge fans of the show but from a less fanboy perspective it‚Äôs great it‚Äôs just not that great."
40 and Single,"Cuz it‚Äôs a fucking popularity contest.

People aren‚Äôt watching it. Voters don‚Äôt even watch everything for the categories they vote on"
40 and Single,"Your show can be in the top 1% of best shows ever made, and still it only takes one show/performance to keep you from winning any awards."
40 and Single,"The show Adam ruins everything covered award shows, it was very eye opening to me as I had always loved award shows, but it seems like the best performances rarely are recognized."
40 and Single,Does it matter? You enjoyed the show and the people involved made a successful show amongst the general public. What more could either party want.
40 and Single,"They didn't pay the required bribes to the HFPA. You think I'm joking, but I'm not."
40 and Single,Disgusting
40 and Single,"Nothing against Kevin Costner , but what a joke him winning for Yellowstone over the performance of a lifetime for all these seasons by Bob!!!  S'all Good!!  NOT."
40 and Single,Fuck awards. Remember Three6 Mafia won an Academy Award before Martin Scorsese ever took home the Best Director Oscar.
40 and Single,"I'll be the dissenting opinion.  Disclaimer: I DO like the show and think it's extremely well made. What I will say though, is that it follows the Breaking Bad ""formula"" too fully stand on its own. Bob Odenkirk was fantastic, but there was never as many big character defining moments as Bryan Cranston got with Walt, and because BCS is a slower burn, they stand out even less so.

Even the directing style  and story telling is very similar and follows the same beats. You're guaranteed to see a very stylish montage of something mundane almost every episode...usually something like Mike fixing something or Sail preparing a job that mirrors Jesse and Walts cook Montages. Also like Breaking Bad it bubbles up until the end and explodes, but the big moments aren't as impactful (outside of a couple notable exceptions). The show is great, but it's always going to be compared and not seen as memorable as Breaking Bad."
40 and Single,"Other shows have good performances as well, but it is a bit weird it's won nothing"
40 and Single,Taco Cabeza is just around the corner.
40 and Single,"Because award shows are meaningless, especially when it comes to something as subjective as ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù‚Ä¶"
40 and Single,"Sometimes the awards shows get it egregiously wrong.

The Wire, for example, only got two Emmy nominations (lost both) and zero GG nominations across its entire run. 

Saul looks pretty good by comparison!"
40 and Single,Because such awards often don't get handed out on merit.
40 and Single,"Like superhero movies and horrors, there is a certain type genre award shows go for. Better call Saul is in that bucket."
40 and Single,"Probably because BB won a bunch of Emmys and Globes. It‚Äôs not fair, but that probably influences some votes."
40 and Single,Because awards for art are arbitrary and meaningless.
40 and Single,Awards are jokes.
40 and Single,People are idiots
40 and Single,Because the award shows are popularity contests. HotD is alright and it won best drama. Mandalorian got nominated for best drama TWICE. It's a joke.
40 and Single,Because awards shows are often nonsensical and miss inexcusably on amazing shows that obviously should have won something. There are just too many examples of awards shows fucking up and Better Call Saul is one of many examples.
40 and Single,"Award Season is much more fun when you realize that they are all given away by groups of people who have collective biases and political/interpersonal opinions and relationships, meaning they will never be true awards of ""The Best"" not that ""The Best"" can possibly exist in the subjective world of the arts, so you just sit back, enjoy the pagantry and take the piss on how you have better taste."
40 and Single,"Lol, when GG awards were announced-all the comments about who cares.  And I said wait until they're given out, then all the people complaining this or that was not even nominated, or didn't win....now we have how many threads doing just that??? You are all closet award show enthusiasts."
40 and Single,"Because none of these awards are actually legitimate.  They‚Äôre about whichever studio will pay for an award.

Isn‚Äôt it true that voters for a number of these film awards don‚Äôt even have to have seen the content in question in full?"
40 and Single,"\> Bob in the final season of BCS was one of the best acting jobs I‚Äôve ever seen

But that's just it.  These shows are presented to the viewer as if the awards are for the whole season.  They aren't.

Voters watch one episode for each nominee in each category.  Episode is chosen by the producers or the actor/actress.  So if Kevin Costner's acting is stronger in the one episode the voters watched than Bob Odenkirk is in the one episode of his show the voters watched, Costner \*should\* win - even if Odenkirk was stronger overall across the entire season of his show than Costner in his.

Beyond that though, there's all sorts of posts below mine about these being popularity contests, pay to play etc. which I largely agree with."
40 and Single,"Golden Globes are all paid for PR/Marketing to kick off the awards season with the goal of ""buzz"". Everyone plays along."
40 and Single,‚ÄúWhat a sick joke!‚Äù
40 and Single,Kinda like the Top 20 songs on Billboard... like wtf? Bunch of no taste mofos out there.
40 and Single,Bob won this year. For Yellowstone.

40 and Single,"the chip in the voters' shoulders must be the size of a T-Rex claw. Maybe they hate Vince Gilligan, dunno"

40 and Single,The true conspiracy is how the fuck did reservations dogs not get nominated a single time despite being consider one of the best shows of the year
40 and Single,How is it with ozarks and better call Saul nominated did house of the dragon win? I like the show but it‚Äôs no ozarks or BCS not even close
40 and Single,It's the Golden Globe who cares
40 and Single,"because its an old show that nobody cares about?

only americans care about this celebrity bullshit anyway.lets save our time and effort on real problems"
40 and Single,I would chalk it up to the cast not going to the right parties or offending the wrong big shots.
40 and Single,"There are better shows

It should have won an emmy by now tho, unlucky. I assume they will win atleast 1 this upcoming time."
40 and Single,Cut to Jimmy and Kim planning how to get the Green Cards of every member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association revoked.
40 and Single,Kevin gets an award but not our precious Jimmy! What a sick joke
40 and Single,"I am not crazy! I know they swapped those envelopes. I knew it was Better Call Saul. One after House of the Dragon. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. They covered their tracks, they got that idiot at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to lie for them. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? They've done worse. That spinoff! Are you telling me that a spinoff from a show with failed ending could've won? No! They orchestrated it! HBO! They glorified foot fetishes! And I respected them! And I shouldn't have.  What was I thinking? They'll never change.  Ever since Game of Throne, always the same! Couldn't keep their hands out of the award room! But not our HBO! Couldn't be precious HBO! Stealing them blind! And they gets to be best drama winners? What a sick joke! I should've stopped them when I had the chance!"
40 and Single,What a sick joke!
40 and Single,Yes
40 and Single,"It's eligible, but winning is unlikely. First, it was released very early in Emmy season so people will have other shows more freshly in mind. Second - it hasn't won yet, meaning the voters don't believe it was worthy it. 

AMC screw themselves with that split season as it only lowered their odds for the prizes."
40 and Single,Still has a shot for 2023 Emmys for Part Two.
40 and Single,It's would be hard for them to win against HotD.
40 and Single,"It counts but I feel Pedro Pascal will be winning for actor, TLOU for drama but I think BCS could still win for actress. Weird how far out you can fairly accurately predict how HBO wins the biggest awards a lot of the time."
40 and Single,And to lose to Costner! The irony
40 and Single,"Saul Goodman was many things, but a ‚Äòtragic *hero*‚Äô certainly ain‚Äôt one of them lol"
40 and Single,Dude almost died filming the last season. He legit gave it his all. I haven‚Äôt watched Yellowstone much but Kevin Costners character just seems to be‚Ä¶Kevin Costner and nothing else
The Liberator,...why is it animated?

The Liberator,Well that looks cheap.
The Liberator,"It also hurts my eyes, it's so jittery it hurts"

The Liberator,Reminds me of the movie Waltz With Bashir. But that looked a lot better IMO. This is... interesting
The Liberator,because of the Dachau scenes
The Liberator,A live action WW2 action show would be way more expensive. Band of Brothers was not cheap.

But i'm kinda digging the comicbook shading lines."
The Liberator,It is called Triscope a new technology similar to rotoscoping. They had a reason related to not wanting to be less authentic with CGI of era tanks etc. So by filming the whole thing in Triscope you don‚Äôt see how someone things are live action and others are CGI.
The Liberator,If it was more like that I'd be fully on board.
The Liberator,"Just started watching it. The storyline has me interested so far, but I really wish they had put more effort into the cartoon-like filter, or just avoided it altogether."
The Liberator,Wow .I  really can't believe this is getting bad review from reddit.  Understandable its something new to get used to the cartoon filter. But that is the point . What makes it stand out is the cartoon filter.  Story line is on par with any war live action movie.   A platoon full of misfits !   Yes the cartoon filter could have been done slightly better. But over all its a fantastic show.   Over all it looks like a video game from a new generation consol. I believe its very  underrated  Netflix  show .
The Liberator,If you get into the story...  you dont even perceive the filter.
The Liberator,"I just sat and watched the entire thing, had to come find some discussion of it. I loved it, felt like a huge war epic. Took me half an episode to get used to the animation but once I was past it I didn't even notice."
The Liberator,Decided to give it a try and thought it was horrible. The animation filter is atrocious and the writing is just not good.
The Liberator,It isn't the filter I have issue with.
The Liberator,Filter gave me a headache halfway through the first episode. The visuals are so choppy. Its like I'm playing a game with low framerate.
The Liberator,the series made me feel compassion for the surrendered German soldiers
The Liberator,Cant say enough how much I loved this show! I hope they do this more with other stories from the way
The Liberator,"What's the deal with the FPS, it seems to be really low? I'm getting a bit sick watching it. Otherwise it's good."
The Liberator,My eyes are struggling to watch it. I wish they would've just made it live action without any filters.
The Liberator,"The filter is an unconvincing digital reproduction of rotoscoping, and the line shading on the characters often doesn't even look like it's attached to them. It's kind of floating over them. There's also an annoying visual overlay to make the image look like a worn photograph or a dirty lens or something. I found that really distracting."
The Liberator,"It's kind of a modern take on rotoscoping, similar to the old Lord Of The Rings animated movie from 1978 or A Scanner Darkly from 2006. Only, it's not hand drawn... it's like an Snapchat filter designed to make it look like a drawing. It's just not that convincing. I'm also not sure why this artistic decision was made for this series. I find it more distracting than anything."
The Liberator,I loved it. Only seen this type of cinema a few times and I really enjoy the different viewing experience.
The Liberator,"How far did you watch? I nearly gave up on it in the first episode, but decided to stick with it and I'm really glad I did.

I agree with the filter being a bit of an eye-sore, but after the first 1-2 episodes I was hooked."
The Liberator,All of that's why I don't think I can stick with it
The Liberator,"I'd be fine with the fake rotoscoping if it wasn't for the annoying overlay you're talking about. Still watching the show, but it's annoying. I hate how foggy it makes it feel."
The Liberator,I stuck with it since it's only 4 episodes. I've seen 3 so far and can't say I've found it's gotten any better.
The Liberator,"Fair enough, I'm personally enjoying it, although I'm a sucker for anything WW2."
The Liberator,"Think that goes for a lot of people defending it at this point, not the fact its actually good actors/story/etc but because they are just hooked on anything ww2."
The Liberator,I thought the story was good and stayed for that. So speak for yourself.
The Liberator,That animation is not pleasant.
The Liberator,rotoscoping is great when it takes place in a surreal(scanner darkly) or fantasy setting(LOTR 78). This is just weird. They be better off shooting in black and white with the tone they are presenting.
The Liberator,I see no reason this story needed to be animated.
The Liberator,"The animation seems a cheaper shittier style of the stuff used in Undone. Wheras Undone took 3 times longer than a filmed show would take, this seems they used animation so they didn't need to build sets or do any SFX.

[
Ars has an amazing writeup/video on it here.](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/war-stories-undones-big-risky-visuals-are-built-on-the-teensiest-details/)"
The Liberator,"This kind of animation makes fire, explosions, and smoke look weird and almost non existent, not a great thing for a war show"
The Liberator,It's like Medal of Honor: A Scanner Darkly.
The Liberator,Looks like they put the Cutout filter from photoshop on each frame.
The Liberator,That Amazon show did a great job rotoscoping. This looks bad.
The Liberator,Had to be animated to coverup the cheap as fuck blue screen sets.
The Liberator,"Does King of the Hill need to be animated? 

Although I can give you the reason -- they can shoot the whole thing on green screen for waaaayyyyyy cheaper if it's all stylized and not trying to look realistic. 

Which I wouldn't have a problem with per se, except this looks something like the live actiony bits from a 90s video game. Not Wing Commander, but something trying to swipe from the success of Wing Commander."
The Liberator,$$$
The Liberator,I see no reason they couldn‚Äôt try out telling a story in this relatively new style. Might as be this show.
The Liberator,It's just rotoscoping. Been around for ages.
The Liberator,"That was pretty good, how does the rest of the show compare?"
The Liberator,"Nope... that scene in fact demonstrates exactly the issue in the first few seconds... ""The problem with you liberals..."" At that point... Fuck you! There is nothing you can say after starting from that position that matters.

I have been in many debates with many people and try not to make things personal or generalize and in almost all cases it eventually boils down to ""You fucking liberals..."" 

I'll listen to a point of view based on facts and opinions interpreting those facts... I will not listen to unfounded or disproved lies and I will not listen to some asshole coming into a discussion not only with his opinion but also assuming my opinion is the one he has invented for me in his head.

At the point you turn the individual you are talking to into a group you have lost the argument and you are wrong."
The Liberator,I do agree that people do see others as the extreme instead of listening to what they are saying. But I completely disagree with the way this show represented conservatism.
The Liberator,Poor subby another conservative victim of the both sides are bad fallacy.
The Liberator,"It's pretty good all around, though admittedly I need to re-up Hulu and finish it.  I got through the first half and it's great."
The Liberator,"I think it was great. Kind of experimental in a lot of its content but mostly hits the mark. 

There is one episode where it's just Louis sitting across from the aunt from the Rosanne show while she tells a story for an hour. You wouldn't think that would work for an episode of TV, but it is probably one of the best episodes of TV that I've seen."
The Liberator,"Boy, the whole message of this video flew 2km over your head right? Its hard to believe you are being serious"
The Liberator,"I'm curious. Did you watch the entire scene or stop it when he started with ""You fucking liberals""?"
The Liberator,Your lack of self awareness is ironic lol
The Liberator,[removed]
The Liberator,What do you mean by this?
The Liberator,"No it really didn't. But clearly the message of my post went over yours.

The reason people ""don't even try"" to see each others viewpoint is one of them is usually being an insulting ass and making assumptions from the beginning.

Deciding you know what the other person is thinking before they've said it is the problem... as you have just demonstrated."
The Liberator,I've seen the whole show.
The Liberator,Not at all... you'd have to purposefully ignore parts of what you just read to believe that.
The Liberator,Proving my point.
The Liberator,"This lazy attempt at painting the left as just as bad as the group that denies history, science, and alternative beliefs among an endless supply of other examples. It isn't Democrats that are trying to ban Christians from marrying. Or saying the climate is changing due to God angry that the gays get married. Or taking health care from 30 million people.

Get a grip."
The Liberator,"He's got some axe to grind.  Like all extremists, they lack the imagination and intelligence to competently discuss their point so everyone else is just wrong, about everything."
The Liberator,"Ok, I wasn't sure based on what you'd written earlier."
The Liberator,Please continue to comment and display your lack of self awareness lol
The Liberator,Get off your high horse. You are just as bad as the conservatives. You're all worthless sheep manipulated by the mass media and ignored by the rich and powerful.
The Liberator,"Of course, I'm the REAL bigot for pointing out bigotry and ignorance. That is such an intelligent argument I am totally silent and have no response. You had to create an account just to say this? edgy as fuck."
The Liberator,Please continue to comment and display your inability to read. I notice you have included no actual statement about what I'm not aware of... Gotta' love when people prove my point for me.
The Liberator,[removed]
The Liberator,"I'm an extremist because I am tired of conservative extremists, again, the real bigot because I point out bigotry. You are a predictable and dying breed of this species. The worked up person is the guy that so quickly responds to me in anger, you're projecting."
The Liberator,How embarrassing for you.
The Liberator,"I am so glad my dad introduced me to this show a few years ago. It has become my all time favorite show and I doubt it'll ever be topped. 

It had so many fantastic hilarious and serious moments, like Archie's thoughts on guns and Edith's Rapist episode. "
The Liberator,">> Edith's Rapist episode.

That one upset me something fierce.... 

"
The Liberator,i just found it to be strange. There's parts where she's crying and describing what happened and then Archie makes a crack that gets the audience laughing. 
The Liberator,I just seen the episode a few months ago for the first time in years and it got me a bit teary eyed and such even though I knew how it turned out. 
The Liberator,">> There's parts where she's crying ....
Archie makes a crack that gets the audience laughing.

Yep, I think its fair to call Norman Lear a genius.  Now, I often disagree with him  still, I have to recognise his gift.

ETA: For that matter, Archie Bunker is such a good character, it took me decades to recognize what a great actor Carroll O'Connor was.  Rest in Peace.

"
The Liberator,"It is too on the nose. Black Mirror is pretty liberal/progressive but the writing is just better and doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer. This new Twilight Zone does have a good moment here and there but it needs to either be shorter (if you continue making simple, straight forward stories) or have some more depth to it."
The Liberator,"It's just bad. The episodes are not well written (at the mimimum don't fit hour episodes) and are contrived. As a big fan of the original show, this show is a HUGE disappointment."
The Liberator,"I think it just stinks. The writing is just poor and it being an hour long doesn't help that. And the original had/explored very liberal ideas for the time.

I've only seen about 4 episodes but they were pretty bad except maybe the one with Adam scott who sort of carries it."
The Liberator,"I don't give a shit about this kind of stuff... But the show just handles it awfully. Like it's so in your face, not trying to be subtle in the least.

And the shows just kinda crap."
The Liberator,"There's a difference between being political with the show and having political elements in the show. One just hammers the lesson onto your head with moral guilt while the other presents the issue and allows the audience to ask their own questions. Think of teachers. One reveals life's paths to you and you choose whether to follow it on your own volition, while the other just tells you how you should think. Who would you respect more? Sadly, lots of movies and TV shows like the new Twilight Zone are of the latter."
The Liberator,"I'm a leftist and it's too preachy, you can see the morals coming from a mile away. Bad storytelling since you already know what's going to happen. The camcorder rewind episode was good, if also heavy-handed."
The Liberator,"I'm pretty liberal and was very disappointed by the series, other than Nightmare at 30,000 Feet. I haven't seen all the episodes but the other ones I did see were not especially good. I don't think the hour long format suits Twilight Zone well"
The Liberator,"Politics aside, yes it is really bad lol. I dont get how they messed it up as bad as they did."
The Liberator,No...it‚Äôs just bad compared to Black Mirror and doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to the OG Twilight Zone.
The Liberator,"The series was just dreadful, without looking into the subtext or commentary it was going for."
The Liberator,"It's a bad show, and that has nothing to do with the way it is (not that subtly) geared toward a liberal point of view. Except for maybe a couple of episodes the writing is really bad across the board, and some very good actors and actresses are wasted on silly plotlines full of tropes and twists that you can anticipate from the get go.

&#x200B;

The Good Fight is another show on CBS All Access that is very clear about its political undertones, and that's a MUCH better show because it manages to make you care about the characters and their stories, while also being honest in showing the rotten in both sides of the aisle."
The Liberator,[deleted]
The Liberator,"It's very hit or miss, moreso than most anthology series. I think the bad episodes are *very* bad, while the good ones are just okay. There are certainly some politically liberal episodes in there and while I agree with their message, I do think they push it too much. It's not at all subtle and it often comes at the cost of immersion because it's so blatant. I only saw the first seven episodes, my sub to CBS Access ran out before the entire season played. 

I guess the best measure of my take on it's quality is this: I don't think the show is good enough to be worth subscribing to CBS Access (but if you're a trekkie, Star Trek: Discovery is totally worth it and Twilight Zone isn't terrible if you want to get the most out of your month.)"
The Liberator,"I couldn't care less about politics when I started watching it. It have some good ideas, badly executed (sometimes I could see what is the twist after like 20 minutes into episode, editing is sloppy af in some episodes, etc). 

I liked maybe 2 episodes out of 10 (it have 10 episodes, right?). So, I don't know what to tell you. If you have nothing else to watch go for it, but you will probably find something better."
The Liberator,It's a bad show. It's the worst TZ adaptation and probably the worst anthology on TV.
The Liberator,"This is the 1st I've heard of anyone not liking the show due to politics. I personally don't like it because its one of the worst conceived and written shows I've ever seen (glad I didn't pay for them). 

TZ shouldn't be an hour long for 1. It's not Black Mirror and shouldn't try to match it's runtime. 30 minutes is the sweet spot for TZ. 

I love Jordan Peele, but watching him do a Rod Serling impression is an absolute cringe for me. And it happens multiple times in every single episode.

And worse of all, the episodes just aren't that engaging. The one Peele himself wrote is ok, but the rest are dumpster fires."
The Liberator,"Yes, it's that bad. It's very heavy-handed, obnoxious. It's not about the messaging, but about the delivery."
The Liberator,[deleted]
The Liberator,"It's apparently just not a good show, and people have said the socio-political stuff is more hamfisted than the previous versions of the show, but it's always been pretty ""liberal"" - war is bad, education is good, whatever.

That's the problem with imdb ratings. People just brigade all the shows because their feefees got hurt, or because they're very bored trolls."
The Liberator,"It‚Äôs just as left leaning as the original. The biggest issue with the show is that the hour long format doesn‚Äôt suit most of the stories they are trying to tell. 


The first episode I liked, but dragged on for way to long. The second one had a perfect ending.... around 15 minutes before it actually ended. Like, it felt as though they made the episode, and some exec said it was too short so they went and shot an extra 15 min and slapped it on at the end. 


As for the rest of the episodes, the premise either fizzles out well before the episode ends or they just don‚Äôt take it anywhere. The exception is the final episode, which has some great meta-commentary about the show and is cleverly done. 

The only episode whose premise I can criticize is one where about illegal immigrants, the twist is that‚Äôs they‚Äôre illegal immigrants...... that traveled here from another dimension. I have no issue with them discussing the subject (I even agree with the general message), but it felt like such lazy writing that that it took me out of the experience. Normally this show is taking a supernatural or science fiction concept and use it to draw parallels to the real world. And for this episode they just took a real world issue and change virtually nothing about it."
The Liberator,"Of the 10 episodes in this first season run, only 3 stuck out to me as being particularly good. And of those three, one had a terrible ending and one was mostly nonsensical (basically it only told half the story it needed to tell for the episode to make sense). I didn't have any problems with the remaining one, but reviewers have said that that episode was a bit too ambiguous for their tastes. (Those episodes being Nightmare at 30,000 Feet, Blurryman, and Six Degrees of Freedom, respectively.) But despite their flaws, those three episodes were really fun/interesting more often than they were problematic, IMO."
The Liberator,Damn I just watched the Santa Claus ep of the OG and loved it. Too bad the new ones don't match up. Hopefully they stick with it and find some solid writers
Trial 4,This looks good but I missed the first 3 seasons...

I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Trial 4,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Trial 4,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Trial 4,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Trial 4,üôÇüíï
Trial 4,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Trial 4,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Trial 4,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Trial 4,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Trial 4,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Trial 4,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Trial 4,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Trial 4,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Trial 4,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Trial 4,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

Trial 4,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Trial 4,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Trial 4,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Trial 4,"Yay, there's someone on here besides me watching the gay Asian romances! But I don't see the connection between this show and Bridgerton at all! That's a costume drama. Kinnporsche has a guy getting beaten and held prisoner. All the shows have in common is the onscreen sex.

Here's the uncut trailer for it:

Trial 4,"Sounds fun, I‚Äôll be sure to check it out. 


I also love how comprehensive this write up was! The headings to break up the text really made me want to read the whole thing. I had not initially anticipated I would continue reading after the first paragraph"
Trial 4,I like the title since Porsche is a german car brand and Kinn means Chin in german so it kinda sounds like its about a car that has the shape of a chin?
Trial 4,"Hey friend! Nice to see another one of us on here! Was so excited to see this in my inbox.

For me the connection between Bridgerton and KinnPorsche was really clear due to the unapologetic focus they both of these shows had on romance, (regardless of the level of violence in KinnPorsche). Bridgerton was the first time a western romance novel was adapted, and the fan-service and specific style of romantic is similar to BL. I got all the same romance ‚Äúfeels‚Äù from both shows. Both are based on romance novels.

I also felt it was the first time both the romance industry and the BL industry had such high production value shows faithfully invested in these stories.

And with fans of Bridgerton, many of them haven‚Äôt discovered the world of BL yet but are looking for something similarly OTT and romantic. KinnPorsche is the perfect gateway to BL.

I totally get why many people wouldn‚Äôt feel the connection though. It‚Äôs just that I personally felt a very strong one based on the feels I got from both, though both shows are technically very different üòä

Edit: I also feel like both shows were pivotal in contributing to an era where romance becomes more mainstream and is given more respect/resources in the showbiz industry."
Trial 4,"Thank you so much! It means a lot to me because I wasn‚Äôt expecting any responses about this show on r/television.

Trial 4,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Trial 4,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Trial 4,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Trial 4,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de L√©a (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de L√©a is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

rating: 6.7 out of 10"
Trial 4,Looks like someone still needs to watch *This Is Going to Hurt*!
Trial 4,Severance show
Trial 4,"You wildin' fam. I know that one paragraph didn't elaborate much (*plan on doing a rewatch and writing a full review sometime*), but All of Us Are Dead is fantastic! Definitely my fav of the year so far. 

Only flaws I can think of is those crappy looking moments where there's bad CGI. But visually I think those tracking shots made up for it. 

Why didn't u like it?"
Trial 4,lol why the hate for All -- Dead?
Trial 4,Thanks. I've been meaning to check out Physical (along with some other Apple TV+ originals I missed out on) but haven't gotten the chance to yet. But that show is from last year so it wouldn't be on this list anyways.
Trial 4,"I've never even heard of thaf show before now. But it ain't too late, I'll watch it and probably update the list."
Trial 4,"I don‚Äôt care for the CGI or technical issues, nor the not well acting or not very good directing. The story, the story was very bad from beginning to end. Zero originality, the only were the ones who stayed normal being zombies, they didn‚Äôt have sense. There are many better anime or manga about zombies and school, especially with better characters and relationships. The part outside also was kind of pointless and really not interesting for me. I was really bored by it. And yes kind of poor realization then. But honestly storyline and development really disappointed me. 
No offense, I mean, you said it was the best for you for this year and it‚Äôs fine of course. That was just my opinion."
Trial 4,"because its not good?

horrible writing, bad acting, trope infested, nothing original, not well shot... where the hell do you get a 9.3 for such a mediocre show?"
Trial 4,Yes but they released s2 this year =)
Trial 4,idk man to each his own. don't you think this was better than Highschool of the Dead though?
Trial 4,"I'm literally the opposite of you on this one. Maybe if you thought it was ""*ok, not great*"" i wouldn't be surprised, but ""not good""?? Did you watch the show in dub or somethn? lol. 

Sure it's not the most original thing (I even mentioned *Highschool of the Dead* in the review), and it's definitely a trope-fest, but it still had some very inventive ideas and scenes. And it might not be the most original, but it's unique in the sense that it's multifaceted. 

It's... a teen-drama more than anything, even those it has political side stories to give a fuller scope of the situation. It starts as a teen-drama, and when the Zombie apocalypse happens, it doesn't stop being a teen-drama. Their conflicts, their relationships, their love interests etc., all of this is just forced under new deadly circumstances, so you'd have to actually care about all the silly crushes and the bullying and all that before it does. That's what fuels the story. 

> not well shot

Nah this is just wrong. Did you see those tracking shots!!?? üò©

But anyway, Severance and All Of Us Are Dead is just a 0.5 difference in rating. I absolutely loved both shows. Severance definitely have the best episode out of each too (the finale). I just found a teeny bit more fault with Severance (*mainly regarding production design*), thus it being half a point less."
Trial 4,"No, HotD was a lot of fun, interesting, never boring or annoying, cool action scenes and cool characters as well, very enjoyable and not for the sizes of the girls."
Trial 4,"c'mon man. everything you just said about H.O.T.D. can be said about All -- Dead. üòÖ 

I like H.O.T.D. but I actually like this one a bit more because it has more emotional depth. H.O.T.D. didn't have scenes like the one where the group were leaving their final messages to their families on a camcorder, not knowing if they were still alive or if they themselves would make it. It didn't have scenes like On-jo and Cheong-san's last conversation, or On-jo watching her father get devoured, or the final scene with all of them on the roof. H.O.T.D. was a bit too focused on giving us action sequences, you couldn't connect to the characters the same way you could here the way I see it. 

And it's not just the sad parts either, I think the youthfulness that stays with the characters even while going through the worst event of their lives is what makes them whole."
Trial 4,Season 1 of twin peaks.
Trial 4,"Hannibal season 2. There were few episodes with too much of a ""case of the week"", but everything with Hannibal and Will just got elevated to another level from ending of s1."
Trial 4,Season 1 of Battlestar Galactica is borderline immaculate in my opinion. Such a great sci-fi show.
Trial 4,Season 2 of Justified just because of Beloved Emmy award winning character actress and fugitive from the law Margo Martindale.
Trial 4,Season 4 of The Wire
Trial 4,"Parks and recreation season 3. Everything leading to Harvest Festival, April and Andy get married, everything with Lil Sebastian (RIP), and Chris and Ben Wyatt are officially in the main cast."
Trial 4,Season 2 of The Leftovers.
Trial 4,"Game of thrones S04. Fargo S02. The Wire S04.
Community S02. All ones that immediately spring to mind."
Trial 4,"Mine is also S4 of GoT. After that, it goes to either S5 of Breaking Bad, S2 of Hannibal, S4 of HIMYM, or S3 of Attack on Titan."
Trial 4,[deleted]
Trial 4,"Black Sails Season 2. The way it fleshed out Flint and his backstory is brilliant all to an insanely amazing season finale.

Flint: They're all trying so hard to convince themselves that they have nothing to be afraid of. How is running gonna change that?

Vane: What do you suggest?

Flint: **That we remind them that they were right to be afraid.**"
Trial 4,Season 1 of 24.  It was a completely new concept and was white knuckle tension from the word go to the word stop.

Trial 4,S3 The Expanse.
Trial 4,"A:TLA Season 3, Freaks and Geeks, Stranger Things Season 1, Game of Thrones Season 3, Breaking Bad Season 4, Chernobyl, Arcane Parts 1-9, and Band of Brothers

These were all peak TV for me, awesome in different ways, but good enough where you can get completely sucked in and feel a little bit sad when they're over, because you know just watched something amazing that you wish you could watch again for the first time."
Trial 4,"Season four of Always Sunny comes to mind. 

Man hunters, billboard model, Mac and Charlie die, nightman, sweet dee has a heart attack, and of course who pooped the bed."
Trial 4,Daredevil season 3
Trial 4,Season 2 Fargo
Trial 4,The Leftovers season 2.

Trial 4,Twin Peaks season 3
Trial 4,The Sopranos season 3
Trial 4,True Detective Season 1
Trial 4,"Season 5 of The Shield was must see tv for 100% of it. It doesn't get better than that.

 2 is probably season 1 of Fargo."
Trial 4,Roseanne Season 4.   The show was already funny and it just kicked up to another level for the next 2 seasons with the writing.  Homeland Season 1.
Trial 4,"This is kind of cheating because Freaks and Geeks only really had one ""season""... but yeah. Freaks and Geeks. All of it."
Trial 4,"Person of Interest season 3 is a nigh perfect season of television. Season 4 does have If-Then-Else and YHWH, but season 3 has an amazing run of episodes (people who have seen it known what I am talking about)"
Trial 4,[deleted]
Trial 4,Probably Fleabag Season 2. There's so little time in it and yet it hits every possible moment. It's funny as hell and has some of the most heartbreaking scenes I've seen in anything.

Aunty Donnas Big Ol House of Fun,I saw them at PAX. Real charming gents.
Aunty Donnas Big Ol House of Fun,It's incredible how few views and subs they have in general. Damn shame. I've been in love with them ever since I saw Bigoted Bill on reddit.

Aunty Donnas Big Ol House of Fun,I will!

Aunty Donnas Big Ol House of Fun,Astronomy club was a good one also. too bad it got cancelled
Aunty Donnas Big Ol House of Fun,"True, but Tim and Aunty Donna have some overlap in fanbase. They could be saying that with the unexpected success of I Think You Should Leave (love Tim but Detroiters wasn't as big as I hoped), it paved the way for Aunty Donna getting some netflix dollars.

God bless you Tim Robinson! Friggin' bonies!"

The whole family is artistically inclined!"
Trash Truck,Who cares? It‚Äôs a kids show. Who are you posting this for?
Trash Truck,He is also the voice of the Grandfather and Trash Truck!

Trash Truck,Doesn‚Äôt seem much interest from the post. My comment got more attention...Says a lot about people caring about itü§£
DASH & LILY,At least the season that's available has a pretty conclusive ending. I didn't even know if a second season was considered. Though I'd watch it if it happened since I find it fun and entertaining.
DASH & LILY,100% on RottenTomatoes. Viewership probably just very low.
DASH & LILY,"A shame. A very cute show, but I'm also really not sure where you would've taken it in a season two. It's a romcom, and the core romance resolves itself in the final episode.

I imagine you could've done another Christmas-set romance series in NYC with new characters - but at that point it's not really neccessary to call it a second season."
DASH & LILY,"I enjoyed it binged it all on Christmas Day it was sweet, short and fun."
DASH & LILY,Damn. I really enjoyed watching it. I watched it while in quarantine last year right before Xmas when I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere
DASH & LILY,"Well, that kinda sucks. I was surprised at much how I enjoyed it when I watched it last year around the holidays. I would even put it under one of the best Christmas Netflix viewings they have out. It‚Äôs not a movie, but it works as a stand alone mini-series. If anyone is in the mood for a romcom holiday festive flick (the eps are short and doesn‚Äôt really end on a cliffhanger so I think people would be satisfied) I would strongly recommend this!  It‚Äôs actually good compared to things like The Princess Switch and the awful Emily in Paris. It reminds me a lot of those 90s romcom with a sweet holiday twist."
DASH & LILY,"Loved the guy on it, hope to see him in more."
DASH & LILY,Was it any good?
DASH & LILY,"Never even heard of this.  Not that it matters, but I‚Äôm always surprised when something people like flies completely under my radar."
DASH & LILY,Did not expect it to have more than one season so I'm surprised to hear it was being cancelled. They should have given 13 Reasons Why this treatment.
DASH & LILY,Aww I really liked it
DASH & LILY,"ah damn...it was a really fun fluffy, x-mas show"
DASH & LILY,Really sad I loved the show
DASH & LILY,Damn. I really enjoyed watching it. I watched it while in quarantine last year right before Xmas when I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere
DASH & LILY,Damn. I really enjoyed watching it. I watched it while in quarantine last year right before Xmas when I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere
DASH & LILY,Damn. I really enjoyed watching it. I watched it while in quarantine last year right before Xmas when I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere
DASH & LILY,It was great but didn‚Äôt need a season 2. Think I‚Äôll give it a rewatch this Xmas though
DASH & LILY,",l,,,,,,"
DASH & LILY,unwatchable
DASH & LILY,"Yes, I felt it was over.  I think any more would have just spoiled it."
DASH & LILY,"I think this one was a victim of the pandemic like Glow and The Society. It did appear on Production Weekly for a season 2 at one point so I take it the pandemic delays killed its chances. It was probably the Netflix equivalent of a network bubble show and the pandemic tipped it to the wrong end of the renewal/cancellation scale.

We are still awaiting news on three more Netflix 2020 debut show in Tiny Pretty Things, Sneakerheads, and Aunty Donna's Big Ol' House of Fun. My guess is all of them are just waiting on official cancellation announcements."
DASH & LILY,Tv shows all get very high RTs. It was also not very popular so its likely it had few reviews.
DASH & LILY,The 100% rating is deserved. It was quite good for what it was.
DASH & LILY,100% means that it wasn‚Äôt reviewed much and they faked the ratings. If it‚Äôs 100% that‚Äôs saying the reviews are fake
DASH & LILY,They have two additional books they could have drawn from. The third of which was written on set as the season was being filmed.
DASH & LILY,He‚Äôs good In Euphoria also
DASH & LILY,Agree. He‚Äôs reminds me of a more likeable Cole Sprouse.
DASH & LILY,Great Value Timothee Chalamet /s
DASH & LILY,It‚Äôs nice to watch during Christmas time. Really no need of a second season as the story resolves itself in one season. Highly recommend watching it during Christmas.
DASH & LILY,"It was fine.  I don‚Äôt regret bingeing it but I don‚Äôt remember much of it either.  I probably would have watched a second season.

I would put it above To All The Guys and Kissing Booth, but under Never Have I Ever."
DASH & LILY,"Yes, it was. For romcom series Netflix has, it‚Äôs way better than that trite and awful Emily in Paris.  I‚Äôm shocked it is cancelled bc I remember it being in the top 10 viewership on Netflix for at least a couple months, and around the holidays last year."
DASH & LILY,It‚Äôs a nice watch during Christmas time. Really no need of a second season as the story resolves itself in one season. Highly recommend watching it during Christmas.
DASH & LILY,I feel like Aunty Donna could still come through with a season two. It must be incredibly cheap to shoot and is in the vein of other successful shows like I Think You Should Leave.
DASH & LILY,"i feel like if the pandemic is what cancels a show, then the property wasnt be cared for anyways. plenty of shows are still around.

i feel like if someone doesnt value their property, then its probably not worth it for the viewer, of course exceptions do apply, if the rotten tomato rate is accurate and of a large enough sample."
DASH & LILY,"Since Aunty Donna‚Äôs Big Ol‚Äô House of Fun was released the boys have mostly been back in Australia‚Äî- they did a few live comedy shows early in the year and were planning a tour before Melbourne went back into lockdown. 

I suspect they‚Äôll do a second season at one stage, but maybe not for a few years yet"
DASH & LILY,"This. Tv shows require a lot of commitment to watch so often the reviewers who watch it are the target audience to begin with. I almost never trust RT scores for shows , they‚Äôre almost always 80 and above"
DASH & LILY,I prefer netflix put the budget to make home for christmas sesson 3 and over christmast seson 2
DASH & LILY,It is even worse for subsequent seasons. Should we really trust a 100% RT on a not so popular show's Season 4 when it only has like 7 reviews? If those 7 reviewers stuck until Season 4 they are more likely to like it.
DASH & LILY,"My gf and I binged the whole show in a day. We both really enjoyed it, and I actually hope we get a second season. Apparently there are 3 books so"
DASH & LILY,We really enjoyed it. It is kinda like Hallmark but with better writing and acting. But that's what I needed to watch.
DASH & LILY,Treacle
DASH & LILY,"It's alright. The chemistry between all the characters dont make any sense though. Everyone was on their own wavelength...except lily and her brother, her grandpa and her aunt."
DASH & LILY,It was okay but seemed like a very long commercial for the Strand.
DASH & LILY,I had high expectations of this show....I realize now that was a mistake...just another rom com series with a Christmas theme that doesn't make sense
DASH & LILY,Been loving Nurse Mayflower. Hope to see lots more of he before the end of the season.
DASH & LILY,"Midori Francis was great in Good Boys, though it's pretty hard to buy her as someone who isn't 26 years old"
DASH & LILY,So far she's been the only redeeming feature of s4
DASH & LILY,That walk gives me chills
DASH & LILY,I tried to watch it last night. Could not realy get into it. Felt like a Hallmark movie for kids. Although the Strand bookstore looks cool.
DASH & LILY,"It's alright so far but I was taken aback when the 24 year old looking 24 year old male lead was referred to as ""a teenager"". I literally thought he was playing a twentysomething because he looks (and his character even acts like) a twentysomething."
DASH & LILY,"Word for word how I feel about it as well. Also, who the hell gets in a what somewhat more serious relationship thing after one hookup on Grindr?"
DASH & LILY,"I know! A hookup on Grindr turns into a serious romance after, what, two hours?"
DASH & LILY,I appreciate Nick Jonas trying to bring visibility to a series but that just ain‚Äôt it.
DASH & LILY,Can already tell this will either tank after season 1 or will get needless 2-3 more seasons because teenagers loved it. There‚Äôs never an in between with Netflix :(
DASH & LILY,"2014 was pretty stacked:

Fargo, True Detective, Bojack Horseman, Bosch, The Leftovers, Star Wars Rebels, Black Sails, Penny Dreadful, Silicon Valley, Halt and Catch Fire, You're The Worst etc"
DASH & LILY,"2015 imo.

Mr. Robot, Better Call Saul, The Expanse, Schitt's Creek, Superstore, Narcos, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, The Man in the High Castle, The Magicans, Taskmaster, 12 Monkeys, Patriot, Making a Murderer, Deutschland 83, Ballers, Sneaky Pete, iZombie, One Punch man"
DASH & LILY,I think 2020 has been one of the weakest new TV years in recent memory.
DASH & LILY,"Just for comedies, I don't see how anything can compete with 2009. 

Parks and recreation, Community, Modern Family, The Middle, Party down, The League, Archer."
DASH & LILY,"1993: Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, Star Trek DS9, WWF Monday Night Raw, Homocide: Life on the Street, Beavis and Butthead, Walker: Texas Ranger, Living Single, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, The Late Show with Letterman, 2 Stupid Dogs (immensely influential in terms of launching animation careers), The X-Files, Bill Nye, Late Night with Conan, Animaniacs, Ricky Lake, Frasier, Martha Stewart Living, Rocko's Modern Life, NYPD Blue, Boy Meets World, Grace Under Fire, The John Stewart Show, Diagnosis: Murder, The Nanny. 

Hindsight and everything, but that 1993 is incredible in terms of pop culture."
DASH & LILY,"2005 also had Supernatural, the Doctor Who revival, Bones, and American Dad, all of which ended up running for many, many seasons"
DASH & LILY,"1994 (Friends, Babylon 5, Chicago Hope, ER)

1990 (Twin Peaks, Northern Exposure, Law and Order, Wings)"
DASH & LILY,"2004 had Lost, Battlestar:Galactica (the actual series, not including miniseries), Rescue Me, House, Veronica Mars, Entourage, and Pimp My Ride.  So definitely 2004."
DASH & LILY,"> The Haunting of Bly Manor, Ted Lasso, The Queen's Gambit, Normal People, Run, Love Life, High Fidelity, Never Have I Ever, Lovecraft Country, Medical Police, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, Mrs. America, The Great, Dash & Lily, Aunty Donna's Big Ol' House of Fun. Even some more off-beat streaming shows like Disney's new Mickey Mouse and Peacock's Amber Ruffin show have been solid. Not to mention, some more acclaimed shows I didn't even get around to like I May Destroy You, The Last Dance, Betty, Cheer, Little America, and Industry.

really bruh?? these are what you're going with as ""impeccable""??"
DASH & LILY,I'm gonna say somewhere in the mid-late 00's
DASH & LILY,"1982- Cheers, Family Times, Fame, The Incredible Hulk, Knight Rider, Newhart, Remington Steele, St. Elsewhere, Square Pegs, and TJ Hooker."
DASH & LILY,Rick and Morty is 7 years old? https://media1.tenor.com/images/b5b744b000097d4a2f11ffea0597192d/tenor.gif?itemid=4203998
DASH & LILY,"I feel like 2020 has been kind of weak.  Most of its best series have actually been mini-series.  I think 2018 and 2019 were both stronger.

2019 had Watchmen, Unbelievable, Chernobyl, Undone, The Mandolorian, The Witcher, The Boys, Russian Doll, Kingdom (Korean version), Infinity Train, Dead to Me, and What We Do in the Shadows.  That's an impressive line-up of new shows!

&#x200B;

2018 had Succession, Barry, Killing Eve, Derry Girls, Counterpart, Pose, Sharp Objects, Maniac, Homecoming, Bodyguard, the Terror, and Cobra Kai.  Again, that's an impressive dozen premiers!."
DASH & LILY,"I think 1989 can be considered: Seinfeld, Quantum Leap, Saved by the Bell, Cops, America's Funniest Home Videos, The Simpsons, Family Matters (TGIF begins), Doogie Howser, Baywatch, Tales From the Crypt, Kids in the Hall, Arsenio Hall, MTV Unplugged, Dragon Ball Z"
DASH & LILY,Broad City started in 2014 and was a great show
DASH & LILY,Great pull! A lot of those are all-time faves of mine.
DASH & LILY,The Knick and Over the Garden Wall should be on this list.
DASH & LILY,"2014 was also an incredible movie year, probably the best one in the 2010's.

Whiplash, Mommy, the grand budapest hotel, Interstellar, What we do in the shadows, nightcrawler, Gone Girl, Ex Machina, The Raid 2, Birdman, Phoenix, guardians of the Galaxy, Boyhood, Captain America Winter Soldier, Paddington, Selma, John Wick,It Follows, Kingsman, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Chef, How to train your Dragon 2, The Babadook, Fury, X men Days of Future Past, Sea Fog, 22 Jump Street, Edge of Tomorrow, Starred up.Her, Obvious Child, Godzilla, Lego Movie, The Rover, Pride."
DASH & LILY,This was the year I immediately through of. Some absolute bangers from 2014!
DASH & LILY,That is a stacked list. Lots of quality there.
DASH & LILY,Mentioning Taskmaster makes this comment the only correct one.
DASH & LILY,agreed. I like Queen's Gambit....and that's basically it. Does Wayne count?
DASH & LILY,"Fair enough! One I forgot to mention was How To with John Wilson. That seems pretty universally enjoyed, in case you're hoping for a new show to lift your opinion!"
DASH & LILY,but The Great!!!
DASH & LILY,You forgot Better off Ted.
DASH & LILY,"Oof yeah, those might not be all my thing, but it‚Äôs certainly hard to beat"
DASH & LILY,"Came here to say this, very good."
DASH & LILY,Good point!
DASH & LILY,"Best premiere of 2004 was Deadwood.


edit:  Those that doubt me suck cock by choice."
DASH & LILY,[deleted]
DASH & LILY,"Lol good forbid OP just shares his enthusiasm for television... on a television subreddit...

Y‚Äôall are cynical AF"
DASH & LILY,I liked them all :)
DASH & LILY,"I agree that's pretty weak. Heard good things about Ted Lasso and Normal People, but Queens Gambit is the only show I liked on that list."
DASH & LILY,Guess it's just a matter of taste because a lot of those don't appeal to me!
DASH & LILY,Seinfeld and Simpsons alone probably warrants consideration for 1989
DASH & LILY,"Lovecraft country

edit: and Raised by Wolves"
DASH & LILY,"> Does Wayne count?

2019"
DASH & LILY,You also forgot Teenage Bounty Hunters. It‚Äôs on Netflix and has 92% on RT
DASH & LILY,"Yep, and it's so weird to me that Modern Family and Better of Ted came out the same year with one ending it's run 10 years ago and the other just this year."
DASH & LILY,Don't know how I missed that.
DASH & LILY,That was a huge hit too.  Not my thing but I knew a ton of people who watched.
DASH & LILY,Definitely a matter of taste!
DASH & LILY,Can't watch it. I have HBO but the sound is just too off. The talking scenes are so quiet and the action scenes are so loud it has me all over the place with the volume.
DASH & LILY,Awful show
DASH & LILY,Those were both big swings & misses for me.  I would throw The Outsider in this group as well.
DASH & LILY,Thank you for adding!
A Lion in the House,"Another way to write this headline 
‚ÄúHBO had the biggest hits on TV for 2nd consecutive year‚Äù"
A Lion in the House,"HBO needs to teach their movie counterparts (WB) the importance of screenwriters, because they‚Äôre the ones responsible for delivering quality! HOTD and TLOU are so damn good!"
A Lion in the House,Maybe this will make execs notice you should be hiring writers who love your ip and not writers who hate it/just use it as a vehicle for their own shit ideas.
A Lion in the House,"Sony to Neil be like ""please make part 3, we have consoles to sell & more money to make!"""
A Lion in the House,"I knew it!

&#x200B;

Second season, just like Dragon, is gonna be huge, man HBO just doesn't miss."
A Lion in the House,"Well deserved.

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."
A Lion in the House,"Discovery really underestimated HBO, I hope this means that they aren't going to try and control more in the merger and still take risks on shows."
A Lion in the House,"You know what's the best feeling in the world after every good news about this show? 

It's knowing that the salt mine that is The Last of Us 2 subreddit are seething with hate. Absolutely love it. 

Good news. Can't wait for season 2."
A Lion in the House,"HBO needs to pick up the Witcher man, which they won‚Äôt do because they have Westeros, but I still dream of what could have been"
A Lion in the House,"TLOU is a rare example of a big production team having respect and understanding for the source material. Most of the time, Hollywood follows the business model of  taking a generic script and sticking a known IP in it to gain publicity (see- Halo TV)."
A Lion in the House,"I played the game a couple times. Once on ps3 and then ps4. But I didn‚Äôt it so long ago I was able to watch the show and not know exactly what was going to happen scene to scene or what was change or the same. The game definitely has you feeling more attached to Ellie and Joel together as you play as Joel and it‚Äôs your job to keep Ellie safe. So some of the stuff in the show didn‚Äôt hit the same. Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons. But being removed from controlling him and watching it play out on a tv show, I feel I got the intended effect. And it definitely makes Last of Us part II more obvious how that plays out."
A Lion in the House,"Damn. This is impressive.

Imagine how Halo show could‚Äôve been if they actually respected the lore."
A Lion in the House,The writing has been superb.
A Lion in the House,"I liked TLOU wayyy more than HOTD and I‚Äôm saying this as someone who loves GOT and who didn‚Äôt play the TLOU game.

TLOU felt way more streamlined and easier to follow. Maybe it‚Äôs like not really comparable as they‚Äôre different thematically and stylistically, but I remember numerous times during HOTD being like ‚Äúwho‚Äôs that guy again?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhy are they doing this again?‚Äù

TLOU is solid storytelling and great acting. Coming into it with no background, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves far more."
A Lion in the House,Praise Druckmann. Well deserved achievement. It goes without saying that TLOU Season 1 has probably surpassed viewership records for Game of Thrones Season 1 when it first aired as well
A Lion in the House,This is the way.
A Lion in the House,It‚Äôs because House of the Dragon didn‚Äôt cast Pedro Pascal
A Lion in the House,It‚Äôs a copycat industry so be on the lookout next year for the newest video game adaptation series: Turok Dinosaur Hunter on Showtime
A Lion in the House,So for the fifth straight year some very vocal people who told me a show or a movie was going to bomb for being too woke were wrong? Say it ain't so....
A Lion in the House,"It‚Äôs a good show. The ending felt rushed and a bit of a flop for my wife who didn‚Äôt play the games. I think they could have done better with Joel thinking about everything, slap in a ton of flash backs and actually show the action more. 10 more minutes would have been great."
A Lion in the House,"They really have to stretch. HOTD still had more peak viewers, but to make TLOU look better they have to go to ""full season viewers"".

Isn't it enough that TLOU did good? HOTD had almost 2 million more viewers on air date."
A Lion in the House,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
A Lion in the House,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
A Lion in the House,"While the show has been strong I feel like they‚Äôre making changes to make part 2 make more sense. So much deconstructing of Joel as a strong survivalist. Too much Ellie making jabs at Joel and not enough of Ellie and Joel bonding. It took 6+ episodes before we got any survival bonding. This show feels rushed and it feels like Druckman is changing so much just to make part 1 make part 2 make sense. Part 2 made so little sense vs part 1. 

I haven‚Äôt hated this but as I went through this show it got worse and worse imo. I am not looking forward to the less well received part of the Last of Us getting more love. This first season has felt rushed in ways."
A Lion in the House,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
A Lion in the House,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
A Lion in the House,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
A Lion in the House,Bring back WestWorld!
A Lion in the House,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
A Lion in the House,God I Hope so
A Lion in the House,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
A Lion in the House,Pascal Power.
A Lion in the House,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
A Lion in the House,HoTD > TLoU
A Lion in the House,"Don‚Äôt care, HOT D still better üëç

TLOU was pretty good but it didn‚Äôt really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
A Lion in the House,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
A Lion in the House,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
A Lion in the House,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
A Lion in the House,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
A Lion in the House,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it‚Äôs not even close."
A Lion in the House,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
A Lion in the House,if only they did halo correctly.
A Lion in the House,"hey, i didn‚Äôt have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
A Lion in the House,[deleted]
A Lion in the House,Its a much better show so thats great
A Lion in the House,Good
A Lion in the House,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
A Lion in the House,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
A Lion in the House,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs good, do we really need to know who‚Äôs watching which more?"
A Lion in the House,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
A Lion in the House,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
A Lion in the House,Good. It was better.
A Lion in the House,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
A Lion in the House,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
A Lion in the House,Deserved. It's a better show.
A Lion in the House,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
A Lion in the House,I honestly didn‚Äôt like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that‚Äôs just my opinion
A Lion in the House,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
A Lion in the House,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
A Lion in the House,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
A Lion in the House,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
A Lion in the House,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
A Lion in the House,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
A Lion in the House,It's a vastly better show
A Lion in the House,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
A Lion in the House,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
A Lion in the House,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
A Lion in the House,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG‚Äôs been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand‚Äôs reputation. IMHO."
A Lion in the House,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That‚Äôs why."
A Lion in the House,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
A Lion in the House,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
A Lion in the House,I couldn‚Äôt get into either show. I think I‚Äôm over GOT and zombie type shit. I‚Äôd like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
A Lion in the House,Was it really THAT good???
A Lion in the House,It was better.
A Lion in the House,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
A Lion in the House,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
A Lion in the House,This always ends each episode with a ‚ÄúOH NO!‚Äô It‚Äôs always a long week until the next episode!
A Lion in the House,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
A Lion in the House,"That‚Äôs crazy, as HotD was loads better, imo. It even came from the public falling out that was Got season 8."
A Lion in the House,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
A Lion in the House,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
A Lion in the House,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it‚Äôs going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
A Lion in the House,What‚Äôs the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
A Lion in the House,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
A Lion in the House,‚Ä¶. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
A Lion in the House,Can‚Äôt wait for season 2
A Lion in the House,Fucking Obviously
A Lion in the House,"I‚Äôm still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it‚Äôs backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in a while."
A Lion in the House,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
A Lion in the House,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn‚Äôt even compare to the game.
A Lion in the House,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
A Lion in the House,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
A Lion in the House,‚Ä¶because it‚Äôs a much better show
A Lion in the House,"Yea bc house of dragons sucked
I‚Äôm surprised white lotus didn‚Äôt beat house of dragons"
A Lion in the House,They both have horribly unlikable main characters.
A Lion in the House,"If any HBO producer is reading this

Do you see what happens when you put effort and hire good writers?

But that doesn't mean we want a pletora of bad/mediocre zombies shows now, ok?"
A Lion in the House,"Yeah, It's still winter outside. House of the Dragon ran through the summer. Not very fair numbers."
A Lion in the House,"Fungos \&gt; drag√µes, simples."
A Lion in the House,"It's pretty good, even though it commits the fucking sin of having the word fuck said way too many times in the fucking script. To the point I can fucking hear it coming before the word fuck is out of the actor's mouth. It really lessons the fucking impact of fuck when it's said every fucking few minutes. 

Otherwise, it's good. Fuck."
A Lion in the House,Two shows with terrible writing‚Äîsave for episode 3 of TLOU which was brilliant!
Wrong Kind of Black,When she said they will show a simulation of how how ancient cities were built and then they showed a minecraft building video üòÇ
Wrong Kind of Black,"This show is almost as good as Belgian techno anthem ""Pump Up the Jam."""
Wrong Kind of Black,"‚ÄúThe most notorious Roman until Polanski‚Äù

I lost it for a good three minutes at this line."
Wrong Kind of Black,"There's also Cunk on Britain and a few others.  One on Christmas, I think"
Wrong Kind of Black,This is a bacus
Wrong Kind of Black,"Dance like no one is watching.

-Aristotle"
Wrong Kind of Black," ‚ÄúIf I ever see Christ again, he‚Äôs a dead man‚Äù -Paul"
Wrong Kind of Black,"‚ÄúSo hang on, if I think therefore I am, what about other people? Do they think therefore they am? How can I tell if they're thinking therefore they am? Or am I just thinking they think therefore they am, but actually they're not real and I'm only thinking they am? Are you thinking therefore you am right now?‚Äù

Dead"
Wrong Kind of Black,I can only handle 15 minutes at a time. It gets to a point where I get so irritated but it‚Äôs hilarious. Internal struggle.
Wrong Kind of Black,"One of my favourite Qunks (a Cunk Quote) is  ‚ÄúIn the Middle Ages, did they know it was the Middle Ages, or did they just think, ‚Äòthis is now‚Äô? How did they know they were halfway through time?‚Äù"
Wrong Kind of Black,Her description of her castle was marvelous. The foley artists must have had a blast doing that. So many great moments and the timing is incredible. Im gonna watch it again a couple times.
Wrong Kind of Black,PUMP UP THE JAM PUMP IT UP-
Wrong Kind of Black,What is clocks?
Wrong Kind of Black,"The Ghengis Khan ""Mongoling free"" line nearly killed me, just thrown in there all casual like"
Wrong Kind of Black,I watched the first episode yesterday and found myself laughing out loud quite a few times. I was completely sold ten minutes in. The joke about how we can make breathtaking simulations of ancient ruins with modern technology... And then it's just Minecraft footage. Amazing.
Wrong Kind of Black,"I don‚Äôt usually go in for these shenanigans but this show is unique and edited so that jokes land with perfect precision.

When she was shocked in ep 4 (?) that nuclear weapons are still a thing and that Britain‚Äôs stockpile isn‚Äôt full of blanks, I was surprised the actress was able to cry so convincingly- your run of the mill sitcom actress couldn‚Äôt do it quite like this.

Are the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù actors or real experts? I‚Äôm almost certain they‚Äôre (coached) real professionals in their fields.

It really is a 10/10 show for its genre."
Wrong Kind of Black,"They created fire, prolonging their already tedious lives"
Wrong Kind of Black,What is this style of comedy called? The Daily Show did it‚Ä¶taking the piss while interviewing experts. Great stuff
Wrong Kind of Black,Soviet Onion
Wrong Kind of Black,"I just binged everything, I loved it. She's so dumb but with few notes of vulnerability towards the end, and the show often have interesting social comments while deliberately using terrible shortcuts and stupid shit.

I'm gonna try to find the Cunk on Britain one, and hope they do more on Netflix."
Wrong Kind of Black,"""My mate Paul says that the media tries to cover it up, just because it's not true."""
Wrong Kind of Black,"When she tried to cancel the historian for implying the Renaissance was more important than Single Ladies by Beyonce lmfaooo

(to be fair Beyonce just released an album called Renaissance)"
Wrong Kind of Black,"I love Diane Morgan. 

If you've not seen Motherland, jump on it as soon as possible, because it's wonderful."
Wrong Kind of Black,Is that‚Ä¶ the girl from After Life??
Wrong Kind of Black,And the experterers who know these things‚Ä¶ she loves to pull a President Bush made up words‚Ä¶
Wrong Kind of Black,"Is the she the actress who plays the clueless ditz in those ""Death to 2021"", etc, mockumentaries?"
Wrong Kind of Black,My mate Paul loves this show.
Wrong Kind of Black,I really hope it has Barry Shitpeas in it somewhere.
Wrong Kind of Black,I always enjoy Diane Morgan in everything she's in. She's perfectly deadpan in all the Cunk series'.
Wrong Kind of Black,I turned this on to have in the background while cooking and ended up bingeing the whole series in one night. The patience of some of these historians and scholars is something else
Wrong Kind of Black,"It rubs me a bit the wrong way that that headline is all about Broker. Without Diane Morgan Cunk would not be what it is and dn it, I want her to get credit, not just the man."
Wrong Kind of Black,"I didn't know anything about this woman, I watched the first two episodes yesterday and it was great. Also, I watched ""Death to 2021 &2020"". Equally amazing. How I missed that?"
Wrong Kind of Black,i like it a piece at a time. it has same effect of Cohen's or Ricky Gervais' comedy on me.
Wrong Kind of Black,"I saw this shit lol, its funny. Love these sort of sarcastic comedies. Any other comedies like this ?"
Wrong Kind of Black,I wanna hang out with her mate Paul tbh
Wrong Kind of Black,I absolutely love her
Wrong Kind of Black,"Philomena I love you, you beautiful crazy schizophrenic brain melting space dolphin."
Wrong Kind of Black,I had a work event Tuesday night and got home late. My wife was watching it. I had no idea what it was but I laughed many times. I can't wait to sit down and give it a proper watch.
Wrong Kind of Black,"Watch this a few months ago with my brothers and the ""computer simulation of what ancient societies looked like,"" took all three of us out so hard we were crying laughing so hard."
Wrong Kind of Black,"Vesuvius ""preserved glimpses of how sophisticated Roman life was, with creature comforts like indoor plumbing and cunnilingus"" üòÜ"
Wrong Kind of Black,The one on Shakespeare is incredible!!
Wrong Kind of Black,[deleted]
Wrong Kind of Black,"I've been very pleasantly surprised by it and trying to convince everyone I know to give it a go. 

""It's hard to believe I'm walking through the remains of the first human city. Because I'm not. That's in Iraq, which is hundreds of miles away, and fucking dangerous."""
Wrong Kind of Black,I want a coffee-table book of just the scripts for this show. Such hilarious one-liners.
Wrong Kind of Black,We just finished it. Hilarious. Just note perfect and a joke a second.
Wrong Kind of Black,Fuck me she‚Äôs funny.
Wrong Kind of Black,Loved her in After Life.
Wrong Kind of Black,Was she the red head reporter from the one episode of Sherlock? The one who cornered Sherlock in the bathroom at the courthouse?
Wrong Kind of Black,Pump it up!
Wrong Kind of Black,"My mate Paul told me I should check this, but honestly that guy is a wanker‚Ä¶"
Wrong Kind of Black,"I love her so much. I only got a chance to watch the first episode, but it was great."
Wrong Kind of Black,Philomena Philomeni is awesome
Wrong Kind of Black,I like how she describes the wheel as pushing the world backwards while you stay still...
Wrong Kind of Black,"‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know why humankind was at war with the cows, and tragically, we never will.‚Äù"
Wrong Kind of Black,And when the masseuse tried to take her coat
Wrong Kind of Black,"Did the ancient Romans invent asshole bleaching or improve upon it?  She pretty much lost the expert guy on that one, but didn‚Äôt let him escape the question either."
Wrong Kind of Black,"Did she just refer to the Founding Fathers as ‚Äúa straight, white, supergroup‚Äù?  The most famous break up text in history?  

Re: George Washington being elected: the single most revered role in the world until 2016‚Ä¶.

(Standby) 

Ok phew had to catch my breath from laughing so hard"
Wrong Kind of Black,"Philosophy is thinking about thinking, which sounds stupid, because it is."
Wrong Kind of Black,I'm six minutes into the first episode and I've already laughed more and harder than I can remember laughing at anything in the last 10 years sober.
Wrong Kind of Black,The trailer is not selling it for me...glad to read it's better than that
Wrong Kind of Black,It‚Äôs so good. I‚Äôm cracking up out loud at least 2-3 times a minute
Wrong Kind of Black,"And if you like this, you really need to check out Dianne Morgan's other series, Mandy."
Wrong Kind of Black,"Morgan and Brooker have always been pure gold with Cunk and it's hilarious as ever. Now do Wipe again Brooker, you oik"
Wrong Kind of Black,Laughed out loud at al-gebra and her discussion of the largest empires (with a very modern reference). I had to replay that segment. Laughed as much the second time.
Wrong Kind of Black,It's literally a laugh-a-minute. Loved this show.
Wrong Kind of Black,Pump up the jam for 45 seconds has solidified me watching the whole series .
Wrong Kind of Black,Managed to watch the first episode of this tonight.  Simply marvelous.
Wrong Kind of Black,I‚Äôve watched half a dozen of these.  She‚Äôs kind of hilarious.
Wrong Kind of Black,Glad to see it's gaining traction! All of them are a laugh
Wrong Kind of Black,Wasn‚Äôt a fan of her shtick although seems to have landed well enough here
Wrong Kind of Black,How history should be taught
Wrong Kind of Black,"This entire show is summarized well by rolling stone-

What a ridiculous person is Philomena Cunk. What a very funny show is Cunk on Earth.


If you want to watch the show skip the article so it‚Äôs not spoiled."
Wrong Kind of Black,Charlie Brooker is funny. A Touch of Cloth is probably the most sorely underrated UK comedy in existence. The second had me absolutely bawling with laughter.
Wrong Kind of Black,Oh so this the show's clip I'm seeing on YouTube lately
Wrong Kind of Black,"She is hilarious in Frayed. Which was all I knew her from so far as an Aussie, had no idea she was behind Black Mirror."
Wrong Kind of Black,They knew?
Wrong Kind of Black,I love love love Philomena Cunk and have all her appearances. I even made a tribute to her by [reviewing a great history series in her style.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdoXCfSdjF4)
Wrong Kind of Black,I could only get through half the episode. Can‚Äôt imagine watching a whole season of it.
Wrong Kind of Black,I tried watching last night I couldn‚Äôt finish the first episode! Wasn‚Äôt my cup of tea tad on the corny side for me.
Wrong Kind of Black,Ali G and Mrs Merton level of intellectual pisstake comedy.
Wrong Kind of Black,I started watching it.  It's funny but I felt like I was watching some kind of blend of Ali-G and Daily Show.
Wrong Kind of Black,"It's a UK show, but it's not on UK Netflix.. figures."
Wrong Kind of Black,"Don't miss Cunk on Shakespeare, it's marvelous"
Wrong Kind of Black,"I love Cunk.

She would be perfect with a Royals expert to narrate the coronation. Interview a ""Royals expert."""
Wrong Kind of Black,"I really appreciate this show as a parody of these kinds of documentaries. Growing up I watched a ton of History Channel and now I watch a lot of old History Channel and BBC docs on YouTube. There is a kind of style to these programs and the Cunk episodes do a good job of spoofing them. I only just learned about her this week and have already watched ‚ÄúCunk on Earth,‚Äù ‚ÄúCunk on Britain,‚Äù ‚ÄúCunk on Shakespeare,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCunk on Christmas.‚Äù I would love for her to do a deep dive series on just the Tudors. I‚Äôm sure its success will prompt Netflix to cut a deal with her‚Äî I wonder if a series on just American history would work?"
Wrong Kind of Black,Ali G successor it seems like!
Wrong Kind of Black,‚Äú Kind of like wiping a bit of dried spunk from Gwyneth Paltrow‚Äòs eye‚ÄùCunCK
Wrong Kind of Black,About a year ago some English people told me about the Cunk on shows. They used to have them all on YouTube. They still may. But man she is hilariously deadpan and I love it. Right up my alley.
Wrong Kind of Black,Tune in next week when we discuss the Bible and the Koran and finally decide which one is better.
Wrong Kind of Black,Watch this it takes a second for it to get funny but once you understand the humor it is absolutely worth it. I already rewatched.
Wrong Kind of Black,I‚Äôm watching through again-comedy gold. Can she do a stint hosting the US Daily Show?
Wrong Kind of Black,"Found cunk last year, and was so happy she's on netflix"
Wrong Kind of Black,"It‚Äôs hard to believe that I‚Äôm standing in the ruins of the first ever city. And you would be right not to, that‚Äôs in Irak, which is far away and fucking dangerous"
Wrong Kind of Black,Is this show just coming out in the US or something? I watched this last year.
Wrong Kind of Black,Darkages
Wrong Kind of Black,"this woman is 47.

she's so so so fine"
Wrong Kind of Black,Couldn‚Äôt make it through the first episode. Seemed like Ali G style ( which was great)but tried too hard.
Wrong Kind of Black,"I just love her last name, it sounds so dangerously close to a certain naughty word, especially when said in her wonderful accent. She's a right Cunk, that one!"
Wrong Kind of Black,"The first 10 minutes of the first episode were brilliant. The interview segments, not so much."
Wrong Kind of Black,Does any one remember her from after life..she is too good!!

Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Whatever it‚Äôs flaws, it was all worth it when Maya screamed, ‚ÄúHow the fuck was I supposed to know that?‚Äù"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Jason Bateman being a cat and telling that his revenge would be sweet was fantastic.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Yeah totally agree. Pete was an unnecessary addition at the end. He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise and he did not gel with the rest of the episode. Really enjoyed Jason and Maya and the rest of the episode until then. When Jason realized Santa was Sean and said ""aw you roped Sean into this?"" I laughed out loud."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Master Bateman and Maya Rudolph were great. Marshawn Lynch was a nice surprise (‚ÄúOh shit, it‚Äôs the dude from Ozark!‚Äù).

Pete Davidson was kind of ‚Äúeh‚Äù, but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

Apparently he was sequestered in his trailer for 4 hours, according to Krister Johnson, writer for Murderville, in the /r/murderville subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/murderville/comments/zm8rz7/_/j0e4mai/"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Yeah, but that's the joke, right? The murderer was someone Maya hadn't even met, and Pete was asked to choose the killer with no information at all. There's no way he could have added anything to the investigation, so he was just having fun with it. 

I liked the interplay between the different guests better than the first series where it's just the guest with Terry, but it would probably be better to have them all there from the start. It would be less confusing for the viewer, and hopefully they would actually choose one of the suspects in the end."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Jasons bird dance was incredible
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,It was almost worth it though for Bateman's deadpan scolding of Pete for mocking Donna Foccacias name
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I absolutely loved the episode and agree that Pete didn‚Äôt add anything. I feel I could‚Äôve done what he did, being I have zero acting talent and what not."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,It was almost like Pete was walking by the studio while they were filming the ending and just dragged him in for no reason.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,We said the same thing! It was SO funny but how none of them chose one of the three suspects kinda killed it. I will say I cracked up that Jason picked Santa because it was absolutely absurd. I think the idea of having someone come in at the very end was great but anyone but Pete. His hype needs to be done. If they got Molly Shannon or something that would‚Äôve been awesome.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Wasn‚Äôt the joke that because he was brought in last minute there‚Äôs no way he could of known what was going on? I thought it was funny anyway‚Ä¶
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"The thing about him pulling the wires though is that they were about to get him to disarm the bomb anyway so why didn‚Äôt they just roll with it and be like ‚Äúoh, good job Pete. That did it I guess‚Äù"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Agreed. I loved the special and hope they do more Murderville. But Pete Davidson is just not funny, and this was made more apparent sharing the stage with actors who can actually do improv well."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I think Santa was my favorite thing in the episode. From him dying like 3 separate times, to the mannequin bit with the Orphans... i just lost my shit."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"My wife and I were blitzed when  we watched this on Friday and I cannot remember a time we have laughed more post COVID.  We were extremely happy to see Marshawn make a cameo and we loved him pointing out, ""That's the guy from OZARK!""

Might be the alcohol talking but it was by far our favorite thus far!"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I kinda like how it feels like improv between friends and a chaotic mess. Also makes it feel more real, less set up and less rehearsed or prepped for as some shows that fake realism can be. Tho it is better when will arnett is trying not to laugh and the comedian digs in to make him laugh. There‚Äôs few times where arnett or the other actor is trying to drag some improv out of the guest whose stuck but you can‚Äôt win them all in improv.

Throwing Pete last minute was some wild farcical comedy. If you don‚Äôt care if he solves it or not it is funny how lost he is"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I think he would have chosen the mint girl if he didn‚Äôt see both Maya and Jason picking outside the box. The bomb thing was absolutely dumb. But it was an enjoyable episode nonetheless.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"The ending did piss me off a bit, and I was surprised that having three professional comedians resulted in them all going against the basic fundamentals of improv comedy.

Definitely would have been better without Pete, but I wouldn't have minded them bringing in a third person at the end.  I liked the underlying premise of ""This guy has no knowledge of anything that has transpired yet.""  Marshawn Lynch would have been good."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,That was literally the entire joke but alright lol
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Agreed completely.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I like Pete more than the average redditor but he straight up sucked. He didn‚Äôt even try to play along at all, didn‚Äôt say a single useful or funny thing, and then pulled all the wires on the bomb at the end which is just textbook terrible improv."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Still can‚Äôt believe no one made a joke at the end about it being an arresting development
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I never knew in wanted a Jason Bateman Maya Rudolph team up and now I want a whole movie
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,It‚Äôs crazy to think an actor with no range or ability to maintain character spent so many years on a live variety sketch show.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,He was fine. Is he as good as the others? No but he absolutely didn‚Äôt ‚Äúruin‚Äù anything and imo played off decently with the other cast. It ain‚Äôt perfect but I think it‚Äôs obnoxious to write a whole post about it.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I wonder what the back story to it was in real life. Like was he just chilling near the studio and someone was like ‚Äúhey were filming this come join! It‚Äôs not like you need a script‚Äù or something similar. 

It didn‚Äôt seem planned (not that much is) but in some ways that‚Äôs the charm of it. 

Or maybe it was just horribly planned out. I‚Äôm going to hope there is an amusing backstory."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I did love the idea of bringing in a 3rd person with absolutely no understanding of what has already happened, right at the very end... but agree.  I wish Davidson had taken it a little more seriously, even if I did laugh at most of what he did.  Including pulling all the wires.

That said, though.  We went back and rewatched the others after the special and I do like the way the Christmas special flowed, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery party of friends, than the others did, because of the character breaks and things."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Agreed, I just don't understand how he keeps getting work. I used to think it was a conspiracy that the entertainment industry force feed you certain people, but I 100% believe it with him. He's smarmy and not funny, who are his fans? What does he actually bring to the table? I'll never understand it."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I agree. The episode was great, but Pete Davidson almost ruined it. 

I really tried to give him a chance, but Pete was laughing the whole time and pointed the finger at Will just to seem funny. He wasn‚Äôt even playing the game. When he pulled all the wires, I just gave up. He was an awful addition to the story. 

Referencing the Smartless podcast, what if they got Justin Theroux instead of Pete Davidson? That would have been gold."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I don't like Pete Davidson. Don't get what his appeal his. He's not talented in my eyes. Just a run of the mill chum.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I groaned when >!Pete Davidson!< lumbered onto the scene. Didn't add anything of value. I wish it had been someone like Michael Cera as a sort of wink and a nod to Arrested Development, like how they had >!Sean Hayes!< on there as a reference to >!the Smartless podcast!<."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"If you've not seen it you should check out Murder in Successville, which is the original version of the show."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Pete Davidson ruined it to be honest.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I guess I was the opposite. Pete is pretty well known for breaking at the drop of a hat so you just have to have that expectation and enjoy it when it happens. Especially since Bateman had made several fourth wall breaking comments and Maya broke when she heard Santa was dead. It's one of those shows where breaking can add to the show, rather than detract."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I died when they asked Jason Bateman to dance and he pulled the ‚Äúca-caw ca-caw‚Äù chicken dance from arrested development
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"By the end my impression of things was that:

Maya was all in and enjoying the hell out of it

Bateman was over it and contemplating who he was going to kill first, Will Arnett for getting him involved (since I imagine that is how it happened) or his agent because agents.

And that Davidson had been walking by while they were filming and some producer yanked him in off the street for the hell of it."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I loved it when Maya accused the mayor who immediately said, ""the fuck?"""
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I‚Äôm not the biggest Pete Davidson fan but I really enjoyed the unnecessary addition. It was more so a joke to add someone at the last second who missed the entire case and then have them pick who they think the killer is. Also how could you not break if you‚Äôre coming into the end of the episode?
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"The kind of ‚Äúcardinal rule‚Äù for improv is the ‚Äúyes, and‚Äù approach. Pete didn‚Äôt say yes to any set ups; he didn‚Äôt play along with the bomb wire. He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect. He just sat and smiled and didn‚Äôt attempt any effort to get into any sort of character. 
I think a lot of us had bigger expectations because he was on a comedy sketch show, but he either doesn‚Äôt have the chops or he prefers to bring chaos and watch everyone shift to his style. 
It‚Äôs way more fun to watch improv when everyone tries to gel; he gave no gifts/easy lifts to the other teammates and he heightened zero scenes. The ability to keep the bit going is all on Will, Jason, Maya and the supporting cast."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"It had its moments, but the whole thing didn‚Äôt feel well put together.  It‚Äôs like they started filming and decided to call Maya and Pete to see if they were free to swing by. 

They should have all been in a group from the start."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Completely agree. I was so disappointed bc Pete seemed to not play the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and instead seemed to want to just f up the story line. 
It made no sense adding him. 
Also they should have brought in Maya earlier in the show."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Me and my girlfriend thought him showing up out of the blue was one of the best parts of the episode.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I don‚Äôt blame Pete because they brought him on right at the end and he didn‚Äôt have any context. I wish instead of staggering the guests they were all present at the beginning. Or they did separate episodes. Overall thought it was great. Loved Jason‚Äôs nod to Arrested Development with the chicken dance
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,It's the American remake of Murder in Successville in case anyone else was confused.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I feel almost completely the opposite about the episode. I thought everything until Pete showed up was weaker than most of the regular episodes, but when he showed up the chaos it brought was hilarious. I don't think without him there Jason and Maya would have picked the killers they did, and it just raised everything up. There's no way it would work as a normal thing, but for a special episode it was a great ending."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Everything was perfectly imperfect and the entire special was wonderful.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I didn‚Äôt mind Pete Davidson. He didn‚Äôt add anything spectacular but his laugh was contagious as a viewer
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"That's why it was funny.

No matter who you bring in, if they're only there for the last 5min, they'd act the same way bc they have no sense of the pacing or what the other 2 ppl have gone through the entire time. 

I found that hilarious."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I think that was the point a bit. To bring some doofus looking guy in who was clueless and had 30 seconds to make a decision and wouldn‚Äôt take it seriously.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Honestly, just having Pete Davidson in a cast is an immediate ""no thanks"" from me, no matter how amazing it might be. Kermit-looking motherfucker is just awful with stupid tattoos."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Before he came in I was sure I'd rewatch it in a year's time. His appearance made it much much worse.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Yeah, WTF why was Pete Davidson even there. He had no context, no frame of reference, he didn't seem like he wanted to play along."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Agreed!
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I agree about Pete Davidson but I was laughing so hard even that couldn‚Äôt ruin it for me. I think Bateman is the perfect type of entertainer to do these things because he is so ridiculously deadpan with his comedy and he didn‚Äôt break no matter what absurd things they made him do. Leslie Nielsen would be proud.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"honestly this episode was hilarious - the end was a bit annoying, but everything else was **great**"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Who is Johnny blaze based on?? I know that is ghost rider but why put him in this skit/movie?? Am I missing something
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Or when Maya said, ‚Äú50 Seconds, MacGruber!‚Äù"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I love Jason but Maya was SO fucking funny
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I laughed the most when that other officer came in when they're interviewing the assistant and Maya goes, ""now who the fuck is that?!"" This show is lots of fun, and I loved seeing Jason Bateman in it as well! Dug the little AD callback with his quick chicken impersonation. If you can even call it that...I'm not convinced he's ever seen one."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"""I never met him!"""
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Or when the lady cop showed up and Maya said ""who the fuck was that?"""
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Oh god that was hilarious. I laughed a lot this episode - watching Jason having to go through all of the debasing stuff set up and talking about having time to plot his revenge.. Sean laughing, the naked guy."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,He was such a good sport not hesitating to go full in on playing a cat. But casually vocalizing that he would get Arnete back for it was gold.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"When he tried to do mouth to mouth, I almost died"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

To be fair, that was the joke.  But yeah, he didn't go along with anything and that ruined the ending a bit."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I wasn't sure who ""Sean"" was or how Jason Bateman knew him lol"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"> He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise

That was the joke."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"The improv masters were great and all, but the completely natural reaction of ""Oh shit, it's the guy from Ozark."" has to be my favorite bit in the whole thing."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"> but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

They need to send that one back to the drawing board"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"""Who's the assistant?""

 ""That one.

 ""oh, she did it.""

And he STILL didn't pick her."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I'd watch a full Pete episode for sure
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"""caw, caw"""
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,it's from 'arrested development' where Will Arnett used to do this dance in front of Jason!
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I didn‚Äôt even know who he was and assumed he was a DJ or something since he didn‚Äôt seem like he could act and wasn‚Äôt funny. Possibly an athlete, but like, for poker or something."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"It was an easier case than the other episodes by a mile - my partner noticed right away that all the name tags were smudged because they were written by someone left-handed and then I picked out that the killer's name tag was not smudged because they were writing it themselves to replace the one they lost.

But the fact that nobody even guessed one of the suspects was a far better outcome than the prior episodes where they just flounder with a random guess. The Mayor, suicide, and Seattle were great picks."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I LOVE the fact that there are three suspects, three detectives, and no one picked any of them.  It feels like an instant, unspoken agreement of ""if we don't know, we won't pick.""  And Pete seemed to pick up on it, too."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Yes, they really needed someone with improv training. Imagine Amy Poehler or Will Ferrell or even Martin Short in that role."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I will say that this episode also seemed way harder to solve than the others.  I don't know if that was because of the multiple guest stars or what.  I didn't pick up on the mint drink at all.  The nametag smear was an obvious clue, but somehow I forgot all about it by the time we met Jim.  And I think the ""magic hands"" was a real stretch, though she was the only thing I go right and that was only because of how crazy she was and honestly I assumed her cat would have done the licking."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"His hype will be done when he stops bagging the top ""newly available talent"" every six months.  It's a damn right of passage at this point.  

Ariana Grande, Kate Beckinsale, Kaia Gerber, Phoebe Dynevor, Kim Kardashian, Margaret Qualley and now Emily Ratajkowski?  The guy's a machine."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Right? I though the absurdity of it made it worth the joke
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I *think* the plan was to have Maya and Jason try and explain the absolute absurdity they just witnessed and basically have him go on that. THey did it a little bit but I don't think they got what they wanted.

I didn't hate it as most of the others, here. I thought it was funny enough."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Where's that ""could of/could have"" bot?"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"True. The absolute funniest scenes in the UK original are ones where everyone breaks character because they're laughing too much. This is my favourite:

https://youtu.be/kphVef2S2bI"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I agree because I've seen this opinion posted everywhere and I think people are taking this obviously silly and fun show way too seriously. ""No one picking a real suspect ruined it for me."" Really?! I was rolling laughing at that and so was the crew in the background, it was a great moment!"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I think you hate Pete Davidson a bit too much if him being there for five minutes ruined a hilarious episode with some insane performances.

I think the ‚ÄúChad‚Äù sketches are dumb, and he‚Äôs not really my cup of tea, but I didn‚Äôt recoil (lol coil) when he walked out. It was more of an ‚ÄúOh, that guy.‚Äù"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,He was really good in King of Staten Island
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Jason also did a bit of the chicken dance when he was singing his elf song.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"Aww, now I'm going to be forever sad that it wasn't Michael Cera. His personality would've been great for this special."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,Sean also randomly appeared in a bit with Will on Lego Masters a few weeks ago.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,And it's amazing
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I lost it when he just pulled the wires on the bomb. I like Pete. I really don't understand why people hate him so much.
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"> He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect.

So did Jason and Maya"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,">He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect. 

Can you imagine if the other two had done that?!"
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,"I do, he still didn‚Äôt go along with the scenes. He‚Äôs a talentless amateur."
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,It rhymes with Sean Hayes and sounds like a bad ass athlete
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,The actual name might be familiar if you‚Äôre a ghost rider fan
Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?,I loved that part so much
Paranormal,Didn‚Äôt even know this existed
Paranormal,"To me, the most baffling part of all of this, and there are many baffling parts, is that I remember that Netflix at some point admitted that the vast majority of their users were just binge watching stuff like Friends or Grey's Anatomy.  You would think that would scare them as more and more classic licensed material gets pulled to go to alternate streaming services. What's going to happen to their userbase if 10 years from now their library is almost exclusively made up of unfinished shows, most ending on a cliffhanger?"
Paranormal,"Man, Netflix‚Äôs promotional team is just non existent for anything that isn‚Äôt a guaranteed massive hit huh?"
Paranormal,"Netflix? Cancellation? Two seasons? Animated show? 

Yep, that‚Äôs a bingo."
Paranormal,Netflix just gets stressed out if they haven't canceled something in the last couple of hours.
Paranormal,Because it was doing better than oddballs
Paranormal,I feel bad for my kids.  They really liked this one.
Paranormal,Thats a shame. It was a fun show but hit on some heavy topics. Would have been nice if they had a chance to wrap up the stories
Paranormal,I like adult animation and I‚Äôve never heard of this??
Paranormal,Netflix should rebrand as a streamer for limited series; hardly any shows make it to a third season
Paranormal,"Netflix: Is your show called Wednesday?

Showrunner: No?

Netflix: Oh, is it called Stranger Things then?

Showrunner: No, it's called...

Netflix: You're canceled!"
Paranormal,I‚Äôve watched other animated shows and this has never once shown up anywhere on my Netflix homepage. No idea about its quality but I bet most people just didn‚Äôt know it existed.
Paranormal,Too many shows nobody knows about. Weekly release Netflix. You're losing too many American creatives
Paranormal,"This is so sad! Such a great show, tackling hard topics like friendships evolving and the first time I've seen a Trans gay male lead. 

Barney was such a great character and so wholesome for today's children's shows. He was a kind person who just loved so much. I feel a little like I've lost a friend. 

Norma Khan was the first time I've seen my own story of realizing what Bisexual is and the excitement to finally understand what you've been feeling. 

I'm in tears, this show was so incredible. 
I'll deeply miss it. Thank you Hamish Steele for two amazing seasons, I'll always wish it was more."
Paranormal,"I love the paranormal, and I love amusement parks. I have never seen this even advertised to me on Netflix. This actually makes me feel anger, I would have watched this, this isn't even the shows fault. So many people in this comment section haven't heard of this either. WTF."
Paranormal,"Damnit, I really enjoyed this one, what a bummer."
Paranormal,"Sigh‚Ä¶

It was fun while it lasted I guess."
Paranormal,Ugh this show was such a a gem too. I was looking forward to more.
Paranormal,I didn‚Äôt watch the show but damn that art style is obnoxious.
Paranormal,"All these cancellations are why I just don't watch any shows until they're finished/on final season, with a proper ending and not cancelled on a cliffhanger."
Paranormal,"It was decent, not great but still wholesome."
Paranormal,"I saw it, it was ok. More pissed about inside job"
Paranormal,I wish I didn't learn of this show's existence from its cancellation notice
Paranormal,">The series was praised for its representation of LGBTQ characters and held a 100% RottenTomatoes score. The show also led to an open letter from five Republican senators to the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board over ‚Äúdisturbing‚Äù LGBTQ+ content.

You think this run forever just to spite its critics."
Paranormal,Never heard of it and it wasn't recommended to me on Netflix once.
Paranormal,"Nah man, if Netflix is going to keep doing this bullshit they need to change their business model. Like becoming the place people premier the first season of their show and then at the end of the season Netflix sells the show rights to the highest bidder and even directs viewers to that service."
Paranormal,"Huh, at least the title is accurate"
Paranormal,"What I find interesting is that all of these shows that are being cancelled I had never heard of until they were no more.

Maybe that is Netflix‚Äôs problem - they don‚Äôt believe in their content enough to promote it. instead they just expect us to just watch whatever comes up on the front page and when we don‚Äôt then its off to the Glue factory."
Paranormal,Just say Netflix beside any title and we will assume it means cancelled.
Paranormal,Make a list of what isn't cancelled at Netflix. It'll be much shorter.
Paranormal,Think I read somewhere that Netflix stopped giving any fuck about animation. Seem to be true.
Paranormal,People will be angry about this but I doubt those people even watched it. Although to be fair Netflix do a terrible job on promotion. Things just shadow drop into the depths of the menu screen and they expect it to do well.
Paranormal,I wanted to like this but got kind of bored
Paranormal,Drop off is real. I remember Netflix shoving this in my face. My wife and I (28 & 29) got 5-10 into pilot and stopped watching.
Paranormal,"Well that‚Äôs unfortunate, I thought it was a good show."
Paranormal,Still can't believe they cancelled Inside Job after renewing it. It was so good and the ending was so sad ;(
Paranormal,"""Netflix cancels show you've never heard of"" is so rote at this point you might as well have a daily headline reading ""Sun rose this morning.""

I just assume that Netflix has two massive bingo-ball machines running at all times. Every morning, one randomly greenlights something and the other randomly cancels something. And at no point does anything from the greenlight machine ever receive so much as a quantum of marketing budget or attention."
Paranormal,Oh look people mad Netflix canceled a show nobody was watching besides the few people in the comments I‚Äôm shocked. It has only 2.3k votes and 6.9 rating on IMDb. Tired of all the complaining I see on here every time Netflix cancels a show that wasn‚Äôt performing well.
Paranormal,Netflix is not the place to watch series.
Paranormal,I watched the first episode and am very surprised it got a second season.
Paranormal,"I thought this show was surprisingly boring. It wasn‚Äôt especially funny, nor was it interesting enough to make some of its heavier themes/topics land. I also think stylistically it feels dated to the early 2010‚Äôs in a way that we‚Äôve moved past since."
Paranormal,Nooooo! We love this show in my house!!! I don't know if the comics have gone further though.
Paranormal,more news: infinitesimally small niche group of fans of minor content are mad at netflix and are sure the c suite doesn't know how to run a business
Paranormal,Weak character design
Paranormal,"Art looks like standard CalArts style garbage.  No loss.

Companies like Netflix keep shoveling stacks of cash into the furnace of woke programming that appeals to 1% of Twitter who still won‚Äôt watch or pay for it.

Velma‚Äôs next for early cancellation despite the fact that any sane executive would have known from the start no one would watch it either."
Paranormal,"One of these days, most likely some years down the road, we're gonna be watching ""Cancelled: The Fall of Netflix"""
Paranormal,I have never even heard of this. I have 2 kids that watch cartoons on Netflix. How did this not come up?
Paranormal,"This one hurts. I adored this show, and its queer representation was ground-breaking."
Paranormal,"So this was pretty big. One of the best shows Netflix put out, and it kinda popped off on Tiktok. Incredibly sad, especially with how season 2 ended."
Paranormal,"I loved this show. Not only because of its main themes, but the low-key representation leading this series was really cool. This makes me really mad. Ugh, damnit. Part of me knew this show didn't have the popularity to keep it going though..."
Paranormal,"Not really a surprise, I watched one episode and it was garbage."
Paranormal,My 4-year-old niece will be very disappointed.
Paranormal,Nooooo
Paranormal,I loved this show.
Paranormal,"Aww, I liked this one."
Paranormal,Noooooooooooooooossss
Paranormal,"Netflix doesn't show me stuff like this - they're tracking what I watch to the point that I pretty much just get a few genres but no real choice. If I switch to Guest (or Hell, even my kids' account!!) I notice there's things I'm missing. I even created a second profile but I find their recommendations converging with my original profile.

I miss the DVD days. Granted, I'd always have a DVD or 2 stuck on top of the TV for a few months, but you could legit rate things and prioritize your selections. Now everything has an Netflix logo attached and I dig around for something to watch.

So now I look forward to visiting my parents and surfing the cable channels."
Paranormal,I for one am blaming all of  Netflix‚Äôs animation cancellations on their dumb two part season bullshit because they release the first part of the season let it rot for a year and then when part 2 releases with little to no advertising they cancel it a short bit later and wonder why people are forgetting these shows.
Paranormal,Netflix really need to get someone in who looks over the stuff being created lmao.
Paranormal,"At this point, whenever I see a series cancelled, I just assume it‚Äôs at Netflix."
Paranormal,Strike three Netflix. I‚Äôm canceling my subscription
Paranormal,I guess parents weren‚Äôt in a rush to show their kids all that ‚Äúdiversity.‚Äù Shit doesn‚Äôt sell.
Paranormal,"Has netflix ever thought about spending more than a couple knickles they found in the couch on marketing for their shows? 

Maybe they could avoid cancelling all these shows if people knew they existed in the first place and gave them a chance. 

Who am i kidding netflix doesn‚Äôt make smart choices"
Paranormal,God damn it Netflix! What the fuck?!
Paranormal,"Good, the trailer was bafflingly boring"
Paranormal,[deleted]
Paranormal,"Tl;dr this thread: Netflix hate circle jerk

Like all you people are doing nothing but watching shows for 8 year olds and are mad you didn't see this one."
Paranormal,Oh.
Paranormal,Never heard of it
Paranormal,"Oh so that's what my aunt was watching last night huh, dinit look very good anyway tbh"
Paranormal,please netflix can we just get a pugsley movie or mini series and we wont ask for anything else and it can be our birthday AND christmas present?!
Paranormal,It really feels like so shows lately start off in a form where I should be in the main demographic for them in they make a bunch of dumb creative decisions that make me have zero interest in it. I usually just chalk it up to the show being made for a different demographic than mine but like‚Ä¶..I‚Äôm a young dude who doesn‚Äôt want culture war stuff in my shows and wants to watch a lot of tv and can pay for it‚Ä¶..you‚Äôd think at some point it would make sense to cater to my demographic at least a little. I‚Äôm begging y‚Äôall to take my money.
Paranormal,The Netflix staff needs to fired and then rehired with new ones because this whole cancellation fiasco is getting out of hand.
Paranormal,That sucks this show is so good
Paranormal,When will people learn? Stop watching Netflix. Cancel your subscription.
Paranormal,Imma judge a book off its cover (thumb nail) and say this show sucks
Paranormal,"I'm no hater but good god there were far too many ""issues"" raised in this cartoon. Its supposed to be for kids. Another one that gets my goat up is cantaurworld. Why does it have to be so flamboyantly gay? There's absolutley no reason for it."
Paranormal,Literally never knew this show existed
Paranormal,"Twice in a week I'm learning about Netflix animated shows because they've been canceled. 

Yet, here's the rub: I am subbed to both r/television and  r/Netflix yet I never saw a single post about any of them. Which goes to prove Netflix's decision to axe them when they didn't even get any buzz among the very audience they were intended for."
Paranormal,Thought about checking it out.
Paranormal,"Damnit Netflix, I liked this one
‚îª‚îÅ‚îª Ô∏µ„ÉΩ(`–î¬¥)ÔæâÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª"
Paranormal,"Fuck Netflix. So sick and tired of them doing one or two seasons of a thing, and then canceling it before a story can end‚Ä¶ Canceling my subscription"
Paranormal,"At this rate, the news will be ""___ does NOT cancel ____"""
Paranormal,Smh cancel culture strikes again
Paranormal,"Fuckin hell, man"
Paranormal,"Honest question, how am I supposed to get invested in ANY Netflix show from the beginning at this point?"
Paranormal,Ugh‚Ä¶ and just when I was starting the 2nd season today. *And* crossing my fingers after Inside Job.
Paranormal,"Loved this show so much, so cute and personal with its topics. Guess it's time to pre-order the two comics"
Paranormal,"Again, I look forward to when creators avoid Netflix like the plague knowing well that they‚Äôll get cancelled if their stuff doesn‚Äôt break records from day one"
Paranormal,"I‚Äôm genuinely very worried about the future of animation in the West.

Disney

Netflix

Especially Warner Bros

Everywhere you look, it‚Äôs going to shit.

At least Japan knows the value"
Paranormal,Never heard of this show
Paranormal,\*sigh\* ofc it was
Paranormal,Great
Paranormal,"Netflix's standards for what qualifies as a success are, simply put, unrealistic."
Paranormal,Oh ffs
Paranormal,Never even heard of this.
Paranormal,It‚Äôs annoying. This was a good show
Paranormal,Never heard of it.
Paranormal,It isn‚Äôt terrible tbh. Just a snooze fest from time to time.
Paranormal,WTF NETFLIX! This was such a good show and it ended on a cliffhanger that I really wanted to see how the story continued. I thought this show had a pretty decent fanbase. Netflix seems to be on a canceling animated shows spree. I‚Äôve been disappointed in so many companies canceling or shorting a show. I guess one good silver lining is that I can get the comic books of this but idk if the show was going to stick to the same thing as the books
Ten Years Late,Now watch it again and you can catch the twist when it happens early in the episode.
Ten Years Late,Scrubs had quite a few gut punch episodes but I still think that one hurt the most. Damn good show.
Ten Years Late,One of the best episodes of television of all time.
Ten Years Late,"This is #2 on my Scrubs Sad Meter.

1a and 1b are My Lunch and My Fallen Idol. (Season 5)"
Ten Years Late,"Getting a Disney+ subscription solely for this show 

So good. You‚Äôve got so many amazing episodes coming up. Hope you enjoy steak night!"
Ten Years Late,God damn that show had some real tear jerkers. I‚Äôm not a big cryer but this episode and the transplant episode get me every fucking time.
Ten Years Late,"You got to watch it without knowing what happens?


If so, GOOD JOB REDDIT for not spoiling it when recommending it


Fun fact: The song at the end, Winter, by Joshua Radin, launched his career. He was Zach Braff's roommate."
Ten Years Late,"Another really sad one that I don't see mentioned often is from an earlier season where Turk, JD and Elliot are each shown with a patient. During the opening voice over JD specifies that statistically one in three patients admitted to the hospital will die there. The episode takes lots of twists and turns and you try to figure out whose patient is gonna be the one that doesn't make it.

In the end? All three patients die. Because sometimes life is harsh"
Ten Years Late,"The song ""One Headlight"" by the Wallflowers always reminds me of the feeling of this episode for some reason."
Ten Years Late,"I just want to compliment you on being so kind as to spoiler mark the episode. I hate the attitude of ""well it's old, you don't need to mark spoilers."" People don't deserve to have plot twists spoiled for them just because something is old. We aren't all able to watch every tv show and movie as it airs, it's unfair to expect people to just deal with being spoiled before just because something came out 20 years ago."
Ten Years Late,"Echoing what others have already said, an excellent episode and truly gut-wrenching.

It was nice to see this different side to both Cox and Kelso and totally believable in their acting that they could soften and show their more vulnerable side.

Kelso telling Carla about his longtime wife Enid and how what he previously viewed as a flaw of hers reminded him how much he truly cared for her was a nice transition to the funeral when we finally get the reveal."
Ten Years Late,"I know this one gets brought up a lot, it is a great episode, but my My Lunch/My Fallen Idol is my favorite followed shortly by My No Good Reason/My Long Goodbye are my favorites.  They pull at my heart so much for different reasons.

But yes after that My Screw Up ranks with it and pulls at me too 

I think scrubs is one of the best shows ever, I have not come across another show that blends comedy with serious drama and characters who grow like scrubs.  The way it can be silly, then dead serious and it doesnt feel forced or uneven, it just works"
Ten Years Late,"Yeah Scrubs has a few of those haymaker moments that just drop you. The ""real"" ending of the show is one of them, probably the best ending to any series ever imo."
Ten Years Late,First few seasons of Scrubs were amazing. Rest of show is great too but the early years were a whole other level.
Ten Years Late,"John C. McGinley really shines in this show, Dr. Cox is one of my favorite sitcom characters of all time. Wait til he tells you about bastards lol. Enjoy the show OP!"
Ten Years Late,"Everybody has their own reasons for loving Brendan Fraser, Scrubs is why I do."
Ten Years Late,"This was the 1st episode I ever saw of Scrubs. I came home from my hospitality job and it was on late that night on TV. It drew me in because Brendan Fraser was in it and it was just kinda goofy at the start. I remember just sitting there completely mind blown at the end, it was just so well executed. The next few weeks my girlfriend and I went and bought all the available seasons on DVD and binged them haha."
Ten Years Late,"There are some episodes of TV that really transcend the show they‚Äôre on and that was definitely one of them. 

Not to saw scrubs wasn‚Äôt a great show, it was, but that episode stood out on another level"
Ten Years Late,"Ah i envy you!!
One of the best episodes of television ever created. Watched it as kid and it hit me hard and streamed it just last month and tbh it hit me even harder. Just so so damn good. 

Hands down one of my top 5 favorite shows. Enjoy! :)"
Ten Years Late,"such a good episode! I‚Äôm slowly rewatching scrubs, I saw that one a couple months ago and still cried, gets me every time!"
Ten Years Late,it‚Äôs funny seeing this because i‚Äôm in the middle of my annual Scrubs rewatch and quite literally just finished watching two episodes that always make my allergies act up. i‚Äôm incredibly jealous you get to experience this show for the first time. you have a lot of great episodes to look forward to - both hilarious and emotional ones. enjoy and see ya at steak night!
Ten Years Late,"Such a heartbreaking episode of a usually upbeat show, but so beautifully acted and written. Always a fave."
Ten Years Late,Still a brilliant episode. I know the twist and I know all the foreshadowing and I still well up every time I watch it.
Ten Years Late,Also there's a Scrubs rewatch podcast where Zach and Donald go through each episode.  It's super fun!!!!
Ten Years Late,"That scene still causes instant waterworks for me. It‚Äôs masterful in how devastating it is. 

Gonna go rewatch scrubs for the millionth time now."
Ten Years Late,"I recently rewatched the series again. That episode gets me with an emotional gut punch every time. It was an incredibly well written episode, with lots of subtle details. >!If you pay attention throughout the episode, after a certain point Ben isn't carrying his camera and taking pictures AND none of the other characters even acknowledge Ben accept for Dr. Cox because he is still trying to process the death of his best friend.!<"
Ten Years Late,That episode hit so hard.
Ten Years Late,"This episode was my introduction to scrubs as a 14/15 year old in English, my teacher picked it out so we could do an essay about it for our GCSE."
Ten Years Late,Don‚Äôt watch ‚Äúseason‚Äù 9. Great fucking show. It will make you crack up and then rip your heart out.
Ten Years Late,When I want to pee tears out of my eyes I‚Äôll throw this one on. Honestly one of the greatest episodes and so well written. Even now knowing the ending I still feel caught of guard by the reveal
Ten Years Late,"If you‚Äôre enjoying the show, their rewatch podcast Fake Doctors, Real Friends is fantastic. Glad you‚Äôre enjoying."
Ten Years Late,"After the MeToo movement I finally watched this show and... well... It's good, don't get me wrong, but kind of cringe in places where I know 20 years ago this stuff didn't really matter or was thought of in the new light."
Ten Years Late,"I love Scrubs but this episode is beyond overrated at this point. I think Fraser‚Äôs character had been in 3-4 episodes and everyone acts like a vital character is gone.

Cox‚Äôs reaction is great but the fanfare this one gets is just ridiculous to me."
Ten Years Late,[removed]
Ten Years Late,Refresh my memory? What‚Äôs the twist earlier in the episode?
Ten Years Late,"I'm excited to do that! I watch only one episode a night so I can make the show last, but tomorrow I'm going to rewatch this one instead of move on to the next new one."
Ten Years Late,"Of all the gut punch episodes, I found that the ones centered around Dr Cox ended up being the best. Not to diminish other ones revolving around different characters, but John C McGinley really brought it when it was his turn at bat."
Ten Years Late,"I'll never forget when the nice old actress Michael Learned (mom on the Waltons), doesn't make it, because of a dirty glove that got touched"
Ten Years Late,It's tied with My Lunch/My Fallen Idol
Ten Years Late,"It really is. Scrubs was a fairly popular show that ran for quite a while yet is still underrated. NBC jerked it around a bit for scheduling which hurt its popularity. Since it's ended I feel like because of the final season & intense dislike (by some) for Zach Braff have caused it to not be looked at so fondly

That's a shame because I really feel like it's a top tier sitcom. It's one of my favorite shows of all-time. After reading this  I'm going to have [""Winter"" ](https://youtu.be/cHlf08yTPiU)stuck in my head for awhile."
Ten Years Late,"If Reddit/Twitter were around and popular in the early 00‚Äôs (weekly discussion threads, in depth analysis) I think Scrubs would be in the GOAT discussion much more in popular culture"
Ten Years Late,I remember being at work the day after My Lunch aired and just being depressed all day.
Ten Years Late,Which one was that?
Ten Years Late,"I wonder how much music they've replaced. I'm guessing probably a lot like Netflix did, which is too bad. Hopefully not in My Last Words. The ending wouldn't hit nearly as hard without [""I'll Follow you Into the Dark""](https://youtu.be/3iV_1ESMHaI). Glad I still have my DVDs."
Ten Years Late,"My Last Words, My Lunch, My Philosophy & so many others."
Ten Years Late,"That's a cool fact, I had no idea and I make a point to watch the series once a year"
Ten Years Late,"I loved that episode so much. It was really harshly sad, but it was so realistic, I just loved the ending so much."
Ten Years Late,"I‚Äôve always loved that song,maybe I too subconsciously attach it to this episode"
Ten Years Late,"It was an easy decision to make! The impact would have been totally lost if I had been spoiled, so I wanted to help anyone else who hasn't watched it yet. :) I'll admit I did feel a little silly marking it as a spoiler because of its age, but the logic of doing so holds true."
Ten Years Late,"I noticed that season 9 had a different title format (Our...), and I thought I remembered people saying it was bad, so thanks for confirming that!"
Ten Years Late,Fuck politically correct shows.
Ten Years Late,"It‚Äôs heavily implied that the code red patient JD gets is the elderly gentleman from earlier in the episode - I believe JD, Turk and Elliott are all at the prescription window and JD suddenly says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a code red‚Äù and runs off like he would any other episode, while Turk and Elliott continue their conversation. 

After that, Brendan Fraser is exclusively seen with Dr. Cox, teasing him with patients and making him laugh with his colleagues, but he doesn‚Äôt have his camera (I‚Äôll take pictures until the day I die) and nobody else can see him/can‚Äôt understand Dr Cox‚Äôs reaction to mostly serious questions/input on the job - only thing is that he is pissed at JD and refuses to leave the hospital then so ‚Äúnobody else dies on his watch‚Äù.  

The whole second half of the episode is this scenario, and it all culminates to Dr. Cox walking with Ben to, what we (and apparently Dr. Cox) think is jack‚Äôs birthday party.  Cox says something to Ben asking why he doesn‚Äôt have his camera to take pictures of crying babies and shit, which JD then appears in a black suit asking Cox ‚Äúwhere do you think we are?‚Äù.  

That snaps Cox and the audience back into reality where we are at Ben‚Äôs funeral and he was a figment of Perry‚Äôs imagination the whole time, the code red was Ben‚Äôs cardiac arrest and Dr. Cox can‚Äôt process it because it‚Äôs his best friend."
Ten Years Late,That when JD was telling Dr Cox about the patient that had passed it wasn‚Äôt the old guy in the wheelchair as we were led to believe
Ten Years Late,"If you're only watching an episode a night and you're into podcasts, you might enjoy their (Zach/JD & Donald/Turk) rewatch podcast Fake Doctors, Real Friends. Gives some extra background and they often have guests on"
Ten Years Late,"You should start listening to the Fake Digitised Real friends podcast

https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fake-doctors-real-friends-60367049/"
Ten Years Late,"My Lunch/My Fallen Idol are amazing episodes that get me more than ""My Screw Up."""
Ten Years Late,"John is great, Zack and Donald have been doing a rewatch podcast and John was on a few and hes always amazing to listen to"
Ten Years Late,"John can bring it so god damn hard in everything he does.

He had a recurring role in the last season of Brooklyn 99 and without a doubt stole the show."
Ten Years Late,This one gets me  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mAtjs-JAtE
Ten Years Late,"This is the ""lost"" episode of Scrubs for my house because my dad was watching it and got so mad at the ending he deleted it before the rest of us got to watch."
Ten Years Late,"> Scrubs was a fairly popular show that ran for quite a while yet is still underrated. 

It really is, and I know Im a Scrubs fanboy, but how many shows blend comedy and drama as well as Scrubs did?"
Ten Years Late,"My friends and I would watch it on Comedy Central once they started airing re runs. All fell in love with the show, but I don't think I watched a single episode on NBC."
Ten Years Late,it's also bounced around a couple different streamers in the past decade which doesn't help
Ten Years Late,"Where Jill Tracy dies from ""cocaine"", Cox uses her organs to save 3 patients but they start dying because she actually died from rabies.

Cox goes on a downward spiral, shows up to work drunk, and suffers severe depression."
Ten Years Late,"I'm pretty sure the music is replaced only on the first three or four seasons.  I remember them talking about it will Bill Lawrence on the podcast and he said after the first couple seasons they got all of the rights to the music.  Also, neat little tidbit, the replacement music was picked by Randall Winston who was a producer on the show and played Leonard the security guard."
Ten Years Late,"Honestly, the Netflix replacements were pretty good!"
Ten Years Late,"It's hardly the worst show ever, but it was supposed to be a spinoff and ABC said no, so it's presented like another season when season 8 was really supposed to be the end. It's mostly from new writers, and it shows. If you choose to watch it, definitely take some time away from the series for a while first, but honestly there just isn't that much to recommend, it's pretty bland"
Ten Years Late,"It wasn't even that. The female characters were these horny teenage boy fantasies for a few seasons. It just simply was cringe to me. 

*shrugs"
Ten Years Late,"I haven't listened to them in a while, but other than the first few episodes, the later episodes mostly consist of their banter about a lot of things other than Scrubs. If you like both personalities, great. But if you want some insight into the show, pick the one with more noteworthy guests like Bill Lawrence."
Ten Years Late,"imo OP should've listen until being finished, since it has spoilers for the series"
Ten Years Late,That‚Äôs Bill Lawrence‚Äôs podcast!
Ten Years Late,That one scene is rough
Ten Years Late,"Same, my absolute favorites"
Ten Years Late,[deleted]
Ten Years Late,"M\*A\*S\*H did a good job. Oof, the chicken on the bus....."
Ten Years Late,The only show that has come close for me is The Good Place.
Ten Years Late,"Nothing like Scrubs, but Reservation Dogs is a show that could have me laughing in first half and choked up by the end."
Ten Years Late,"As a huge Scrubs fan (by far my favorite show), I think there's a few:

* Ted Lasso (same creator)
* Shrinking (same creator)
* Lovesick (British show on Netflix)
* MASH (huge inspiration for Bill Lawrence)
* Bojack Horseman
* Mythic Quest when they do their annual ‚ÄúEpisode‚Äù
* Fleabag

There's also a bunch of popular shows (The Office, HIMYM) that did a good job of it once in a while, although the balance was much more skewed toward the humor half."
Ten Years Late,"There are two that work as well as Scrubs did, in my opinion.

After Life
Shrinking"
Ten Years Late,"It did, and there were some complications with the music rights is some episodes, so songs were removed .  Normally they isn't a big deal, but Scrubs isn't the same missing certain songs"
Ten Years Late,"Everyone always complains about Netflix music replacements but I actually have never even noticed when there was one. Just people being like ""ugh they removed XYZ from episode Whatever!"" and I'll be like ""It sounded fine to me though?"" One of my favorite songs from Scrubs turned out to be a syndication replacement!"
Ten Years Late,"Yes, maybe it helps that the show was a narration through the eyes of JD? So basically the female characters are portrayed how JD interprets them."
Ten Years Late,Or any episode featuring John C McGinley he brings notes and keeps the two others on focus.
Ten Years Late,"Thats my issue with alot of these show podcasts.
They often aren't about the actual show."
Ten Years Late,HOW TO SAVE A LIFE
Ten Years Late,Nope! Just very emotionally connected to that plotline apparently.
Ten Years Late,"What? It was just a chicken, right?"
Ten Years Late,"The Good Place and Scrubs are my 2 all time favorite shows, sooo good."
Ten Years Late,Wouldn‚Äôt Community fit into this list ?
Ten Years Late,"I didnt like Ted Lasso

Need to give Shirking another shot 

Enjoyed Lovesick

Still need to watch Mash

Didnt care for Bojack

Love Fleaback"
Ten Years Late,"I did enjoy After Life

Shrinking didn't click with me but I may try again as I only did an episode"
Ten Years Late,which one?
Ten Years Late,"I mean sure, but looks like they abandoned that in the later seasons because the women were so one dimensional. Carla finally broke out it seems by the last season with what she wanted and her boundaries being recognized."
Ten Years Late,"Because they showed a green shadow on everything that was touched by the infectious material, your eyes can follow how it goes from A to Z in the scene. It would actually be useful as an educational clip."
Ten Years Late,"Sure, it was a chicken. :("
Ten Years Late,"Community doesn't have as much heart, drama and emotional scenes as the others on that list, that's not a diss to it, it's one of my favourite shows, but it doesn't fit into the comedy-drama genre at all"
Ten Years Late,"I wasn't convinced after the first episode of Shrinking, either. Keep watching if you like After Life - it's very similar to it. Some scenes make you cry and then 10 seconds later you'll be laughing hysterically.

My wife and I have a policy of at least 3 episodes of a new show. If you can't grab me in the first three episodes, I'm not gonna like the rest of what you have. But some shows take a few episodes to find their rythym and casting to gel. This policy has never disappointed us."
Ten Years Late,"> heart, drama and emotional scenes

[Excuse me ](https://youtu.be/Sg3NrdLVDVc)"
Ten Years Late,Got it
Ten Years Late,"That's my usual, I'll probably go back when I have time or don't have other distractions"
Love & Anarchy,[deleted]
Love & Anarchy,"Yes, love this show! Really hope it gets a second season. I just found out that a Norwegian Netflix show I also like, Home for Christmas, is coming back for a second season next month, so I'm hopeful for this one too."
Love & Anarchy,I enjoyed it.
Love & Anarchy,I just switched it to Swedish and watched with subtitles!! Way better.
Love & Anarchy,Is the English dubbing bearable?
Love & Anarchy,"‚ÄúWould you be interested in having an affair?‚Äù

*Yes*"
Love & Anarchy,they need robots
Love & Anarchy,It's just not the same without the robots.
Love & Anarchy,I am a bit confused. Wasn‚Äôt there another very recent miniseries based on the same( or similar) true story. I believe with Jessica Biel ( Candy )
Love & Anarchy,"*""Would you be interested in having an affair with me?""* Bro, look at her eyes, she has those crazy murderous eyes, say no."
Love & Anarchy,"Jessie Plemons is fantastic. I‚Äôd watch him in anything. I‚Äôve no idea what this is about and this trailer is all I‚Äôm going to see about it before I watch it, hopefully. The trailer did well to intrigue me without actually giving away any details."
Love & Anarchy,wild that they have two versions of this story like not even. year apart.
Love & Anarchy,Elizabeth Olsen is perfect üòç
Love & Anarchy,"Elizabeth Olsen, Jesse Plemons and Lily Rabe? Sign me up! Been waiting for this so long and it's coming out around my birthday! Let's go!"
Love & Anarchy,Man I thought Jesse Plemons was Philip Seymour Hoffman for a second and thought this was filmed before his death
Love & Anarchy,"Wow, this season of WandaVision looks intense."
Love & Anarchy,"It'll be fun to compare this to the one from last year, starring Jessica Biel and Melanie Lynskey."
Love & Anarchy,"Can‚Äôt wait, Elizabeth Olsen is a stellar actress and the rest of the cast is great"
Love & Anarchy,Kind of remind me of Fargo S1
Love & Anarchy,I just got through watching Candy which was not bad at all. Going to be hard to watch this so soon afterwards which is a shame as it looks like a better version.
Love & Anarchy,I had to look up the name of the actor Elizabeth Olsen's character had an affair with. Damn ... he (Jesse Plemons) could almost be a drop-in for Philip Seymour Hoffman.
Love & Anarchy,"Damn,I really missed HBO type miniseries. Can't wait for this one."
Love & Anarchy,"The husband was 20x hotter on Hulu's Candy. I like this actor in general, just saying."
Love & Anarchy,My boy Plemens doesn't even get his name in the trailer?? Du fuk??
Love & Anarchy,Elizabeth Olsen and Jesse Plemmons together in a show? I‚Äôm sold.
Love & Anarchy,I'm looking forward to this.
Love & Anarchy,"Elizabeth Olsen, Lily Rabe, AND Krysten Ritter?? 

This was made for the gays"
Love & Anarchy,"This is just Candy, all over again... jessica biel tv show also set in the same time period, same location, same murder"
Love & Anarchy,"The tv movie from 1990 is still great. ""A Killing in a Small Town"" with Barbara Hershey."
Love & Anarchy,"I was really skeptical, because it seemed to be missing the robots."
Love & Anarchy,WHERE ARE THE ROBOTS?!?
Love & Anarchy,"c'mon HBO, Tokyo Vice when?"
Love & Anarchy,No robots?
Love & Anarchy,"I wonder if the people who were outraged over Netflix's Dahmer will say anything about this. (Unless the distinction is that >!Candy ""only"" murdered one woman with an axe!<)."
Love & Anarchy,Thought it was love death and robots :(
Love & Anarchy,and robots dammit. where are the robots!!
Love & Anarchy,"The casting of the husband was a very...odd choice. Not sure why she would be tempted to have an affair with him.

Hope this goes well for Lizzie though, she has proved to be a good actor."
Love & Anarchy,"Looks good, though not something I'd watch."
Love & Anarchy,She looks like Cyllian Murphy in the thumbnail
Love & Anarchy,boring trailer. good actors so i will try it
Love & Anarchy,I think there was a movie based on this in the 90s
Love & Anarchy,I'm in. üò≥
Love & Anarchy,THey need to bring back Swamp Thing.
Love & Anarchy,"Elizabeth Olsen is brilliant; glad to see her do a non-Marvel, purely drama work, and Jesse Plemons always does such great stuff, from the very serious dramas to weirder stuff."
Love & Anarchy,"Yanderes, not even once."
Love & Anarchy,Is Jesse Plemons... ok?
Love & Anarchy,Would have been interesting to have Paul bettany as the husband she's cheating on
Love & Anarchy,"I like how they only announce Olsens name at the end‚Ä¶ put some goddamn respect on my boy Plemons, HBO, ffs!"
Love & Anarchy,"The show Candy is based on the same story, it was a really good show, strange to me this story is being done again."
Love & Anarchy,"If you look like that, and a woman who looks like that, ever says that to you... She's going to try and manipulate you into murdering her husband or selling government secrets to a foreign power.

Little bit of life advice I've acquired over the years."
Love & Anarchy,Discount Matt Damon is getting some action
Love & Anarchy,I literally mentally inserted robots into the title initially and was very confused about a lot of things.
Love & Anarchy,Elizabeth Olsen in a romance with a robot? That would be too weird.
Love & Anarchy,Right?  Wheres the fucking robots?  Literally.
Love & Anarchy,"They had their own shows. Unfortunately for the robots, Westworld and Raised by Wolves have both been canceled."
Love & Anarchy,My thoughts exactly
Love & Anarchy,"OMG!! When I saw this thread in my email, I saw ‚ÄúLove, Death & Robots‚Äù on HBO Max. I was so confused and upset because I don‚Äôt have a subscription to HBO, and I love that show! I even (thought I) read it multiple times‚Ä¶ Clicked on it, opened it up, looked at it again. Started looking at comments for a while‚Äî Then I finally realized that it was NOT ‚ÄúLove, Death & Robots‚Äù. 
üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Love & Anarchy,"To be fair, there were literally 3 Pinocchio movies last year."
Love & Anarchy,"Yes.

It's happened before, two networks make series based on the exact same story. Both hoping to be the one to release it first."
Love & Anarchy,Thats unBielievable
Love & Anarchy,"Yes, exact same story and it was on Hulu"
Love & Anarchy,"Yeah, but I'm gonna say yes.."
Love & Anarchy,But If evil why hot?
Love & Anarchy,"Listen if you're a grown-ass man who looks like a 12 year old who just ate something he's allergic to, you take what is offered."
Love & Anarchy,"I dunno, I think everything will be fine. At least that's why my brain down there is thinking."
Love & Anarchy,"To quote the sand snakes from game of thrones, while thinking about gone girl

I like a da bad poosay"
Love & Anarchy,"Yea, but bro's fat.  Best piece of action he would get in his whole life."
Love & Anarchy,Didn't they release multiple Ted Bundy movies at the same time? Same thing with Jeffrey Dahmer.
Love & Anarchy,I mean i watched both fyre festival documentaries and loved them both lol
Love & Anarchy,"You can thank the pandemic for that. This one was always meant to come out this year, the Hulu one was meant to come out in early 2020 and star Elisabeth Moss, but she dropped out, so they hired Biel and threw it together because they wanted it for Emmy eligibility last year. Which‚Ä¶backfired on that regard."
Love & Anarchy,"Looked up some more of the cast. Krysten Ritter, Elizabeth Marvel and Patrick Fuget also? Hell yes!"
Love & Anarchy,"The Prestige / The Illusionist

Deep impact / Armageddon

Etc etc"
Love & Anarchy,Yeah I don't question his acting skill but I do kinda question this casting.
Love & Anarchy,"Yeah, physically, Jessica Biel was more into role, but it should be interesting what Elizabeth Olsen brought to this role."
Love & Anarchy,I have Candy in my Disney+ watchlist but now that this is coming out I probably won't bother seeing it.... unless this HBO one gets much worse reviews for some reason.
Love & Anarchy,"When breaking bads last season was on, people started calling him Meth Damon lol

He‚Äôs gained a bit of weight since then so idk if they still call him that."
Love & Anarchy,don't you dare speak about jesse dunst that way!
Love & Anarchy,You're only saying this after having seen his ass in Halo aren't you?
Love & Anarchy,"Netflix released Dahmer. Hulu already aired a mini-series about this last year called Candy with Jessica Biel, though. I don‚Äôt recall there being much blowback despite showing the murder in fairly graphic detail."
Love & Anarchy,I mean that guy is married to Kirsten Dunst in real life
Love & Anarchy,Hey stop this Jesse Plemons disrespect
Love & Anarchy,I thought it was one of the Olsen twins. She‚Äôs never looked more like her sisters than in this thumbnail image.
Love & Anarchy,I was thinking more like a younger Sissy Spacek.
Love & Anarchy,Thought it was Bryce Dallas Howard.
Love & Anarchy,"> life advice I've acquired over the years.

Seems like you also sold somegovernment secrets to foreign powers."
Love & Anarchy,*Or* you're about to lose your kidneys.
Love & Anarchy,Definitely
Love & Anarchy,"uff, yeah, tell me about it"
Love & Anarchy,"you too huh?

i mean, I knew she was sketchy af but i just could not say no...................... i miss her."
Love & Anarchy,He married Kirsten Dunst. Landry did good for himself.
Love & Anarchy,"Fatt Damon. 

(though, to be fair, Jesse Plemons has had enough of a career by now, we should all learn his name)"
Love & Anarchy,Meth Damon getting his dick wet
Love & Anarchy,You lack The Vision
Love & Anarchy,"And all of them had Tom Kenny in it!

One as Pinocchio, another as Gepetto, and the best one, >!as Benito Mussolini!<"
Love & Anarchy,"Pinocchio, so hot right now."
Love & Anarchy,Lies of P is also coming out this year
Love & Anarchy,And the best one was with Pauly Shore.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMn4LinlxY0
Love & Anarchy,And the best one was Guillermo‚Äôs. I‚Äôve decided to ignore the one Disney released.
Love & Anarchy,So true.
Love & Anarchy,"Father, when can I leave to be on my owwwwwwn?"
The Unicorn,"There‚Äôs still the Kevin James one on Netflix- The Crew.

Actually it might be cancelled too."
The Unicorn,We also lost At Home With Amy Sedaris.
The Unicorn,"I loved ""The Unicorn"", at least the 1st season. So warm-hearted and cozy. The characters, I really liked them. 

But with season 2, I felt that the 1st one was already. It's so intense that you just can't go on and on with it."
The Unicorn,I forgot this existed. I found it unwatchable with an IN YOUR FACE laughtrack iirc.
The Unicorn,Oh wow really. Ik amy sedaris lives in NC but didn‚Äôt know she lost her show too.
The Unicorn,"As a huge fan of his, I made it 10 min into the first episode. How is the laughtrack still this popular in the streaming age?"
The Unicorn,Yeah they canceled it this past year. She always mentioned they were in the Research Triangle amongst other NC references. I guess TruTv had to make room for more reruns of Impractical Jokers.
The Unicorn,I wanted Amy Sedaris to guest in Bless the Harts but now it‚Äôs gone after next month.
The Unicorn,"Is this network funded by the US government or something,"
The Unicorn,I love FBI and I'm not old.
The Unicorn,"Alright, I'm really enjoying FBI and FBI: Most Wanted."
The Unicorn,[deleted]
The Unicorn,"Is FBI good? I‚Äôm almost out of quarantine shows.

Also, I‚Äôm surprised the Unicorn got renewed. It‚Äôs not a bad show and Walton Goggins is always great, but I only saw this show because it popped up somewhere (Hulu maybe?) and I caught it."
The Unicorn,You gotta give props to CBS for at least trying to still be a broadcast network in the old sense. The rest of the Big 4 are just a collection of niche shows with one or two 'hits' per network.
The Unicorn,Bull is still on? Has it changed its format at all or is Bull himself still the weakest link?
The Unicorn,How does Weatherly still have this gig?
The Unicorn,Old people love these kinds of shows
The Unicorn,I love old people and I'm the FBI.  Open up
The Unicorn,sure grandma let's get you to bed
The Unicorn,They were given the November timeline in August. But no word on whether they were ok'd to start filming. I bet Jan 2021.
The Unicorn,"I'd say it's good, probably one of the better Dick Wokf shows, tbh. The spin off, FBI:Most Wanted is also pretty good."
The Unicorn,"Oh yeah I'd really recommend it. Its got a great cast who bounce of each other very well, the stories are nothing ground breaking but their enjoyable, tightly written and quite varied, and its got some really tense moments.

I'd also recommend its spin off. I'm sure their are other shows with a similar premise, but watching a manhunt where they know the target but don't know where they are or what their going to do, is kind of a refreshing take on the formula.

Its likewise got a really good cast."
The Unicorn,Bull and Les Moonves are too busy sexually harrasing actresse.s
The Unicorn,I‚Äôm not old and SEAL Team is my guilty pleasure show.
The Unicorn,my mom is hyped....but I have a feeling the pandemic and BLM episodes are going to be pure cringefests
The Unicorn,I dunno what constitutes as old. But I'm 34 and I like SEAL Team. I watched all 3 seasons this month.
The Unicorn,SEAL Team is actually one of my favorite shows currently kicking out seasons.  It gets a bad rap for being on broadcast TV.  Swann's (Datak Tarr of Defiance) subplot was extremely well done.
The Unicorn,"I need Walton Goggins to play the Devil at some point, I just imagine him bartering for some poor bastard's soul at a crossroads. "
The Unicorn,Walton Goggins doesn't get enough credit for the variety of roles he plays and how he plays them all well
The Unicorn,[deleted]
The Unicorn,I would watch Walton Goggins read the newspaper.
The Unicorn,"Walton Goggins should play Spider Jerusalem.

That is all."
The Unicorn,"Fuck, I hate CBS sitcoms but LOVE Walton Goggins..."
The Unicorn,what a waste of talent
The Unicorn,"I'd love to see him as a Batman villain, like Riddler"
The Unicorn,He should be in movies not making lame tv shows for 60 year olds on cbs
The Unicorn,It's good to see Detective Vendrell seeing the success he deserves.
The Unicorn,Damnit Gamby!
The Unicorn,Booooyd!
The Unicorn,The plot for this sounds kinda dumb honestly. 
The Unicorn,Nice to see CBS leaning more into single-cam comedies. Life in Pieces and Young Sheldon are pretty good
The Unicorn,This dudes a great actor. I love his character in Vice Principles on HBO.
The Unicorn,This will get cancelled after one season 
The Unicorn,"Ugh CBS. Here come the shitty laugh tracks.

I love Walton Goggins though so I'll try giving it a chance."
The Unicorn,This man should be making big budget studio movies not starring in sitcoms
The Unicorn,lame. He should be in a cable or streaming drama as the lead.
The Unicorn,Just let it be him freestyling the busted song for 22 minutes. That series drew so much out of him comedically.
The Unicorn,Honestly can't see him doing a comedy but I'm open to it
The Unicorn,Dude's a fantastic actor - please don't waste your time on a lame network sitcom that WILL be cancelled after one season (or less).
The Unicorn,he should be on cable. he's wasted on network tv (heavily censored).
The Unicorn,A CBS comedy seems beneath him.
The Unicorn,I bet this garbage will actually make it to tv while la confidential staring Goggins which sounded really good and had rave reviews didn‚Äôt get picked up.  
The Unicorn,I mean I do love me some Walton Goggins and I really love me some comedy Goggins. The CBS thing concerns me though. They have been constantly missing for me since HIMYM ended. 
The Unicorn,"He won't be making an appearance in the Deadwood movie, right? That would just be a little too perfect."
The Unicorn,I do enjoy Cletus van Damme's performances.
The Unicorn,I need a spin off with Lee Russell or Boyd Crowder!
The Unicorn,That [deadline.com](https://deadline.com) website is an Internet vomit.  fuck.
The Unicorn,Who?
The Unicorn,Someone a few months ago suggested him as the Joker. I think that needs to happen as well. 
The Unicorn,All raised and furrowed eyebrows and southern dandy charm. 
The Unicorn,I just expected him to do a better TV series to follow up Vice Principals. I really hope he makes a guest appearance in The Righteous Gemstones
The Unicorn,He was hilarious in Justified. Being funny outside of a comedy isn‚Äôt easy. 
The Unicorn,He was a convincing mix of comedic and threatening in Ant-Man and the Wasp. 
The Unicorn,Maybe he'll get that CBS money and do movies in the summer 
The Unicorn,I‚Äôm with you on that.
The Unicorn,"Same, but I‚Äôd love a Tarantino script where Walton and Peter Dinklage go back and forth! "
The Unicorn,Watch?
The Unicorn,Damn. That‚Äôs not anything what I had on my mind but I‚Äôve been sitting here pondering it for the last 20 minutes now. Nice blast from the past and I could see him (Goggins) effecting the right voice for it as well. Good call!
The Unicorn,"Wooooooooooooooow

Never thought of that. You‚Äôre fucking spot on. "
The Unicorn,https://i.redd.it/t9k4b48uhk201.gif
The Unicorn,Holy shit how did I never think of this.
The Unicorn,Luckily the guy has talent to spare. Still disappointed he isn't in Tarantinos new film. 
The Unicorn,He deserves a payday.
The Unicorn,Lame sitcoms for 60 year olds is were the big money is at. If you are in a show that gets syndicated you are set for life.
The Unicorn,Louder with Boyd Crowder 
The Unicorn,"It's CBS, I have very low expectations. At least it went back to single cam though. "
The Unicorn,"honestly, 99% of sitcom premises are retarded. Doesn't mean it wont be funny."
The Unicorn,It sounds like it was written for Louis C.K pre-scandal. 
The Unicorn,"You're the first person I've ever seen, on this or any other website, that has anything good to say about Young Sheldon."
The Unicorn,Only because that is what happens when I like something.
The Unicorn,"> Here come the shitty laugh tracks.

As a single-cam it's very unlikely to have a laugh track."
The Unicorn,Watch vice principles. 
The Unicorn,His mouth is wide enough and he has way too many teeth so yes it would work. 
The Unicorn,Make Ben Mendelsohn play the devil. NOW Devil vs Devil battle. 
The Unicorn,I always reserve judgement for comedies like this. The basic premises are always the same but some turn out to be great thanks to good writing
The Unicorn,He was locked into an L.A. Confidential series on CBS that I'm guessing never went anywhere.
The Unicorn,He‚Äôs a natural supporting actor too so that probably wouldn‚Äôt even be too hard. 
The Unicorn,"yep, thanks."
The Unicorn,It has haunted me ever since it popped into my head. He‚Äôd be *spectacular*.
The Unicorn,"Really? That‚Äôs a bummer. I figured between Tarantino, Olyphant, and the L.A. connection to The Shield that he would be a perfect fit in that movie. Maybe channel a little 60‚Äôs Shane Vendrell."
The Unicorn,Probably didn't want Dewey Crowe to get rattled by seeing Boyd there...
The Unicorn,"For reals, Walton Goggins gotta eat. Then when if he gets that fuck you money he can do whatever he wants."
The Unicorn,"Yep, the Big Bang Theory guys are making bank"
The Unicorn,[deleted]
The Unicorn,It gets a bad rap because people think it's like Big Bang Theory.  But it's a sweet little single cam with no annoying laugh track.
The Unicorn,"Tbh I've only seen like one or two episodes, but I've seen a decent amount of positive reactions. "
The Unicorn,Life in Pieces is pretty solid though. Helps that they havr an excellent cast.
The Unicorn,True. The only reason I would watch it is because of Walton goggins 
The Unicorn,"I agree with your sentiment, but this is CBS we are talking about... What even was the last *good* comedy they created? "
The Unicorn,"Oh yeah! I forgot about that, that sounded a lot more interesting than this.

The Parkers,One on one used to be my shit. I could never get enough Kyla Pratt growing up.
The Parkers,Can we get Living Single? And Hangin w/ Mr Cooper?
The Parkers,"Adopted kid (now adult) here - loved LOVED LOVED Sister-Sister! Gave me hope I had a long lost twin. 


I didnt."
The Parkers,"Sister Sister was so good! It lost its way a little when they became ‚Äòcool‚Äô though.  I liked them being dorky.

I‚Äôd put it up there with Sabrina and Teen Angel."
The Parkers,"Sweet, love the classic UPN lineup"
The Parkers,"This is great news , most of these shows didn't even get a DVD release."
The Parkers,No Martin? Fuck.
The Parkers,"I wanted Family Matters ;/ 

But I guess I have enough DVR'd on YTTV anyway"
The Parkers,They need Smart Guy too. That‚Äôs a classic

The Parkers,Justice for my wife and kids
The Parkers,"MO TO THE

The Parkers,"Grew up watching this stuff, Ill probably ignore it with the rest of the stuff on Netflix as I rewatch starship troopers."
The Parkers,Eyyyy!!! Put in Wayans Brothers and Jamie Foxx in there too please
The Parkers,"For all the 1990s-nostalgia we‚Äôve been getting, one thing that was not joining along was the R&B/Black sitcom shows from the WB/UPN from that era. Never figured out why."
The Parkers,"I never realized how much I missed shows like *Moesha*, *The Game*, *The Parkers* and *Sister Sister* until this was announced. This is going to make staying at home a little bit more bearable as it will be very refreshing to be able to watch these shows on demand. I can't even remember the last time I've watched any of them. Great news!"
The Parkers,"Still no In Living Color, bummer"
The Parkers,I feel like In the House should have been on this list.
The Parkers,UPN is coming back
The Parkers,Heeeeeyyyyyyy professa ogleveeeeeeee!!!!
The Parkers,"When I was a kid, I would watch One on One because i had a crush on Kyla Pratt. Didn't like the show at all. But I liked Kyla Pratt.

I used to watch the show Girlfriends almost every Sunday night too. Hated that show, but damn dude. I didn't have cable and there was nothing else on. This was before you could just find any movie or show online. Like a few years before that era started. All the other channels had were infomercials around that time or the news. I think I was in my first year of college or it could have been late high school, I can't even remember honestly. But just thinking about that show right now fills me with the opposite of nostalgia. it fills me with dread. I'm dead inside now days, but holy crap, those days were dreadful. I was failing my college classes. I didnt want to be in school. No direction. Everything just sucked until I started working with my friends.

I remember Moesha being alright. It would come on when i was in middle school and high school I think It'd be on after school and I'd watch it after Toonami was over or Dragon Ball Z was over. I remember it always being Sailor Moon then Dragon Ball Z then Reboot and then some other show I can't remember. But then when they started Gundam shows after DBZ, i'd just watch something else. Eventually they changed up to be Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, and then Dragon Ball Z and some other shows I think. 

I saw glimpses of the other shows, but never watched them that much. i'm a black guy, but none of these shows ever appealed to me. The ""black shows"" that did appeal me were Smart Guy, Steve Harvey Show (the sitcom), My Brother and Me, Family Matters, the Sinbad Show, Good Times, Sanford and Son, Fresh Prince, My Wife and Kids, A Different World, Bernie Mac Show (i dont think this is considered s sitcom though?), Jeffersons, Waynes Bros, Jamie Foxx Show, That's So Raven, What's Happening, Hanging with Mr Cooper, Kenan and Kel, In the House, On Our Own, The Hughleys, and so many more. 

Every 90's kid needs to experience My Brother and Me. ALL the episodes are on Youtube. Download them for later because they'll probably be taken down. here's a random episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI1itsIg32Y It's made of pure 90's."
The Parkers,Wow I‚Äôm surprised Netflix was able to get some of these shows. I guess we have to thank the streaming wars alongside the people for this one.
The Parkers,"I‚Äôm excited for this! I used to love Girlfriends, and never knew why it wasn‚Äôt streaming. Can‚Äôt wait to do a rewatch"
The Parkers,"I'm so excited for the game, but disappointed its only the first 3 seasons. Hopefully they are working on getting the remaining seasons that were on bet."
The Parkers,Great news. Wish they could add Living Single too.
The Parkers,"Man I really wish they would have decided to put on Sister, Sister first but I'll take Moesha with no complaints."
The Parkers,P.S. Check this box if you like Moesha[ _ ]
The Parkers,MO TO THA
The Parkers,"I had a really bad vertigo episode and stupidly went to an urgent care (it's stupid because they didn't do anything for me and told me if it got worse to go to the ER), and while I was sitting in the waiting room trying not to vomit, a random woman was repeatedly playing the opening part of the Sister Sister theme song. Sister Siiiiiiisterrrr. It was stuck in my head for weeks."

One on One,"Ah, when Monique was funny."
Man with a Plan,I feel like letting a focus group have so much input almost guarantees your show will be dog shit.
Man with a Plan,"I feel like ""pam marries joey"" would've been a really effective marketing gimmick."
Man with a Plan,That‚Äôs why actors turn down roles that they sometimes feel will typecast them
Man with a Plan,Typecasting is such a bitch sometimes. Having a starring role that everyone knows you for is great until that role is over and your typecasted into that role again and again
Man with a Plan,Did anyone actually buy Jim's portrayal as Jack Ryan? What's this paper salesman doing in Yemen?!
Man with a Plan,No jokes I legitimately took part in a focus group for this show in Vegas at MGM and remember writing about their lack of chemistry on screen. My only focus group experience so it‚Äôs a trip to see this years later.
Man with a Plan,"Man with a Plan is a weird one for me. I have never seen a single scene from that show or really seen any discussion about that show. I actually still flip through network TV a decent amount, I'll even stop and watch a random new episode of a sitcom I don't know because it just sort of reminds me of being a teenager and that's how you would find new shows on network TV but in 4 years never once did I stubble upon this show (and I watch 2 whole episodes of Kevin Can Wait In That Time Period)

Even weirder is the show wasn't really a ratings disappointment, it just cost more to produce. It's ratings in the 2019-20 season were on par with the 2020-21 ratings for any CBS sitcom that wasn't Young Sheldon or Mom, and it performed better 2 seasons ago than any CBS did this past season."
Man with a Plan,"Man with a Plan is basically ""Pucks"" from Episodes"
Man with a Plan,"Liza Snyder did a great job opposite LeBlanc, I thought they had great chemistry and I enjoyed Man With a Plan. It was pretty low stakes and just fun."
Man with a Plan,She said this [years ago](https://youtu.be/sT6mn-3kqak). I wonder why this is being posted now?
Man with a Plan,"HOLY SHIT I WAS IN THIS FOCUS GROUP. Jenna Fischer was aaaaawful in the pilot. Loved her in the office, but her acting was so so bad in this. I made it very clear that I thought she was not right for the part, and I‚Äôve always wondered what happened to the show."
Man with a Plan,"As much as I like Jenna Fischer, Liza Snyder definitely fit the role better imo


Edit: Liz to liza"
Man with a Plan,Thanks for listening to office ladies podcast.
Man with a Plan,"Today, on ‚Äòhow grown ass adults have trouble telling actors from their characters, and thus can‚Äôt separate reality from fiction‚Äô‚Ä¶"
Man with a Plan,"The problem isn't that Pam wouldn't marry Joey.  The problem is that these studio idiots think focus groups are a great way to cast a show.  

They make tons of money for shit like this.  Geniuses."
Man with a Plan,"Ohhhh.... I can actually contribute.   

I was on a focus group for both this show and Kevin Can Wait.   The other people in the group may have been the most closed minded people I've ever been in a room with.   One guy kept loudly insisting that they needed to recast Kevin James's best friend, because a black friend was unbelievable and made him uncomfortable... especially since the lead character was a retired cop and ""would know better than to be friends with him"".

I can't speak to the re-cast, as we were shown an Erinn Hayes re-shoot... But again, the same guy insisted that Matt Leblanc's character should greet people by saying ""How you doin'?"" each time as new character walked in.  

Creativity dies in focus groups."
Man with a Plan,"I honestly find her so obnoxious and annoying on her podcast. Angela is much more interesting and Jenna constantly has to point out she had a bigger part and was classically trained. Meanwhile, Angela was a much more interesting character."
Man with a Plan,If Jenna Fischer didn't want to be seen as Pam she should stop doing so much office shit. You know why Harrison Ford didn't get typecast as a scifi actor post Starwars? Because he didn't give a shit about Han Solo and has never shown up to a convention
Man with a Plan,Can anyone bitching about how dumb focus groups are make any real case for Jenna Fischer deserving that role? With how little she‚Äôs done since The Office it‚Äôs hard to argue that they missed out on something special by not hiring her.
Man with a Plan,The [Focus Group](https://youtu.be/zwkySqQU8tw)
Man with a Plan,[deleted]
Man with a Plan,I would have actually watched the show if it had Jenna Fischer‚Ä¶
Man with a Plan,"Well that‚Äôs stupid. I watched her sitcom **Splitting Up Together** with Oliver Hudson and wasn‚Äôt exactly thinking ‚Äúwait, why is Pam not with Jim? And when did Adam from Rules of Engagement break up with Jen?‚Äù"
Man with a Plan,"Good thing they listened to the focus group.  Case and point, no one would ever believe Malcom‚Äôs dad would end up as a druglord"
Man with a Plan,Focus groups are the dumbest bunches of motherfuckers on planet earth.  You give a dozen people with nothing to say a platform to guide entertainment based on shit they trump up so they can feel important in the room.  Morons.
Man with a Plan,I do remember a TV critic on twitter stating that Jenna and Matt had the opposite of chemistry.
Man with a Plan,The fact that these executives take stuff like this from focus groups seriously is shockingly out of touch.
Man with a Plan,Owch
Man with a Plan,"Pam would marry Joey, but would start doing pranks with Chandler and leave Joey for him shortly thereafter."
Man with a Plan,"I mean, she married Jim and he‚Äôs just a slightly less goofy version of Joey‚Ä¶"
Man with a Plan,"Detail: But, the actress (Andrea Anders) in the last sitcom ('Joey' not 'Man with a Plan')who did get the part did marry Matt LeBlanc for a while.

Honestly it was a good pairing, but I don't see why Jenna Fischer wouldnt have worked.  


Update: Ah.. apparently, people who were in the actual focus groups said they didnt have chemistry. I could see that."
Man with a Plan,Joey couldn't pack Pam's lunch. (That's more of a sports term than sexual one...you sickos.)
Man with a Plan,"well if she's gonna be typecast as Pam, might as well reveal that she is the one that sent the monsters at Jim and his new wife in A Quiet Place"
Man with a Plan,I don‚Äôt think Jenna Fischer is a good actress so maybe there‚Äôs more to her not getting the role or other roles in general
Man with a Plan,They're right.
Man with a Plan,ugh typecasting is a bitch.  Nice to have the security of a multi year show but there's a price to pay.
Man with a Plan,One of the reasons I negatively associate the Office US is because of its brain dead fans.
Man with a Plan,it‚Äôs like a crossover of the worst fanbases in television history
Man with a Plan,I really like the woman they chose though
Man with a Plan,Focus groups are such scams
Man with a Plan,"The whole concept of a focus group is flawed. When you put a dozen strangers in a room and ask them questions, they're going to tell you what they think is proper to say, not their truth."
Man with a Plan,"They weren't wrong. Leblanc is the Gen X Tony Danza, in which they could only play a version of themselves."
Man with a Plan,So stupid it hurts
Man with a Plan,"I‚Äôm glad that she didn‚Äôt get that role. She was not suited for it. I respect her, but she‚Äôs not the best actress. 

The show she did after The Office, where she and her husband are splitting up but still living together and co-parenting, was not good. She wasn‚Äôt very good in it.

Liza Snyder ended up being a great fit for that role opposite Matt Leblanc. I like good sitcoms, and really liked Man With a Plan. The first couple seasons were really entertaining, and the third was still above average."
Man with a Plan,It‚Äôs astounding to me how consumers of film and television can‚Äôt separate the actors from the roles they play.
Man with a Plan,Jenna only has done office related stuff since the show ended. She type cast herself if you ask me
Man with a Plan,Who the hell is Joey
Man with a Plan,"Honestly, that‚Äôs pretty screwed up just seeing someone as one role solely, but long running TV shows tend to do that. Maybe that‚Äôs why Disney stars become troubled to break the image."
Man with a Plan,I was gonna say‚Äî Old news. She wrote about this in her book about the industry.
Man with a Plan,Don‚Äôt judge an actor because of a roll they played well. Pam is a terrible character in that she plays an anchor that keeps Jim from his potential. She played it perfectly
Man with a Plan,Thusly demonstrating the uselessness of focus groups.
Man with a Plan,so she got fired from a show that puts their faith in focus groups? how is this bad for her career? this seems like the best thing for her.. now she wont have this shitty show on her resume
Man with a Plan,"In all honesty, I really liked the actress they had play the role. My wife and I enjoyed the show, and wish it were still on."
Man with a Plan,"If it‚Äôs a show it makes sense because if general audiences can‚Äôt see the actors together, then the show won‚Äôt work."
Man with a Plan,Whatta you talking bout? Everybody loves Joey! How you doin? üòÇ
Man with a Plan,"This outlines how difficult it is for actors to have a career following a successful TV show. And why focus groups are absolutely worthless, unless you are aiming for forgettable mediocrity."
Man with a Plan,When people take TV characters too seriously....cringe.
Man with a Plan,"focus groups are good, they ensure cars are made without the steering wheels falling off (this was a joke from i think you should leave season 1)"
Man with a Plan,Joey is way too good for that
Man with a Plan,"Well, ""Man With A Plan"" was fine I felt. It was cute and generic, but it also oddly felt like a show that was insanely outdated. I read welcome TV critic who referred to it as ""Matt LeBlanc's Welcome To 1994"""
Man with a Plan,She dodged a bullet.
Man with a Plan,I‚Äôd rather watch a movie staring Pam. Maybe they should have ditched Matt instead
Man with a Plan,She sucks
Man with a Plan,God people are morons‚Ä¶
Man with a Plan,Man With a Plan might be the most generic family sitcom I have ever seen and I am including all of the generic family sitcoms of the '80s.
Man with a Plan,"Well if I ever get my TV show created, then I will be trying my best to get her in a role"
Man with a Plan,Bro i thought Jim wouldn't be able to stop terrorists but here we are.
Man with a Plan,I would have like to see Jenna in that role.
Man with a Plan,Fuck I hate stupid people
Man with a Plan,"So apparently you can just listen to a podcast and report it as news?

I also listen to Office Ladies, I should really be getting paid as it turns out.

EDIT: For the record I‚Äôm not doubting the veracity of the story I‚Äôm commenting on the fact that I listened to the episode and this writer basically just transcribed it to generate content. It‚Äôs a little absurd that that‚Äôs someone‚Äôs paid job."
Man with a Plan,"That seems to have some class and sub-ethnic subtext to it (even though the Adam Burns character is not Italian), but even so good for her. LeBlanc himself could probably have tried to do something a little more original too, particularly after how well he did in Episodes."
Man with a Plan,Focus groups are almost always wrong. Dear fucking God.
Man with a Plan,If it was about the how you doin was too hot for her and they had a physical chemistry and make out every episode wait wtf
Man with a Plan,That and its an awful unfunny show.
Man with a Plan,lol she said this on Wednesday‚Äôs episode of Office Ladies as kind of an aside and now it‚Äôs ‚Äúnews‚Äù. She‚Äôs probably laughing her ass off right now.
Man with a Plan,This is normal.  Actors get pigeonhole all the time from 1 great show they are on and can‚Äôt be seen as any other character.
Man with a Plan,Cool well they‚Äôre playing different characters dipshits
Man with a Plan,"I didn‚Äôt read the article, but the headline means they believe Jenna and Matt are bad actors who are still stuck in their OG personas."
Man with a Plan,I‚Äôve seen too much impractical jokers to have faith in focus groups
Man with a Plan,"God*damn*, I swear they must really go out of their way to find the dumbest motherfuckers alive for these focus groups."
Man with a Plan,"I don't get how people can typecast a person/actor(ess) unless that said person is a terrible performer and they only have one role in them. Few of them have this issue too and this is just sad.

I honestly love it when they challenge themselves and play roles that you just can't imagine them playing. Daniel Radcliffe did it in a great way, went and did wild things from the cookie cutter movies, did plays. Swiss Army Man is probably my favourite film and it's so fucking far out there it's ridiculous he was in it, as a corpse and he was beautiful!"
Man with a Plan,They're losing out now
Man with a Plan,Honestly she would have fit that role
Man with a Plan,"Not sure if im shocked by the news or by the amount of photoshop in her face, she look like someone else..."
Man with a Plan,"Wow almost like focus groups are a stupid waste of time. The whole format forces people to think up criticisms that might be totally unimportant to them. Everybody is trying to come up with something to say (often because they are being paid), so they say stupid shit that they don't even really believe or care about."
Man with a Plan,"Absolute horse shit. People in that focus group would binge watch the office 20 times and foam at the mouth about how much jimbo and pamela belong with each other

They cost her a role"
Man with a Plan,[deleted]
Man with a Plan,The cultural inundation of the Office is disgusting and a real indictment of just how mundane everyone‚Äôs life is
Man with a Plan,People can be so retarded
Man with a Plan,Oh come on that‚Äôs not fair to her. She‚Äôs a great actress and deserves a chance to move on from the show
Man with a Plan,They should ignore the typecasting.  These are actors.  Audiences get used to them in new roles.
Man with a Plan,Why would they typecast her like that üòÇ The Office has been over for years
Man with a Plan,So fuckin cute my lord
Man with a Plan,Joey is a dumdum she deserves way better
Man with a Plan,"That sucks, especially when Matt Leblanc is given so much opportunity and he‚Äôs mediocre at best. She‚Äôs talented."
Man with a Plan,They can also just say she is a terrible actress
Man with a Plan,"Wow, fuck those assholes.

I know it's impossible, but it would be fantastic if these tastemaker fucks got put out on their asses.

I mean, they finally got Ike Perlmutter out, why should the Icy Scythe of Death be the only judge of these fucks?

I really like when actors play completely different characters, particularly if they pull it off well.

Bryan Cranston was the monster in Power Rangers for fuck sake! 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZSjwnX87YY

I'm still waiting for my down to earth magic robot show.

Walter white should have replaced his dealers with putties. They're ultra disposable. And they don't get ideas.

They might not be able to collect money though, no pockets."
Man with a Plan,Only idiots capitalise every fucking word.
Man with a Plan,"Friends was far better than The Office, and Leblanc is a much better actor than Jenna Fischer. There‚Äôs no comparison."
Man with a Plan,tough
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I hope they tackle the recent discovery that people were in fact being held against their will down in Tennessee. It was reported and authorities charged sev sect members who immediately pled guilty to protect the cult from greater scrutiny.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,[deleted]
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Hi Karin!
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"For anyone who hasn't listened to her story, I highly recommend it. I listened to a Joe Rogan podcast where she came on and talked about it, and it's just absolutely bonkers how such a crazy ""religion"" can exist.

I also listened to another Joe Rogan podcast with Ron Miscavige. He's the father of the leader of scientology. He used to believe in it but eventually came to his senses and escaped (yes, ""escaped"", not ""left"").

EDIT: Changed David to Ron. Ron is the father, David is the son and leader. Thanks for the correction ya'll"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Man Leah must be stressed as fuck 24/7. The amount of vitriol and threats coming her way must be staggering. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Fuck Tom Cruise, fucking tooth in the middle of his mouth, scam cult endorsing motherfucker.

- regards, man affected by Scientology"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"It's pretty good because it gets down to the core if the problem which is how they make the people continuously support it. It's remarkable and brave for those who grew up in this 'religion' to separate themselves because they're pretty much cutting themselves off from their while known life, especially their family. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"The leader,  David Miscavige, wife has been ""missing"" since 2007. Another fun fact, hes 5'1""."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Within the first 5 minutes of hearing anyone explain the basis of Scientology, i would think even an average person would mumble something about having forgotten about some appointment and walk away. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Is there any way to watch these online without a cable subscription? I watched the first two episodes on A&E's website when they came out and they were great, but then they quickly put up a paywall."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I'll tell you what, I met Nancy Cartwright. Scientologists are weird as fuck. They take on this persona of non-religious and act like all they want to do is meet people and give out weird books. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,[deleted]
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,If there is anything that will aid in putting the nail in the coffin of this organization it is this show
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I have to wonder why Leah hasn't been found floating face-down in the Hudson River yet.  Scientology don't play.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,[deleted]
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I never knew who Leah Remini was until I read her book Trouble Maker.  Upon reading it I was blown away. She has accomplished some pretty interesting things and lived a unique life. If you want a funny, witty, and insightful look into the life of someone pretty much raised into Scientology, I highly recommend it. I wish her great success in whatever she pursues."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Anyone who is interested in this should watch the podcast she did with Joe Rogan. It's a couple of hours and they really get into all the issues. What I found sad is she was basically born into the Church of Scientology.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,If Catholics / Muslims were doing anything remotely close to what Scientologists are getting away with in the USA people would be at church gates with torches and pitchforks.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Scientology is one of my favourite cults to research next to Lyndon LaRouche's political cult (incidentally LaRouche said Scientology was a dangerous cult that was part of MK Ultra).

I suggest downloading and reading The Bare Faced Messiah if you want a hilarious read about Scientology."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"These show titles keep getting better. I keep waiting to see ""Scientology: a Religion and Cult Miscavage"""
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,WOW! She's really going after them. Good for her. I hope she has security around her because going after a religion is a task!
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"A&E, you should have learned by now. You gotta announce it on a Friday evening so the lawyers that can try to sue are off, allowing you to show it. Oh, and make sure you air it before business hours on Monday."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Hi Karin.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Dont bother trying to read that article on mobile. I almost bought a large diamond ring and new car insurance trying to get the scoop.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Man, COS pissed off the wrong Sicilian. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,[deleted]
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Jehovah's Witnesses are just as bad but hide behind the skirts of Christianity.  Parents have actually been pressured to allow their children to die refusing blood. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Hi Karin!
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Are they doing a second season?
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,The only people watching this show are the people who don't really need to watch h  it
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"See the scary part is that this cult or whatever you want to call it. Financially, they are loaded and have real estate all over the planet.To make this grind to halt you have take their money out of the picture. Not sure how, but basically if you starve it to death...you won't make martyrs out of them. There will always be remnants, leftover factions here and there but it might be the only way to break this gig up.
"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"When you type ""cults in the US"" into google, the first in response list is scientology... Followed by the ku klux klan. Hmm... Interesting. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Well, I hope she has some safe environments for her self...judging by her own words these people are non to be fuzked with."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Can someone explain the ""Hi Karin!"" posts I'm seeing throughout this thread? "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Her AMA was incredible.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,All religions are play on one's fears. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Hopefully they will do expose on the softcore sister to scientology,  LDS or the Mormons"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,FUCK Scientology! The pedophile bastards.

Joe Rogan podcast with Ron Miscavige (father of David, current leader of the cult)
https://youtu.be/FVVdCikBDQk"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Her podcast with Joe Rogan is great to learn about the farce that is modern Scientology
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Another good interview is with Jason Beghe, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHb0BZyF5Ok

I loved the guy in Californication. Fascinating to hear him tell his story."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"http://www.ronmiscavigebook.com/

Wow. David Miscavige created that website to counter his fathers book. Dozens of people in videos bad mouthing Ron."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I heard HBO needed a ton of lawyers when making their documentary on Scientology, because those people will come after you. How has she been able to put a whole show out exposing them?"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,great show and kudos to Leah for helping get the word out 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Hi Karin!
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Having a friend that is/was continually hunted by the Scientologists, I know for a fact that if you hear terrible things about it... Like holding a girl on a boat for 9 years while making her work as a slave... It's true. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I JUST finished listening to the Joe Rogan podcast with Leah Remini as his guest and everything she described sounded sickening.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Is this the king of Queens girl? 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Damn she is hot
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I wonder if we ever going to find out what happened to David miscaviges wife.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Beauty, brains and courage. I love Leah Remini. I like her voice too!"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Leah also did a 2hr and 30(ish)min podcast with Joe Rogan specifically talking about scientology.

Edit: JRE #908"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,You go girl!
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Anyone notice how no one dares ask Tom Cruise about this?  All his Mummy interviews and no one dares bring it up? 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Anyone check out Leah remini on Joe Rogans podcast, good watch"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,We need more people like her to expose the other perverted religions. The mormon cult would be a good place to start.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Can't wait until the church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster gets tax exemptions. Essentially the same thing here. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Fantastic. Thanks for reading it. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Remind me! On May 28
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,RemindMe! 1 week
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I thought this already aired?
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Crazy ppl
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I thought it was [Merchants of Death](http://www.energyenhancement.org/Thank-You-For-Smoking-the-Cabal.jpg)?
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Loved this tv series nothing has really been in public about how horrible Scientology is
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I really want to see this. I find it odd that such a rich and powerful organization who has done a lot of really messed up things has allowed her to make so much noise. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Leah is a truly courageous individual and I am so impressed by her strength of character.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Great show.  Can't wait for more.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Can we get rid of this ridiculous cul- I mean ""religion"" now?"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I'm so intrigued by these stories. Going Clear, My Scientology Movie, and Leah's series have shed so much light on a variety of subjects that only those who actually searched out the incidents would've known about. Now the mainstream public knows a good amount of them. I hope they keep it up, because some of the atrocities need to be learned from."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"She was on the Loop here in Chicago. Truly some fucked up shit that is. The brainwashing in that ""church"" is unreal."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I have never actually thought about watching this series, is it worthwhile? "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Hi Karen!
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,The reason why this cult is so dangerous is because they focus on recruiting very wealthy and famous individuals to bolster their reputation
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I am definitely looking forward to this show. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I would love to see this done for other cults, especially Jehovahs Witnesses "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"No matter how many documentaries I watch or how much I read, I still do not understand Scientology one bit. Was it really a work of fiction the founder made up which people just ran with? Louis Theroux's recent work was an eye opener into their batshit insanity and paranoia. "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Can someone explain to me the whole thing about Scientology and why it is so widely hated? I really do not know much about this and I am curious as to why this religion has the reputation it does.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"[I just heard Joe Rogan interview Remini on his podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ0-VeWMr-A)

Fascinating stuff. I am sucked in now. Podcasts, YouTube videos, and soon books. I want to learn everything about this cult/money laundering organization that has been so successful in masquerading itself as a religion"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I love her, but these ""Scientologists"" will never leave her alone. They'll hound her until she's in her grave.. They have the money for that. Also I watched  a documentary on them, they revel in doing that as well.. I feel for her fight.

But, they'll kill her... They seem that deranged."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,I can't afford to be a Scientologist.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"It's crazy that someone as caring and intelligent as Leah can get sucked in to the toxic cult that is Scientology. Her entire series on it is brilliant. I hope she's doing ok now cause during the show I really got a feel for how much scientology messed her up. 

Also hi Karen "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Happy to see that she's speaking out.  Sad to see that it's her new career.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"So...

Is this called... ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath"" or ""Merchants of Fear""?

Or both?

""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath: Merchants of Fear""

wtf"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"She's the Ayaan Hirsi Ali of Scientology and not because they are women, but how awful those religions treat apostates. She's a hero."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Go Leah !! 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,How am I getting this push notification if I turned push notification s off in my settings?
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"I live in Clearwater, they basically own a few city blocks. Weird stuff."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Anyone interested in this story should listen to her on the Joe Rogan podcast she did recently. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"As a liberal, if Trump went after Scientology, I wouldn't mind looking past the rest of his B.S. He can whip up hate and emnity towards an organization that deserves it, and start taxing those pricks."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,Wow this is the height of subserviency. Fuck these people. Add racism and you've got Nazis.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Hi Karen! 

Leah is badass."
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,This is probably going to be insane.
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"Just started watching this, there are 7 episodes on On-demand  now and Wtf!!!! "
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,What's the name of her original show? Wonder if it's in Netflix. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,"and what has this done for scientology? are people leaving?
"
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,All religion is a cancer on this planet. 
Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,The only difference between a religion and a cult is how long ago the founder was alive.

Half & Half,Dare I say it... can we get the Girlfriends ending we truly deserve. Better yet.. can we get an extra season or 2?
Half & Half,"Seems like Netflix is targeting the ""make my kids watch this old stuff with me"" demographic."
Half & Half,Never knew how much I missed ya
Half & Half,"Sister Sister, YES!"
Half & Half,WE‚ÄôRE THE PARKERSSSSS WE DOING OUR THING ITS A NEW TYPE OF SWING COME JOIN US
Half & Half,One on one used to be my shit. I could never get enough Kyla Pratt growing up.
Half & Half,Can we get Living Single? And Hangin w/ Mr Cooper?
Half & Half,"Adopted kid (now adult) here - loved LOVED LOVED Sister-Sister! Gave me hope I had a long lost twin. 


I didnt."
Half & Half,"Sister Sister was so good! It lost its way a little when they became ‚Äòcool‚Äô though.  I liked them being dorky.

I‚Äôd put it up there with Sabrina and Teen Angel."
Half & Half,"Sweet, love the classic UPN lineup"
Half & Half,"This is great news , most of these shows didn't even get a DVD release."
Half & Half,No Martin? Fuck.
Half & Half,"I wanted Family Matters ;/ 

But I guess I have enough DVR'd on YTTV anyway"
Half & Half,They need Smart Guy too. That‚Äôs a classic
Half & Half,They're bringing th old UPN lineup out
Half & Half,Justice for my wife and kids
Half & Half,"MO TO THE

Half & Half,"Grew up watching this stuff, Ill probably ignore it with the rest of the stuff on Netflix as I rewatch starship troopers."
Half & Half,Eyyyy!!! Put in Wayans Brothers and Jamie Foxx in there too please
Half & Half,"For all the 1990s-nostalgia we‚Äôve been getting, one thing that was not joining along was the R&B/Black sitcom shows from the WB/UPN from that era. Never figured out why."
Half & Half,"I never realized how much I missed shows like *Moesha*, *The Game*, *The Parkers* and *Sister Sister* until this was announced. This is going to make staying at home a little bit more bearable as it will be very refreshing to be able to watch these shows on demand. I can't even remember the last time I've watched any of them. Great news!"
Half & Half,"Still no In Living Color, bummer"
Half & Half,I feel like In the House should have been on this list.
Half & Half,UPN is coming back
Half & Half,Heeeeeyyyyyyy professa ogleveeeeeeee!!!!
Half & Half,"When I was a kid, I would watch One on One because i had a crush on Kyla Pratt. Didn't like the show at all. But I liked Kyla Pratt.

I used to watch the show Girlfriends almost every Sunday night too. Hated that show, but damn dude. I didn't have cable and there was nothing else on. This was before you could just find any movie or show online. Like a few years before that era started. All the other channels had were infomercials around that time or the news. I think I was in my first year of college or it could have been late high school, I can't even remember honestly. But just thinking about that show right now fills me with the opposite of nostalgia. it fills me with dread. I'm dead inside now days, but holy crap, those days were dreadful. I was failing my college classes. I didnt want to be in school. No direction. Everything just sucked until I started working with my friends.

I remember Moesha being alright. It would come on when i was in middle school and high school I think It'd be on after school and I'd watch it after Toonami was over or Dragon Ball Z was over. I remember it always being Sailor Moon then Dragon Ball Z then Reboot and then some other show I can't remember. But then when they started Gundam shows after DBZ, i'd just watch something else. Eventually they changed up to be Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, and then Dragon Ball Z and some other shows I think. 

I saw glimpses of the other shows, but never watched them that much. i'm a black guy, but none of these shows ever appealed to me. The ""black shows"" that did appeal me were Smart Guy, Steve Harvey Show (the sitcom), My Brother and Me, Family Matters, the Sinbad Show, Good Times, Sanford and Son, Fresh Prince, My Wife and Kids, A Different World, Bernie Mac Show (i dont think this is considered s sitcom though?), Jeffersons, Waynes Bros, Jamie Foxx Show, That's So Raven, What's Happening, Hanging with Mr Cooper, Kenan and Kel, In the House, On Our Own, The Hughleys, and so many more. 

Every 90's kid needs to experience My Brother and Me. ALL the episodes are on Youtube. Download them for later because they'll probably be taken down. here's a random episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI1itsIg32Y It's made of pure 90's."
Half & Half,Wow I‚Äôm surprised Netflix was able to get some of these shows. I guess we have to thank the streaming wars alongside the people for this one.
Half & Half,"I‚Äôm excited for this! I used to love Girlfriends, and never knew why it wasn‚Äôt streaming. Can‚Äôt wait to do a rewatch"
Half & Half,"I'm so excited for the game, but disappointed its only the first 3 seasons. Hopefully they are working on getting the remaining seasons that were on bet."
Half & Half,Great news. Wish they could add Living Single too.
Half & Half,"Man I really wish they would have decided to put on Sister, Sister first but I'll take Moesha with no complaints."
Half & Half,P.S. Check this box if you like Moesha[ _ ]
Half & Half,MO TO THA
Half & Half,"I had a really bad vertigo episode and stupidly went to an urgent care (it's stupid because they didn't do anything for me and told me if it got worse to go to the ER), and while I was sitting in the waiting room trying not to vomit, a random woman was repeatedly playing the opening part of the Sister Sister theme song. Sister Siiiiiiisterrrr. It was stuck in my head for weeks."
Half & Half,"Girlfriends will be the first thing I watch 
Tracy Ellis Ross i need not say more"
Half & Half,"Add in Hanging with Mr. Cooper and In the House, and I'll be a happy man."

I only ask because they similarly announced last month that Kingdom (UK) was going to be added in July for the US. It's now going to be added to Canada in August."
Half & Half,I‚Äôm gonna need Hanging with Mr Cooper to be added as well please.
Half & Half,Still waiting on The Wayans Bros
Half & Half,Wake me up when they get _Hangin' with Mr Cooper_
Half & Half,"One on One intro had me hooked a kid, loved the show too, half and half was good as well. Now...saved by the bell anyone?"
Half & Half,"Rachel True was my reason for watching Half and Half, so it looks like it‚Äôll be time to revisit that show once it comes out in October. :)"
Half & Half,"All of these shows sound vaguely familiar, I'm fairly certain they were on a channel called Trouble here in Ireland"
Half & Half,I had the biggest crush on T from the Parker‚Äôs !!! Still waiting on My Wife and Kids.
Half & Half,"Great....

How about they produce a decent comedy? Or pay for one?

B list movies/shows and crappy originals just give people more reason to shut off Netflix and tune in to Hulu/Tv/youtube"
Half & Half,No thanks. Don't want any yelling coming from my t.v..  MmmHmmmm...
Half & Half,Hangin with Mr. Cooper?
Half & Half,WE STILL NEED MARTIN!!!! @netflix
Half & Half,"I thought the good ones were Different Strokes, Family Matters, the Hughleys, Living Single and Martin."
Half & Half,"Who the hell wants to rewatch Sister Sister, I'm so close to canceling Netflix."
Half & Half,"Are these really iconic to the black community though? Or are they simply being added for the color of their skin and not the content of their show? 

Seriously asking because I've never heard of any of these."
Half & Half,Ahhh yes the shows that came on the WB network after cartoons on weekday afternoons growing up. I usually changed over to Fox for Simpsons reruns.
Half & Half,"Oh man, Moesha and Sister Sister was my childhood and I‚Äôm white as snow."
Half & Half,"Sister Sister, Half & Half, One on One... god, they were so formulaic."
Half & Half,Why is that I read the first couple titles and immediately thought the article was gonna be about the lead actress dying
Half & Half,"Ah, when Monique was funny."
Girlfriends,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Girlfriends,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Girlfriends,People are so stupid.
Girlfriends,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Girlfriends,Good. What a POS.
Girlfriends,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Girlfriends,What a gross thing to do.
Girlfriends,Holy fucking loser Batman
Girlfriends,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Girlfriends,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Girlfriends,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Girlfriends,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don‚Äôt miss any of the action.
Girlfriends,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely ü•∫ 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Girlfriends,I hate everything about this headline.
Girlfriends,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Girlfriends,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Girlfriends,Good. Fucking loser
Girlfriends,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Girlfriends,Who and who?
Girlfriends,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Girlfriends,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He‚Äôs a true monster.
Girlfriends,"It‚Äôs crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It‚Äôs a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Girlfriends,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Girlfriends,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Girlfriends,Never heard of him.
Girlfriends,"If he‚Äôs put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he‚Äôll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Girlfriends,As he should. If not more‚Ä¶
Girlfriends,Oh my god that‚Äôs terrible.  Which website was it?
Girlfriends,[removed]
Girlfriends,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky ‚Äúoops, it got leaked‚Äù way."
Girlfriends,Nasty bastard
Girlfriends,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Girlfriends,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Girlfriends,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Girlfriends,Link?
Girlfriends,Maybe don‚Äôt allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Girlfriends,Lame.
Girlfriends,Remindme! 2 hours
Girlfriends,20000 channels here
Girlfriends,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Girlfriends,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Girlfriends,*Sigh*
Girlfriends,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Girlfriends,See ya
Girlfriends,Loozah!
Girlfriends,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can‚Äôt help themselves.
Girlfriends,Good
Girlfriends,"Surely that should be ‚Äòcelebrity‚Äô Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Girlfriends,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Girlfriends,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Girlfriends,What a douche.
Girlfriends,"I remember him watching the, ‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Girlfriends,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Girlfriends,"every brother is big in prison‚Ä¶

have fun."
Girlfriends,Whoa that‚Äôs awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Girlfriends,Picture checks out
Girlfriends,Disgusteng
Girlfriends,Neck tattoos‚Ä¶
Girlfriends,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Girlfriends,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a ‚Äúcelebrity?‚Äù
Girlfriends,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Girlfriends,Both of them are a waste of space
Girlfriends,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Girlfriends,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me‚Äù"
Girlfriends,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Girlfriends,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Girlfriends,He‚Äôs probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Girlfriends,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn‚Äôt already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Girlfriends,How do you know it was rented
Girlfriends,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find your answer
Girlfriends,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Girlfriends,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Girlfriends,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Girlfriends,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so‚Ä¶"
Girlfriends,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Girlfriends,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Girlfriends,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Girlfriends,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Girlfriends,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Girlfriends,Which beckons the question why we‚Äôre giving them more publicity
Girlfriends,He‚Äôll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Girlfriends,Holy shit that guy is huge
Girlfriends,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Girlfriends,The narcissistic wound in public format
Girlfriends,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Girlfriends,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt‚Äôs Creek.

‚ÄúEeew, David.‚Äù"
Girlfriends,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Girlfriends,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Girlfriends,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Girlfriends,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Girlfriends,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‚Äòall in a house‚Äô only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‚Äòa career in being famous‚Äô and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‚Äòjust in a house‚Äô and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‚Äòwashed up‚Äô, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‚Äòfamous‚Äô.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They‚Äôre already ‚Äòscene‚Äô if they‚Äôre hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something‚Äôs who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That‚Äôs the point that it became clear ‚Äòthe kids‚Äô make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Girlfriends,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Girlfriends,"Hilariously, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren‚Äôt becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there‚Äôs no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Girlfriends,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Girlfriends,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Girlfriends,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Girlfriends,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can‚Äôt be more masculine than that!"
Girlfriends,I can't find it
Girlfriends,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
Girlfriends,"But he is also a registered sex offender, and all that entails"
Forged in Fire,"That seems very disrespectful of the time, hard work and care they put into making those blades - especially if this idea were also implemented for the finale where they make the historical weapon.

Also, considering the temperature necessary to melt the metal, that'd be an insane safety hazard. 

It's cool fantasy imagery, I'll admit, but other than that it's not a good idea."
Forged in Fire,I like it better when they recycle the knives in another episode later on.
Forged in Fire,"That is a terrible idea. It would go against the whole idea of the show. 

This isn't a show hosted by Simon Cowells, Gordon Ramseys, or Ann Robinsons.

This is a feel good, interesting, and moderately educational show about a cool hobby."
Forged in Fire,terrible idea
Forged in Fire,"If anyone knew how to do it safely, it would be the people of that show. I can see it being kinda disrespectful, but it's a competition and if you don't win you are a loser, so it's already going to sting whether its thrown into the garbage or MELTED DOWN IN A FIERY PIT OF HELL! 

It would just be so gloriously dramatic!"
Forged in Fire,"> This isn't a show hosted by Simon Cowells, Gordon Ramseys, or Ann Robinsons. 

I actually imagined Gordon Ramsey doing this, so it's funny you mentioned him. XD

But I think people are kinda looking too far into the idea. It's like taking the blade full circle. It started out as metal, got worked, and returns to raw metal. But it seems I'm the only one who thinks so.  


I'd personally rather my blade be melted down instead of someone else in the future potentially re-working it. "
Forged in Fire,"Alright, then let me rephrase that. History would look at that proposal and be all 'Are you fuckin' nuts?' and veto the idea. If not for safety purposes, insurance reasons, copycat worries (They already added the warning at the beginning of episodes because some dumbass nearly burned his house down trying to make a home forge because he watched the show) or whatever. It just would not fly. 

The losing weapons don't get thrown away. They (As well as the winning weapons) get kept by the production company and some are put on the walls as decorations or kept in storage. I think I also remember something about a first round challenge where contestants were told to make something usable out of the weapons that were barely shaped metal pieces from previous first round failures.

Like I mentioned, this is a cool fantasy visual, but there's not a snowball's chance in hell they'd ever do it. Plus, it's a waste of some really cool weaponry, even if they can never be anything but props. "
Forged in Fire,"Yeah I actually remember seeing an episode like that. They had to work with losers' blades. Personally I think it's even more disrespectful to hand someone else's 'crappy' blade off to another smith to make it 'not crappy'. 

Smithing is a tough job, and I doubt you'd get many over-sensitive people. I actually think melting down a loser's blade would be like giving it a warriors death. 

  
But just to be clear I don't think History would ever go for it. I just like the idea. And every time I see people eliminated it bothers me their blade isn't throw into a huge fire pit or forge to be melted down. Just seems like the right thing to do. "
Forged in Fire,"I didn't much care for that idea either. I doubt the original smiths are particularly proud of those pieces, but they're usually what they managed to get done after struggling a lot. That's something to be proud of in itself. Seeing that get molded into something else by someone else has to sting a little.

True, lots of contestants are tough bastards and I doubt they'd get torn up over it (Except maybe the finale weapon. That'd be a bitch) I can also see your views on it being a 'warriors death', kinda like viking funerals. Make a cool tribute or ceremony out of it. 

Many warriors from all over the world and from all time periods were so attached to their weapons and they had such significance in their lives that many were buried with them by their side or in their hands. So, I suppose what's truly respectful is completely in the eyes of the smith. 

Truth be told, I wish the smiths could just keep them. They'd be awesome mementos, even when they're barely more than slabs of metal. The law prevents them from letting them do that, though.

The pit is a cool idea, but what would be done with the melted metal? Mold something out of it or just leave it as a giant mass molten weapon graveyard?....Which sounds really awesome."
Forged in Fire,"> The pit is a cool idea, but what would be done with the melted metal? Mold something out of it or just leave it as a giant mass molten weapon graveyard?....Which sounds really awesome. 

A giant molten mass weapon graveyard would be cool, I wouldn't mind that at all - have ""the season 1 blob"" put on display. Or at the end of each season they could use the metal to pour the Forged in Fire logo for the next season or something cool. "
Forged in Fire,"Pawn Stars is from stock music.

I'm sure FiF is the same."
Forged in Fire,"Awesome, thank you!"
Forged in Fire,"Chris was so frustrating and the show itself did a huge disservice by pandering to his bullshit. He flat out ignored challenges from the start and made whatever the fuck he wanted. The day he made the colored pencils instead of a cartoon CHARACTER which they explicitly said they needed to do he should have been done. It just felt like they decided from the beginning that since he had tons of experience he should win. It was only after he ignored the rules like four times did they actually remove him, which was way too late. 

Chris also emotionally manipulated the judges on more than one occasion to advance. 

Elliot deserved the win. He was the best from day one. 

When you have contests like this the rules need to be adhered to. The best thing about Triple G is the emphasis on gameplay. If you don‚Äôt follow the rules you lose. On Blown Away the rules don‚Äôt apply if you have enough experience."
Forged in Fire,"1. The quality really dropped this season. 

2. Chris came off as an entitled and frustrating person who epitomizes the expression of ‚Äúfailing up.‚Äù

3. Cat was more creative but Elliott was plainly more skilled. 

4. Those judges sure don‚Äôt have much charisma. 

5. Nao was a bright spot in a rough season!"
Forged in Fire,"I enjoy this show overall, even though the judges can be terribly inconsistent and pieces took a dive in quality this season.

I was also very annoyed with Chris and glad to see him cut. They obviously kept him around because he is apparently a big shot in the glass blowing community and they wanted the competition in later rounds. 

Anyone else who completely ignored the theme and requirements of the round was cut last season. They gave him special treatment because of his apparent status. The guy is a total douchenozzle and should have been eliminated at the cartoon round, and possibly at the centerpiece round too. I felt disgusted when he started being emotionally manipulative with his sob story to avoid being cut. His might have been the worst AGAIN with the socks during the fashion round. He might have creative technical approaches, but showed limited vision with his concepts. His ""letters to his mom"" piece was the only thing that really stood out to me.

The best glassblower in terms of a mix of creativity and skill won this time I thought, but it still felt like amateur hour compared to last season."
Forged in Fire,"Just finished Season 2. I am biased in liking Cat‚Äôs final installation more - I enjoyed her style of glass blowing and her personality won me over, but Elliot is also incredibly talented. A deserving two finalists."
Forged in Fire,"I like seeing these blowers in action but I really hate the production of this show.  The judges/hosts are stilted, the editing is too rushed.  You get like no time to actually look at the pieces, and the thoughts & criticisms given by the judges are *so* unbelievably bad/shallow.  Also glassblowing clearly *doesnt* work as a rushed competition... Glass breaks, often.  This would be a way better show if each contested had a few days to work on their pieces, even if that just included extra time for planning.  I don't know if it's just the editing but it always seems like because of the time limit they always make the first idea they get, which is like, not how good art is made lol.  Not to mention with the amount of breakage/failure that is likely with glassblowing, they should really have more of a chance to complete the work."
Forged in Fire,Anyone think that elliotts hat and tie was unreal and shouldve won? I felt that cats Egyptian thing was good but needed to be huge or draped to show itself better. Idk the hat and tie made my jaw drop
Forged in Fire,"I haven't watched season 1 yet but overall I'm quite like this season. Elliot is the right and predictable winner. The only problems I have are:

1. The show gave Chris the free out of jail card too many times. He can do whatever he wants and tries to come up with some bullshit explanations then the judge will let him pass. The worst is the perfume episode, he made such a fugly piece, one of the most ugly pieces of the season and guess what? It's a non elimination episode. The centerpiece is also so bad, if the hand shape is actually look like a hand then it can be kinda cool but nope, the execution is just straight fugly
2. It seem like the quality drop in the second half of the season so my excitement is also drop, like the top 3 episode with fire theme, all pieces are kinda meh, even Elliot's"
Forged in Fire,"When Chris still got through to the next round in episode 8, I was so pissed off. The judges were only negative about his work. Like wtf. 

This guy should have been kicked out the day he fake cried about his dad."
Forged in Fire,Does anyone else feel like Andi was robbed because Katherine decided she didn't like her for some reason? The critiques she got about her megaphones were ridiculous!
Forged in Fire,I‚Äôm scared to read through the posts so it‚Äôs not spoiled since I haven‚Äôt finished so I am making a new post. I CANNOT BELIEVE Jason got eliminated during the cartoon challenge. To me his idea made so much sense and Chris‚Äô piece didn‚Äôt even follow the prompt. It bums me out watching shows like these because the peoples work is amazing but the judging is annoying.
Forged in Fire,"I wish there were more people talking about how much they liked Elliot's work and less time talking about how much they hated Chris.

Elliot is obviously a sculptor and every single piece was good. He is probably also great at making the more abstract pieces that others made, so I would have liked to see more of that. Beyond that, he made really fun, well-executed, professional pieces. He made it seem so easy too."
Forged in Fire,"It's so frustrating and annoying watching this show because every week when they choose a winner it's CLEAR they are making it so that ""everyone gets a chance to win"". Like oh my god it's a COMPETITION. This isn't a 7th grade talent show. 

If they were picking based on the best piece, Elliot would have won almost every week in a row (Chris maybe a few times). I'm only on episode 5, but the cartoon character one that Cat won and the center-piece competition that Nao won was just disappointing. The show wants to make it so that different people win each week. Elliot was ROBBED."
Forged in Fire,Cris was odious but honestly one of my favorite parts of the whole season were all the cut scenes of Andi's hair slo-mo blowing in the wind.
Forged in Fire,[deleted]
Forged in Fire,"The judges are complete baffoons, when it was the final three i was so over it I threw my remote at my tv, ‚Äúcat and Chris are thinking about it too literal, Elliot is too cartoony‚Äù well then wtf do you want?!"
Forged in Fire,This show is awesome but the judges are snoody and the elimination rules are nonsensical. You can win 3 weeks in a row and still be in danger of leaving.
Forged in Fire,"I really wanted Cat to win and hope she gets a big break out of the show irrespective of the loss. I think she consistently put herself out there and expressed a lot of her vulnerabilities through her art. On top of all that, she‚Äôs so cheerful despite having had what sounds like a really tough life. Also, her last piece was very well thought-out and intense.  

Elliot is, of course, very skilled and has some really cool ideas - but his pieces lack heart. That spilled milk piece especially really missed the brief and was kind of disrespectful to the theme."
Forged in Fire,"Chris is this show's Kale Frost from Lego Masters Australia. Insufferable narcissists, but skilled enough to avoid being eliminated. Talking about yourself in third person should be illegal."
Forged in Fire,"Just binged Season 2 and I share a lot of what others have said on here. I was pretty sad to see Nao go - I really liked her work and her bag was definitely better than the socks...
But also something I caught myself doing more and more throughout S2 was rolling my eyes at Cat's reasons for she deserves to win. Some of her pieces were awesome, some (unisex ballsack perfume bottle and vacuum) didn't really do it for me - but, of course, this is all subjective. What irked me the most was when she said something along the lines of ""these 2 (Chris & Elliot) already have exposure so that's why I deserve the win."" In the end, it is about skill/design and not about who has the saddest story or least exposure. I do applaud her for being self taught and taking risks throughout the season, and hope that her being on the show really boosts her exposure."
Forged in Fire,This show is the most racist pos show ever. A black guy was on there scared to death because he was a black guy and then boom he loses to a white idiot that made pencils when the challenge was to make a cartoon character. Netflix shows project just how racist their creators are and it was clearly demonstrated in full display for people to see. I hope this show gets canceled.
Forged in Fire,"Elliott is extremely talented, absolutely had the most consistently beautiful and high quality work from the jump and I do believe he deserved to win. But I find him so pretentious and annoying, it's hard to watch towards the end of the season when there's less people so more Elliott. I'm all for being aware of social issues and incorporating that into your art and general way of thinking but every single piece was some holier than thou bullshit, even his spilled milk sculpture. Over him, but love his glass."
Forged in Fire,"I haven‚Äôt watched season 1 yet and to me this seems like a fun casual watch. Art and reality tv probably doesn‚Äôt mix too well in the first so I think everyone should take these evaluations with way more than a grain of salt. Elliot, Nao, and Cat were all fun to have hope they have successful careers."
Forged in Fire,"I actually thought season 2 was better, although that may be because I loath Deborah (I actually skipped as much of her dialogue in her s2 episode as possible).   
In general, the artists were a lot more evenly matched, and the challenges were less sculpting-heavy, which I appreciate because making exquisite blown pieces is a very different skill set than making glass sculptures, IMO."
Forged in Fire,"I am about to start this season. I have an interest in glass blowing because I smoke marijuana and custom made glass pipes are a big thing in the industry. I like to collect pieces from my favorite artists. I dont have a ton of pieces but I have somewhere between 4-6k in glass. Most expensive piece retailed for $1,200. So while Im not some snobby glass connoisseur... I still follow techniques, color use, etc etc.

And with all that said... I find this show to be so boring for a subject matter Im willing to spend all my extra money on. 

Last season I found... the one guy who was doing like, characters wasnt very good and Id put him below most of the artists that Ive bought pieces from. Another was woke af and spent their entire time making glass potatoes then saying its how they seem themselves. 

The one decent artists I liked was doing techniques I at least have heard of.

I work at a medical marijuana dispensary and all my coworkers have seen a couple episodes but ultimately said the show sucked.

I hope going forward each challenge they have to make something that we see daily made of glass. 

Maybe first and easiest challenge is making a pendant. Anything you want that can fit on a string and go around your neck. Let them show what techniques they actually know. 

Second challenge could be a glass mug.

Then keep scaling it up. Maybe they have to make a lightbulb one challenge. Maybe another they have to make a ""table centerpiece"", and another could be a pitcher with top. 

I just found all the odd challenges that resulted in people trying to think outside the box left us with some really lame pieces. My mind keeps going back to the woke af glass sausages and glass pan thing and I was just scratching my head like ""what the actual fuck...."""
Forged in Fire,I didnt actually read the post because I was worried it might spoil some thing. I didnt get far through it. I stopped where you said season 2 they seemed less skilled. I thought season 1 lacked a lot of skill. Oh boy.
Forged in Fire,"I was expecting a lot of more cut-throat completion like Forged in Fire is. But they turned it into a feel-good self pat. also, how can they stay so calm all the time while working?  feels highly edited."
Forged in Fire,"In my opinion i don‚Äôt believe Cat deserved to make it as far as she did, there‚Äôs a whole bunch of emotional appeal which I found to be annoying. Chris even though he was very entitled I found him to be a very simple and minimal person and the show producers made him out to be the bad guy who had a bunch of experience, maybe i‚Äôm wrong but I believe it should of been elliot vs chris in the finale."
Forged in Fire,"I was annoyed with Chris in this season. My favorite contestants were Mike, Cat, and Elliot. What do you guys think about Cat?"
Forged in Fire,"Y‚Äôall can say whatever about his personality (and I probably agree), but the reason Chris didn‚Äôt get out is because technical ability was a part of the judging and he is damn talented with the fancy techniques"
Forged in Fire,I think Cat should‚Äôve won the second season. Her pieces had more meaning and were more interesting to look at imo
Forged in Fire,Elliot‚Äôs cookie jar in the household items challenge was an absolute masterpiece! I couldn‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt win. Maybe the judges did not wanted to give him back to back wins but the cookie jar / ashtray was so SO impressive.
Forged in Fire,"Yes! I noticed in one challenge he had one of the worst pieces, but then when the judges asked him what it was about he started crying and the judges were like ‚Äúthank you for being so brave and opening up to us‚Äù..."
Forged in Fire,"He also recreated an old piece of his and tried to sell it as the one about himself...

https://academicaffairs.risd.edu/2016/10/taylor-featured-at-1969-gallery-and-aldrich-contemporary-art-museum/"
Forged in Fire,"I agree Chris was frustrating, but as the season continued I found I really enjoyed getting to see all the interesting techniques he used like the French pull saran-wrap, the cracked journal, and the glass springs. The other contestants didn't do stuff like that. So I'm glad he stuck around even though he didn't really deserve to, and I'm also glad he didn't win."
Forged in Fire,"Chris was very talented technically... but he should have been out in the cartoon character episode for not following the brief. I watch great british bakeoff... and for that show it doesn't matter if you're the best baker. If you dont follow the brief, you're out.

The second time he did the brief a disservice was the high fashion one. Nao should've stayed on 100%"
Forged in Fire,[deleted]
Forged in Fire,"After finishing season 2 I started season 1 again.


The first guest judge is Chris Taylor...."
Forged in Fire,They did this last season too. They just want the best technical artists to stay to the end. Really bothered me.
Forged in Fire,He should‚Äôve gotten sent home multiple times but the producers kept him on for drama change my mind
Forged in Fire,"I agree completely but I think Elliot is also more creative than cat. I feel like cat created amorphous structures then came up with some made-up ""meaning"" after the fact. For example, I think Elliot's candy dish was way better than cat's plain bowls - she just made multiple of them...Also, I think Elliot's Mr. Noteworthy was much more creative than Cat's vacuum.  

I think for the last episode it was a clear-cut win. Even before they made their pieces, i knew Elliot was going to win.  I wish they put someone who was more skilled to go up against him. I know everyone hates Chris (and me too) but he is very technically skilled and it would have been more interesting."
Forged in Fire,"Chris was an asshole the length of the entire show.  His skill is there, but he straight-up ignored almost all of the briefs, and yes, that should be an automatic elimination.  He never should have made it past episode 3."
Forged in Fire,"Believe it or not, the majority of pieces I saw this time around were way, way more technical, IIRC. I don't remember seeing much cane work or  Murrine, and, though I did dislike Chris's shenanigans, he did have some insane techniques, like replicating plastic wrap on the iceberg packaging. I also agree on him leaving on the cartoon animal challenge, though it clearly wasn't his personality or skill set."
Forged in Fire,"I totally agree! I definitely connected with Cat more, so I‚Äôm biased. But I do think that she evolved the most out of the two, and Elliot‚Äôs ‚ÄòSpilled Milk‚Äô piece just bugged me on an emotional level. For someone with a psych degree I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be so dismissive of his own emotions/struggles!"
Forged in Fire,I liked her exhibit a lot and it was very creative but there was no skill involved from what I can tell. Just make whatever you want and hang it up and let the viewer interpret it. Maybe that played a part in the decision? I also have zero knowledge about glass so I'm just guessing.
Forged in Fire,"totally agree, sometimes the judges would try to get a guest to say something off....like when they had bobby from the fab five on and they asked him who needs a makeover?? 

The edit is an absolute mess. 

Also giving them time to breathe, plan, and execute what they wanted to a degree and then recover from challenges would make for a better experience as a viewer."
Forged in Fire,"Completely agree! Thought that was one of the best pieces he‚Äôs made! Particularly the tie!! 

The Egyptian piece was a great idea, but I felt like the execution was pretty poor actually."
Forged in Fire,Yeah I couldn‚Äôt agree more. That hat and tie was  so sick and I want that set. Love that he matched the inside pattern
Forged in Fire,Okay I agree that Chris got a few free passes but i actually think the non-elimination perfume episode was to save Cat instead of Chris. Both judges (excluding the narrator guy) didn't like it and critiqued her armour bottles more than Chris'.
Forged in Fire,"I didn‚Äôt love everything that Andi did (I didn‚Äôt really understand the centerpiece with the polar bears), but I LOVED the megaphones."
Forged in Fire,"Also that episode elliot COMPLETELY missed the point. The point was to open up. He said ‚Äú i just wanted to dismiss what i went through compared to others‚Äù 
Not saying he wasn‚Äôt talented but that challenge went over his head and should have been eliminated for it. But then again chris also did whatever  he wanted ignoring the brief and somehow survived for so long so i was not that surprised."
Forged in Fire,It. Gets. Worse.
Forged in Fire,This is where I thought Chris should‚Äôve been kicked! It gets way worse
Forged in Fire,"What should‚Äôve won instead of Nao? Her design was minimalist, had utility, and was even a little elegant."
Forged in Fire,I also think they choose winners not based on who actually made the best pieces but I completely disagree with you on the Character challenge. I loved the vacuum and it deserved to win IMO.
Forged in Fire,"Um, keep watching."
Forged in Fire,"Those were the most beautiful shots of the show, hands down."
Forged in Fire,"I agree!
I wish for the finals they would have something like 2 days. So that they could really flourish their artistry without having to worry all the time about time constraints."
Forged in Fire,All the episodes are too short. It's kinda nice being able to binge it but I want more. They spend like 3 seconds looking at the finished pieces each episode. Do a 360 shot or something so I can see what the show just spent 20 minutes building up to.
Forged in Fire,Bro FACTS. Ffs the lengthy lady was so critical to the point that there is absolutely no knowing what piece she is going to shit on. She finds the most arbitrary reasons to criticize their work.
Forged in Fire,And it seemed as if they talked sooo much shit about Elliot's piece....then he won. Like wat
Forged in Fire,"I agree that Cat's personality was so refreshing and bubbly. I love her character so much - she has charisma.

But overall, I think Elliot's pieces were superior. A lot of people interpreted Elliot's spilled milk piece as being pretentious or disrespectful but I truly don't think that was his intention. I think he recognized other contestants have gone through a lot in their lives (ex. Chris losing his mother), and he didn't feel like his problems could compare to it. The spilled milk was symbolic. Yes, it wasn't very ""deep or emotional"" but I don't think it was disrespectful.  He could've made something else and fabricated a whole story to garner sympathy. So i actually respect him a lot for not doing that."
Forged in Fire,On top of giving a great opinion I have now a new show to binge!
Forged in Fire,"I don't want the show to get cancelled per se, but they do need to deal with that because fucked up shit like this was simply infuriating. I thought Jason's piece that week was actually pretty cute and yeah Chris didn't even attempt to follow the rules. They just let the old white man ""with sooo much experience"" keep going despite the fact that aside from technical feats, he was subpar."
Forged in Fire,"Yeah, his holier than thou final installation about.... Being insecure and not good enough for the challenge?"
Forged in Fire,Want to show us some of your glass pieces? I‚Äôm sure people would enjoy!
Forged in Fire,"Don‚Äôt worry, no spoilers!"
Forged in Fire,I enjoyed the second season. I binged both seasons in like 2.5 days. The first season was better but the winner of the first season was pretty insufferable as a person although she was talented. I still think if they took the body of work into account Janusz should have won. I think Deborah also emotionally manipulated the judges in the end of season one although not to that extents that Chris did.
Forged in Fire,"That‚Äôs a big Oof. 

Isn‚Äôt that plagiarism?"
Forged in Fire,"I found his piece better, but it wasn‚Äôt even what he intended. It came out that way because he broke it in the annealer! Haha"
Forged in Fire,He also stole from Kat for the fire piece - Looked over and decided to scrap his camp fire idea to try and create a better version of hers.
Forged in Fire,wait what?! that's so weird. I found it odd how they brought contestants from season 1 who lost to come in and judge season 2. It makes sense that Deborah was a judge because she won. But why would the contestants who lost season 1 be qualified to judge other contestants?
Forged in Fire,"Is it the same Chris Taylor?
He looked very very different, but then again...how many Chris Taylor‚Äôs can there be in the glass blowing community."
Forged in Fire,"Although, if that was the case, I think Alexander should‚Äôve stayed for the final. He deserved it more than Janusz, who screwed up on the last two challenges."
Forged in Fire,While I like Elliot I highly disagree with Cat coming up with half assed explanations her final piece about her bubbly and positive headspace with anxiety being hidden with in seemed to sum her up perfectly
Forged in Fire,"Yeah, Chris really shit the bed with his fire piece. He liked to evade the themes and count himself clever ‚Äî it finally caught up with him. I had a feeling Deb wasn‚Äôt going to buy his ‚ÄúTrust me, I‚Äôm the best‚Äù schtick. It‚Äôs sorta too bad, I think an Elliot and Chris finale would have been better."
Forged in Fire,"That's because he came in and basically recreated old pieces and tried to pigeonhole them into the brief...like this one supposedly meant to be about himself

https://academicaffairs.risd.edu/2016/10/taylor-featured-at-1969-gallery-and-aldrich-contemporary-art-museum/"
Forged in Fire,Exactly!! I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt kick him off for that. Seemed so unfair to the other guy.
Forged in Fire,"But maybe the fact he has a psych degree is precisely WHY he is dismissive of his own struggles. Because he's heard the struggles that other people go through and doesn't think his can compare. I volunteer at a helpline where people chat in to talk about their life problems or when they are in a crisis situation. And honestly I relate to Elliot's spilled milk piece a lot. I'm finishing off my psych/neuroscience degree and even I view my problems in a similar way.  I think my struggles are valid and I deal with them in private. But when they guy next to you is talking about how is mother passed away, you don't really want to bring up that your 'boyfriend just broke up with you and it's been really hard'. you know?"
Forged in Fire,"Ah, I really had a problem with the judging in that one, they were like ""show us how you feel"" and when he did it was ""no not like that"". Not to make a bad pun, but it reaaaally feels like they were trying to milk the contestants' trauma in this one.

I relate to his piece because that was also how I felt about shit in my life at some point, and it can be very liberating to just take some distance with your issues. To me it wasn't hopeless, it was hopeful because it meant that you can take a step back and get your head out of the water.

Either way I found it INCREDIBLY hypocritical of them to ask the contestants to open up and blame one for doing so. You can't ask ""show us your trauma for views :)"" and then complain that someone... Manages their mental health in a way? It felt very ""sorry, you should be more hurt"". While the comments about toxic masculinity were interesting, I don't think you can judge how someone manages their hurt if they're not hurting anyone. 

Also it looked dope"
Forged in Fire,"Oh yes, for me beside Elliot and Nao, all other pieces are so ugly. At the end of the episode I expect them to be punished in some way, like participating in a sudden death round. 

I was actually very excited for Cat‚Äôs piece based on her technique and she describe it as ‚Äúunisex‚Äù. Then the final product is a ball sack.  What the hell Cat?"
Forged in Fire,Obviously Elliot!
Forged in Fire,"And I also quite liked Nao‚Äôs centerpiece to be fair. It was eclectic, functional and multipurpose"
Forged in Fire,"you think the vacuum cleaner deserved to win over Mr. Noteworthy?? Mr. Noteworthy was so creative, it was a completely invented character and there was meaning behind it - the fact people are surveilled. The other one was a vacuum cleaner with googly eyes....Also you have to admit the technique of Elliot's piece looked so much cleaner and sophisticated"
Forged in Fire,"i finished it, i'm glad they came to their senses in the end but I still think he should've won way more challenged throughout"
Forged in Fire,I find they spend too little time on the presentation. Maybe give the artists a chance to talk about their art more. Sometimes they even skipped some of the final pieces.
Forged in Fire,"FOR REAL, i had to pause the episode when they showed the final pieces every time to actually be able to look at them."
Forged in Fire,"Thank you for your perspective. I get what you‚Äôre saying about how it‚Äôs good that he didn‚Äôt make up something just for the sake of the show. However, I still feel that there was perhaps a better analogy to be made there? I guess it was just shocking for the audience considering how the same artist came up with that layered and inventive dung beetle sculpture. 

And of course, Elliot seems to be much more of a *pro* than Cat - but I guess her pieces really spoke to me in a way that Elliot‚Äôs didn‚Äôt. Which also kind of goes to show how subjective these things can be, I suppose. I just hope things work out for her. üòä"
Forged in Fire,"Lego Masters is great! Apart from Kale, Australia is much more chill than the US version, but both are good fun."
Evil,"I played most RE games. They shine in the atmosphere and gameplay departments, not in plots and relationships. The story each game offers is at best entertaining without an emotional depth. 

Creating an amazing RE show will require you to create an amazing plot from scratch."
Evil,"There's more nuance here than what you imply. Last of Us was practically tailor-made to be adapted to live action. The thing is steeped in cinematic techniques. Some even criticize that aspect of it, saying games like that are too much like playable movies. It's something Hollywood can easily wrap its head around. As such it's no surprise that it made for a good (or at least faithful) adaptation."
Evil,"My brother in Umbrella Corp, are you really comparing the narrative source material of TLOU to Resident Evil?"
Evil,I think the Last of Us proves that a video game should only follow the source material when the source material already plays like a movie.
Evil,">  If anything, The Last of Us show has disproved any doubt that a video game adaptation needs to follow the SOURCE MATERIAL.

Not at all... there is plenty of shit source material that should NOT be translated to TV. 

Last of Us was already a good story that had to be adapted. Some games absolutely do not need to be remade shot for shot lol, especially half the resident evil games which had plots closer to a  bingo board.

If anything we need to ditch source material and just create new stories in established worlds. I already played the games, i know what happens - show us something new with new characters."
Evil,"This stems from 

A. Last of us has a practical Oscar winning script in a fucking game.

B. Resident evil has a literal by the books barely there storyline that has been shit on so many times and retconned alot of plot points later on.

Having said that I DO love the show but I have more complaints than I would like to have with the adaptation, but it IS comparatively better than any Resident evil movie adaptation by a long shot.

The cast of the show is great and can all act, but certain plot devices/story moments are taken in a different (not always good) direction imo.

Definitely a 9/10 tho for sure"
Evil,[deleted]
Evil,"The Last of Us video games are already extremely well written stories with well written characters that hold up against any other medium. Most video game stories, even the games that are known for their great stories, are not really amazing compared to other mediums. Most video game stories aren't anything special once you remove the gameplay and player agency from the equation. This is why game adaptations don't work very often."
Evil,"I thought Welcome to Raccoon City was alright. It was a stupid little Zombie flick, and I honestly don't expect much more from a RE adaptation.
Would I watch it a second time? Probs not. Did I have a good time looking for all the easter eggs? Definitely. (Now that I'm writing this I actually might rewatch it and turn the easter egg hunt into a drinking game lol)"
Evil,"To be fair, the last of us game gave the show a clear outline to follow when it comes to dialogue and story.  Resident Evil had the worst cutscene dialogue possible to adapt for tv or movies."
Evil,"People crap on that first movie, but they had to jettison ""authenticity"" to save the movie.

Romero's take was 100 times worse.

They made the protagonist a new character, because adapting Chris or Jill was not going to work back then.

Could it be done now? Maybe. But even the sequels screwed that up. Wentworth Miller tried so hard. :(

I remember at the time people complaining the UMBRELLA team were wearing STARS uniforms, but Umbrella would TOTALLY DO THAT.

The disappearing bodies were a fantastic joke about the original playstation's memory limitations.

Beyond that, any of the other stink was SONY. They've got more movie producers than talent."
Evil,I love the Resident Evil Movies.
Evil,[removed]
Evil,"To be real most of the stories arent that great to translate into a movie. Something might be possible to make, but i feel if they did try again they do 7. Much smaller cast to have to write dialogue for, nothing super. And given the nature they have multiple types of villains and scares (you go from crazy hillbilly, insect queen, a hillbilly silence of the lamb, to psychological)."
Evil,RE games don‚Äôt have good plots and need to be altered for adaptation. TLOU has a plot that could‚Äôve won best picture and changing it would be risky.
Evil,"The Last of Us has much better source material, though. It was easier to adapt because it was already a cinematic experience. 

The more recent Resident Evils that are less action gameplay focused would be closer to The Last of Us in ease to adapt"
Evil,"Something to keep in mind is that Neil Druckman himself is directing the last of us series, whereas most video games IP gets sold off to big studios who have no idea wtf they‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt actually like/care about the source material that much. RE movies had little to no interest in being congruent with the games, same with that monster hunter movie that was a weird isekai about us marines or something.?? Not a video game but shinichiro watanabe wasn‚Äôt involved in the Netflix adaptation of cowboy bebop at all and he says he couldn‚Äôt make it through the first episode lol

Edit: the Witcher show is another obvious example"
Evil,"It‚Äôs HBO, they could make a show from Pong and it would be good.  Though it does help that Last of Us is story driven."
Evil,"The Resident Evil games are written as campy, B-movie schlock early on. It's not on the same level of writing, game direction, and tone as The Last of Us

So a RE adaptation just does not have a strong enough source material as a foundation that would elevate it to prestige tv writing"
Evil,"The problem is TLOU has a phenomenal plot, dialogue and storyline. RE doesn't. RE is atmosphere, only."
Evil,reisdent evil games are written like cheesy b-movies. the last of us was always written as a prestige hbo show. stop regurgitating this stupid bs.
Evil,"Last of Us already had a great story and characters, it was just a matter of finding a studio willing to pay what it would cost to create the world and a creative team with the talent to bring it to life, everything else is right there in the game. Resident Evil, on the other hand is still more than anything just an action survival horror video game with archetype characters and a storyline that revolves around solving puzzles and reading notes. A creative team can recreate the look of the locations and characters but everything else falls on them in scripting."
Evil,It makes me feel the opposite - now there‚Äôs a great model/template that other adaptations can follow if they want to be successful.
Evil,I wish they would have put more effort into Welcome to Racoon city. It was a lot closer to the games but the cast was bland and it had that low budget feel to it.
Evil,Two vastly different franchises
Evil,"I think you could make a great rec movie but you'd have to lean into the b movie aspects of the games, I think physical effects, paired down action would make a great re game.
That said I feel like silent Hill fans have been disrespected even worse, silent Hill 2 could make a great somber/serious horror film, but the movie lens into action and if I render correctly completely bungled the lore"
Evil,"I feel you, but RE is total Z-level horror shlock and proud of it. It's one of these games like the Mario ones, gameplay first, whatever plot late. Impossible to adapt, basically, whereas TLOU is the opposite"
Evil,"I don't wanna break it to you but narratively the Resident evil games are fuckin batshit and TLOU works because it's grounded and therefor the real visuals and humans acting it out works. 

For Resident Evil? Idk, a few of the stories are solid but a lot of the franchise is both narratively fuckin awful and so out there and ridiculous that they could never do SEASONS based on any of the later games.

And to also equally talk shit about TLOU. 

That game is a mid tier videogame cut in half by a solid movie that plays between levels and during some sequences they both happen. 

Most of TLOU is just PURE narrative and nothing else."
Evil,"I'm saying this as a fan of resident evil: these games from a story perspective are at their VERY best campy, shlocky, silly, stupid fun. An accurate Resident Evil adaptation would just about be a so-bad-its-good silly ass piece of crap, and in that regard the RE movies are JUST that, even if they're entirely inaccurate to the events of the games.

Now, I'm not saying you couldn't make a good RE movie- you could adapt Resident Evil 4 and just lean super hard into it being a campy spy movie (but with zombies). Cast Joel McHale as Leon and Nicholas Cage as Saddler, throw in some halfway decent action. I think you'd come out the other end with a watchable action movie. But trying to adapt the story of any of these games with even a modicum of seriousness is a highly misguided effort.

This is all in aid of saying: the story of The Last of Us has narrative weight, is told really well, and has enough depth that it could survive the change in medium while still allowing the shows creative team to express themselves. It's massive false equivalency to say that a Resident Evil TV show could have reached the heights of The Last of Us."
Evil,"To be fair, TLOU (game) was written to be a much tighter narrative with themes, hooks and dilemmas both physical and moral.  RE1 was a shot at horror with some unintentional camp that took off into a franchise.  Adaptation for RE always had a pretty large margin for error, but yeah, it seems every major attempt has failed catastrophically, at least creatively.  I'm still pretty upset that Paul W.S. Anderson hasn't been publicly flogged for what he's done.
  The point is, TLOU was pretty much already written like a movie, adapting it for a theater or TV series wouldn't be difficult at all.
RE wasn't built like that, or even around the story at all, so pinning down what makes it amazing outside of the gameplay is kind of a losing proposition.  I still want a 1 to 1 screenplay for RE, just to see what that would look like."
Evil,Comparing any resident evil storyline to TLOU is a BIG stretch
Evil,RE source material is nothing even close to TLoU
Evil,"Far too often creatives feel like they NEED to put their own spin on something. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn‚Äôt."
Evil,When are people gonna understand its always been about the network. HBO respects source material and its showrunners WAY more than most.
Evil,"The problem is Last.of US was already acclaimed for a great story. Well told and already well shot as a game. It becomes easy to adapt when the game itself is story proto story board.

RE, never had a great story. Nothing extraordinary. And if you take a game IP and it already has a weak story then either you'll fail to create a new story worthy of the IP or make a half baked version of the same story and stretch it to movie time."
Evil,"...The characters and plot from Resident Evil games are ridiculous, though.

Also, TLOU show DOESN'T follow the source material fully. But the stuff they changed works well."
Evil,Resident Evil was and will always be a money machine.
Evil,it seems like Constantin Films has like a perpetual hold on that IP.
Evil,"Good stories make good series, if well executed.  

The primary reason that TLOU is engaging is that there was always a good story, and that the story is well-executed.  

I don‚Äôt think its success says anything about video game adaptation, other than proving something we should have already known- video games can be adapted into good series if there was always a good story in the game, and if the series is well-executed.  

My fear is that the takeaway will not be the simple truth above and instead will be ‚Äúvideo games are ready for adaptation!‚Äù And we will be getting heavy promotion for poor adaptations of popular video games coming soon to Netflix and Amazon prime.

‚ÄúZac Efron stars as Toad in Mario Party: the series!‚Äù"
Evil,Isn't it because not all show producers actually like the source material?
Evil,They butchered the resident evil movies :(
Evil,"Garbage in, garbage out."
Evil,Amen
Evil,"I don't see why it's so difficult to make a faithful adaptation of the first game. It's almost like playing a movie, anyways."
Evil,"Ehh, have you seen the game's story? It's all corny, too. It was always destined to be a bad movie because it's about immersion and action, not good plot or believable characters."
Evil,"As a HUGE RE fan, it makes more sense to me that they fucked it up over and over again. TLOU has a compelling and dramatic story. RE has at its core a short mystery to solve and.... stuff to kill. So Hollywood turns it into an action poop-sock every chance they get bc theres no substance there. 

Now, could they make a suspenseful horror thriller of RE? Probably. But. Fuck."
Evil,"Idk, I feel like LoU was already a good story. That was basically half the work done. Then you gotta get good producers, casting, and sets and you‚Äôre golden. LoU is basically a cinematic for the show, like the ones for Marvel movies. I mean, take the game away and the story is fine."
Evil,"Meh, RE and TLOU are a different genre. TLOU is way more narrative based than RE that relies on a different narrative, based on the environment and atmosphere."
Evil,TLOU is an example for all other video game adaptations to follow
Evil,"I always thought resident evil would work as a television show, if they did it mini series style. Resident evil zero is one mini series, then the next, and so on. It could be action packed and not need a ton of subplot."
Evil,Video games will be the next comic books. Resident Evil will be rebooted and done right don‚Äôt you fret. Hollywood is desperate for known source material.
Evil,"The last of us makes all other video game adaptation look like they were made by people unaware that they existed as good stories in a different mediums. 

I also think its really disrespectful to all the storytellers in video games and the gamers who love them to change the source material so much that what made it cool to begin with, completly gets lost. 

Halo was imo, the most disgraceful thing to happen to video game adaptations since the super mario brothers movie and microtransactions.  

Hopefully going foward, the last of us can teach filmmakers that the apeal of video game storys translates to gamers and non gamers alike because a good story is a good story regardless of medium.  I hope its not just wishful thinking on my part."
Evil,"I don't see why everyone is so amazed that the last of us is being adapted so well. TLOU is a story first and a game built around that. Adapting older games/franchises is a lot harder than ""just follow the source material"" when most of the source material is gameplay. How do you adapt a game where the majority is running around a house solving puzzles and shooting zombies. There is barely a story in the first 3 RE games that would make for an interesting film."
Evil,"Resident evil wasn't an adaption, it was a dumb show with the name resident evil slapped on"
Evil,"Its because idiots who dont play the games write and make them...

Still puzzles me when writers say they dont like the source material they are adapting.  I think this happened on netflixs witcher and Henry had to argue with the writers over their versions of the story...

What the fuck are those people doing in those positions?"
Evil,[deleted]
Evil,It‚Äôs because Netflix is a shit stain company that shouldn‚Äôt be given adaptions
Evil,The resident evil games are cheesy and the plot is dumb. The movies stay true to that
Evil,"I wish Resident Evil fans (of which I am a massive one) will soon realize the strengths of RE as a franchise is in it's interactivity. 

The characters and plots are paper thin and redundant, because they're all riffs on pop-culture.

No, a spooky mansion with two heroic super-cop characters unraveling a corporate conspiracy with zombies and mutants doesn't exactly have a lot of depth outside of actually playing it, where it's one of the best survival horror games ever made. 

A faithful movie would just be a pale imitation of the media that inspired it, and the general population would know it, sure maybe hardcore fans would enjoy it, but I don't think most people would be very jazzed about a generic slow burn haunted house with zombies flick, the market is already completely oversaturated with lame entries.

As for characters in the series...lets see....Jill Valentine, super swat cop, no real character traits to speak of other than ""hot"". Chris Redfield, super swat cop....yeahh...kind of drawing another blank here. Barry Burton, another swat cop....defining character trait? He uhh...likes guns? Albert Wesker, cartoonish comic book villain who moonlights as a super swat cop. I love these characters, us fans love these characters, but they are as thin as they come.

Last of us didn't require extensive retooling, Joel, Ellie, Tess, Marlene, every character in the game really have strong writing, strong motives, strong character traits, strong personalities and situations they go through that already presented itself well for cinematic dramatization.

For RE to work as a movie you're undoubtedly going to piss of fans, maybe Chris is a recovering alcoholic, maybe Jill has PTSD from some unseen STARS raid that she has to overcome throughout the story, they would HAVE to inject some clearly out of character drama because there is absolutely nothing to their characters, the only way for it to work is to turn it into something that it's not, which is what has happened for 7 terrible films and a terrible netflix series. Or you can be faithful to the paper thin characters and watch 3 terrible CG films and a terrible cg netflix show, it's almost as if Resident Evil removed from it's game context has absolutely nothing worth portraying in other media."
Evil,"The Last of Us is probably the perfect candidate for adaptation to tv. It‚Äôs basically a playable movie already with an excellent story. Also they got the perfect people involved with Druckmann from Naughty Dog so it stays in touch with the games, and Mazin who is a brilliant screenwriter and knows how to create a post apocalyptic atmosphere.

Basically they used the right game and got the right people."
Evil,The Welcome to Racoon City movie was really good. Characters and situations from the games. Better than all the Jojovich movies and the Netflix series combined. I hope they make more movies since they ended with a mid credit cliff hanger.
Evil,"TLOU actually kind of makes me angry lol. Because it shows how absolutely simple in concept approaching an adaptation is - *just respect the damn source material*. 

The MCU has been showing us this for *15 years,* and we're still getting garbage like Resident Evil.

So much potential down the drain over the years."
Evil,"Yeah

Maybe Netflix witty hire real writers next time snd try"
Evil,"Every video game adaptation, the writer and director don't want to recreate the game.  That's why they all fail."
Evil,"Just about every other live, video game adaptation should be absolutely embarrassed by what TLOU is doing. 

If Paramount had any sense at all, they'd take the Halo series' entire preproduction and writing crew, shoot them into the sun, and reboot that POS."
Evil,"""Have been straight up abused""...

First World abuse, they didn't make my tv program the same as the game."
Evil,"Resident Evil, Halo, Wheel of Time, Witcher, the one thing all these shit shows have in common is idiot writers who thought they could do better than the source material they were hired for. Hopefully Hollywood looks at the success of Last of Us and House of the Dragon and finally takes a hint"
Evil,You‚Äôve basically retracted from your whole post in this comment lol
Evil,"I will just say this. ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù has had over 20yrs of being able to look at Resident Evil and all the other adaptations/etc and evolve, which is something I would expect all shows or movies to do compared to others made decades ago. They‚Äôve still been making Resident Evil movies over the years but they were already in that identity so it is what it is. Raccoon City was decent but it‚Äôs only the one ya know. This is like saying the NBA today makes me sad about how NBA was back in the 60s or something. If we‚Äôre comparing these athletes to those athletes‚Ä¶today will always look way better. These showrunners are looking at horror related things, looking at Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, all these shows that have been fairly big too."
Evil,"And Halo is off to a great start for that ""abusing""  lawl. What makes it worse is the time from the simple idea of ""what would a live action adaptation look like?"" We got....this.  Somehow season 2 was greenlit, but I expect nothing less from the studio that allowed the abomination and absolutely unneeded series, Star Trek Picard.

I honestly keep forgetting Resident Evil got a TV ""adaptation.""  My head is still remembering the moviecircle jerks. We had WAY too many, people!"
Evil,"This is the quality difference between HBO and Netflix.

There was a time when Netflix originals were on par with HBO's originals, but not anymore. They're mostly just trash now."
Evil,Sonic the hedgehog was surprisingly good too
Evil,I am sad about how utterly the potential of Witcher book adaptation was destroyed so I feel your pain
Evil,"The Resident Evil storyline isn‚Äôt exactly breaking new ground. It‚Äôs not the strongest thing the franchise has going for it. The Last of Us on the other hand, has a critically acclaimed story that seemed, 10 years ago, to be ripped out of an HBO show only to later become that very thing."
Evil,"What do you mean, did you not like the inclusion and diversity in the shitty series? I mean that's what makes a series great right?"
Evil,"People highly overrated the RE games, especially the original game which was objectively terrible in almost every way. The movies are garbage but it's not like the source material is some sort of masterpiece"
Evil,"as it is with books. it really is not difficult to create a successful show if you stay close to the source material.

harry potter did it, game of thrones did it before they chose their own way. and with computer games it is just like that. people have fond memories of these source materials. then fucking respect that source material! look at the witcher, look at wheels of time, look at the lord of the rings tv series. all fucking trash. now look at sonic the hedgehog another succes. why because they respect the source material!

 that is why i can not comprehend how you can fuck it up so badly every time. stay close to the source material. easy peasy!"
Evil,"Or Witcher, or Rings of Power. Such a cool stories completely butchered by woke show runners"
Evil,"I think I‚Äôm the only one who preferred Resident Evil. 

It was camp, it was over the top, it was ridiculous- but it was different and it was fun. 

To me, TLOU feels like a less impressive version of what I‚Äôve already seen in the game. The show feels like what we‚Äôve already seen a million times in The Walking Dead."
Evil,Mila jovovich and her husband seem to have the rights and butcher it everytime.
Evil,"Resident Evil IP is not TLoU IP. It can return in many different forms and made by someone else than netflix.

For me the first movie is the best... the focus is on zombies and horror, it's got great atmosphere, cool action scenes (not over the top like in later films) and awesome soundtrack."
Evil,"I mean, the story of the Last of Us game already was amazing, the stories of Resident Evil games are.... there. Sometimes really bad. They need to work on an original story based on the games for Resi to work, but they should absolutely copy the style of the games. Last of Us LOOKS like the game, no Resi movie ever did."
Evil,And Halo and Uncharted
Evil,"Resident Ecil went out all guns blazing on the woke angle and from there, we knew it was doomed. Just leave out identity politics at least for some shows for God's sake."
Evil,It‚Äôs not because of the last of us. It was just handled poorly. Period. And that is enough to make you sad!
Evil,Resident Evil had a story?
Evil,"Just play the game then, bud."
Evil,Dude. You're 13 and probably never played RE1. You're attacking windmills here.
Evil,"The Last of Us is already a movie, just with more interaction. The God of War adaptation will be the same. Where adaptations struggle is having to write dialog and characters and coherent plots from scratch within a world that already exists. That's considerably different though I doubt Paul Anderson even tried.

The show is good but let's not pretend that they had to do much more than reenact the game shot for shot and abbreviate some parts. Sony loves these very cinematic, epic games and they are criminally easy to adapt compared to say Sonic the Hedgehog or Prince of Persia"
Evil,"To be fair, resident evil don‚Äôt have anything to tell. They have B horror movies plot with great gameplay."
Evil,"For The Last Of Us, hopefully they won‚Äôt follow the source material for season 2 üôÅ"
Evil,"I just don‚Äôt want last of us 2‚Ä¶ I hope they beer off their own way after saving Ellie. Seriously, part 2 is disappointing trash"
Evil,The only thing about RE I liked was seeing glimpses of Cape Town.
Evil,"Tbf, TLOU has much better characters and stories to adapt than resident evil.






We can leave resi as games, their stories aren't good enough to be actually good films or shows, unless they're were to be very loose adaptions."
Evil,"A well written game gets a good adaptation. I LOOOVE the RE games, but the writing is always a mess."
Evil,"I‚Äôd be interested in seeing the RE7/RE8 storyline with the Winters translated to tv. 

It‚Äôs fairly easy to isolate it from the rest of the lore, and if it works out you could pick up more from there."
Evil,* cries in Witcher *
Evil,I like some the RE titles.   At their best they are nothing but mindless entertainment but not just anyone can make films like these.   If TLOU has more depth then good for HBO but the RE films have a place in many bluray collections.
Evil,The first RE was really good
Evil,"In 2-3 years HBO will be looking for the next video game to bring to the screen, so maybe then?"
Chappelles Show,"Any time I have even the smallest success against some of my friends in video games, I ask them why they don‚Äôt purify themselves in the waters of Lake Minnetonka and not one of them knows where it‚Äôs from.

Chappelles Show,"""Game: Blouses"""
Chappelles Show,I think we have differing opinions on what uncensored means
Chappelles Show,I miss when Dave Chappelle was funny. He used to write really good and original stuff and now he‚Äôs just kind of a tiresome hack.
Chappelles Show,"I seen this, OP."
Chappelles Show,I mean its actually from the movie Purple Rain lol but I get you.

Chappelles Show,Timeless. I laughed until crying as a 15 year old when they came out and I‚Äôm still that today whenever someone reminds me these sketches are out there.
Chappelles Show,"I totally understand Dave's outburst back in 2004. The Rick James one was completely oversaturated with people in school quoting JUST ""I'm Rick James, bitch."" that it ruined the show for me for several years just because of my sensory auditory disorder.

Is it still funny though? Oh hell yeah. But the Prince one is more iconic to me."

Chappelles Show,Maybe if he could agree to play the game
Chappelles Show,Any Prince Vs Charlie competition these days is destined to end in a draw.
Chappelles Show,What was it Chappelle said about that? Something about how he couldn't sue Prince even if he wanted to and Prince knew it.
Chappelles Show,My favorite line

Chappelles Show,Common and Kanye's performance was also really good!
Chappelles Show,"Rap in the 90's was at its best! If you need to know where to start I'd say look up A tribe called quest, Nas, Mobb Deep, KRS one, Dead Prez, Gang Start, Wu Tang Clan (obviously), Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, Pharcyde, Scarface, and Digable Planets. That should be enough to have you down that rabbit hole."
Chappelles Show,"Erykah's performance turned me onto searching for live performances, rather than just accepting the radio or album version."
Chappelles Show,"The performative hate for this guy - especially from Brits, who it should be pointed out *basically cannot see James Corden on their TV unless they specifically seek him out* - is super weird."

Chappelles Show,"Back then Chappelle was at his creative peak. Those standup specials he did in the late 90s and early 00s are flawless. He‚Äôs still funny now, but obviously his comedy hits a different tone considering all that he went thru with show biz and how the world is nowadays. But yeah I agree, he was more upbeat and lighthearted, much more than he is now anyway."
Chappelles Show,"More ‚Äúlisten to this funny story‚Äù and less ‚Äúhere‚Äôs why my haters suck‚Äù.

Not sure if that's the joke or if video got taken down lol"
Chappelles Show,So good that they used that live performance as the actual release of the song.
Chappelles Show,"Mobb Deep especially man, holy shit"
Chappelles Show,"My problem with finding rap songs is that I have low tone sensitive ears, and its mixed to have a lot of drum and bass much more forward, so I can't hear the actual music. Its just drowned out. Thats whats special about this clip, I can actually hear how skillful Mos Def is as a rapper and even understand the words."
Chappelles Show,"Yes, yes.  Add in The Roots as well."
Mias Magic Playground,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt‚Äôs destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Mias Magic Playground,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Mias Magic Playground,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn‚Äôt get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Mias Magic Playground,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Mias Magic Playground,[deleted]
Mias Magic Playground,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Mias Magic Playground,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Mias Magic Playground,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Mias Magic Playground,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There‚Äôs frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn‚Äôt be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don‚Äôt see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Mias Magic Playground,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."

Mias Magic Playground,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Mias Magic Playground,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Mias Magic Playground,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Mias Magic Playground,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Mias Magic Playground,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Mias Magic Playground,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Mias Magic Playground,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it‚Äôs be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Mias Magic Playground,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don‚Äôt care. Evidently there‚Äôs something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what‚Äôs going on. 

It‚Äôs one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn‚Äôt going to understand the world‚Äîisn‚Äôt given enough information to‚Äîand likely isn‚Äôt going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn‚Äôt get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn‚Äôt be the norm."
Mias Magic Playground,"It‚Äôs a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren‚Äôt up to snuff in 2020.

I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Mias Magic Playground,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they‚Äôre not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Mias Magic Playground,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Mias Magic Playground,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Mias Magic Playground,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Mias Magic Playground,This is a great primer but you shouldn‚Äôt have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I‚Äôll watch season 2.
Mias Magic Playground,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Mias Magic Playground,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Mias Magic Playground,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There‚Äôs frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Mias Magic Playground,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Mias Magic Playground,My wife and I are watching the series now and were quite confused. Your timeline doesn't seem to match what we are watching.
Mias Magic Playground,"I know that I will get downvoted for this but if the first season of a fantasy show needs a post like this to explain it... then it is not a good show.     

I am currently watching the Dark crystal age of resistance and it has a lot of fantasy elements which are very original yet nothing that needs a lot of outside explanation if you have not seen the movie since it explains most of them as the story goes on"
Mias Magic Playground,"I watched it and was also mildly confused until the last two episodes. If a show needs a ""guild"" then it wasn't explained good enough in the series. Did anyone notice when a time or scene changed there was never a caption explaining the time or location? Pretty frustrating and not insightful"
Mias Magic Playground,"Guide or no guide, it's still an average show"
Mias Magic Playground,Appreciate the help!
Mias Magic Playground,"The thing is, this being necessary means the show failed in its job."
Mias Magic Playground,"Very nice explaination. Although the plotis not hard to understand by just watching, your write-up makes it better.

> Geralt broke out of Cintran captivity in the chaos, but had no idea that Ciri successfully made it out, too. Geralt, like Ciri and the Nilfgaardians, also travels north from Cintra, in his case heading for the witcher‚Äôs keep of Kaer Morhen to lick his wounds and feel sorry for himself over the whole Ciri business. He saves a travelling farmer from ghouls attracted by the bodies of Cintran refugees, but catches a nasty bite in the process. The farmer tosses Geralt in his cart to recuperate. As a wound-fevered Geralt is transported back to the farmer's house, the Battle of Sodden Hill happens close enough to be within earshot, and Yennefer (who Geralt doesn‚Äôt know is fighting in that battle) goes MIA after summoning a firestorm that stops the invasion cold.

You didn't mention the part where Geralt saw his mother. Was that a ""dream"" or was his mother actually there?"
Mias Magic Playground,It‚Äôs a really big indictment on the writing in the show that you‚Äôd feel like this type of thing was necessary.
Mias Magic Playground,This is an absurdly long post for a show that isn‚Äôt at all hard to follow
Mias Magic Playground,"Holy heck thank you for this write up. I watched the show and loved it though was very confused initially. I own Witcher 3 but haven‚Äôt played and have never read the books. It helped so much, especially the backstory."
Mias Magic Playground,Extremely helpful and well-written. Thanks!
Mias Magic Playground,"Thanks so much for this. I went in totally blind and this helped world-build a ton for me. I think the show is entertaining and pretty well done, but I wish this backstory would have been explained more (or better)."
Mias Magic Playground,Very helpful. I think if you pay attention most of this is clear in the show but this definitely helped me connect some dots. The law of surprise connection being such a strong father - daughter bond for them was not 100% clear to me before this so things make a lot more sense now.
Mias Magic Playground,"The wish to tie their fates together, didn't that stop the djinn because if the djinn killed Yennifer then it would have killed Geralt and a djinn cannot kill it's master?"
Mias Magic Playground,Fantastic writeup
Mias Magic Playground,"Good writeup overall, missing most of the details of Yennefer's plotline, but I can see why you left them out for clarity's sake."
Mias Magic Playground,[deleted]
Mias Magic Playground,"Super helpful. Once I realized there were more than once timeline, even for just a relatively short period of the show, I got co fused and somehow thought Renfri and Yen would end up being the same person. Like Yen would transform to Renfri which is why Renfri was a monster or something."
Mias Magic Playground,"Any explanation as to why Geralt's eyes turn black and face turns extra veiny looking during a fight, but he looks like a normal, painfully handsome man the rest of the time."
Mias Magic Playground,Saved for when in finished
Mias Magic Playground,Very good post
Mias Magic Playground,"The only thing that bothered me was the characterization of the Wizards/Sorcererers in the series. In the books and games, they are said to be the most beautiful/handsome a person can get due to magic manipulation. So they should be all Kens and Barbies, but i can udnerstand the issues of adapting that."
Mias Magic Playground,Thanks man this helped so much! Hopefully they have a less confusing timeline in season 2
Mias Magic Playground,"Thanks very much for the write up! It's nice to have some of those gaps filled in. I didn't see this asked anywhere, so apologies if this was clarified, but why was the law of surprise in one case (Duny) a marriage, but in another (Geralt/Ciri) it's protection? 

Will Geralt eventually marry Ciri when she gets older or something? The rules just seem so ambiguous for such a powerful request."
Mias Magic Playground,"RemindMe! One week ""Read this when you have finished the series"""
Mias Magic Playground,"Thanks, that is helpful. Never read books or played games but post TV series, inspired to buy and started playing Witcher 3. Already learnt lots prior to this post thanks to the game."
Mias Magic Playground,Save for later
Mias Magic Playground,Commenting to find later!
Mias Magic Playground,Awesome write up! Succinct and to the point. I like how you skipped over the entire forest of Brokilon arc with a single sentence :p
Mias Magic Playground,Bravo and thank you.  *Tosses a silver to his Witcher bard*
Mias Magic Playground,Question for anyone who caught this: what was vilgefortz doing at the end? He survives his battle with Cahir and then wakes up and....bashes a friendly mage's head in with a club? I was so confused.
Mias Magic Playground,"If they‚Äôd simply added some kind of year captions before each short story, it would‚Äôve solved a lot of problems. Even something so basic as ‚ÄúX years before the War‚Äù"
Mias Magic Playground,Wow this was so thorough and now I know what the hell is going on with no help of wikipedia. Thank you!
Mias Magic Playground,"One detail I think is really good to show the tone of the series is that Gerald does not get the butcher of blaviken moniker because he killed some cutthroats, but rather because he opposed the elite/rulers, that being the mage."
Mias Magic Playground,"A bunch of people have probably already said it, but thank you.  This is a great, concise piece that filled in several gaps for me about the show."
Mias Magic Playground,That was very helpful in filling some plot points I missed
Mias Magic Playground,"Fun fact: if Geralt had invoked the law of surprise for helping the farmer at the end, he would have gotten Ciri twice by the law."
Mias Magic Playground,"Thank you for this great recap. I watched the show without any background knowledge and it was a bit confusing to follow at times. I had to go look up a few things between episodes.

This summary lets me know that I did get the gist of things from the show. When I watch it again I think I'll be able to enjoy it more now that I know what's going on."
Mias Magic Playground,There's a place called flotsam but not jetsam
Mias Magic Playground,Saved this for later.
Mias Magic Playground,Thank you for posting this. I had never played the games nor read any of the lore. Loved this series and can‚Äôt wait for more.  This guide has helped me put some pieces together of the history that I was unsure of.
Mias Magic Playground,Bookmark
Mias Magic Playground,"even with my playing the game, this is more thorough and a wonderful guide!"
Mias Magic Playground,did you just write another book...
Mias Magic Playground,Will be showing this to my partner. Great write up.
Mias Magic Playground,Thank you!!
Mias Magic Playground,I'd like to know more about Filavandrel's uprising
Mias Magic Playground,"Top job! I didn't miss anything in your recap of the series it seems, but I really liked your summary of the world at the start, I didn't know much of the world building stuff."
Mias Magic Playground,God‚Äôs work
Mias Magic Playground,"It'd be dope if they explained this better in the show. I love a non-linear narrative but the way they attempted it did not make sense.

I think one problem is throwing too many unknown nouns at us too quickly"
Mias Magic Playground,"You sir, are a god among men"
Mias Magic Playground,"You say Nilfgaard attacking Cintra is an irrational desire that wont be revealed until season two, but I got the impression Nilfgaard wanted Cintra as they needed Ciri because some mysterious white flame told them to? I mean you don't know the exact reasons and I am sure they will be expanded on in S2, but that is the premise yes?"
Mias Magic Playground,"Just finished the series today. 
Great write up! Didn‚Äôt realise that was why Geralt couldn‚Äôt sleep. 

Really helpful"
Mias Magic Playground,Someone toss this man a coin!
Mias Magic Playground,Thanks for putting this together. I was completely new to the Witcher with while watching the tv show. I didn‚Äôt even realize they were playing with the timelines until a few episodes in. This background gave some great context.
Mias Magic Playground,What was the comment about not being able to make any more Witchers?
Mias Magic Playground,"Really appreciate this. This was better explanation than the show! I watched the show due to all the hubbub and enjoyed it. But def could feel there is sooooo much more going on that isn't being explained. It would be great for fans already of the books and games. However being Netflix and so mainstream with tons of the audience not being familiar with the TW universe previously, I'm confused why they didn't explain much of this better."
Mias Magic Playground,Great guide!
Mias Magic Playground,"Keep up the chatter, we need so many seasons!"
Mias Magic Playground,Omg. My wife an I just discussed how this detail was missing for nubes. Thank you!
Mias Magic Playground,"I've been hesitant to watch this, until now. Thank you!"
Mias Magic Playground,Thanks OP
Mias Magic Playground,What an amazing and well written summary.  Thanks for that from one who knows the story only from having watched the show.
Mias Magic Playground,Hm
Mias Magic Playground,Thank you!
Mias Magic Playground,This helps a lot
Mias Magic Playground,nice
Mias Magic Playground,"Fan of the show who never read the books nor played the games:

My biggest complaints during the show were having no idea what the hell the power-gifted characters were actually capable of, and not understanding the Law of Surprise.

One of the early episodes opens with Yennifer bamfing around across the whole world every minute or so fleeing an assassin.  Then later when all the mages need to get from point A to B and time is a factor, they need to take a boat??  So I thought maybe I missed something, and these portals aren't just free teleport-anywhere-whenever-you-want spells.  But then in ep8 that one mage teleports onto the Nilfgard general to try to kill him?

I just generally never know what any of the magical characters can actually do.  I have no idea if they are taxed to exhaustion by summoning a sword, or if they can freeze time, magically decapitate someone, or burninate a whole mountain.  

And how the hell does the Law of Surprise work.  You save someone's life, and claim it.  Then they owe you the first thing they gain without knowledge?  Seems to often be a person?  Does Geralt own Ciri?  Does he marry her?  Does he raise her as his own kid?  None of that was explained well.

Loved the show overall.  Just never knew if the magical characters were genuinely in danger because I had no idea what they could do at any moment."
Mias Magic Playground,They just needed to give town name and date as text wherever they changed timeline.
Oh My Baby,"Damn Nick Cannon really gets a whole ass game show where women compete to see who gets to have sex with him.

Also I legit thought this was some sort of mystery game show where a contestant has to figure out which woman is pregnant with Cannon's baby"
Oh My Baby,"From the headline, I thought it was a gameshow about Nick Cannon finding out who is already pregnant with his child, which would be vastly more entertaining."
Oh My Baby,Like an SNL sketch come to life.
Oh My Baby,"> In what's being billed as ""the mother of all game shows,"" Nick Cannon is set to pick from a slate of contestants who want to have his next baby in a new game show hosted by Kevin Hart.

Kevin Hart's career is deadddd"
Oh My Baby,"Imagine being a contestant on this show... That this is your concrete history and what you'll be known for until the last person forgets you. Your existence 

A woman competing to have a nutjob's 14th baby for ratings"
Oh My Baby,">Cannon also jokes about his selection process when he says, ""Eeny, meeny, miny, [moe].""    

When this is inevitably a hit, and some other network decides to make their own version, I vote for *Eeny Meeny Miny Mom* as the title."
Oh My Baby,Not it!
Oh My Baby,"He is going to be the father ?

We are truly on the road to greenlight Ow My Balls!."
Oh My Baby,This isn‚Äôt an early April fools joke?
Oh My Baby,"""Jim Wallace, Associated Press [ Clears Throat ] Is this a joke?"""
Oh My Baby,"This is disgusting.

And no one should reproduce with that black supremacist."
Oh My Baby,"This gotta be a joke, right!?"
Oh My Baby,"Who the fuck would green light this and fund it.

>on E!. 

Reality tv has reached its [current] low point."
Oh My Baby,Spoiler Alert: it‚Äôs everyone!
Oh My Baby,Creampie Cannon
Oh My Baby,Yeah this feels like it would be a subplot in a dystopian novel or something.
Oh My Baby,Not real: https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/nick-cannon-whos-having-my-baby-game-show-kevin-hart-1235545865/amp/
Oh My Baby,As if I needed to dislike Nick Cannon even more.
Oh My Baby,Your mom had Nick Cannon's baby
Oh My Baby,I would love to see the pitch meetings for this show.  Who actually green lighted this and thought it was a good idea?
Oh My Baby,That's the sequel show.
Oh My Baby,"Easy. All of them, including the crew and audience."
Oh My Baby,"""No, really, who is having my baby? I need help."""
Oh My Baby,Same
Oh My Baby,He's got a bunch of Capital One cards. He should be fine for a while with all that cash back.
Oh My Baby,He already has 12 kids...We've been on this road a while and the destination is closer than most people realize.
Oh My Baby,I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs a joke
Oh My Baby,Sounds like something from the producers of ‚ÄúMilf Island‚Äù.
Oh My Baby,Comcast ‚Äòwe can‚Äôt let WBD beat us in the no taste wars‚Äô.
Oh My Baby,"And 7 of them are a year-old or under.  My god, there has to be some sort of mental illness at play here, right?"
Oh My Baby,"Amazingly Zazlav has nothing to do with this, it's all on E!."
Oh My Baby,"While it has all the fundamentals of Dark, i dont think this show quite captured the ‚Äúspark‚Äù that Dark was so famous for. Too many one dimensional characters for my liking, so above average at best."
Oh My Baby,"Dark just copied that Ethan Hawke movie ""Predestination"""
Oh My Baby,"I‚Äôm a big fan of Dark, so I‚Äôve started this but after watching 2 episodes I have to admit it hasn‚Äôt really grabbed me yet, I‚Äôll give it one more episode, but tbh I‚Äôm just about ready to tap out."
Oh My Baby,"Would be interesting to see how it performs for people who have NOT seen Dark think that is likely the most important thing.       

Lot of Dark fans will likely watch it even if they dont think its good"
Oh My Baby,"This show has a much longer slow burn than Dark S1, because Dark‚Äôs premise started immediately (time travel). You don‚Äôt even get to anywhere near the premise until episode 5 or 6."
Oh My Baby,"It feels like they spent more time setting up the mysteries than actually creating intriguing characters, everything feels very storyboarded and stiff. But I‚Äôm also only on episode two so will watch at least four before I make a judgement. I like all the actors enough and the setting is fantastic. I just wish they could draw me into the atmosphere more, it feels like everything is just place to place with nice outside shots and then people meeting and having mysterious conversations."
Oh My Baby,"I didn't see Dark (though now I want to watch it). I LOVED the earlier 1899 eps, but the ending is falling flat for me (I'm in the middle of the final ep now... and as you can see I'm on Reddit on my second monitor). 

I really don't like the twists that came in the latter half (even though they're being explained in this final ep), I wish we knew a lot LOT LOT more about the characters, and the pacing just seems to be totally off. It feels almost as if the entire Lost, all the seasons, were packed into 8 eps."
Oh My Baby,Would love some bloopers
Oh My Baby,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
Oh My Baby,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
Oh My Baby,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
Oh My Baby,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
Oh My Baby,If they don‚Äôt reenact the musical alternate ending I‚Äôm gonna be very disappointed.
Oh My Baby,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
Oh My Baby,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
Oh My Baby,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
Oh My Baby,Gotta get my fix!
Oh My Baby,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. üò≠
Oh My Baby,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
Oh My Baby,Cool advert
Oh My Baby,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
Oh My Baby,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
Oh My Baby,[removed]
Oh My Baby,[removed]
Oh My Baby,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
Oh My Baby,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
Oh My Baby,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
Oh My Baby,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"
Oh My Baby,The Laughs Of Us.
Oh My Baby,I feel like 10-12 episodes would have been perfect. 9 is on the short side.
Oh My Baby,1st game shouldve been 2 seasons tbh
Oh My Baby,"For sure can play Part I since it will end where season 1 ends. And who knows maybe you‚Äôll want to play part II afterwards anyway, not a spoiler if it‚Äôs ultimately going to be the same story :). I think it‚Äôs a story worth experiencing via it‚Äôs original medium first."
Oh My Baby,You better end up playing Part II fairly soon because I feel like you‚Äôre not gonna be able to avoid spoiler talk after season 1 ends
Oh My Baby,"Yes, season 1 is just the first game including dlc. It's a great game, if you've ps5 or pc you can pick it up cheap enough if you keep an eye on sales. Otherwise you got the ps4 remaster which is still really good"
Oh My Baby,Play Part 1 as it won‚Äôt spoil anything and it‚Äôs an incredible game. Don‚Äôt play part 2 if you don‚Äôt want the rest of the show spoiled
Oh My Baby,"""You're smart"" - Pedro to Sean"
Oh My Baby,"I just watched that episode, it was amazing. Pedro Pascal is so damn charming, I just want to hang out with him"
Oh My Baby,"[Listen to the podcast to scratch a bit of that itch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-the-last-of-us-podcast/id1660320068) \- I believe they are all over 40 mins long and this includes Druckman, Mazin and it is hosted by Troy Baker. Can't get more inside than that!"
Oh My Baby,"Jo and Mal from the Ringer-verse are also doing an interview/recap with Craig Maizin and Neil Druckman, so an extra 2 hours there if you want"
Oh My Baby,"Pedro has to do a project with Nathan Fillion where they can play brothers. Christ, their speaking voices even sound alike."
Oh My Baby,Maybe they‚Äôre saving that storyline for later seasons to help even out joel time
Oh My Baby,"They both have different show title names and are also set in a different universe.

Damn, that was easy"
Oh My Baby,Why would anyone care about proving you wrong? Demomstrate that you're correct or your assertion is to be laughed at and dismissed.
Oh My Baby,"I mean they're literally different. 

Dumbass."
Oh My Baby,"This apple and this orange are the same thing.

Oh My Baby,"It would be a little *too* on the meta-nose.

But I would have loved to see Pascal killing Baker while being unable to talk. Voiceless at it were.

For those few not in the know: Joel in the show killing the actor in the show (Buddy Boy) that played Joel in the game (voice + motion caption)."
Oh My Baby,Is this a spoiler? What the fuck bro
Oh My Baby,Oh mah gahhhhhhh!
Oh My Baby,They did make 10 episodes. HBO then combined the first two into a movie length premiere because they thought it worked better dramatically and because otherwise most of the pilot would be the 2003 flashback.
Oh My Baby,It is 10 with the double length of the first episode.
Oh My Baby,Having 9 episodes where two of them are around one hour and 20 minutes is what I‚Äôd prefer
Oh My Baby,"How? The game takes about 15 hours to complete, most of which is gameplay. At most this could have 10 episodes instead of 9, but there is not enough story for 2 seasons."
Oh My Baby,Gotta love how a mildly unpopular opinion gets you downvoted to -44.
Oh My Baby,That‚Äôs too much. 12 episodes I could get into. 2 seasons is overkill.
Oh My Baby,"Unfortunately it‚Äôs not on PC until the end of this month, and it‚Äôs $60 so probably won‚Äôt be cheap for a while."
Oh My Baby,The stuff that he says isn't even *that* funny but he's so goddamn charming that Sean is losing it and I'm laughing just as much.
Oh My Baby,"Hope so, they nailed the actors and Tommy needs more screen time, I want to know what Joel did to survive, if they can tell a new story about characters like Bill and Frank they can tell something new about the actual focal characters."
Oh My Baby,The easiet gottem of all time
Oh My Baby,"OK, you grumpy folks..The same guy, Joel, take a little child along several seasons. The child has superpowers that nobody has, and Joel has no purpose in life, till he meets the kid. The purpose now is to take him to some enigmatic place with some enigmatic people. Once he delivers, they want to take the kid down.

THE SAME SHOW.

You do not agree?

ok, how about this:

The last of us is the prequel. Ellie develops some symptoms like greeny face and longevity. Also she can be in touch with mother nature. in season 7 Joel get ill and die, and Ellie manage to take an eye of Joel, the last part not contaminated by the fungus, so she can bury him next his brother.

She place the eye ina sferic metallic ball and hit the ground. Finally she cant say goodbye and keep the ball as an amulet.

Years later, season 35, Ellie use the rounded eye of Joel, stored in a sferic ball of steel, to get Joel DNA and to revive him. They need berskar because the weekness of the skeleton, so they go to mandalor, and train as mandalorian.

It turns out Ellie is shrinking, so the ears seem to be huge, and  greening step by step.

As the reconstruction of Joel is a succes, an evil force try to make more clones,  But they need more Joel DNA.

They take Joel, kill him and get all DNA they need. They  turn the startup into a success, and start a special program of mass production on clones!

Once she finds out, she get mad about and convince a new Joel  to destroy the  Clone factory with all the clones but the last one. Ellie get injured and unable to speak again, and almost a fern by now.

The bush with ears and Silver-helmet go for the gallaxy looking for the misterious people and the enigmatic place, while grogu -she doesnt feel like a girl any more and changed her name- plays with the sferic-steel ball, that contains the last piece of his friend. They travel again and forever.

The end"

The Bus Stop,wasn't that the kid who stole arnold baseball?
The Bus Stop,"This scene didn't bother me too much as a kid

Helga's backstory on the other hand [...](https://i.imgur.com/5c6fuel.jpg)"
The Bus Stop,Hasn‚Äôt aged well? I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs aged like fine wine :).
The Bus Stop,"Interesting, I always thought it held really well! The stories and characters are strong. The music rules. What do you think didn‚Äôt age well?"
The Bus Stop,"always 2 there are, a comment and a bugged duplicate"
The Bus Stop,"It's aged really well. It's pretty grounded in reality, with a lot of true-to-life characters. Characters who could otherwise feel like stereotypes are fleshed out and given both flaws and strengths. Adults struggle with real problems like mental illness, addictions, poverty, homelessness, etc.. Of course these issues are dealt with relatively lightly and with humor because it's a kid show. But they don't make jokes at the expense of those people and their struggles either. It's a very human show with a lot of hidden depth. The character who is positioned most often as the antagonist is also the one with the most complex internal struggles, and basically hides her true nature and feelings from everyone in her world. The audience are the only ones who know the truth about Helga. Her self-repression and denial are products of her emotionally distant parents, both of whom are addicts in different ways. Big Bob is addicted to his success and technology and his alpha machismo persona, and has little idea how to actually relate to his artistic, tomboyish, and emotional youngest daughter (Note how Bob never seems to take an interest in Helga's participation in traditionally male sports and activities, despite Bob being a big macho sports fan. But when it's something intellectual, he's very interested, because Helga's older sister was a successful student and Bob sees that as a worthwhile pursuit for his girls.) Miriam is a case where we can see how she would be a better mom for Helga if she was able to conquer her veiled alcoholism. I think the failures of her parents help cause Helga to hide her true feelings,act like a bully or villain, but then she usually has a change of heart where she realizes she's wrong and helps resolve the problem. I'd argue that she's the greatest character in a children's cartoon."
The Bus Stop,[deleted]
The Bus Stop,That‚Äôs interesting. I feel like this animated show is one of the few from that era that has aged well.
The Bus Stop,It ages pretty well imo. It's just not zany like new cartoons. More like king of the hill in that things that happen are typically realistic and confined to plausible visual gags and stuff
The Bus Stop,Same here I wonder why..
The Bus Stop,yeah my biggest issue is the original Arnold's voice actor was the best and they change to a new one every season
The Bus Stop,"You‚Äôre right, I worded it wrong

Something like the Simpsons, I watched as a kid and still watch today and love it

Hey Arnold, I adored as a kid but it doesn‚Äôt give me the same joy watching as an adult

It still looks great"
The Bus Stop,"whoa that‚Äôs weird, I definitely only posted it once."
The Bus Stop,"I agree that Arnold was boring, he was meant to be the standard good guy protagonist.

My favorite were all the boarders. They had such different personalities, all annoying at face value but then they were quite interesting when you got to know them (except Oscar lol)"

The Bus Stop,"I think he sees the strangers who are unaffected and unaware of his father's death going on with their day and realizes what happened is insignificant in the scheme of things, and therefore more able to accept that it was his time to go. Moreso he recognizes that all these people will one day get on the bus as well."
The Bus Stop,Just jealous you are watching it for (seemingly) the first time. I hope you enjoy it!
The Bus Stop,"Honestly, Andor is just a wartime drama that happens to be set in the Star Wars universe - and they've taken care *not* to shove that in your face.

Like, if no one told you it was a Star Wars show and you didn't know the Imperial Seal, you might be surprised when an obviously recognizable Star Wars element popped up."
The Bus Stop,Diego Luna is a seriously good actor. Has been for a long time. He has some great Mexican films. Check them out.
The Bus Stop,Andor - a Star Wars property where they actually tell a mature story and don‚Äôt have have to shoehorn anything in there purely to sell toys to kids.
The Bus Stop,"I like that most of the humor is subtle, and that not every moment has to be punctuated with humor. That's way, way too common with everything Disney."
The Bus Stop,"The best line ever is when Cassian talks to the Skarsgaard character and describes how the empire just let's you walk in and pretend to be them, due to their own arrogance. It was a brilliant look into his psyche. I cannot wait to see more."
The Bus Stop,"This show is an outstanding WW2 espionage/resistance show with a star wars coat of paint. It's super refreshing to watch and beautifully acted, directed, edited"
The Bus Stop,So far it‚Äôs great. Find it much better than Obi Wan. Which is something I can‚Äôt believe.
The Bus Stop,I don‚Äôt have Star Wars fatigue. I‚Äôve got lazy tropey writing fatigue.
The Bus Stop,"There wouldn't be ""Star Wars fatigue"" if they released quality shows like Andor more frequently. Obi-Wan, Boba, and the anthologies just aren't what I'm looking for. Andor is."
The Bus Stop,"I have been having an absolute blast watching this show. I can't say I'm too surprised that a SW show from the creators of Rogue One is one of the few live action SW things I like, but it still feels like it has no right to be as good as it is.

Last episode had me totally engrossed and captivated by a scene with Mon Mothma which was literally nothing but two people *talking.* When has Star Wars ever done that? Build real suspense in a dialogue sequence? Never to me.

Phenomenal cast too, the acting is top notch which is again a rarity in SW.

The whole production just feels like someone genuinely had a story to tell and didn't just want to churn out another SW product. This is what Kenobi and Boba Fett lacked, they were creatively bankrupt projects."
The Bus Stop,"Episode 3's closing sequence is far and away the best 5 minutes of Star Wars I've ever seen. Prior to that I was pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of the show but those final moments were truly something else. 

For those who've read the EU novels, Andor is the closest we've gotten to an adaptation that truly feels like it's exploring the lore outside of it's Skywalker confines."
The Bus Stop,"Episode 6 is incredible, I love this show."
The Bus Stop,"Definitely agree.  I love that it's showing all of the parts of Star Wars that get glossed over in favor of the shiny stuff like Jedi and bounty hunters.  It's showing the dirtier side of the rebellion, the Imperial bureaucracy and how they are badly affecting the common people.  It's great!"
The Bus Stop,Don't forget about the music in this show. Outstanding soundtrack.
The Bus Stop,"For anyone looking to start Andor, it seems like they are telling the story in 3 episode chunks. So episode one, for example, doesn't end on a big cliff-hanger-drop-to-black-omg-LOST moment. So if you are at least intrigued by the first episode, give it a couple more episodes after that for the story to get it's hooks in you.

Having said that I was totally enchanted by the first episode. The show looks gorgeous, beautiful real sets, this was not shot in a warehouse in front of a green screen, and the overall tone of the show is clearly different from any Star Wars that came before it. Andor himself is a subtle and fascinating character (and a total badass) whose story and motivation is still slowly unravelling itself (EDIT: and there are so many other fascinating characters as well, and each episode we are getting a little more information about them).

Tony Gilroy and his team are absolutely delivering on all fronts, and if you listen to any Gilroy interviews you can tell he is so excited about the show, genuinely over the moon that he's been given this opportunity. I have high confidence this will go down as one of the best Star Wars projects."
The Bus Stop,"I want these people to make every SW show going forward. Let them experiment with different tones, approaches etc - but just leave them to it. Andor is lightyears above anything else in the Disney SW"
The Bus Stop," I‚Äôd been avoiding Andor, as I wanted lots of episodes so I could see how it develops. I just caught up, and it‚Äôs so much better -sooooo much better - than I even hoped"
The Bus Stop,"It's not even Star Wars fatigue, it's Disney fatigue for me.

Every Disney property has the same exact marvel-esque quality to it now. It's gotten INSANELY stale, and they're just pumping out series after series that all feel exactly the fucking same regardless of property.

Netflix original series suffer from the same problem, of all just feeling like the same mids shit over and over again. All have the same lighting, writing quality, set design, etc obvious hallmarks of Netflix are recognizable between shows.


The issue isn't that there's too much star wars, it's that everything star wars just feels like marvel-disney now. 

I'd LOVE more star wars that isn't just more Disney tripe. If Andor truly is any different then someone please let me know. Until then, nah.

[Edit] OK ok, you guys convinced me to give it a fair shot I'll start it tomorrow"
The Bus Stop,"My problem with Star Wars Disney isn‚Äôt fatigue. It‚Äôs just that 95% of it is downright terrible. 

The only thing of any value is rogue one, some of the Mandalorian, and Andor."
The Bus Stop,‚ÄúStar Wars Fatigue‚Äù is just some lame excuse Lucasfilm Executives came up with to tell themselves why people don‚Äôt care. Truth is the last two shows were awful and people aren‚Äôt watching bad tv
The Bus Stop,"It's the second best show of 2022 after BCS, even better than HotD IMO

It's unbelievable how Disney achieved this after the dumpster fire that were Kenobi and Boba Fett"
The Bus Stop,"There is no such thing as ""Star Wars fatigue"". There **is** such a thing as bad story-telling fatigue."
The Bus Stop,"True, i think it's the best thing the brand has produced since Disney bought it."
The Bus Stop,Both Rouge One and Andor are remarkable.  As someone who grew up in the ‚Äò80‚Äôs on Star Wars I had always hoped that the content would mature with the audience.  I‚Äôm not moved by the same things I was when I was 7 years old.  I realize they want to keep the franchise alive for the same kiddie demographic but for us old timers we really appreciate these films.
The Bus Stop,"How many articles are we going to see that say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good, why are people not watching it?‚Äù"
The Bus Stop,"This might be sorta off topic, but I notice all these review posts whenever some new, big budget show comes out. Lots of, ""Best show you're not watching!"" sorts of posts.

To cut to the heart of it, I don't know how much I trust the honesty of these posts. I think they're being submitted by someone in marketing."
The Bus Stop,It‚Äôs the first real adult oriented Star Wars show and by far the best so far imo.
The Bus Stop,"Don't call it star wars fatigue, it's shit writing fatigue. Everything disney has put out until this point has been subpar *at best*. People haven't stopped watching Star Wars because it's Star Wars, people have stopped watching because they've come to accept it is going to suck.

Everything about *Andor* is leagues better than what has been put out so far."
The Bus Stop,"People keep telling me this show is good, but the Star Wars fatigue is hitting so hard that it is hard to believe. The brand damage is definitely real."
The Bus Stop,No one has 'star wars fatigue' they have 'shitty writing fatigue'.
The Bus Stop,"It‚Äôs not Star Ward fatigue, it‚Äôs Bad Writing Fatigue.

Edit: that being said if this one is actually well written maybe I‚Äôll check it out. I just don‚Äôt do that by default anymore."
The Bus Stop,"Yeah, no I‚Äôm good.  Disney is awful in so many ways and I avoid their crap.

Plus, Star Wars should have stopped at The Return of the Jedi."
The Bus Stop,"Fine, I will watch it, but I also remember people pretending Obi-Wan was good too and that one sucked."
The Bus Stop,"Best thing to come out of the Star Wars universe since Empire Strikes Back.

(whispers: maybe the best period)"
The Bus Stop,I am fatigued with every show happening in a 80ish year time span in SW history and for the most part being sub-par under the Disney regime.
The Bus Stop,"I just love the fact that we are watching what is essentially civilian life in the Star Wars universe. None of the ""Force"" talk, just civilians planning strategies."
The Bus Stop,"What if I don't have ""fatigue"" I just haven't watched anything after The Mandalorian because I thought it was lame? Is there hope for me liking Andor?"
The Bus Stop,I think Mon Mothma's scenes are overlooked. The tension in *every* scene she's in is off the charts.
The Bus Stop,Sorry bro its not Star Wars fatigue. It‚Äôs Disney fucking things up again and again fatigue
The Bus Stop,"Pretty amazing to think the budget per episode is considerably less than Obi Wan, yet it looks noticeably better in every way. Just shows how much difference top tier directing and cinematography can make, especially when it‚Äôs backed up by a creative vision. Andor is almost like something Villeneuve would make. Excellent."
The Bus Stop,I have Disney fatigue. They milk their MCU and Star Wars properties way too much and I just don't care about them anymore.
The Bus Stop,"It's not so much ""fatigue"" as ""Disney has turned the brand into crap, so I'm no longer interested."""
The Bus Stop,"I am definitely one of the ""fatigued"" I have heard it is good there has just been a flood of star wars stuff and I am so bored with the universe. That said I think I will have to watch Andor at this point, and I will continue to watch Mandalorian."
The Bus Stop,"Andor is exactly the kind of star wars TV show I dreamed about when reading the novels way back in the 90s. A fairly serious and mature exploration of survival in a totalitarian sci-fi universe, with an emphasis on hope and resistance. Why did it take so long to understand that is the key?

Obi Wan was everything that is wrong with post Return of the Jedi Star Wars; shallow pandering, with a complete lack of clarity about what really made the world interesting. I cant believe they spent the last 24 years thinking light saber sound effects are enough to satiate any one older than a toddler."
The Bus Stop,It's honestly sad that it took this long to get Star Wars content that doesn't treat its audience like morons with a five minute attention span. I pray we get much more Star Wars media that is like Andor. If only the sequels were given this much care...
The Bus Stop,They managed to finally hire a writer who can handle mature dialogue.
The Bus Stop,I've been saying it feels like The Americans but Star Wars. Great espionage drama
The Bus Stop,"Its more of a Disney fatigue, fuck the rat."
The Bus Stop,"too late, they killed the brand"
The Bus Stop,It absolutely will stop me from watching it
The Bus Stop,"The series set up the universe so convincingly, that if we ever see a Jedi right now, the force would feel so magical and mesmerizing, as it should."
The Bus Stop,I'll get around to it eventually
The Bus Stop,"I don't have Star Wars fatique, I have a fucking ""let's not move forward with Star Wars -shows"" fatique. Even when they tried to move forward a bit, they still used every fucking old Star Wars character possible. Just do something new for fuck sakes."
The Bus Stop,This feels like a post by a marketing group.
The Bus Stop,This sub is just one billboard after another
The Bus Stop,It‚Äôs crazy how much astroturfing goes down on this site. This is clearly just an ad.
The Bus Stop,"It feels like a prestige HBO show set in the stars wars universe. The writing is really good, acting is superb and it looks great.

I literally paused the show a few episodes ago and thought ""is this really a disney + stars wars show? This is really good"" shockingly enjoyable so far"
The Bus Stop,I‚Äôve just got franchise fatigue.
The Bus Stop,Try Star Trek fatigue still need to make it past the Picard era
The Bus Stop,How long till they cancel this you reckon
The Bus Stop,"Ah back to blaming ""star wars fatigue"". I guess fatigue means sick of shit content? Andor is great, but you can't blame people for not wanting to give something a chance when they watched Boba and Kenobi and just saw the same mistakes from 7,8, and 9 repeated once again."
The Bus Stop,"Show it, don't say it."
The Bus Stop,Correction. This is the only good show Disney has made.
The Bus Stop,"I'm getting whiplash following the posts about this show. Generally speaking I know what lies within my own tastes so I know how interested I am in Andor or not, but it's wild how discourse has changed on the internet."
The Bus Stop,"They're fucked. Every show has somehow managed to have decent reviews but be soulless shit.

I assume I'm not the only one who will need 2 + good seasons before jumping back in."
The Bus Stop,It really is fantastic and under-appreciated.
The Bus Stop,Andor has been a solid show so far and it‚Äôs only half done. Very entertaining and written very well.
The Bus Stop,"Yes, this is a good show."
The Bus Stop,"Nah, I'm good"
The Bus Stop,"It shouldn't, but it has"
The Bus Stop,"Definitely. Please have the makers of Andor do all of Star Wars from now on. It's head and shoulders above the rest.

The only thing I don't like about it, and this is just my personal taste and in no way reflects badly on the show, is that it turns out that Cassian >!really is just a low-life who murders innocent people to save his own hide. In Rogue One it was kind of implied the ""terrible things"" he admitted he did were for the greater good!<, but no."
The Bus Stop,"> Star Wars fatigue

This isn't a thing.

Disney could do $2 billion in Star Wars movies a year with a summer and winter tentpole and run shows. 

They just have pursued a batshit strategy of ignoring decades of great stories from comics and books (just like Marvel) that they could crank out and update like the MCU and have decided to instead write their own lazy and often offensively bad storyline that barely seems to fit to the point you're baffled how they thought it was better or even good. *And they keep staying the course...*

Star Wars fatigue? No. Shitty Star Wars fatigue, maybe."
The Bus Stop,Yeah this one blew me away. Easily my favorite star wars cinema.
The Bus Stop,"It‚Äôs not Star Wars fatigue.

It‚Äôs the bitter resentment of Star Wars betrayal."
Deadly Class,Just read the comics. They are great
Deadly Class,"It was a superlatively classy show, I don't know why they wouldn't just move it to streaming rather than just cancel it."
Deadly Class,"And they ended it at the worst possible moment storywise. Ending it on that cliffhanger, and knowing what happens next, it‚Äôs sad we didn‚Äôt get any more of it"
Deadly Class,it should have been netflix show tbh
Deadly Class,"Its one of those shows where I question if I should even recommend it to friends, because its so good but it ended before it could be amazing."
Deadly Class,"the entire aesthetic for the show was so unique and i loved the characters. it was edgy in a corny way but also aware of that edge, one of my favorite shows of all time"
Deadly Class,"I'm so shocked it never got a second season, even on Syfy. It was well put together, and it looked like a lot of love was put into its production. Even if it mostly had lesser known or unknown actors, it still managed to portray multiple characters uniquely enough that, as a viewer, I could distinguish them from each other not only by name, but by personality as well.

Also the 80's feel is freakin great."
Deadly Class,"Definitely.  It was one of my favorites shows from 2019,it's a shame that Syfy did not promoted it enough."
Deadly Class,"It was so good!! And the comic creator being involved was incredible, plus the soundtrack"
Deadly Class,It really did.
Deadly Class,This show made me really want Lana Condor as Cassandra Cain
Deadly Class,"I'm certain that the show would've done really well if it was a CW show, fit right in on that network."
Deadly Class,I dont know what the fuck those idiots at syfy smoked when they decided to cancel it...such a good show
Deadly Class,"Agreed. It looked **so** good, although it could have done with one fewer edgy monologues that went on forever. That sort of thing really doesn't translate well to the screen; it barely worked in *Watchmen*."
Deadly Class,No it didn't.
Deadly Class,It was probably the most frustrating shows I‚Äôve ever watched. No wander it did not get a second season üòÇ
Deadly Class,SyFy.
Deadly Class,"I'm enjoying the hell out of this show, there's some great casting and character work going on, and the plotlines are very entertaining. Viktor is the goddamn man. ""Communism doesn't see rich or poor; just vagina!"""
Deadly Class,Very Remender tropey lol. They are getting reprinted in the next 3-5 months too which is great
Deadly Class,I do
Deadly Class,"Yes! I thought this show would be great on a streaming service! It is such a shame Syfy was given the rights to it! 

Look at how Sweet Tooth flourished on a service like Netflix!"
Deadly Class,"Yes! Part of me just wishes it got cancelled after s2. It'd have a somewhat more conclusive ending, albeit rather depressing."
Deadly Class,"Fuck no, it would have been so much worst on netflix"
Deadly Class,"Blood Drive...

Still stings."
Deadly Class,Yeah it did.
Deadly Class,"yeah, it at least would've been a more complete arc. The Freshmen finals would've been insane to see live action. Basically just Battle Royale"
Deadly Class,"Woulda got canceled anyways and we woulda been right back here lol.

Great comics, but I dont think syfy channel believed in itself. Which is crazy cause geeks are in control now and spend the most money."
Deadly Class,Might have got three seasons out of it tho.
Deadly Class,I really enjoyed the show and hate that it was canceled!
Deadly Class,This was probably my most anticipated moments when I was watching the show and I was so stoked they did an awesome job with it. Damn shame this show never had more seasons.
Deadly Class,"Still my favorite episode. Great show, I wish we could‚Äôve had more."
Deadly Class,To bad this show was on Syfy because it was was such an underrated show. It's a lot better than The Umbrella academy which I do enjoy and aired around the same time.
Deadly Class,"I'm not the acid king üò•


I loved this show, it got me into the comics which are great as well, then even more different comics."
Deadly Class,Yeah I think it suffered being on Syfy. It definitely seemed like a really promising world they were building.
Deadly Class,"I know!

Such a shame.

Another short lived SyFy show dies a tragic death."
Deadly Class,Love both shows!
Deadly Class,The next season would‚Äôve been absolutely dope too given what happens in the next two volumes.
Deadly Class,"I dknt know what happens in the comic at all, fill me in? Don‚Äôt mind spoilers Ive only  got one episode left now."
Deadly Class,"Honestly you should read them because they‚Äôre awesome but if you don‚Äôt want to well:

>!Maria goes missing after taking on El Diablo‚Äôs men solo (IIRC she actually kills a couple of them) and then Marcus spends most of volume 3 trying to figure out what happened to her until finals which is revealed to be a big battle royale between the rats and the legacies. The rats have to survive the night where as the legacies have to kill the rats.!<"
Deadly Class,"It seriously pisses me off that we'll never see the final exam adapted. That entire volume was *so* good and had the potential to be high entertainment on TV. 

Still can't quite believe no streaming service rescued it. This show would've had a third season by now if Netflix took it on. Granted, it probably would've been canceled, but at least we'd have the final exam."
Deadly Class,Wow! Awesome! Thank you.
Deadly Class,Did r/television change their spoiler settings?? You used to not be able to mark your spoilers like that
Deadly Class,It probably would‚Äôve only lasted like 2 or 3 episodes but man those episodes would be a real rollercoaster with how wild it would‚Äôve been.
Deadly Class,Couldn‚Äôt tell you I just used reddits site wide spoiler text
Deadly Class,[deleted]
Deadly Class,Damn it! Happy is fun af.
Deadly Class,"Really bummed about Deadly Class, but not shocked it was canned. Really hope it is picked up on somewhere else, hopefully the RUssos can get it picked up.

Suprised about Happy tho, totally saw syfy keeping that around for a lttle longer"
Deadly Class,Bummer I was looking forward to another season of Happy
Deadly Class,Sad but unsurprising.
Deadly Class,"Well, that sucks. I truly enjoyed Deadly Class."
Deadly Class,"Bummed about Happy, but it was too niche of a show. Maybe it will find home in Netflix? It already distributes it"
Deadly Class,"I might be wrong about this, but I honestly think these shows were DOA because of cable. The target audience especially for Deadly Class are teens but most teens consume media via streaming. No one wants to tune into a cable network at a specific time to watch one single episode."
Deadly Class,What the fuck. Happy was awesome.
Deadly Class,"> After a breakout first season for **Happy!**, linear ratings for the quirky comedy/drama series, starring Christopher Meloni and featuring the voice of Patton Oswalt, dropped sharply in Season 2. But the hybrid live-action/animated series reportedly **has been doing well in its second window on Netflix where it is said to be the streamer‚Äôs top performing second window drama, besides You, in key male demos and teens.**

It'll get picked up by Netflix."
Deadly Class,Those fucking dicks.
Deadly Class,Thanks for letting me never watch your station again SyFy.
Deadly Class,WHY HAPPY?! I was hoping for a Halloween season T_T
Deadly Class,"Ah man, that sucks. I watched the first season of Happy on Netflix and really enjoyed it, I was hoping that it would have lasted a few more seasons."
Deadly Class,Damn I loved both of these shows. Happy is such a niche show so I'm not that surprised but it is probably the most fun I've had watching a TV program lately.  I was certain that Deadly Class would be given a Season 2 after that cliffhanger ending too. Hopefully Netflix decides to save these shows. They better not cancel The Magicians or I'm done with their network.
Deadly Class,Damn I loved happy.
Deadly Class,"As much as this news pissed me off, I've got to wonder about the future of Sony TV. Them being an independent company in a TV world were everyone is doing in-house production has to be affecting them."
Deadly Class,"SyFy more like ""you're gonna watch nothing but The Magicians and you're gonna like it, also we hate Joseph Mallozzi with a passion and still hate MST3K"""
Deadly Class,NOOOO! Deadly class was so good! That's what I get for enjoying a syfy show. Screw them.
Deadly Class,"The Expanse  
Dark Matter  
Stargate: Universe  
Defiance  
Alphas  
Caprica  
Helix  
Farscape  
...  
Deadly Class  
Happy"
Deadly Class,Ive been slightly defending syfy cancelling a lot of stuff as theyve had some really good shows before but now idk what direction theyre gonna go. They pretty much just have the magicians (which I love but probably has only 1-2 seasons left) and thats it.
Deadly Class,"Not to be that guy, but... read the comics."
Deadly Class,"Man, it's been a bad week for Patton Oswalt."
Deadly Class,"Fucking hell. Come on, Netflix, pick up Happy"
Deadly Class,No! Deadly Class was really well done. They were really able to deliver the aesthetic and trippyness of the comic. Man. This is disappointing. The show would've gotten even better after where the season 1 ended.
Deadly Class,"Save Happy!

Screw SyFy!"
Deadly Class,Gotta save money for Krypton. You are all watching Krypton? Guys? Where is everyone going? ;)
Deadly Class,Hope the Russos shop it to Hulu.
Deadly Class,"What was the last good non-cancelled syfy show? Not American, so dont know exactly what theyre responsible for, but it seems like every syfy show I've ever liked gets cancelled early.

Stargate Atlantis, Incorporated, Stagate Universe, Eureka, and now Happy which I was planning to watch."
Deadly Class,"It's getting to the point that I don't want to start shows because they get canceled so quickly. There is so much content available now and so little free time in the day to watch. Fox is already on my dead to me list, I don't watch anything new they put out because it always ends up being canceled too quickly. 

Still pissed about The Mick

Happy! deserves to be on Netflix. It sucks as a show to watch once a week. So much better having all the episodes at once."
Deadly Class,"Poor Patton Oswalt. First AP Bio, then Happy."
Deadly Class,"I really want to see another season of Happy, especially with that insane final episode."
Deadly Class,"What is going on with this god damn channel! 

Wynonna Earp, we need more!"
Deadly Class,"I don't even know if I'm even gonna bother watching shows until they get a S4. It's getting outta hand how many unique,weird,inventive shows are being cancelled without even going more then 3 seasons. Syfy was one of my fav networks bc of The Expanse,The Magicians,Happy,Deadly Class,and Krypton, which will almost 100% be cancelled after this year also. So I'm done with watching anything new until 2022 unless its a mini-series or HBO series. 



 I'd rather just rewatch shows like,Chuck,Fringe,Breaking Bad,Veep,Curb,Scrubs and other Blu-Rays I have laying around and let reddit & word of mouth tell me what I need to watch in 2022."
Deadly Class,Did either show end in a cliffhanger?
Deadly Class,"This sucks. Happy ended in mostly such a bummer of a way, with all its characters lost in different ways."
Deadly Class,"Just a couple days ago I was thinking how much I love the current Syfy. What the fuck, man."
Deadly Class,"damn both of these are great, unique and interesting shows with great world building. hope they find other homes"
Deadly Class,"Deadly Class was amazing, but launched between Titans and Umbrella Academy and got completely lost in the shuffle because people hate SYFY so much they just refuse to give any shows from there a chance. 

I am sad now. I blame you people. This is a tv forum and there's way too many ""I never heard of Deadly Class.""    Why not go make yet another post about the same 5 shows?"
Deadly Class,"Fuck SyFy. What else is there to even say at this point? The people running things over there have no clue.  There‚Äôs no long term planning, no serious promotional efforts - hell, even their company name is cringe. 

I love the idea of a sci-fi centric tv channel, but SyFy ain‚Äôt it anymore. At this point I kinda wish they would get bought out or absorbed by some other entity, like WarnerMedia or another conglomerate.

Also, can I just say... WHY do the writers on SyFy shows continue to write season finales with cliffhangers? It‚Äôs risky enough ending a season that way on any channel without a confirmed renewal, but a particularly bad idea on SyFy where they cancel shows left and right. Now I won‚Äôt be able to recommend Deadly Class to anyone even though it had some great moments.

And I‚Äôm still not over what happened to Dark Matter."
Deadly Class,"Two surprise hit shows that I really enjoyed. Deadly Class was catering to a younger audience, but connected greatly with me with the themes, story telling, secrets, and especially characters. The show really fleshed out its characters well.

Happy! was very niche. Very, VERY unusual and creative. I very much hope that someone picks up Happy!."
Deadly Class,Deadly Class is the only show I was excited to watch each week. Really sad. üò¢
Deadly Class,"Sorry, what is the point of SyFy again?"
Deadly Class,What the absolute shit Syfy
Deadly Class,No one fucking knew about Deadly Class. No one. And everyone I showed it to thought it was cool.
Deadly Class,"Knew it was coming, still completely bummed."
Deadly Class,Of fucking course *Deadly Class* got canceled 2 weeks after I watched the whole season.
Deadly Class,"I started watching Killjoys about 2 years ago and didnt know SyFy. So glad it will get an ending and im really lucky as its one of the only show that gets one on SyFy.


Sad Happy! got cancelled I wanted to watch that one."
Deadly Class,Noooooo. I am not happy. Just watched the season two happy finale. It was tits out ball slapping awesome. Wish they'd stop cancelling these shows. Its getting pointless watching any shows just in case it gets cancelled.
Deadly Class,Both of these could have gone for at least 1 or 2 more seasons on Netflix before being unceremoniously cancelled
Deadly Class,"I don‚Äôt understand when people get surprised by SuckFy cancelling shows. How they stay in business is baffling when even their own in house shows can‚Äôt stay on the air. They have been doing this to show fans FOR YEARS. Close to a decade. They are one of the poorest marketing networks and treat their casts like crap. As soon as a show is successful, actors are going to want more money. SyFy says ‚Äúnope‚Äù. Show cancelled. Because they would rather move on. Probably because they are awful at contracting too. This network is designed for reclusive ADHD space and robot needs that exclusively watch YouTube videos under 5 minutes while streaming 5 hours of LoL. I stopped around 2011 with them. Won‚Äôt go back to their shows. SyFy is and always will be a network of syndicated fantasy and SciFi and shorty in-house B movies that sometimes hit. #getsomerealmanagement"
Deadly Class,deadly class was a good show but it was undermarketed and unfortunately came out around a similar time as umbrella academy
Deadly Class,"hope netflix saves DC. They hit it big w/ Umbrella academy, and Deadly class has a way better source to go off and build a franchise."
Deadly Class,For those who don't know Happy! is based on a graphic novel. They pretty much ran through the whole story in season 1 so was a bit surprised they were gonna do a second season. I still enjoyed season 1 but I hate when studios try to milk this type of content.
Deadly Class,syfy has already announced that  it is canceling a handful of shows set to premiere in 2020.
Deadly Class,That's fine.  Rick Remainder will have more time to write comic books now.
Swedish Dicks,Johan Glans is a national treasure here.
Swedish Dicks,Jag har alltid gillat Johan Glans s√• jag √§r lite nyfiken.
Swedish Dicks,I'm afraid to Google this.
Swedish Dicks,I follow stormare on Twitter and he talked about production but hasn't mentioned an air date that I've noticed. Has it started yet?
Swedish Dicks,there are 6 episodes out now
Swedish Dicks,Seen them all  - pretty good - swedish speaking bits with subs. 
Swedish Dicks,"The nutshell:  
""Swedish Dicks is an American-Swedish comedy web television series created by Glenn Lund and Peter Stormare (as Viking Brothers), Peter Settman and Andrew Lowery. The plot follows two unlicensed Swedish private investigators trying to make a living in Los Angeles. It premiered on September 2, 2016 via Swedish online streaming service Viaplay as its first original production. In the United States, it is scheduled to premiere in early 2017, as well as being distributed worldwide by American network Lionsgate TV.""  

I was on the fence for a bit at the start but it has grown on me."
Swedish Dicks,IMO 12 Monkeys is undersold on this list - it is a really satisfying show that has a tremendous finale.
Swedish Dicks,"Have you seen Battlestar Galactica (2003 Miniseries and 2004 Series?) Absolutely fantastic, one of my favorite shows and would definitely add it to the list if it hasn't been already. Effects especially hold up incredibly strong considering it was a shoestring budget in the mid-aughts."
Swedish Dicks,"I assume you haven't seen Battlestar Galactica (the remake) since its not on the list, i would really really recommend it for anyone who likes sci-fi."
Swedish Dicks,Have you checked out The OA yet? Kind of a slow start but even with being cancelled after the second season it‚Äôs a great watch
Swedish Dicks,"There is a distinct lack of Farscape on your list.  It started off as a poor man's Star Trek with muppets but toward the end of season one all the writers either started getting high when doing the plots or just said fuck it, let's make this weird and the show became trippy magic."
Swedish Dicks,"I sure hope you've seen Fringe and just forgot to mention it. If not, you better make it a priority!"
Swedish Dicks,"The Expanse becomes Game of thrones in space, but without the shitty final season, if you really watch it. Amos is an all-time classic TV character."
Swedish Dicks,"If you have not seen Babylon 5, that is definitely a show you need to add to your list. Definitely one of my favorite Sci-Fi shows of all time."
Swedish Dicks,"Have to give a big SECONDED!! for Into the Night. It's sooo good. 

Also, 11.22.63 was pretty good, but it cut out a good deal of important content from the book."
Swedish Dicks,Mr Robot is not a sci-fi show though?
Swedish Dicks,"I loved Raised by Wolves and See, they are some of my favorites new shows from these last years.
12 Monkeys was also great in my opinion.

I also have seen Altered Carbon,Legion,Dark,Maniac and Russian Doll from this list."
Swedish Dicks,"The Expanse is good, but it starts out rough. If I hadn‚Äôt read the books first, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have even finished the first season."
Swedish Dicks,No Battlestar? Get the fuck out
Swedish Dicks,Black Mirror
Swedish Dicks,"While mine are probably topped by Babylon 5, Farscape, BSG revival and DS9.

The Expanse has excellent production but I never liked it as much after Season 2.  And most people who love it all the way through seem to be book fans.  It's like they revealed this massive galaxy of stuff and then said ""Nah, let's stick with this solar system"""
Swedish Dicks,"I just binged Love Death + Robots, and....oh damn. All I can say is THANK YOU for the recommendation. Luck has it that season 2 is available on Friday, but I guess there was an earlier screening, because the sub is full of S2 chatter. Think I'll hold off for a week or so before joining."
Swedish Dicks,"> Raised by Wolves (HBO) ‚Äì I was hopeful about this one because it had Ridley Scott attached (my fave director) but it suffered like many of the lower numbers here for being too long, slow moving, and tried to do too much at once. It‚Äôs a pretty cool concept and has it's moments (Killer robots, epic, religious, intergalactic wars, that guy who plays Ragnar from Vikings) so you could try the first two episodes but I couldn‚Äôt do any more than three.

I made it up to I think episode 5 or 6, but gave up there for more or less the reasons you did. It was hard to like any of the characters, and the plot was moving too slowly.

Also, I've come to realize that Travis Fimmel seems to act pretty much the same way in every role I've seen him in. Vikings had him as Ragnar, the Warcraft movie had Fantasy Ragnar, and Raised By Wolves featured Space Ragnar."
Swedish Dicks,"Alice in Borderland

Sweet Home"
Swedish Dicks,"LEXX  https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115243/

Very much a strange show, almost entirely made on Green Screen.  Male, Female, Robot Head and Dead Assasin looking for a new home, or sex, whichever comes first.  Made in Canada. 


Charlie Jade https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408378/

Parallel worlds, where Alpha Earth wants to rape Beta Earth for all its natural resources, as they have run out.  Made in South Africa."
Swedish Dicks,Curious whether you've see Dark Matter.
Swedish Dicks,Love this list..... I mean I can't fuck with that little Black Mirror sneak diss you threw in there but great list either way hehe.
Swedish Dicks,You like dark sci-fi way more than I do.
Swedish Dicks,"As I was scrolling I was like, where's The Expanse? Lol."
Swedish Dicks,"Your list is lacking in space based scifi. Since you really liked Man in the High Castle maybe try For All Mankind, since it's also alternate history. It starts a bit slow though, really picks up from episode four on.

Also I really liked Raised By Wolves personally, but to each their own."
Swedish Dicks,"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo, in my opinion."
Swedish Dicks,"Your just a hater if you didn‚Äôt like electric dream. Very underrated show. Similar to black mirror as every episode is a new story, but I liked some of those episodes more than I did any of the black mirror episodes. Some were stinkers, just like certain black mirror episodes, but it doesn‚Äôt affect the entire season because every episode has its own story. I loved most of electric dream. Looking forward to season 2. It‚Äôs long overdue."
Swedish Dicks,"DEVS was amazing.  It's a slow burn, granted.  The payoff at the end is great though. I personally liked the mystery aspect too though and you seemed put off by that.  The show really works if you have an interest in theoretical physics and/or quantum computing too"
Swedish Dicks,"A little late to the party. How is it that ""Electric Dreams"", given my watchlist and viewing habits on Amazon, was *never* promoted to me? What an amazing and delightful series!

I have a love-hate relationship with ""The Expanse"", but I keep coming back to it. Same deal with ""The Boys"". 

I wonder if anyone will ever have the brass to do the Ringworld books."
Swedish Dicks,"I think it was a good show, especially as a fan of the original movie! I just think it suffered from overall sloppiness and eventually it just had so many potholes I couldn't keep it all straight xD I did watch it a long time ago though so maybe it's worth a rewatch, thanks for your input :)"
Swedish Dicks,"I watched Battlestar when I was younger! It is a great show, I'm just not a huge fan overall of early 2000's and earlier sci-fi (Firefly being the exception). Appreciate the recco, though! Maybe eventually I'll take a stab at it :)"
Swedish Dicks,LOVED the OA! I thought the second season faltered a little bit but the first season was just wow.
Swedish Dicks,"> a poor man's Star Trek with muppets

I feel like that gives people the wrong impression though. Star Trek was more exploration whereas Farscape is adventure and survival. Farscape is more like Battlestar Galactica, if the Galactica had a dysfunctional crew of half a dozen criminals and no guns larger than a pistol. 

Which is also not a great analogy."
Swedish Dicks,This sounds awesome and I've never heard of it!!! Thank you!!!
Swedish Dicks,I take Fringe as a given!!! One of my all-time-faves.
Swedish Dicks,I've heard that about the Expanse! Just haven't worked up to it/had the time to dive in. It's 100% on my list though.
Swedish Dicks,Thanks for the recommendation :)
Swedish Dicks,"I KNOW RIGHT! I seriously had no expectations and it blew me out of the water.

And that's good to know-- I had no content going into 11.22.63, and generally got what was going on but couldn't shake the feeling  like I was missing something."
Swedish Dicks,"It's catagorized as one, and I would say that it takes place in a psuedo-near future with some futuristic technology/events taking place so it fits, if loosely."
Swedish Dicks,"I loved those two also. RbW faltered a little in the middle, but mostly because I couldn't tell where they were headed. I really enjoyed See but I don't take it too seriously so it meets my expectations as a light action show."
Swedish Dicks,"They are definitely cool shows, don't get me wrong! The visuals in Raised by Wolves are particularly cool. And 12 Monkeys def had it's moments :)"
Swedish Dicks,"These are just the shows I've seen recently, but thank you for your input!"
Swedish Dicks,OMG. I knew the second season was coming out soon but I didn't know it was THAT soon! Happy watching my friend :)
Swedish Dicks,I totally feel that about Travis (thank you for the name btw!) But I sort of love him like that? Maybe it's just my love for him in the first few seasons of Vikings bleeding over that colors my opinion.
Swedish Dicks,Alice in Borderland was a bit too intense for me but I'll def check out Sweet Home!
Swedish Dicks,FYI: Lexx is available free and Charlie Jade is available for purchase on Amazon Prime (US). Couldn't find them anywhere else.
Swedish Dicks,">Dark Matter

I have not yet! I'll add that one to my list. :)"
Swedish Dicks,"I love me some Black Mirror!!!! It's a fucking fantastic show. I think some episodes are better than others as well but def check out Love Death Robots if you haven't seen it yet, every episode is killer. :)"
Swedish Dicks,Guilty as charged :)
Swedish Dicks,Plot holes?! Like what! I‚Äôve found it to be one of the most tightly plotted shows I‚Äôve ever seen. So much foreshadowing and all the loose ends are tied up so satisfyingly.
Swedish Dicks,It's kinda like star trek and Battlestar Galactica had a baby and it was raised by stargate
Swedish Dicks,I just go by how some of it was like a weird cut / paste of Star Trek early on.  Especially D'Argo who was just a version of Worf in the early days.
Swedish Dicks,Keep in mind the sole earth Human on the show has PTSD and no way to deal with it in a foreign alien galaxy other than going crazier as the show progresses
Swedish Dicks,"Phew. Crisis averted! I only just watched it last year, but what an incredible show."
Swedish Dicks,I heard about 3 weeks before the last season started. Finally gave it a try. Binged 4 seasons in under 2 wks.
Swedish Dicks,I'll have to agree with this one. You owe it to yourself to get on it. One of the best SF shows EVER. And I've seen them all.
Swedish Dicks,"That's cool. I didn't start watching Vikings until recently (I'm up to the early third season) so I saw the other two first, and it made more of an impression on me of ""Either this dude only has one setting, or he keeps getting hired by people who are huge fans of Vikings."""
Swedish Dicks,"Charlie Jade used to be on Netflix, but not anymore."
Swedish Dicks,"Good show but it was cancelled too early, just to warn you"
Swedish Dicks,"yea i loved Love, Death + Robot."
Swedish Dicks,Farscape is hard to describe.
Swedish Dicks,"I remember way back in the day on some message board a guy was watching the show for the first time and had just finished the Crackers Dont Matter episode and made a comment of ""Ben Browder plays crazy really well"" to which all of us who had seen the whole series laughed because we knew he'd only seen the tip of the iceberg."
Swedish Dicks,Oh wow that sounds right up my alley.
Swedish Dicks,"Yeah that's what most sci-fi shows are missing all the shit their characters go through and they're fine the next episode, they might do a one off episode where they deal with mental pain and that's it. Farscape since the first 10 minutes he's constantly shot at, kidnapped, imprisoned, tortured, dissected, deatomized, driven to delusions by the weirdest Muppet monsters you can imagine and he keeps getting more manic and mood swingy staving off one psychotic break after another. I try showing my friends episodes and they're always saying he nuts. Like wouldn't you be too?"
Swedish Dicks,"Man, that video player works quite well."
Swedish Dicks,"Aftonbladet is our largest newspaper and sucks badly. Here you go:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Wp9iNINHMc

Conan's reaction:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo_kW2jp63Q"
Swedish Dicks,"I guess they don't understand Conan's humor. He wasn't upset at all, he was just doing a bit. Conan always jokes about himself. "
Swedish Dicks,Are Swedish Cartoon Genitals OK On TBS?http://teamcoco.com/video/swedish-gentials
Swedish Dicks,"Well, there's your answer, fishbulb."
Swedish Dicks,You know you're famous when someone models a cartoon penis after you.
Swedish Dicks,[deleted]
Swedish Dicks,"ok I'm a woman and I would be so flattered if that penis was modeled after me (you know, a woman, so the penis would have no reason to be modeled on me). That is the cutest damn penis in the world "
Swedish Dicks,Can uhh... I get a dick pic?
Swedish Dicks,So... What is this video about? Safe sex? 
Swedish Dicks,I'm a little surprised that Fallon isn't complaining about the vagina being modeled on him!
Swedish Dicks,"How did he find out? Does the cartoon penis have [one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFR5oZQrIVc) implanted, too?"
Swedish Dicks,"What the fuck?...

Conan still has a show?"
Swedish Dicks,I guess you could say his real name is Conan O'Bangin' 
Swedish Dicks,Who is the woman on the far right?
Swedish Dicks,"Yeah I suppose they look alike in the sense that both have red hair..
Looks like Conan is a little short on material"
Swedish Dicks,"Swedish is not very pleasant to the war, is it? I'm biased bc I'm more used to the romantic languages that tend to sound like silk in comparison. "
Swedish Dicks,"Oh yeah! With that 1px height progress bar and stuff, it's so easy to use!"
Swedish Dicks,Oh those crazy Swedes.
Swedish Dicks,Somebody is costumes had to make that penis costume... Probably on very short notice
Swedish Dicks,"I think they were trying to be edgy and funny and didn't get the reaction they wanted so they're forcing conflict to save face. Either way, it just makes me cringe reading that like Conan is actually offended or something."
Swedish Dicks,I don't think thats subtle at all...
Swedish Dicks,"Yeah, that site was horrible, and I refuse to spend more time on it trying to find an image."
Swedish Dicks,RIP both your inbox and your eyes. You're going to need a detox on r/cute for a month
Swedish Dicks,"I'm paraphrasing but it's basically about human anatomy but presented in a kid friendly manner (it aired on a Swedish kids channel). Boys have a penis and girls have a hoo-ha. They're cool and we pee from them. Etc.

They say nothing about sex, because that's probably too much."
Swedish Dicks,"Vagina with... the claps?


Not even sorry."
Swedish Dicks,"But he was right. So, yeah, there's that."
Swedish Dicks,"Well it doesn't sound like Conan pronounced it, that was some German shit. People use to say that Swedish sounds like we are singing because we have a very different talking melody. "
Swedish Dicks,Swedish is easy on the ear and generally quite clear. It has a singing melody as well.
Swedish Dicks,">Can call if he's hurt

It was a really weird to thing to say. I wasn't sure if it was sarcasm or some Swedish humor that doesn't translate well in English. "
Blood of Zeus,"Less money and time because the source material wasnt as popular as the others, which led Netflix to not believe it would do as well."
Blood of Zeus,The answer for poor animation work is always not enough money and/or time.
Blood of Zeus,Lower budget because it's not an existing up?
Blood of Zeus,"Speaking of which, did the show get cancelled? 2 years since it came out and I haven't seen any news about it. It was interesting enough to binge."
Blood of Zeus,[deleted]
Blood of Zeus,"I read somewhere that there would be a season 2, is this true?"
Blood of Zeus,It was renewed shortly after the first season came out but that's the only real news about it.
Blood of Zeus,Because both aren't really worth mentioning
Blood of Zeus,What?
Blood of Zeus,**BECAUSE BOTH AREN'T REALLY WORTH MENTIONING!**
Blood of Zeus,You two are idiots üòÇ
Blood of Zeus,Seeing American-made animation that isn't for kids and isn't comedy pleases me greatly.
Blood of Zeus,Great timing with the all Hades hype.
Blood of Zeus,"Hades: the series

awesome"
Blood of Zeus,"As with all good Greek myths, Zeus has yet again cheated on Hera and had a bastard."
Blood of Zeus,Castlevaniaesque
Blood of Zeus,I was sold in the first 10 seconds. This looks amazing.
Blood of Zeus,Hearing that upbeat [Lacrimosa](https://youtu.be/k1-TrAvp_xs) by Mozart was an interesting choice.
Blood of Zeus,"""You are the son of Zeus""  
God damnit, Zeus. The hell's wrong with ye?"
Blood of Zeus,Attack on... Titans!
Blood of Zeus,"Really looking forward to this!!

So, is it a reimagining of Hercules?"
Blood of Zeus,[removed]
Blood of Zeus,Looks pretty cool! Would absolutely love a series like this but revolving around Norse mythology <3
Blood of Zeus,Hot damn.  Looks great.
Blood of Zeus,"I‚Äôm down.  I love anything Greek mythology.  All those terrible movies they aren‚Äôt afraid to keep making, yeah that‚Äôs on me."
Blood of Zeus,Props for Mozart's Requiem in a trailer!
Blood of Zeus,"Zeus having sex, with the bees and the eagles"
Blood of Zeus,"Okay, I‚Äôll bite"
Blood of Zeus,"Looks dope, might have to give it a watch."
Blood of Zeus,Why do all the eyes look dead though
Blood of Zeus,The animation looks like stiff and lifeless 1980s She-ra and He-man stuff. It's so ugly and the colour palette is awful. Why would anyone make this look like this?
Blood of Zeus,The Gigantomachy? I‚Äôm in.
Blood of Zeus,"Looks cool, but what's the point of watching it? Netflix will probably cancel it."
Blood of Zeus,"AND . . . it's canceled. Move along, nothing to see here."
Blood of Zeus,"I was like Alexander? But no, some guy named Heron."
Blood of Zeus,this....is...good
Blood of Zeus,Well I‚Äôm fuckin in
Blood of Zeus,Looks great. Looking forward to it.
Blood of Zeus,Kratos would like to know your location.
Blood of Zeus,This looks amazing
Blood of Zeus,can't wait for this to get cancelled half way though season 2
Blood of Zeus,"I didn't look into it, but if I had to guess, I'd say the people who made Castlevania made this too."
Blood of Zeus,CastleVania vibes and there's also a little hint of Voltron.
Blood of Zeus,Nice. Adult animated anything is my jam.
Blood of Zeus,Is that Wayne June narrating???
Blood of Zeus,I will feel particularly excellent pirating this from netflix.
Blood of Zeus,"Is this from the same guys who made Castlevania? Looks similar. Also, are there any other series like this?"
Blood of Zeus,Is this made by the same studio that's worked on Castlevania? The animation looks very similar.
Blood of Zeus,"God damn, that looks badass! 

A non-comedic adult-aimed western animated action series with a focus on ancient Greek mythology? Sign me the fuck up! The less rare these sorts of productions become the better it is for both the medium and its fans."
Blood of Zeus,"Getting mad at Netflix for cancelling shows needs to stop, wtf else are they gonna do if the show tanks? Spend money to renew it and have it be another waste of money?

I get they cancel shows a lot but it‚Äôs only natural when you‚Äôre putting out a lot of originals to see what sticks.

Also netflix has done other bad shit that inexcusable (I.e cuties) so I‚Äôm not tryna fully say they do no wrong here."
Blood of Zeus,How is this anime? I'm not understanding... looks cool tho...
Blood of Zeus,Looks so cool. Giving me Ulysses 31 vibes.
Blood of Zeus,"Been a long time anime hater, seen avatar but that‚Äôs it, and this has me hooked from the start. I find myself rewatching the trailer for more of this ‚Äúepic‚Äù story and how it might piece together. Plus it‚Äôs just really smooth and pretty lol"
Blood of Zeus,Cool!
Blood of Zeus,"So, how many seasons until this one gets cancelled?  Two or three?"
Blood of Zeus,"Netflix has all the data and demographics for all the people who watch anime on their service. 

They know this shit sells really well. It is sad though that it has taken this long for someone to see the appeal of something that Japan has capitalized on for over 30 years."
Blood of Zeus,Castlevania doing well really helped things for the genre on Netflix
Blood of Zeus,Have you watched castlevania or seis manos? It‚Äôs on Netflix.
Blood of Zeus,Primal started back up if you watch that and if not you should start. (though idk for sure if its American. could be Canadian or something idk)
Blood of Zeus,"If it's American made, why is it called an anime ?"
Blood of Zeus,"Right? I've been wanting shows like this, Castlevania and Seis Manos ever since I was Avatar the Last Airbender was a kid 15 years ago. Serialized, action focused, for an older crowd. Finally they're here."
Blood of Zeus,We really need more of this.
Blood of Zeus,Right? I love anime for its amazing animation and fighting and thats such a rarity for western stuff
Blood of Zeus,What hades hype?
Blood of Zeus,"UNTAGGED SPOILERS because /r/television auto-removes comments with spoiler tags in them

Hades is one of the first takes on Greek mythology in a long time that doesn't just make Hades the bad guy. I also found it refreshing how petty and vindictive and jealous every Olympian god is. Felt like it got the source material far better than most modern versions.

Good stuff."
Blood of Zeus,Was there a show about Hades that was announced?
Blood of Zeus,Right? Perfect time to cash in on that Hades hype.
Blood of Zeus,"Dude I‚Äôm right in the middle of playing Hades and when I saw this trailer get released, I got so excited."
Blood of Zeus,Just got past Elysium for the first time todayalso Bouldy is best waifu
Blood of Zeus,"He kinda has to -  he has lightning bolts, he fucks every woman he sees plus some other assorted animals and buckets of water, and he doesn't get along with titans.   These are the 3 character elements you need to make a Zeus."
Blood of Zeus,It's not cheating if youre in goose form
Blood of Zeus,And it looks like Hera is a villain in this as well.
Blood of Zeus,"Same animators/artists, which is a good thing. They have a style that works for their (Netflix) anime."
Blood of Zeus,Considering castlevania is literally one of the best things on netflix - I'm goin to watch it for sure.
Blood of Zeus,Immediately what I thought.
Blood of Zeus,Yup
Blood of Zeus,Y‚ÄôALL SHOULD WATCH GANGSTA.  THEN MAYBE WE COULD GET NETFLIX TO PICK THAT UP !!!!!!! üò¢üò≠üôèüèº

They just distribute what other people make."
Blood of Zeus,Because it's different animators?
Blood of Zeus,Kengan Ashura has some rad fight animation even if it's CG.
Blood of Zeus,"You might be getting something like that at some point in the future.

https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/zack-snyder-norse-mythology-anime-series-netflix-1203264664/"
Blood of Zeus,"I would love that as well! 

Eventually maybe one about Egypt too, just for the fun of it. I feel like you never see that done"
Blood of Zeus,"I'll take some of that blame too. Anything mythology related I watch, I've seen some bad Greek and norse films."
Blood of Zeus,Yeah that was my thought as well. That means the main guy will be Heracles right? From memory the giants were originally born of Gaia not the Titans so it looks like they're changing it up
Blood of Zeus,Not if it gets hype
Blood of Zeus,"Sigh...castlevania is going on its 3rd and its 4th season is being made right now, if this gets the same amount of hype and viewership it‚Äôll get renewed in a heartbeat.

Netflix is a business and if shit they spend money on doesn‚Äôt do well they are gonna cancel it, they won‚Äôt renew it if it will probably cause them to lose money. Netflix does stupid shit but then cancelling shows usually is a smart business move on their part."

Blood of Zeus,"Tbh, they tend to let their animated stuff have full runs."
Blood of Zeus,"How is it not anime? Most people use it to refer to the Japanese style of animation. To the Japanese it is just that, animation regardless of origin. No reason why you can't refer to it as anime even it is made in the US or and other country for that matter.

Also ""anime"" is usually catered to older audiences while ""cartoons"" cater to younger."
Blood of Zeus,It‚Äôs anime
Blood of Zeus,[deleted]
Blood of Zeus,"There was adult-aimed American made animation pushed in the 70s and early 80s with folks like Ralph Bakshi and the guys at Heavy Metal. They were fantastic, but they just didn't catch on that well. Mainstream audiences just weren't ready for them."
Blood of Zeus,"Yes.  The former is excellent, the latter is okay at best."
Blood of Zeus,the definition of anime is changing as time goes on and the medium becomes more popular.
Blood of Zeus,"Because Anime has become a global thing, and a style of its own thanks in part to the internet. Hardcore weebs will gatekeep that it's not true anime if it doesn't originally come from Japan, but the fact is it's no longer some niche hobby. Anime is being made for a global market now, and as it continues to grow those who grow up being influenced by it will start to create it themselves. Just look at how available even the most niche anime is compared to 20-30 years ago. You can find almost anything produced these days officially subtitled within hours of it broadcasting. Compare this to people who had to subtitle bootleg vhs copies in the 80s & 90s, or the fan subbing boom of the early 00s."
Blood of Zeus,"Because people are using the term ""anime"" incorrectly."
Blood of Zeus,"It's not anime, it's just animation."

1. She goes to an orphanage but the children don't bully her on her first night and the matron is actually gentle-hearted and doesn't stop her playing chess when she finds out she has been playing in the basement.

2. She enters a chess tournament with all men and they all end up being chivalrous and kind. Shoutout to the twins.

3. Her adoptive mother ends up being really supportive even when she finds out Beth is drinking and staying at a party with college boys. Their relationship was actually really well done - often vices end up with explosive fallouts but it didn't happen.

4. Borgov was actually quite dismissive of his yes-men sidekicks when they were discussing Beth, and he was very warm when he lost the final.

5. Her addiction to alcohol and medication didn't end up killing her in the end via suicide or OD.

It was super refreshing not having to worry about these plot points you've seen a thousand times."
The Queens Gambit,Netflix recommended Queens Gambit to me so i thought i would watch few minutes of the first episode just to see what it was about... I ended staying up all night and watch the Whole series in one sitting!  Best series I've seen all year.
The Queens Gambit,"For anyone interested in the chess side of it, check out agadmator‚Äôs analysis on YouTube of some of the games from the series. Beyond being interesting from a chess standpoint, it really shows the level of detail that went into making the series. Little comments like a move being better than what was played are not just plot points and dialogue, but are proven by computer analysis. The camera shots are quick enough that they could‚Äôve easily gotten away with the characters making any moves and the drama still would‚Äôve worked. But they took the time to choreograph each game of chess perfectly to the level expected by the plot, including 1960s grandmaster level and make every line of chess-related dialog accurate."
The Queens Gambit,Upvoting and gtfo-ing because I haven't finished yet but it's soo good
The Queens Gambit,"I really liked the outfits haha, amongst other things. Couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off of Anya."
The Queens Gambit," I highly recommend Godless, it‚Äôs by the same person as QG, and is a period piece in the Wild West era"
The Queens Gambit,I think the scenes between Marielle Heller as the mother and Anna Taylor-Joy is some of the best acting I've seen.
The Queens Gambit,"I'm not usually a binger, but I watched the entire thing over like 3 days while working from home. It was absolutely incredible. The only critique I would have is that the Benny Watts character casting took me out of it for a couple episodes when he was first introduced. I don't mind the character, though."
The Queens Gambit,"What I loved about is it never went the way I expected it to. 

The janitor wasn't creepy, the orphanage was mostly nice. It was just absolutely class storytelling. Had me gripped from the start"
The Queens Gambit,"I loved watching a tv show that has a brilliant, troubled, messy female character. All shows of this ilk usually have men as these ‚Äúbrilliant but troubled‚Äù types ie House or Sherlock for example so it‚Äôs encouraging that a show is centering women who are extremely gifted but willing to show the nuances of it and not ‚Äúround them out‚Äù or worry about making the woman more likable (she‚Äôs clumsy! She‚Äôs dorky! She gets into silly hi-jinx with her girlfriends! All of that syrupy shit basically)"
The Queens Gambit,This was the best show I've seen on Netflix in a while. I sat down yesterday to watch an episode or two but got hooked  and ended up binging it. I hope they do more mini series since you don't have to worry about them getting canceled.
The Queens Gambit,"I don't play chess and don't know much about it, but I quickly fell in love with this show. I can't remember the last time I was so captived by a storyline."
The Queens Gambit,My friend and I regularly debate who is better: Anya Taylor-Joy or Florence Pugh. We‚Äôve decided the winner is the audience.
The Queens Gambit,I really like the concept of limited series. No danger of it being cancelled halfway through.
The Queens Gambit,[removed]
The Queens Gambit,Can I enjoy this show if I don't even understand the basic rules of chess?
The Queens Gambit,"Something really cool to point out, looking at her clothing, it‚Äôs very geometric. There‚Äôs squares and checkers and plaid on so many of her outfits. They literally dressed her to resemble a chess board. And that last outfit where they dressed her like the queen piece! Absolutely stunning show in every way. She also never wore pants until (spoiler) her mother passes, symbolising her having to grow and mature. I can‚Äôt get over how well this was done"
The Queens Gambit,"And for his portrayal of Benny Watts, the Emmy goes to David Spade."
The Queens Gambit,"Fantastic show.  Acting, writing, dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack.

My only gripe was [spoiler](#s ""the last episode which kind of spoiled it for me.  It went from a complex character drama about a traumatized genius struggling with addiction - chess, love, sex, drugs, alcohol, dependency - into a kind of Saturday morning cartoon where her lost love shows up out of the blue and all her friends/exes break character to team up and help save the day.  I felt like the whole show was a study into this kind of obsessive compulsive behaviour and how people can struggle to define and balance themselves in the face of loss.  But everything just resolved itself and tied itself up with a somewhat cheap 'together we can do anything' bow.  While it was nice to see characters I emotionally connected with get happy endings, it also felt like everything that came before just lost a lot of its poignancy."")

But great show nonetheless.  Fantastic direction, especially with how every chess match/tournament is shot and conveyed.

___

Edit: A lot of people explaining the ending to me (and downvoting me for saying as much). I got it. I understand what happened. I understand what they were going for. I get it. I get the unplanned move.  I get her adapting herself.  I got it.

My point is that I didn't like it, and I would have preferred it went a different direction.  

[spoiler](#s ""The show was very much about addiction and growing past your yourself.  From Benny (who seemed like a superstar until you see his home and see what his obsessive lifestyle had done to him), to Harry (who came to terms with it, and grew out of it; not determining his value as a person by his skill but by how he treated others - hence the grocery store line), to even Mrs. Wheatley (who's injury clearly diminished her from a woman who was strictly and absolutely in control, from her orphanage to her soul).  That all is fleeting and life takes everything away; nothing lasts and no man/woman is king forever, and those who come to terms with it, and those who hurtle towards it like a car over a cliff."")

[spoiler](#s ""The point is that Beth's growth as a player shouldn't have been the focus, but rather her growth as a person; the chess was a backdrop to her humanity, not her superpower to beat the villains.  All the value she had for herself, because of her abandonment and trauma, came from chess.  That in all other aspects of life, she was awkward and alien to the world around her.  And disassociating from that, and growing the way Harry or Jolene had, should have been the point.  It should have been about learning to resolve the issues she'd spent her life running from.  Her addiction wasn't pills and alcohol, it was estrangement and escapism."")

[spoiler](#s ""But then, in a very strange turn, it all just became a punch up with the big bad Russians that Team America had to defeat, and Beth's journey was more or less pointless because her learning to not use drugs and 'she had it in her all along'...was somehow the new point?  And it's fine, it was well handled.  But that's also the story of Teen Wolf.  That's the story and theme of hundreds of thousands of children's stories where 'someone hurt overcomes their mistrust and learns to work as a team' or 'it was in me all along' is the end lesson and it just felt like the show was building towards something different and more nuanced, rather than something so childish and simple."")

Just my two cents anyway (since I'm being downvoted for trying to explain myself below)."
The Queens Gambit,"It most certainly is. Writing, acting, costume, sets, music, cinematography, FX - all superlative."
The Queens Gambit,I worried for a bit that the old janitor would fall into the ‚Äúhelpful dude except that he‚Äôs rape-y and steals her success.‚Äù Was really taken aback by how he was the absolute polar opposite and happily expected nothing in return.
The Queens Gambit,I was impressed how they managed to visualize chess play and make it still look interesting after several episodes
The Queens Gambit,"Watched it last night. Based on the trailer, I thought it looked only ok. But I gave it a try anyways.

I watched and finished it in one night. It was fantastic."
The Queens Gambit,"I love how they portrayed addiction in this show. Her addiction is not magically fixed when [Spoiler](#s ""she's determined to get clean and tossed the drugs away, she still asked the front desk where she could buy more. She stops drinking but considers it for a second when she was offered vodka. Addiction never really goes away, it's a steep and slippery climb."")"
The Queens Gambit,"Just started watching this last night. I watched 4 episodes before I made myself go to sleep. I'm planning on finishing it today, it's good!"
The Queens Gambit,"Best Netflix tv show this year. And Anya needs to star in a old Hollywood type of movie asap, she just has that look"
The Queens Gambit,Just binged this SO good
The Queens Gambit,"I was really engrossed with this. I am not a chess player, but the way the chess matches are shown, you don't need to know it to enjoy it. The acting and conversations about it make the tension and significance of moves and matches well understood.

The acting is just phenomenal, I highly recommend this."
The Queens Gambit,"Was I the only one who felt the ending was a complete circle returning to her lost childhood, playing chess with an old man who was her only real father figure?"
The Queens Gambit,"As a chess player, loved the show."
The Queens Gambit,Really well done series
The Queens Gambit,"It was good, but being an Appalachian/Lexington KY resident, I think there may have been two people who had any kind of southern accent."
The Queens Gambit,"As someone who played chess in middle school with a serious chess club, I loved how they didn't go too technical into the chess world but went deep enough to make you interested. Also, they even moved the pieces correctly!!! That's a big one. Most of the times, chess is played poorly in movies."
The Queens Gambit,Incredible show. I hope she wins an Emmy for that staggering performance
The Queens Gambit,"Isn't anyone gonna talk about how AWESOME the lighting was in the MOVIE, I'm not a Filmotologist or anything but the lighting really brought out the emotions of how she feels, OMG~"
The Queens Gambit,"Game against Borgov was based on 1993 with Ivanchuk vs. Wolf in the Buel Interzonal. It ended in a draw but it was ‚Äòplayed out‚Äô by by a couple of grandmaster Bruce Pandolfini and Gary Kasparov. 

If you want to watch an analysis of the game https://youtu.be/oIMaTKOZG-8

Edit: for clarification, Pandolfini and Kasparov scripted the game forward from the draw for the show."
The Queens Gambit,"Yes I love this show. I also appreciated the elephant in the room, racism during this time portrayed truthfully. A lot of period pieces, have a tendency to omit it despite it being a very significant part of history and just placing a black character for the sake of it. They acknowledged it properly, would have appreciated a second storyline on a special young lady. I think it would‚Äôve made a beautiful contrast."
The Queens Gambit,Binged it and it was very satisfying. What a great show.
The Queens Gambit,I liked it so much I got it on Audible. Hoping the book is even better..
The Queens Gambit,This show is so unbelievably good
The Queens Gambit,[deleted]
The Queens Gambit,It was sooo good. The wife and I binged it in a day
The Queens Gambit,"Loved it from start to finish. A lovely slice of life done properly. Wonderful costumes, music and cinematography. And the acting was wonderful too. No major complaints."
The Queens Gambit,One of the best shows on Netflix since Russian Doll.
The Queens Gambit,Really enjoyed the show!
The Queens Gambit,"I hope they can make a second season?  Or whatever.  Doubtful but it was extremely enjoyable. 

I told a friend the actress was sneaky hot and he immediately replied ""Uhhh....."".  Didn't realize at the time he was still on EP1 when she was a child lol"
The Queens Gambit,Pure class
The Queens Gambit,This is a superb series.
The Queens Gambit,"We just finished the series. At first I thought it was a biopic not a fiction.  Still good.
For a period design that is on the screen for 2 seconds, check out the costume on the soviet airlines stewardess.  That is some cold war soviet fashion there. It is in the chapter where she goes to Moscow for the final match."
The Queens Gambit,Bill Camp is an underrated actor loved him since The Night Of
The Queens Gambit,Outstanding! I stayed up to 4am binge watching
The Queens Gambit,"To be fair, only a small part of it was about her getting her period. More like a Drugs/Alcohol/Chess Drama."
The Queens Gambit,"I thought this was an excellent series. The plot was inventive, the quality was great, and it had few downsides."
The Queens Gambit,This was an awesome series. Didn‚Äôt think I would be hooked going into it. Highly recommended.
The Queens Gambit,Absolutely phenomenal show
The Queens Gambit,Amazing show. Perfect.
The Queens Gambit,It‚Äôs such a damn good show.
The Queens Gambit,This show sucked me in and I watched all 8 episodes in two days. Very cool show
The Queens Gambit,"Loved it.  We watched it because we were bored not because it sounded particularly great or interesting.  It was just new.  Great series all around.  The acting was stellar, the plot was great and the story was well thought out and executed.  I could use more like that for sure."
The Queens Gambit,Love the costume and set design!
The Queens Gambit,"I've been looking forward for this show, and still I'm shocked at how amazing it is. The best thing I've seen this year."
The Queens Gambit,"Close your eyes dear.

Binged it, not the best tv iv seen but its creamy enough to rise to the top."
The Queens Gambit,"It was so well done that I was convinced it was based on a true story the whole way through, even though I knew ahead of time it wasn‚Äôt. Fiction that mimics reality is very difficult and quite powerful."
The Queens Gambit,"On paper this sounds like the most boring show you can imagine, but it is just so well done. Was hooked from the first episode."
The Queens Gambit,"I don‚Äôt give a shit about chess but the first episode hooked me in with the quality of the show, my parents unexpectedly were hooked on it when I called them to check up on them, they basically told me to get lost they were watching the whole thing lmao

Netflix making good original programming, a shocker"
The Queens Gambit,I'm about half way through it and extremely impressed with it!
The Queens Gambit,I have not enjoyed a show that much in a long time.  The acting and writing was superb.  I‚Äôll watch it again over thanksgiving weekend
The Queens Gambit,"It was one of the best things I've ever watched.  It looks like it's going to be super serious and almost heavy to watch, but it wasn't at all.  IDK why, but it almost had a happy quality to it.  I have a shit attention span and watched the whole thing in 2 days."
The Queens Gambit,Such a great show and an amazing performance. I absolutely loved it
The Queens Gambit,"I went in thinking *hm strong woman lead I‚Äôm about it* and then was pretty blown away. The actors nail it and the writing is something to learn from. 
The entire concept was something I truly appreciated."
The Queens Gambit,That‚Äôs a mother fucken fine television show right thur!
The Queens Gambit,"I regret finishing it too fast. This is one of those rare shows that would benefit from a weekly release, absolutely loved every second of it."
The Queens Gambit,"I just clicked on it because it seemed like something I could easily ignore while working. 

I paid attention. 

I‚Äôm as enthralled with the audiobook. 

I don‚Äôt play chess even a little bit."
The Queens Gambit,"The show was masterfully done. But the script caught me off guarded because she's so naturally good at chess. Like a shot of a star, suddenly from county champion to winning against World Chess Champion."
The Queens Gambit,It was so refreshing to watch a series with a strong female lead that wasn‚Äôt a fucking super hero and the males weren‚Äôt two-dimensional misogynists or rapists. Refreshing and absolutely wonderful. Even better the second time through!
The Queens Gambit,"It‚Äôs an awesome show. Writing, acting and directing are all top notch üëç"
The Queens Gambit,"Beyond being a really good show, I was so so pleasantly surprised that she was not sexually, emotionally or physical abused, or taken adantage of, inspite of her traumatic past and emotional baggage. As a character she was allowed so much agency in her life, it was really beautiful to see."
The Queens Gambit,I put this on as background noise and ended up binging the entire thing. Now I‚Äôm crushing on Anya Taylor
The Queens Gambit,ATJ just constantly blows me away. One of my favorite actresses.  She does everything from horror to thrillers to period drama perfectly.
The Queens Gambit,Great show and Anya is a real beauty that Bobby Fischer could never be.
The Queens Gambit,"As someone from Lexington, Kentucky, this was a VERY pleasant surprise."
The Queens Gambit,I literally watched the entire series in one day.. truly a master piece
The Queens Gambit,"I loved it, honestly really want to play Chess now too. Was a fantastic drama despite being about something many would consider tame/boring."
The Queens Gambit,"Man I did not do my homework on this. Unexpected chess series and nothing about royals. There are not a lot of series that kan keep me on the edge of my chair and make me cry like a newborn. Damn this one is good!

Ps. new Scarlett Johansson? I‚Äôm game."
The Queens Gambit,"It's a great series. I have no interest in chess whatsoever but the story, cinematography and Anya Taylor-Joy's knock out performance were incredible! Highly recommended. Solid 9/10."
The Queens Gambit,Hopping on the ‚ÄúI just plowed through this in a few days‚Äù bandwagon. Love a historical fiction story with gorgeous costumes.
The Queens Gambit,"I wanted to love this movie. I loved the main actress and her performance. Sadly, I cannot say I enjoyed this series much at all :/

The main character, Beth, was so outlandishly gifted, that it just comes off as lazy pandering. I love seeing movies that portray girls as being capable of going up against the big boys. I can see the value in telling empowering stories to girls, even if it can sometimes mean embellishing things a bit. This show does much more than a little embellishing though.

During the 1960s, a time when there where very few professional female chess players, Beth is not only better than any other male player in the entire world, she is also in her early 20s and looks like a model... 

Even if this movie was made about a modern day female chess prodigy who was born into a family of grandmasters, I would still find it hard to believe."
The Queens Gambit,Period drama. Apt description.
The Queens Gambit,Every month there's period drama
The Queens Gambit,I'm currently watching this now and really enjoying it.
The Queens Gambit,Not really. It feels reeeeally stretched.
The Queens Gambit,"I'm not trying to be snarky, does it get better after episode 1? I found it super slow and repetitive for even one episode."
The Queens Gambit,Its fiction though?
The Queens Gambit,"It was a great watch, but I found it extremely predictable. The foreshadowing for certain things was way, way, way to easy to spot."
The Queens Gambit, Reminds me of Polgar sisters which is a  different story but real.  For anyone intrested watch The Polgar Variant.
The Queens Gambit,Such a good series
The Queens Gambit,"I LOVED this drama so much, I‚Äôm learning chess ‚ôü"
The Queens Gambit,"This is totally off topic, but the title of this reminds me of working in the box office at a movie theater when The Favourite came out. I kinda recommended it to people before I saw it (mainly because most of the other movies would be full). ""It's a period piece, I don't know if you like those.""

Then I saw the movie. I live in the South of the USA, aka the Bible Belt. I realized that all those people were probably in for quite a shock. But I don't recall giving many refunds for it. So who knows?"
Move,"Looks like *all* the shows at Television City currently (like Bill Maher and Dancing with the Stars) are moving out, construction is starting at the studio. Whether that means they'll return in the future is unknown"
Move,It was such a thrill to see it in person when I turned 18 during Drew Carey's first season. Didn't get picked but saw 3 entertaining shows in 2008 and 2009.
Move,They will be producing TPIR until the end of time. It's one big hourly tv commercial with low production cost.
Move,"No more tourists spilling out into The Grove after filming every day has me torn. On one hand, I will miss seeing those people, they‚Äôre a fun bunch to talk to. They have their tags still on, and are in such good moods. It always gives me a re-appreciation for my city, and they get to have a friendly interaction with a local. Such a positive. 

On the other hand, all that construction is going to be noisy. It *does* make me happy to know how very mad this makes Rick Caruso (mall owner, failed mayoral candidate). Such a positive."
Move,I got called down to contestant row.  One of the funnest days of my life!
Move,But....but...it's the Bob Barker Studio...
Move,The Price Is Wrong ‚Ä¶ bitch.
Move,"After Covid the price is right has NOT been the same.  As someone that has been watching this show for almost 40 years, I can tell the audience is totally not even a thought anymore.  Gone are the days of home made custom shirts, here to stay are made in China shirts that are picked up at the store on the way into the shooting.  It‚Äôs painfully obvious."
Move,"Hackman Capital, the current owners of Television City, also bought CBS' other Los Angeles studio lot (The Radford Studios) just over a year ago.  They just announced last week that the Radford lot will be undergoing a billion-dollar renovation of its own.  Lots of television history on those two lots, and not just CBS stuff either.

https://la.urbanize.city/post/1-billion-revamp-bring-new-offices-and-soundstages-radford-studio-center"
Move,I didn‚Äôt know Brenden Gleeson hosted the price is right
Move,it‚Äôs moving to Glendale?! BOO GLENDALE!!! Amirite r/burbank
Move,I shouldn't be but I'm mortally offended.
Move,im just realizing the price is right uses the same font as the GTA games
Move,Wonder if this will mean a return to a full audience. I have to imagine it will at this point
Move,but... it's the Bob Barker Studio
Move,all the prices are wrong anyway
Move,Last time I was there they were talking about a major studio renovation so could this just be temporary?
Move,"What a shame to lose the original location where Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman from Breaking Bad) jokingly said he gave his best work. ü•∫üëâüëà

https://youtu.be/_SEL27xiJGQ"
Move,No one‚Äôs going to talk about Drew Carey morphing into Jeff Bridges?
Move,Vancouver is discountef!
Move,"I mean, who gives a shit really?  The show continues right?  Maybe in a new studio instead of a relic?"
Move,"It seems like a lot of Fremantle‚Äôs shows will be taping in the new studio, along with TPIR.  This includes Press Your Luck, Celebrity Family Feud and Let‚Äôs Make A Deal. 

https://twitter.com/buzzerblog/status/1633863193763381249?s=46&t=fhyTSvoEQSS30_U2gcErOw

Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if all of Fremantle‚Äôs shows end up there."
Move,"IIRC, Maher films on the same stage as Price, so if one is going it was almost certain the other would."
Move,"I thought when the buyout deal was signed 5 years ago, it said they were to move all production out within 5 years. Unless I‚Äôm misremembering the deal, this was always inevitable."
Move,Small world.
Move,[deleted]
Move,"I watched a recent episode and was shocked by a change.  It used to be that every product shown, from the deodorant to the washing machine, was described in detail.  A commercial veiled as a description to help the constant guess the price.

But now ... not so much.  Brand names aren't mentioned and descriptions are more generic.  At least for the smaller products, that is.  Cars still get the full treatment.

I wonder if the smaller products aren't sponsored anymore.  Like the toothpaste you need to guess the price of so you can win the furniture."
Move,"> It's one big hourly tv commercial with low production cost.

When I worked in an office, getting to watch TPIR was such a treat, I always looked forward to a workday off so I could see it. 

But now that I work from home and could see it all the time, I really dislike it and never watch it. Not just knowing how much of an advertisement it is, but knowing how ""fixed"" it is (everyone in the audience doesn't have a chance of getting picked, the producers choose who they want to come on stage)."
Move,Pro tourist and pro construction noise is a rare position to find someone
Move,How does this hurt Caruso
Move,Why is it making Rick mad?
Move,[deleted]
Move,[deleted]
Move,Me too! It aired almost a year ago! I won a car!!
Move,The guy who was standing in front of me in line as we were going in got called up and won a car.
Move,You should have bid $1
Move,Details?  Lifelong dream of mine.
Move,"It sounds like the older studios and historic elements will be staying put, but the construction everywhere else surrounding it will make it infeasible to shoot shows there at least for the time being. So I am guessing they‚Äôll be back!"
Move,He deserved an Oscar. So did Little Richard in Down and Out in Beverly Hills.
Move,"God, I hate that Bob Barker."
Move,"Yea the big crowd used to be part of the fun, it‚Äôs not the same."
Move,"I haven't seen any recent episodes of the show, but I went to a taping with my mom years ago and goddamn... It's exhausting! 

They tell you that they're watching you throughout the show, so you've gotta keep your energy and enthusiasm up or else it might cost you! I nearly almost fainted, because they had us screaming so much. üòÜ

I can imagine after what we've all gone through with the pandemic, people just don't have the same energy anymore."
Move,"It's not just The Price is Right.  People just have different ways of expressing themselves and making their presence recognized.  Signs used to be a big deal at sporting events. You'd make your own sign and try to get it on camera.  Then you'd go home and watch or tell your friends to watch to try to see it on TV.  So cool!  Now, things like custom shirts and signs are rare. People just take a selfie and post it on social media."
Move,"Well, as you should know, made in China or not-the actual retail price if this shirt is: $13.59"
Move,"I watch this show daily with my dad and while it has changed, I'm not sure I feel the same. If you have any examples or pics maybe I'd understand better what you mean. Like the shirt thing. maybe I'm blind"
Move,"I think part of it is inevitably because rather than having 200+ lunatics trying to get in, as a lasting vestige of COVID protocols they‚Äôre basically doing more of a ‚Äòcasting‚Äô of the groups you see in the audience ahead of time‚Ä¶ so a lot of the energy and spontaneity can‚Äôt be replicated. I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll be back to a more traditional audience again by the new season, though."
Move,Yeah I stopped watching after covid. It's a completely different show
Move,"Yeah, the covid distancing really hurts it. The pandemic is over; time to get back to normal."
Move,"Yeah, the audience best not be dull, or he might hack his fingers off and lob them at the audience. Note to contestants be entertaining and, for goodness sake, leave Jenny at home locked up inside with the windows closed!!  üò±"
Move,"The font is literally called ""Pricedown"""
Move,Sorry bub. Comment above you has says but... but... not just but... they win
Move,That face at the end. THAT‚ÄôS why Jesse Pinkman turned to crime! üòÇ
Move,No he's GabeN now
Move,I was wondering why Maher was playing Pinko on his last show...
Move,Sorry. That is from a different company.
Move,"Article says they're expanding the stages at the place from 8 to 15, while preserving the original four studios."
Move,"Yep.

Watch an old episode on Pluto, and you'll notice the ""Promotional Consideration"" part in the end credits. That was companies paying for the in-show plugs for the small stuff.

They stopped that over the years, so the detailed descriptions did too."
Move,"So i literally just watched a Netflix documentary about this. Basically one guy had been keeping spreadsheets of data for years. He knew the prices of almost everything. They used to give these huge descriptions so if they had 2 of the same products with different features and different prices he‚Äôd probably know the right price. After one guy got the showcase showdown spot on they had to change up how they talk about products and what is on the show. 

Documentary was called ‚Äúthe perfect bid‚Äù"
Move,"I think some companies still pay, so you get introductions like ""First up is Charmin, and second we have some mint toothpaste"""
Move,"Everyone does have a chance, but it‚Äôs not random."
Move,"All tv is like this, it's entertainment."
Move,Means the Grove‚Äôs foot traffic is liable to dive.
Move,"The Grove and CBS properties back into each other. This is a huge expansion that‚Äôs been in the works for years. Caruso spent way over $100M running for mayor to stop this from happening. He lost. 

CBS is adding 1.9 million square feet to their facilities (studio/office/retail). Caruso‚Äôs worried about how the expansion will impact Grove Drive (the street off Fairfax that leads to the grove‚Äôs parking garage).

Move,"Moved from NYC, Connecticut before that. It‚Äôll be twenty years next year. Haven‚Äôt you moved anywhere new and different? Should I hate where I live?"
Move,The entire point of the US is that the states are united and anyone can move between them freely. Nobody cares your parents fucked in Reseda thirty years ago.
Move,Weird that you don‚Äôt understand tourism and the money it brings in.
Move,How much were the taxes?
Move,do an AMA
Move,Or $1 over the highest bid.
Move,"Possibly, I wouldn't bet on it.

Fremantle has a stake in this new studio, and it would make the most sense for them to have their shows in their place where they probably don't have to pay as much.

Plus, this gives them a chance to do the stage up to accommodate Price that they didn't have at Television City, or couldn't even conceive of 51 years ago."
Move,"I don't think so, I've been to that studio... it's very accessible from the street..."
Move,"Went to an americas got talent taping maybe 10ish years ago. Pretty similar experience. Also couldn't have phones inside or wear any clothing with branding. 

And then the usual ""please clap a lot now"" (I think they just record a few takes of solid clapping and then cut and paste it in different parts of the show so it seems like the audience is enjoying certain moments a lot). 

Crazy thing is now I've seen the latest shows and it seems people can bring phones in now and stuff. Still, was a cool one time experience."
Move,Or lung capacity! ü§î

Move,Look at the amount of signs in pro wrestling in the 90‚Äôs and even early 00‚Äôs compared to now. Some older 90‚Äôs footage the crowd is literally a sea of signs.
Move,"> Signs used to be a big deal at sporting events. You'd make your own sign and try to get it on camera. Then you'd go home and watch or tell your friends to watch to try to see it on TV. So cool!

now you have to go to the 1975 show for this"
Move,The shirts a lot of the people are wearing are just things that they bought at the shop before the show.  Nothing custom and homemade much anymore.
Move,Move forward. Maybe we shouldn‚Äôt cram ourselves into rooms like sardines at every opportunity?
Move,Fantastic movie.
Move,shit
Move,I can't tell if this is a pinko commie joke or a misspelling.
Move,"It's incredible to think that they're still getting free advertising thirty years later, due to reruns on Pluto."
Move,"They also did the ""Contestants not appearing on stage"" segment where we'd be shown their parting gifts."
Move,"His name was Barney Stinson, and rumor has it Bob Barker was his father."
Move,"Not exactly.

While you are correct that it's not random, the producers do 100% pick who they want to be on TV.  

They do soft interviews with the contestants before the show while giving out name tags, etc.  Those producers then bring a list of the most exciting/charismatic potential contestants, and the players are chosen from that list.

If you are boring during your soft interview, you are 100% not being called up.  So I'd say that no, not everyone has a chance, because a lot of people that attend don't have any idea that your demeanor during the soft interview is what gets you called up on stage."
Move,It's not that many people and they don't film those shows most of the year.
Move,[deleted]
Move,Why limit it to the US. Move to another country if you want/ can
Move,A percentage of the cars value!
Move,"I had to pay regular sales tax and license fees (about $2,300), and I have to claim it as income on my taxes this year. So it will add $23K to my taxable income."
Move,What‚Äôs that?
Move,Or $1 over the actual retail price.
Move,Now that's the really exciting thing someone break out the SUPER PLINKO.
Move,I don't mind that because people will put up the cringiest stuff to get attention or try to promote their own stuff.  And the signs block the views of the people behind them.  You don't want to pay all that money to look at the blank side of someone's posterboard
Move,"The fuck are karens and quarter-zips, you assuming people are a certain way by how they look?"
Move,"Yes! I hated the ending for Dominic tho, and I bawled like it she was my own when Jenny was found. Poor girl!"
Move,It was kind of like in Price is Right when they bid 1 cents over you lol
Move,It was a typo!  (I also misspelled typo the first time)
Move,"Haha same.  Maher's last episode had Bernie Sanders on it, so the typo happened to be a perfectly timed dig at democratic socialism."
Move,"People just don't get a year's supply of Rice A Roni, The San Francisco Treat often enough anymore."
Barbarians,I love how they went through the effort for the Romans in this show to actually speak Latin instead of just evil British like every other show
Barbarians,"Other companies sleep on history epics but fortunately Netflix is investing on the genre with shows like Barbarians, Last Kingdom, Vikings Valhala but I could use more shows in different periods, regions."
Barbarians,Rome reboot on HBOMAX when
Barbarians,Finally! Can't wait.
Barbarians,Cool..... I loved the first season.  It is a high quality historical drama if that is your thing.
Barbarians,Season 2 should just be called Empire Strikes Back
Barbarians,So what's the word on this show? Any good?
Barbarians,Not the best historical drama but it definitely deserves a second season. Hoping for the best.
Barbarians,Why are the name of Netflix historical dramas so uninspired tho
Barbarians,"The King and Outlaw/King are fantastic movies, also.  Netflix movies are mostly awful outside of historical fiction and period pieces."
Barbarians,"Couldn‚Äôt agree more - You‚Äôd think the algorithm would have shown how much of a sleeping behemoth HBOs Rome was by now. 

I‚Äôd personally love another take on the crusades; scratch that Kingdom of Heaven itch."
Barbarians,Would love for them to do more with what built up to Caesar marching on Rome and to do the Battle of Alessia justice.  Really my only real complaints with the first season.
Barbarians,best things about roman empire in this decade
Barbarians,It's really good.
Barbarians,Its decent but its no The Last Kingdom.
Barbarians,Yes
Barbarians,Probably since Rome. The Romans were in Germany for 400+ years and it's neat to see the other side of the Roman conquest.
Barbarians,"The Last Kingdom was just amazing, hard to live up to that. I agree with your assessment of Barbarians tho, I found it to be just okay."
Barbarians,"yesss, I always like to watch things that show the opposite side"
Barbarians,I do not know how this could possibly impact Koala Man less.
Barbarians,Looks like Justin better go check out that rental property he owns in Detroit.
Barbarians,Justin Roiland impersonators are about to get a lot of work lol.
Barbarians,"""Did you get any of that?"""
Barbarians,Need an up-and-coming voice actor to make a House of Roilands show now.
Barbarians,"They have a solid cast for the rest of the characters that replacing Roiland as Korvo won't be bad.

Now give me more of the Wall!"
Barbarians,"Solar Opposites should hold up better than Rick and Morty without Roiland. He only really contributed Korvo and very few small characters, unlike Rick and Morty where a large number of background characters relied on his voice in addition to both Rick and Morty‚Äôs voice."
Barbarians,"A two week gap to investigate and all 3 made the same decision? He admitted to something, likely that the DMs were all real."
Barbarians,Chris Pratt is about to have a very busy year
Barbarians,Soon he'll join the production of Horny Unicorn.
Barbarians,"Yeah I'm not holding out any hope for some exoneration miracle here anymore. It's Chinatown. 

Sucks that he's a dickbag but I've always thought that there had to be a good reason, a *very* good reason why he was only a guest on Dan Harmon's podcast (Harmontown) once ever, and it was basically a promotional thing with the rest of the cast back in season 1 of R&M. 

I can't remember where he said it, but Dan said something to the effect of 'Justin is what happens when a spoiled rich kid with ADD is given everything he wants in life and manages to succeed' and how his comedy is like being rewarded for being the annoying kid in a car trip. 

The malfunctioning human is starting to become a clearer picture to everyone now."
Barbarians,"Both shows will continue without him. Solar Opposites has 2 more seasons and Koala Man just started it's first.

Hulu:

>‚ÄúWe have ended our association with Justin Roiland‚Äù"
Barbarians,Starting to think he wrote that scene with the math teacher‚Äôs repressed feelings for Summer
Barbarians,">	Roiland faces one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit against an unnamed woman he was dating in 2020, according to Orange County Superior Court records. The charges were earlier reported by NBC News, which said most of the California court records are sealed under a protective order.

Not to be a messy bitch, but I really want to know the details about what exactly is being kept under protective order. And what alleged injury this man could have inflicted on someone he was dating?? Certainly does not sound good, potentially vile."
Barbarians,"Look kids, a falling star. Make a wish :P"
Barbarians,Man i hope zach hadel or michael cusack get to fill the void that roiland‚Äôs leaving.
Barbarians,Really concerned about the future of Solar Opposites now.
Barbarians,[deleted]
Barbarians,"So Adult Swim, and its parent company, have Private Investigators.  This is like Jared the subway guy all over again.  Subway knew before everyone else how that was going to turn out.  So given that Netflix and Adult Swim just dropped him like he's radioactive, I suspect they were able to indecently confirm whatever it is they wanted to know that lead to his firing."
Barbarians,It kind of boggles me that famous people do such stupid shit. Like you already have it all! You're talented! You're funny! You're now rich! Why are you fucking it up?
Barbarians,They will use some alien tech that changes his voice and move on as usual.
Barbarians,If only he‚Äôd choke slammed a woman on camera and pleaded guilty to burglary like Ezra.
Barbarians,I would love to hear what Dan Harmon had to say about this given his background...
Barbarians,"After careful consideration, I have decided to drop Justin Roiland out of my top 8."
Barbarians,If Solar opposites just becomes ‚Äúthe wall‚Äù
Barbarians,"Given the rampant sexualization of teenage girls in R&M, I'm kinda surprised it was domestic violence that did him instead."
Barbarians,Hey maybe now we can get something other than ‚ÄúMorty‚Äù voice for EVERY thing!
Barbarians,"Man, this guy built a really successful brand for himself with all of these projects in animation and video games, and now his choices have lead to all of it continuing without him."
Barbarians,Adult swim fires up ChatGPT: ‚Äúdo a Rick and Morty impression ‚Äú : crosses fingers:
Barbarians,Roiland should change his name to Ezra Miller to keep work
Barbarians,"I hope this dude is actually guilty, 'cause got damn."
Barbarians,As he should
Barbarians,Good. Fuck abusers.
Barbarians,I don't think I've ever seen someone be less defended by the people that know and work with him. It just seems like the general consensus was that he was a huge asshole and people were just waiting him to get caught doing something like this to drop him?
Barbarians,"This is for the best even if it costs them viewership

Edit: 

Folks, you don't need to respond to a one month old account who thinks Domestic violence isn't that big of a deal.   Whether their post was genuine or bad faith is irrelevant.

The ignore/block button is far more useful than responding to a bad troll or someone you would never acknowledge IRL."
Barbarians,I can‚Äôt wait for him to resurface in a few years on Joe Rogan to talk about how cancel culture ruined his life (his crimes have nothing to do with it surely.)
Barbarians,"with inside job cancelled, these shows should look there for new writers"
Barbarians,This man destroyed his career overnight.  damn.
Barbarians,Good. Dudes a douche. He deserves everything that is happening.
Barbarians,In b4 he starts podcasts about cancel culture
Barbarians,So the domestic abuse is what gets him. And not the DM-ing underage girls to hang out with him?
Barbarians,Being a well gigged voice actor in LA is one of the easiest jobs on the fucking planet yet somehow this guy couldn‚Äôt help himself but be a pedo
Barbarians,Good riddance
Barbarians,Aww jeeze.
Barbarians,I don‚Äôt know about you guys but I only watch that show for the Wall. What a fun concept
Barbarians,Before the trial? Johnny depp all over again
Barbarians,"Justin's always been a pretty fucked individual. Considering his original cartoons included [an early version of Mr. Jellybean who kidnaps children and creates skin masks from their faces](https://vimeo.com/48645513), [a deranged Cat in the Hat](https://vimeo.com/62232896), and the [original Rick and Morty](https://vimeo.com/channels/1015634/97680161), he's had his schtick for years of completely deranged cartoons. 

If all this is coming out at the same time, it's definitely Roiland owning up to his career going in the toilet. He's a funny guy yeah, but like lots of people in the creative field, he has a scummy streak that's been made worse by being thrust into the spotlight and into a position of power. All honesty? Maybe Roiland was better off being that guy who did niche cartoons with Channel 101, instead of being the guy whose creation turns into a generational phenomenon."
Barbarians,"Clearly guy is a piece of shit but jfc, the level of coping I‚Äôm seeing on reddit is insane. ‚ÄúOh the show doesn‚Äôt need him. He only created it, voiced most characters and wrote the first four (best) seasons!‚Äù This is hilarious"
Barbarians,ITT: Domestic abuse and pedo apologists not understanding the difference between a court room and a private company.
Barbarians,Sounds like this time for Vanbo!
Barbarians,Terrible year for animation
Barbarians,FUUUUUUUUUCK
Barbarians,He did one voice for Koala man why does everything seem to think he made the show
Barbarians,Give Natalie tran a bigger role in koala man
Barbarians,There has to be a lot more we don‚Äôt know. Everyone is tossing him out. Which sucks for Squanch Games.
Barbarians,At this point in surprised that actors don't put in their contracts a no fire clause in case they get caught being pieces of shit
Barbarians,What character was he
Barbarians,People only watch Solar Opposites for the wall episodes anyways.
Barbarians,Did Justin Roiland just have a cosby moment?
Barbarians,"God dammit, why are there so many super talented shit bags? Rick and Morty has been an amazing show, one of my absolute favorites, and now it's going to go down in flames."
Barbarians,"Stopped watching rick and morty last season, now may continue. Always hated Roilands annoying ""improv"""
Barbarians,"What happened to innocent until proven guilty. What happens now if he goes to court and gets found innocent? Are they going to reimburse him lost wages. If, and I admit it a big if, he is innocent he should sue them over this."
Barbarians,Wouldn‚Äôt it be crazy if the case is dismissed or if he‚Äôs found not-guilty? I wonder what these production companies know since they‚Äôre going scorched earth before the justice system has worked its way through the situation.
Barbarians,"I don‚Äôt watch anything he is in, but has there be a trial or anything?  Nobody has learned a damn thing from the fucking mess of Depp/Herd lies/career destroying on both sides."
Barbarians,"I loved Justin Roiland and was looking forward to ‚ÄúHigh On Life‚Äù dlc or a sequel. I‚Äôd also love to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but he fucked up. It‚Äôd have to be one hell of an apology and a lot wounds to heal before anyone can give him a second chance."
Barbarians,"Honestly I wouldn't doubt if he's done these things he's accused of.  But I'm never going to be onboard with this mentality that because an allegation or charge is brought against you, that you're automatically a piece of shit and should instantly have your job taken from you.  Let's see what the court of the law has to say before we grab our pitchforks, that's my opinion.

Of course that's not meant to be a blanket statement either, there are clear exceptions: say if there is public video footage of the crime in question for us all to see, don't need a court to prove your guilt in that case.  Or, if the number of claims against you is so substantial that it's impossible to ignore, like when 40 or so people all had stories about Bill Cosby.  That's probably a pretty safe situation to say, yeah he certainly did those terrible things.

Would I put money on Justin being innocent here?  No.  But I also am not in favor of immediately cancelling him in every feasible way without due process or at least damning evidence readily available to us all right now to look at."
Barbarians,Now he‚Äôll have time to make ‚ÄúHouse Of Cosby‚Äù a thing now. Maybe make more Doc and Marty‚Äôs.
Barbarians,Maaaan I freaking love solar opposites :/
Barbarians,"They should wait at least until after his trial is over to fire him. This is why the justice system destroys lives. Imagine you are some lowly nobody and you get a arrested for something you didn‚Äôt do. 
You lose your job and spend money on lawyers"
Barbarians,Edit: I guess i'm out of the loop. The first i heard was accused of fellony abuse followed by his shows cutting ties. It turns out there's a whole lot of in between involving abuse in previous relationships and underaged girls. Shit's fucked up.
Barbarians,This is the time to voice your concerns about cancel culture and how you don't mind the actions of this dirtbag and think floating his fucking career and buying him another mansion is an appropriate response.
Barbarians,I'm just here to watch people get their boxers in a knot over what pedophilia is.
Barbarians,"All these complaints about ""cancel culture"" usually come from conservatives or right wing pundits. And they will never see the irony when they praise Joseph McCarthy with his own ""cancel culture"" crusade in the 50's trying to root out communists in Hollywood. Lots of false accusations ruined a lot of careers back then but I guess it's only a problem today because liberals.

Edit: And to be clear I am not defending Roiland I am aiming this at all those comments with the downvotes."
Barbarians,"Has there been any more released on the whole alleged predator/grooming stuff?

The only thing I've seen so far was the DM snippet where he called the 16yr old jailbait.

Which is pretty slimy or whatever, just to be interacting with fans of that age via DM at all really, but has there been something directly criminal that has been revealed in that aspect?"
Barbarians,Did the dude get convicted yet? Or is everyone just dropping him because it‚Äôs inevitable that he will be in legal trouble? Last I heard nobody from the public knew and his lawyer said he did nothing and was going to clean his name..
Barbarians,"Trial by media.

Some nameless woman accuses him of something.. back in 2020.

He denies all accusations, gets fired anyway before he has even seen a judge about the matter."
Barbarians,How come he's getting dropped so fast when so so so many (proven) abusers don't catch much if any flak?
Barbarians,Yet they keep Thomas Middleditch in Solar Opposites.
Barbarians,"Sixteen, Dude."
Barbarians,"Man, first it's House of Cards, now Solar Opposites AND R&M... Can these assholes just finish their shows before the public catches up with their horrific behavior like once?"
Barbarians,"So I guess nobody is willing to be the least bit skeptical?

I want to first say, this kind of behavior is deplorable and indefensible. That being said... What *is* this behavior? What *happened*?

We don't even have the allegations. Literally all we know is that charges were pressed. For all we know about the abusive nature of our criminal justice system, I think it's really weird. 

When people get the faintest whiff of stuff like this, there's no hesitation at all. People just snapped their fingers and called Aziz Ansari a straight up rapist for what was basically just being a shitty date. The allegations around Andrew Callaghan sound really similar to his.

I don't know, man. People are probably going to say horrible things about me just for saying, ""Um."" I guess I'm less trusting of allegations I'm not even allowed to *read*."
A Suitable Boy,"I'm going to stick with it but being only 6 episodes long, it was going to be a tough task to get the pacing right."
A Suitable Boy,"As a ""non-woman of non-color"" I'm sick and tired of the glaring lack of positive representation of my constantly marginalized and demonized non-demographic in media."
A Suitable Boy,?
A Suitable Boy,"Lol Jenson keeps talking about a sex scene that he had to beg to have toned down, I guess this will be the episode."
A Suitable Boy,"The full ""warning"":

>This Episode Depicts  
  
>A Massive Supe Orgy, Airborne Penetration,  
  
>Dildo-Based Maiming, Extra Strength Lube,  
  
>Icicle Phalluses and Cursing.  
  
>It Is Not Suitable For Any Audience"
A Suitable Boy,"Having read the comic 15 years ago, i can confidently say the content warning is correct"
A Suitable Boy,So the exploding dick hole is only the appetizer?
A Suitable Boy,the episode is illegal in 4 countries btw
A Suitable Boy,fucking diabolical
A Suitable Boy,r/TheBoys is gonna go nuclear when this episode comes out
A Suitable Boy,"I made the mistake of watching the Termite scene with my Dad, so I might just watch this episode by myself if it‚Äôs as bad as they say."
A Suitable Boy,"if they keep the normal sized guys gangbanging the giantess, kudos to them"
A Suitable Boy,So is this like the Red Wedding of The Boys as far as anticipation and shock value are concerned?
A Suitable Boy,I feel like Herogasm hasn't been mentioned in the show at all. Are they just gonna stumble upon it?
A Suitable Boy,If Ackles isn‚Äôt getting railed on camera I don‚Äôt want it
A Suitable Boy,"The scene with Deep eating Timothy made me throw up a little, I can only wonder what this will do."
A Suitable Boy,"I remember when my partner, who has not read the comics, said they were doing Herogasm. I told him, having read the series, there is no way they can do Herogasm given how insanely explicit it is. 

I stand corrected."
A Suitable Boy,"Is anyone else wondering if it'll be underwhelming, given how much it's been hyped?"
A Suitable Boy,The fact that some of the actors were traumatized with the things they were filming üò≠
A Suitable Boy,"Can it truly be worse than the very first episode of this season?

That was definitely the reason why eye bleach was invented."
A Suitable Boy,If its not suitable for any audience then whos gonna watch it HUH?
A Suitable Boy,South Park has this warning for years.
A Suitable Boy,"Fuck dude, I really wish the comic community had just let us be surprised by whatever happens in this episode rather than posts and articles about it every 5 seconds"
A Suitable Boy,"This show has pretty genius marketing, their social media game is 10/10 right now."
A Suitable Boy,Urban talking about the camera man is hilarious
A Suitable Boy,I bet it still doesn't depict any female nudity like the rest of the season.
A Suitable Boy,Jensen Ackles was the only voice of reason on the supernatural set and now it looks like he‚Äôs doing it again for The Boys lmao
A Suitable Boy,"Hopefully they do the comic issue justice and it's not another ""Multiverse of Madness is scary"" kind of marketing."
A Suitable Boy,I've got 5 on Homelander being jacked off and through some weird shenanigans Hughie ends up teleporting right in front of him as he finishes and they're both freaked out and start yelling.
A Suitable Boy,"Seen a lot of people in this thread say they want to read the original comics. Well, it just so happens that the entire run is currently available DRM free from Humble Bundle for less than $30, with a whole bunch of other comics from Dynamite Entertainment. And some of the proceeds even go to charity.

https://www.humblebundle.com/books/boys-versus-girls-dynamite-books"
A Suitable Boy,"I just wrapped up season 1 and gosh is this show entertaining. And it‚Äôs actually a worse universe than we‚Äôre in, making it a feel-good show. With lots of dong which is very nice."
A Suitable Boy,"**""ALL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW --EVEN THOSE BASED ON REAL PEOPLE-- ARE ENTIRELY FICTIONAL. ALL CELEBRITY VOICES ARE IMPERSONATED ... POORLY. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM CONTAINS COARSE LANGUAGE AND DUE TO ITS CONTENT IT SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY ANYONE.""**"
A Suitable Boy,Cuz a guy that shrank and crawled into a urethra and sneeze enlarging to life size again and exploding wasn‚Äôt enough
A Suitable Boy,"I‚Äôm enjoying this season quite a bit more than last season so far but does anybody else feel‚Ä¶idk, exhausted by the constant ‚ÄúLOOK HOW EDGY WE ARE‚Äù tone?"
A Suitable Boy,"This shows just make me wish for a more mature Gotham city.

Season 3 of the boys, made me actually feel fear from Homelander. Yet, no matter how big the threat is in DC or Marvel movies, I don't feel anything, because no one gets actually hurt, or if they do, is showed as a minor thing and is not graphic at all.

And I don't say that I need to see gore to this level, but even when Iron Man was super hurt, I didn't feel like he was hurt at all. It felt like nothing. Half of the universe died in Marvel, yet it didn't make it ""believable"" or anything. Same with Justice League when Steppenwolf fought everyone so easily, I didn't feel the threat.

I know Dc and Marvel is more targeted to kids, but still, I really wish they could make something more ""violent"". Fuck, Gotham city in DC would work perfect in a setting like the boys."
A Suitable Boy,How do you top the exploding tiny man inside a penis bit?
A Suitable Boy,#FULL PENETRATION
A Suitable Boy,Worse than sneezing in s3e1?
A Suitable Boy,After the urethra moment I‚Äôm up for anything
A Suitable Boy,"When this show is over I'm going to put it in the same drawer as Breaking Bad, one of the best shows I NEVER want to watch again."
A Suitable Boy,Rated ‚ÄúD‚Äù for diabolical lol. I love that. This show and Barry are my favorite shows on TV currently.
A Suitable Boy,"I really hope that the showrunners realize soon that their main audience doesnt watch for edgy gore scenes, or uncomfortable sex stuff. Most people I know watch for the story. They dont need to try to one up themselves with edgy scenes every season."
A Suitable Boy,Rated EB for Epic Bacon
A Suitable Boy,I just hope they left the dog out.
A Suitable Boy,I just saw an interview with Jensen ackles on Seth meyers show and he said he did not like to do any weird sex positions but it was still written for him. Guess this is the episode.
A Suitable Boy,"Oh no, keep Frenchie and Kimiko safe"
A Suitable Boy,"I was staying at an AirBnB and a carpenter for 'The Boys' was also staying there. They were filming in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.  She said they had to build a phallus with a diameter of 6 feet or so.  Pretty crazy and not your typical carpentry gig."
A Suitable Boy,"After the first episode this season, I can surely say that I am not ready."
A Suitable Boy,According to some things I read the actors are so scarred from making this that they refuse to watch it when it releases while others pleaded with the writers and show runners to cool their fucking jets. I‚Äôm very excited but also genuinely concerned.
A Suitable Boy,My sister explaining how the show isn‚Äôt that weird after she just told me that the plot for an episode is basically ant-man in someone‚Äôs dick
A Suitable Boy,"I mean, homelander exploded a woman with his jizz in the comic, and in the show we just explored an exploding urethra, so if this has a ""nsfl"" tag, then I'm both scared and intrigued."
A Suitable Boy,I enjoy the show but it sometimes feels like the writers are a bunch of 13 year olds competing to see who can make the most edgy corruption of traditional superheroes. To the point where the shock value quickly runs thin and it just feels repetitive.
A Suitable Boy,The inner dick scene nearly made me yarf. Maybe i'll skip this episode.
A Suitable Boy,"Oh I remmeber this one from the comics.. When the Supes all meet for their annual getaway to fuck Island!  

Theres a Homelander scene I am really curious to see if they include.... You'll know it if you read the originals."
A Suitable Boy,Anyone else getting sick of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how grotesque we can be this time??‚Äù I hate gore porn and I‚Äôm starting to hate this show because of it
A Suitable Boy,"How more fucked up can this show get? 


Im leaving this comment here so if i get my brains blown on friday, i can come back here and eat my words"
A Suitable Boy,The Boys fanbase is disturbed
A Suitable Boy,I am scared and excited at the same time
A Suitable Boy,"Welp you heard em, folks! No one watch this."
A Suitable Boy,I think anyone who read the OG Spawn 0-100 would have known what was going to happen
A Suitable Boy,Yeah.. I already stopped watching this show with my parents
A Suitable Boy,THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM CONTAINS COARSE LANGUAGE AND DUE IT ITS CONTENT IT SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED BY ANYONE‚óªÔ∏è
A Suitable Boy,I hope they don't waste too much time on this just for shock value.
A Suitable Boy,"I‚Äôm convinced they‚Äôre overplaying this, but I‚Äôll be watching because even if it‚Äôs only comparable to all the other episodes, it will be good."
A Suitable Boy,Well the way they opened up with the first episode of season three. Cocaine and I‚Äôll let you find out what else. They are gonna top that? ü§Ø
A Suitable Boy,"That dick scene they showed was enough for me.

When the mini guy sneezed in the dick.

Im still shook"
A Suitable Boy,"I'm 99% sure we're going to see Ashley in full Dominatrix mode fuck a dude with a dildo longer than her leg.

And that'll be on the lower end of the shock scale"
A Suitable Boy,"This season has been a slow burn to a fault. We're five episodes in and the plot is only getting started. By comparison, season 2 had told the entire arc of Kimiko's brother by episode 4."
A Suitable Boy,"The boys is rapidly approaching the ""point of no return"" for shock value. Eventually you move the needle too much and it loses its potency."
A Suitable Boy,"So why do people like to watch this then, to the point that this is used as advertisement? I myself have stopped watching after following up to this season. I just dont get the appeal of being disgusted."
A Suitable Boy,Wow are they actually going to show a nipple in this episode?!?
A Suitable Boy,It's all bit... edge-lordy isn't it?
A Suitable Boy,"Haven't we already been through the ""Not suitable for everyone"" scheme? Trust me it's not going to be anything out of the ordinary. It's just simple marketing."
A Suitable Boy,"Just to remind everyone in the first episode of this season a guy shrunk down to a size of a grain of rice and went inside the penis to touch some sensitive spots. Coughed and blew up size rupturing the penis and basically the groin basically cutting the guy in half killing him. 

That apparently was more suitable than whatever they are about to show this week."
A Suitable Boy,[deleted]
A Suitable Boy,...I mean the first episode of this season *FFS!*  That moment completely outshined experiencing a certain scene from *Br√ºno* in theaters. How much more lewd could they get?! I guess we'll find out.
A Suitable Boy,I'm expecting The Boys x Spartacus type episode.
A Suitable Boy,It's not going to be as bad as they're making it out to be
A Suitable Boy,They've already had naked dude shrink and crawl inside another guys dick. I can't imagine imagine how much further they can push it.
A Suitable Boy,In the comics ‚Ä¶ this part of the story has a LOT of superhero sex.  A LOT.
A Suitable Boy,"They‚Äôre definitely over hyping this episode, but maybe they‚Äôre not what do I know"
A Suitable Boy,"They‚Äôre really hyping it, I‚Äôm thinking it might not fully live up to the hype they‚Äôve been creating, I hope they prove me wrong."
A Suitable Boy,There‚Äôs not a smile in the world deranged enough to express my deranged smile.
A Suitable Boy,I can‚Äôt wait to see the pg-13 content that finally got approved
A Suitable Boy,"Reading the comics ages ago especially herogasm, felt like a guarantee it would never be filmed. Thought the same for preacher. We are in the golden age of comic entertainment. The boys is the only living up almost to the potential. Preacher was ok. Walking dead was great for a little. Y the last man was a let down. Sucks, was really excited about it. Would love transmetropolitan."
A Suitable Boy,This sounds horrifying! When is it coming out so I don‚Äôt watch it!
A Suitable Boy,i hope Homelander has a subway omni-man like scene :D
A Suitable Boy,Counting down the hours for this episode!!
A Suitable Boy,"You did it, crazy son of a bitch, you did it"
A Suitable Boy," a sex scene that he had to beg to have toned down,"
A Suitable Boy,xXedgelordXx
A Suitable Boy,Am I the only one who can't enjoy The Boys because it just goes way too far?
A Suitable Boy,After they hyped up that musical segment of last episode (and it was only like 3 min total) I have very low expectations ü§£
A Suitable Boy,Only took ‚Äòem three seasons to reach South Park levels.
A Suitable Boy,"See, one of the problems with The Boys is that it lack a certain eroticism. 

What if we were to bring an incredibly hot but skeptical female lab partner into the mix? And then that way, whenever Homelander‚Äôs not out busting heads because he smelled crime, he's back at the lab performing outrageous sexual experiments on her supple young body. 

Now, here's the twist, and there is a twist. We show it. We show all of it. 

Because what's the one major thing missing from all tv shows these days? 

Full penetration. Guys, we're going to show full penetration, and we're going to show a lot of it. I mean, we're talking, you know, graphic scenes of Homelander really going to town on this hot, young lab tech. 

From behind, 69, anal, vaginal, cowgirl, reverse cowgirl-- all the hits, all the big ones, all the good ones. And then he smells crime again. 
He's out busting heads. Then he's back to the lab for some more full penetration. Smells crime, back to the lab, full penetration. Crime, penetration, crime, full penetration, crime, penetration, and this goes on and on, and back and forth for 4 seasons until the show just sort of ends."
A Suitable Boy,"I remember not being able to get through the first episode of this show. I recall this scene >!Aspiring superhero Annie January auditions as ""Starlight"" and is accepted to join the superhero group the Seven following Lamplighter's retirement. Arriving at the Seven's headquarters, she is greeted by the Deep, who blackmails her into performing oral sex on him.!< Which had me not wanting to watch anymore, then I heard this was hardly the worst thing I would see. Nothing against the idea of bringing superheroes into ultra realism (I think a movie directed by James Gunn did that already?), but this show definitely isn't for me."
A Suitable Boy,"Wonder how far they're going to go, because the comic version is basically enough to make a normal man throw up."
A Suitable Boy,I‚Äôm still waiting for Homelander to get his ass handed to him by anyone! It‚Äôs getting a little boring because he‚Äôs like a bad Superman with no real competition.
A Suitable Boy,"I have to say, there isn‚Äôt one episode of this series that doesn‚Äôt totally SLAP"
A Suitable Boy,"Unpopular opinion, but this is the episode I wish they wouldn‚Äôt do. The Boys TV show is so much better than it‚Äôs comic counterpart. When they start adhering closely to the comics, I get less interested. I think The Termite scene might be one of the most amazing scenes in the show and from what I can remember, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the comics. The show is at its best when it‚Äôs doing it‚Äôs own thing and forging a new path."
VIP,Watching other people fuck up makes us feel better about our own lives.
VIP,[deleted]
VIP,"Still waiting for the Endgame of scammer films, the Nigerian Prince."
VIP,Because I'm tired of watching horrific murder docs and want to see the scammer douchebags get dickwhipped by the law.
VIP,"I was just talking about this with my girlfriend the other day. True crime stories can be fun, but I just don‚Äôt enjoy serial killer stuff ‚Äî it‚Äôs weird and it feels a little like glorification of horrible murders. White collar crime tends to be a lot more complex and interesting because of it, so it scratches the same itch without the parts I don‚Äôt like."
VIP,"If you enjoy these types of stories and enjoy podcasts, you should check out Swindled. The most recent episode is about the ‚ÄúBad Vegan‚Äù and he‚Äôs previously reported on the story behind Inventing Anna and the Tinder Swindler. It‚Äôs like these Netflix shows but without the over-the-top editing and dramatization, but still has some dry humor and charm, so it‚Äôs not lifeless."
VIP,"Rise and fall stories have been popular since Ancient Greek times. 

Most good stories usually follow a Greek tragedy template. There‚Äôs that fun sense of dramatic irony for the audience. 

Best modern example I can give is Breaking Bad."
VIP,"Producer: ""Someone scammed $2,000,000. Can I make a show about it?""

NETFLIX: ""Done, your budget is $4,000,000.""

[Won't Get Fooled Again plays]"
VIP,"I think it's simpler than that. These are just good stories. I watched The Dropout, and they paint a nuanced portrait of a neurodivergent person who wants what many people want, money and fame. 

You don't feel sympathy for her, but she's a fascinating character. You watch her slowly change in every episode as she tries new ways to get what she wants, and it makes the show interesting and dynamic. 

I don't watch shows to make friends with these characters. I don't watch shows looking for role models. I watch shows for interesting stories, and if the complex portrait they paint is of a bad person, I'm not here to judge them."
VIP,"I think it shows that just because people are ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt make them a good person or all knowing. Many of these scammers scammed very successful people. Look at who was associated with Theranos, we work, Uber, and even the Vegan lady. It was the movers and shakers of the their sectors. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt get behind worshiping these tech people or any ‚Äúbillionaires‚Äù. The people obsessed with Elon Musk or the like really disturb me."
VIP,"A lot of people have mixed feeling about inventing Anna. While I do think it could have been done with maybe 2 episodes less, it‚Äôs still very interesting. 

Then again what do I know I‚Äôm purrr"
VIP,"I am kind of over the ""podcast/documentary"" to ""Limited Series"" pipeline. Like that awful ""Joe vs. Carol"" series? Or the 12 different movies/series in the works about Elizabeth Holmes? Usually the podcasts/docs that these series are based on are 100% better and not watered down with fake ""it probably went this way"" scenes."
VIP,You forgot the tinder swindler. People taking advantage of others stupidity or vulnerabilities. Takes a certain kind of person to do this. Hopefully these movies don‚Äôt inspire others to act this way.
VIP,I‚Äôve learned if you have blonde hair and blue/green eyes you can easily scam a lot of people
VIP,"We are in the golden age of scamming, paying tribute to the OG's who paved the way lol. Influencer shitcoin scams, crypto, nonstop scam calls/ emails etc."
VIP,"I mean, what was the point of all the gangster movies of old that literally glorified utter pieces of shit?"
VIP,[deleted]
VIP,"The point is these stories are much cheaper to write than a work of pure fiction. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be a ‚Äúscammer story‚Äù either, take a look at the Tommy Lee/Pamela Anderson miniseries or any of the American Crime Stories. The plot is right there, you don‚Äôt need to pay a bunch of writers to come up with new stories and characters, you just adapt what happened into a script and you‚Äôre ready to go. Casting, wardrobe, it‚Äôs all easier and therefore cheaper when you‚Äôre basing it off true events.

I read the article and see that the author is trying to make some point about audiences wanting to see scammers, but that‚Äôs some tail wagging the dog bullshit. Consumers don‚Äôt really have a say in what gets produced, people will watch what‚Äôs marketed to them and these are being marketed hard at the moment."
VIP,Bad Vegan was really something... apparently all I have needed to do in life is meet a rich beautiful New York woman and yell at her until she gives me all her money.
VIP,"I love them.  Julie Garner will deservedly get the awards, but I think The Dropout is a much better series.

Bad Vegan was a really interesting one.  I could almost sympathize with her extremely naivete and ignorance and stupidity... but in that last episode where they ask her ""Why are you going to prison?"" and she responds ""That's a good question.  Why *am* I going to prison?""

Then she rattles on about how 'they' dont understand that she was brainwashed etc.  

It's like ""Honey, no matter if you believed your husband was a secret CIA mercenary guy who was testing your faith in him, YOU STOLE THE MONEY AND GAVE IT TO HIM.  That's why you are going to prison.  You took something that wasnt yours to take.""

I hope this trend continues though I'm reading WeCrashed kind of sucks and the documentary, which was great, *is* much better."
VIP,What's the point of all these stupid articles just getting clickbaits?
VIP,Ultra-rich socialites and investors count among their preys so the audience either enjoys the schadenfreude or outright cheers for them.
VIP,The point is people are gullible morons.
VIP,"They‚Äôre examples of the scam, money hustle economy we‚Äôve been living through these past ten years or so. Crypto, NFT, investment scams, tech scams, the types are endless. 

It‚Äôs the need for the perception of success. The need to make a living in financially precarious times. These shows are about how the post-recession economy have created desperate people willing to go to any length to get theirs. Holmes wasn‚Äôt desperate, and her story pre-dates the recession. But, the zeitgeist of the tech boom amplified how dangerous she could be and provided a narrative and excuse for her behavior. 

These shows aren‚Äôt just about the perpetrators but also about how society as a whole enables and encourages people like this."
VIP,"When it's scamming rich people or someone that comes off as a jerk we like it because of the perceived karma. Haven't seen all of these, but that seems to have been one of the hooks of Inventing Anna."
VIP,"I love watching shows where those in power have to scramble to protect the wealthy from their own stupidity...

That is what hooked me into inventing anna. Seriously if you're that wealthy AND that stupid, I don't see how you should get your money back at all. Get fucked."
VIP,I was SCAMMED into reading that commercial for Bad Vegan dressed up as an article.
VIP,"This woman is 100% full of shit. I'm sorry. You don't graduate from University, work for a big investment bank for years, own and operate a successful multi-million dollar business, and yet somehow manage to get completely hoodwinked by some idiot grifter claiming he's ""black ops"" and can ""make your dog immortal."" Give me a break. She was definitely in on the scam. She robbed her staff blind, played dumb, and got a slap on the wrist, probably because she's an attractive, soft spoken woman and society tends to automatically give people like that the benefit of the doubt."
VIP,Narcissism is at its breaking point in USA
VIP,Promote a culture that feeds on it's self so it's less concerned about larger issues
VIP,"Unfortunately I think that
> the answer is some ethically muddled, bizarrely patronizing mumbo-jumbo about how women are punished for doing things that men get away with. Okay? Is that all?

is a fairly accurate description for most of these ‚Äúcon‚Äù shows/movies coming out. I think they bank on this idea of a powerful, flawed, woman because it‚Äôs ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù and feels feminist while truthfully it just reinforces the fact that women can only be powerful in media when they‚Äôre manipulators. The awful Netflix movie I Care A Lot comes to mind most recently."
VIP,"Remember in the late 90s when two volcano disaster kicked got released near each other 

Some producer prob thought this was a good idea and others got in on it. 

You can never know what picks up with an audience. These were real stories and garner interest. 

Poor reviews are irrelevant if views are high. Controversy sells. Whenever a movie gets controversy, I‚Äôm compelled to watch to see what the fuss is about."
VIP,"Some nobody popping, full cloth, into existence and scamming the ultra wealthy?

I'll watch that every day of my life.

This article misses the point entirely."
VIP,"The lesson I take from these stories is that if I'm going to lie, I'm going to lie big.  The bigger and more preposterous the lie, the less likely that people will call you on it.  It certainly explains Trump and Q Anon."
VIP,"Same reason people like movies like Scarface, Goodfellow, Blow, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Wolf of Wall St, Catch Me If You Can...

TV shows like Law & Order and CSI...

True crime podcasts....

Jack the Ripper..."
VIP,"The thing that annoyed me the most about Elizabeth Holmes is that she got in trouble for ripping off wealthy investors not for fucking up regular peoples lives. 

I refuse to watch the show because of this."
VIP,"Wait...half our network TV has been about Crime and Punishment for better part of seventy five years, this falls into that catagory."
VIP,"There is no point, they are just fun to watch, next question please."
VIP,I find it fucking stupid that we are rewarding scammers by giving them even more money/fame by giving them more money to make their story into shows
VIP,People are shitty and love to watch other shitty people?
VIP,"Case in point is WeCrashed.. have 0 interest watching a douche playing a douche and how it glorifies douchy business ethics. 
Now let‚Äôs produce this douche salad and feed it to the crowds lol."
VIP,"The Tinder Swindler is a lot like Bad Vegan, same scam with multiple women, only less batshit."
VIP,"Its the appeal of being ‚Äústranger than fiction‚Äù. We have a very conditioned view of what is and is not possible within a narrative to the point where some people even consider characters acting irrationally to be a plot hole. 

People simply don‚Äôt realize how stupid people can be. We don‚Äôt even realize how stupid we our ourselves can be. which is why when so many people meet a scammer they believe it couldn‚Äôt possibly be happening to them because they‚Äôre too smart to be manipulated. Nobody is too smart to be manipulated."
VIP,I want back all the hours I spent watching Inventing Anna
VIP,"The point is that America is a country of scammers, and scams are rewarded"
VIP,"True crime stories got really popular a while back, but they‚Äôve already done all of the murder stories that aren‚Äôt too gory or depressing for general audiences, so they branch out to scams and con artists."
VIP,M O N E Y
VIP,"Tf do you mean ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù

It‚Äôs television

The point is entertainment"
VIP,Could be propaganda to keep us middle/lower class people in check. The class wars are becoming a reality and this could be a form of media control.
VIP,"Wasn't it serial killers before scammers?

It's entertainment and there are no new stories to be told in fiction so they are ripping from reality."
VIP,"Really? After the 2016 election and complete breakdown of trust within the internet addled American populace, you can‚Äôt imagine why there‚Äôs a sudden fascination w scammers and a desire to watch their downfall?"
VIP,They are entertaining.
VIP,"Was just talking about this. I think it‚Äôs because we live in a historical moment where seemingly obvious lies and conspiracy theories are bamboozling huge swathes of the population. At some point or other in the past couple of years all of us have asked ourselves: ‚Äúhow do they believe this bullshit??‚Äù These shows provide a glimpse of how easy it is to pull the wool over people‚Äôs eyes and how seemingly normal people can fall for such outlandish nonsense. The cherry on the cake is that the people in these shows are held accountable for their bullshit. The liars are punished and the truth prevails. So there‚Äôs also a kind of wish fulfillment element to watching these shows. It shows how reasonable people can be taken in, how the lie works, and then punished the liar - the opposite of what‚Äôs happening in the world right now."
VIP,shitty people cover the whole spectrum
VIP,"I can appreciate the story telling and while I can understand the perception that this type of genre glorifies bad behavior they still resolve their stories with a narrative comeuppance. We can't really say that for the plethora of reality TV shows glorifying vapid housewives, mistresses,  etc."
VIP,Don‚Äôt forget The Tinder Swindler
VIP,"I actually felt bad for Sarma in Bad Vegan, she had so much potential to stay successful"
VIP,"I havent seen the Dropout but I am facinated by the Elizabeth Holmes story. I read the Book ""Bad blood "" a while back and find myself interested in these con artist type charmers. You need to keep an eye on chancers like this in your life.  

Wasnt there a movie with Jennifer lawerence about to be made about this too?"
VIP,Never trust anyone who is comfortable with wire transfers‚Ä¶
VIP,To show women can be just as corrupt as men.
VIP,I find Elizabeth Holmes fascinating. It‚Äôs pretty incredible how she was able to pull the wool over the eyes of billionaire investors and fucking Walgreens. Like.. how did no one do their due diligence?
VIP,"My hope is that there is some sort of ""scam awakening"" happening in society.

We need to be more aware of fraudsters, from the random door-to-door salesperson all the way up to Trump.

We, as a society, need to reduce the number of people falling victim to their deceit."
VIP,The wolf of wallstreet
VIP,It‚Äôs Hustler Culture the essence of Grifter America
VIP,Trump
VIP,"scams have become a huge industry. publicizing them is a good thing. these same tactics are shared and used across the documentaries and in real life by people scamming you.

creating artificial and rushed trust and intimacy. demonstrating your high net worth claims. having a family member/parent validate the conartist's claims. and creating an urgent need for the money (usually safety)."
VIP,"Because it is fascinating. It‚Äôs a part of all of us, but 99.9999% of people just don‚Äôt got to this extreme. It‚Äôs always intriguing to see what happens when some people break the norms that we all are controlled by in our everyday life."
VIP,"It's a cautionary tale.
Read ""The Man in the Rockefeller Suit"" for another great scammer story."
VIP,"Americans love to let pretty white ladies off the hook for crimes, notice the weird defenses of Holmes psychopathic behavior.

Essentially every time, It's that if a white woman is reasonably attractive, Americans believe there's no reason she should be a criminal, and the media plays the game.

These are fancy Lifetime movies, if you like them great, but they're modern pulp stories.


These shows are creepy, telling us nothing new, just exploitive nonsense to pass the time."
VIP,That  -- OFTEN criminals look different than you've been led to believe and financial crimes occur at the same rate and are JUST as damaging as violent crimes and need stronger sentences üòí
VIP,It's to distract us with stories of poor people stealing from rich people while the Oligarchs steal from all of us.
VIP,I‚Äôve complained about it as well. Why do we give these scum bags who trick everyone and rob them their light and make them celebrities. Fucking dumb
VIP,"Instead of glorifying this garbage as entertainment why don‚Äôt we make sure people like this get hard prison time.  Start with Trump, work our way down."
VIP,"Just like murder porn, just interesting to was. Based loosely on a true story, with enough drama to keep you hooked"
VIP,"Hey, so long as they don't mention the fukcing kardashians and all their nasty, vile baby daddies, fukc bois, fukc trophies and trophy wives, I'm in."
VIP,It‚Äôs entertaining. It‚Äôs not that deep
VIP,"It's part of true crime, people are interested in crime. It's not that deep."
VIP,"They are above suspicion because racism has positioned blonde white women and girls as the object of highest perfection/protection‚Ä¶ this enables them to siphon millions.

Unless they‚Äôre directly challenging a powerful white man they will always be believed/given the benefit of the doubt‚Ä¶all to say that the common denominator among the _most_ audacious scammers does not surprise me."
VIP,"Because people want to watch them?

Sorry that's all I've got.  Past that, ya got me.  I don't find any of these the slightest bit interesting.  Just not my cup of tea, I guess.  But they are clearly very popular overall."
VIP,Because it's fun to watch self righteous people crash and burn
VIP,People like glorifying bad behavior... at least my sister does. These shows are a reflection of or are normalizing anti-social behavior in our society.
VIP,"Inventing Anna got so bad it had to be turned off, left unfinished, scenes were very repetitive, should of definitely been done as a movie instead.."
VIP,you forgot Tinder Swindler
VIP,"The Dropput advert makes me laugh every time, it‚Äôs so hammy and stupid, I think it‚Äôs Stephen Fry‚Ä¶

*‚Äùyou don‚Äôt understand business‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚Äú*AND **YOU** DONT UNdeRSTAnd THE SCIeNCe!*‚Äù

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W7rlZLw9m10&start=116

makes me laugh everytime, maybe you shouldn‚Äôt be living hHEeEeEeEeeeeeeee"
VIP,Garbage TV for garbage people
VIP,"Its glamourizing the rich Instagram fake lifestyle people seem to envy. It also makes these people out to be heroes and not the villains they are, especially inventing Anna.  It is indicative of the sad state we find our culture in eighrnkwm"
VIP,"No more original content. And now things that happened 20 years ago is history. Audiences want marvel boom boom fight. Crash, noise, slam, fire, explosion‚Ä¶.everything is all the same. Tv is annoying, movies should entertain. (Or at least have different plots)."
VIP,"Tinder swindler too. Humans like to see other humans fall. Too bad in the dropout, Elizabeth ended up living with a hotel magnate in a 135 million dollar estate. Justice has not caught up with her at all."
VIP,We live in a scam/rob what you can world. Ask hedge funds an the american government:)
VIP,"I don't get why people watch these, I really don't. My parents watched Inventing Anna and it looked like the most boring show I may have ever seen. Just people sitting around talking. No action at all."
VIP,What's the point of these articles complaining about genres of TV?
VIP,to show how great white people are ‚Ä¶ ah duh and how they can do what ever they want with doing any jail time
VIP,"Money wtf why is this a question? Why is anyone reading the article.  

It‚Äôs always money. That‚Äôs the why. Unless it‚Äôs intercourses. But it‚Äôs really always those things and this has nothing to do with the second one. So it‚Äôs money."
VIP,Point is life is instant hussle so yeah they got caught but mostly people don‚Äôt so lesson is Fake it till you make it !
VIP,No point people just like em. Journalist u suck
VIP,Feminism?
VIP,"I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve noticed but frauds kind of rule the world (trump, musk, Putin). It‚Äôs all relative, but generally wealthy people pretend they‚Äôre worth more, and they put themselves in positions of power where they can manipulate and tell any lies possible to make more. The whole system is fraudulent, and the honest hard workers are generally at the bottom. I think this trend of shows captures that sentiment, it‚Äôs almost a nihilist perspective where it‚Äôs like ‚Äúfuck it, there is no point in life, let‚Äôs game it and take advantage and lie and deceive for personal gain.‚Äù I think it allures to a lot of people. More and more nihilists every day."
VIP,"I like true crime and thought I‚Äôd love these shows but after watching tinder swindler I‚Äôm done. The problem with these stories is they are all the same, same story, same motivation, same actions, different character. Lie steal money get arrested repeat. If the genre is gonna be successful I think they‚Äôre gonna have to find / create characters with different motivations for doing what they‚Äôre doing."
VIP,Ruth langmore is a badass ‚úÖ
VIP,"I‚Äôm loving ‚ÄúInventing Anna,‚Äù minus the fact that Anna Chlumsky reminds me of the insufferable Anne Hathaway. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs just her role as Vivian."
Doctor John,"I can only imagine how it feels for a fan to go from making a cute little Doctor Who / Sherlock crossover, to working on a Regeneration Scene and a scene involving *five* Doctors."
Doctor John,"Honestly, to think this one person did so much work on the show off the back of a funny little ‚ÄòDoctor Who meets Sherlock‚Äô video, and was only brought on because of Rachel Talalay."
Doctor John,His work with particles and organic CGI is just beyond compare. His work really is beauty. Astounding pieces of art.
Doctor John,"I gotta admit, the Cgi got so much better since the 13th doctor. Clearly received an increased budget. I also like the change to the 2:1 ratio."
Doctor John,"This is amazing! I sure stopped watching at the wrong time, these effects are way better than ten years ago"
Doctor John,The Capaldi title sequence was done by a YouTuber after Steven Moffat was shown an earlier version on his channel.
Doctor John,I really liked the effect of the little particles of light coming through the Doctor's face during the last regeneration. It was subtle but really added to the overall effect IMO.
Doctor John,"I'm really looking forward to the next batch of episodes. They've got a ton of Sony *and* Disney money coming in so even more of a budget, plus Russell T. Davies back in charge."
Doctor John,Decreased budget actually.
Doctor John,"> these effects are way better than ten years ago

The writing is also much worse."
Doctor John,"The production value did take a leap when Jodie's doctor was introduced.  The show looked a lot more cinematic and the visual effect quality improved.  But someone a bit of the charm was lost too.  IMO, turns out some the low-budget campiness is part of what makes Doctor Who"
Doctor John,"I feel like I stopped watching at the wrong time too, but I just couldn‚Äôt stand Clara, didn‚Äôt particularly like Capaldi‚Äôs Doctor, and was losing my ability to watch the new episodes anyway and wasn‚Äôt super inclined to find ways around that because of it. With the Disney deal, David Tennant coming back, and RTD back as showrunner, I may have to get back into it."
Doctor John,No Sony money. Bad Wolf is merely producing it on the BBC‚Äôs behalf with BBC money. The Disney thing is based on a misunderstanding of the press release for world distribution. They aren‚Äôt involved in production of the show.
Doctor John,"Hopefully it gets better now.

And it's not like Jodie got no good episodes, there's some gold in them hills. Just not enough.

If they keep these visuals with Chibnall out as showrunner, we could be in for a good era."
Doctor John,Lovely RTD back now though. :)
Doctor John,"Now there's an understatement... Completely and retroactively ruined nearly 60 years of Doctor Who in a single Timeless Child. Like, everything before that could be swept under the rug and safely ignored. But after that? Oofsie daisy."
Doctor John,"The next season of Doctor Who is being produced by Bad Wolf, who handled His Dark Materials and A Discovery of Witches. I'm going to assume the production quality is going to be even better again. (The worldwide deal with Disney helps too, I'm sure)"
Doctor John,"That's what I'm thinking as well. Russell T Davies is back as the showrunner and while I don't expect to be brought back to Series 4 David Tennant era of Doctor Who who made my childhood (even though funnily enough that's exactly what we're gonna get next year for a short bit), I just hope writing is more coherent and dialogue is more natural, cause I really wanna be immersed in this show again."
Doctor John,"> ‚ÄúI met with John and reprimanded him,‚Äù Julie Gardner, former Doctor Who and Torchwood executive producer said in a statement to the Guardian, ‚Äú[and made] it clear to both John and his agent that behaviour of this kind would not be tolerated‚Ä¶ To my knowledge, John‚Äôs inappropriate behaviour stopped thereafter.‚Äù 

So reading up on Barrowman, the issues with him happened as recently as November 2008. That was 12.5 years ago. When do we stop punishing someone if they have most likely learned from their mistakes because their last incident was 12.5 years ago? I mean if it was another recent incident, sure, but 12.5 years is a pretty good track record. 

This could just be my love for the character of Jack Harkness, but this just seems like a dumb reactionary move. ¬Ø\\\_\(„ÉÑ\)\_/¬Ø"
Doctor John,"I'm conflicted about the Barrowman thing  
Most of me thinks: it was 12 yrs ago, he was told to stop, and he stopped

But then I recall an early ep of Buzzcocks where I saw a predatory camp queen and thinking: I wouldn't like to be alone in a room with him"
Doctor John,Now I remember why I unsubscribed from this shithole many years ago.
Doctor John,"> Barrowman‚Äôs alleged frequent exposure of his genitals on the set of the show, framed as pranks.

Sigh"
Doctor John,Thanks social justice witchhunters. /s
Doctor John,"is great that when people like one person and something like this shows up is always ""it was 12 years ago..."" but if they dont like the person there are not valid excuses."
Doctor John,This is stupid. His actions were already addressed. What's the point in drudging up the past in order to re-punish people? Why not do this to everyone? I know a few public figures that we could drudge up some shit and fire them.
Doctor John,Cancel culture is fucking cancer
Doctor John,He should never be allowed to work again!
Doctor John,"I've not spoken out about ""cancel culture"" because I've mostly sided the other way, especially for creepy sexual predator behaviour. I'm sorry, but this falls nowhere into that calibre, based on my limited knowledge of the specifics. A gay man making jokes with his penis - obviously stupid, but stupid fun is like that. So long as the offense was visual, I just don't see it as bad. Now if he was non consensually smearing his penis onto other people - I'd likely feel differently. It sounds like this was handled properly back then. He was told he was crossing a line, and he stopped. If he continued doing it, I'd feel different. Equating this with Noel Clark creeper stuff seems like a false equivalence."
Doctor John,"Have people forgotten about Puppetry of the Penis? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppetry_of_the_Penis
This was a late 90's idea that had strong recognition in the early to mid 00's. I'm simply pointing out that there legit was a phase where doing weird things with a penis was very entertaining."
Doctor John,Wasn't he in Arrow?
Doctor John,"I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of fans out there who would like to experience immersing themselves into his ballsack.

EDIT: ME DOWNVOTED? UNPOSSIBLE!!!"
Doctor John,"Maybe they can do an animatronic groping simulator, in the Doctor Who Immersive Experience."
Doctor John,"I actually have a ticket for this - it's been put back a couple of times because of Covid. It would be a bit strange seeing him now, I'd say.

The Big Finish audios may well drop him as well - they've signed up a huge amount of the still living cast from the classic and new series, while recasting in cases where the actors are no longer with us. So, Captain Jack can be dropped without any real problems."
Doctor John,"He continued during [Torchwood season 4 (2011)](https://twitter.com/AMadmanNotABox/status/1391378931463376906?s=20) and mooned people on [Arrow (2014)](https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/514256/John-Barrowman-naked-Arrow-Season-3) so... though the Torchwood story seemed to be just with Eve, who had expressed before she was okay with seeing his dick (but the start of the clip suggests that the only thing stopping Barrowman was the American definition of ""sexual harassment""), and Arrow was ""only"" mooning. I think he (and society, it seems) has decided that mooning is an acceptable ""raunchy"" act, as he's done it on television fairly recently--but that is a very different situation than in a workplace environment.

I've seen people say that the on-set dynamic in general can get quite raunchy, so perhaps mooning fits in with that. The penis stuff there's no excuse for.

It's a tough situation, because Barrowman never really got any repercussions for his harassment, and it was fairly widely known from Eve's stories about the Torchwood set. But it's being brought up again now because of the (undeniably worse) [allegations against Noel Clarke (Mickey)](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/29/actor-noel-clarke-accused-of-groping-harassment-and-bullying-by-20-women). Barrowman's old allegations are (to me) distracting from the new ones against Clarke."
Doctor John,"I‚Äôm just as conflicted as you are.

My love for the public persona John Barrowman has and for Captain Jack make me want to just say, ‚ÄúIt was 12 years ago and just on-set jokey shenanigans üôÑ,‚Äù but I feel hypocritical for that because I know my judgment is definitely bias.

All-in-all, this is just a sad situation."
Doctor John,"It's absolutely ridiculous that we've come to a point where people are not allowed to grow from their mistakes. It was innapropriate behaviour, not sexual assault."
Doctor John,"And then the cast made of his say that everyone was laughing when he was all naked? If everyone's laughing then how is he supposed to know it's a problem? And when someone did tell him to stop and he did doesn't that mean problem solved?

Having the specter looming above you because you acted inappropriately a decade or more ago, in a way that didn't appear to hurt anyone, and it was stopped after just being talked to in the normal way you deal with issues like that is beyond shitty and unfair. I mean we're not talking about rape or violence."
Doctor John,"> When do we stop punishing someone if they have most likely learned from their mistakes because their last incident was 12.5 years ago? 

I mean they should face some consequence for it. It's not like he's been punished for 12 years. 

I assume the reason he's taken off is simply to avoid negative headlines about it. It's a money based move, not moral one."
Doctor John,"Because the social authoritarianism of the neo-puritans isn‚Äôt about learning, forgiveness or actual change. It‚Äôs about punishing and the rush they get from ruining people"
Doctor John,I am glad you found the real victim in all this: you and any terrible people doing terrible things a while ago
Doctor John,"> This could just be my love for the character of Jack Harkness, but this just seems like a dumb reactionary move. 

You know how they say you need to separate the art from the artist? That goes both ways. Jack Harkness was a fun, well written character, John Barrowman the actor is an asshole. Same goes for Captain Picard and Patrick Stewart. I refuse to allow asshole actors to ruin the roles they played perfectly in the past.

That said, this was 12 years ago and he already apologized. Cancel culture is stupid and there is no reason to bring this back up now."
Doctor John,"What makes me wonder is why people use the term ""allegations"". There aren't any ""allegations"" as Barrowman never hid that he loved pranking people with his dick. 

There's no allegations of abuse against him whatsoever. From what I understand this is literally just the information resurfacing and people on social media being unfomfortable with it. 

Maybe I'm just seeing it differently because I do know some gay men who love whopping their thingies out at parties or even during lunch breaks, and it never bothered me, but I'm just not seeing the ""allegations"" here."
Doctor John,"If you check [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/nb10kd/john_barrowman_removed_from_doctor_who_immersive/gxy61zx) it seems it kept going through the 2010s. 

Can people change? Sure. But a lot of the time they don't because they don't feel the need to."
Doctor John,">Why not do this to everyone? 

Most people who take their dick out at work would get fired from their job and never be allowed to work for them again.

Barrowman is being removed from a glorified theme park ride.  They're not even saying he won't be on the show in the future.  Seems like a pretty chill punishment, honestly."
Doctor John,"Nah it's creepy for sure. Being gay doesn't transform creepy into "" stupid fun""."
Doctor John,"> Now if he was non consensually smearing his penis onto other people

He actually did that  
Placing his dick on a woman's shoulder in make up or somewhere"
Doctor John,"Sounds like you'd be a pretty terrible HR director, champ. I have no doubt Barrowman was just ""stupid fun,"" but that doesn't make it any better for those who didn't want to see their coworker's dick. Intentions don't change the effect."
Doctor John,"Sure and I'm totally cool with it as a concept, but if there was a sudden surprise performance of Puppetry of the Penis in my workplace I'm not sure I'd be too cool with that."
Doctor John,"Yeah people have forgotten about an Australian theater/performance act, yes."
Doctor John,">	I'm simply pointing out that there legit was a phase where doing weird things with a penis was very entertaining.

Weird distinction to make when those people are very obviously consenting if they‚Äôre paying to see it. Try doing a flash mob with this penis puppet concept. See how far you get."
Doctor John,Maybe.
Doctor John,"I find it funny how so many people are equating their current personal work environments with an artistic work environment from over a decade ago, or even ridiculously comparing to Weinstein. Considering the nature of the allegations against Clarke, bringing up Weinstein obviously makes sense. But for Barrowman - not at all."
Doctor John,"Well that was certainly not on the Wikipedia page. Thanks for the info. I'm still a bit torn though. It means the last incident was 7 years ago, so this happening now is still weird."
Doctor John,You put only in quotes as if mooning some big deal. Ffs people can we stop this hysteria?
Doctor John,"Well though it seems not that long ago, it still was at a time where him coming out naked would seem like a joke. Nowadays, no.  Though I'm conflicted about why a naked person is so bad in comparison to those who are actual grab asses, sickos, etc. I see naked people at the beach all the time, & those who quite frankly are better off going naked considering where their thong covers absolutely nothing(talking about guys here). Now if he was going up to people & shoving his penis in their personal space....that is quite different."
Doctor John,">	And then the cast made of his say that everyone was laughing when he was all naked? If everyone‚Äôs laughing then how is he supposed to know it‚Äôs a problem? And when someone did tell him to stop and he did doesn‚Äôt that mean problem solved?

He didn‚Äôt stop though, he continued on Torchwood (which had the same producers as Who) and Arrow. He allegedly (I can‚Äôt find the video where he talks about it) entered Katie Cassidy‚Äôs trailer and did inappropriate things in there while she wasn‚Äôt there. 

Also, the cast might find it funny but we haven‚Äôt heard the crew‚Äôs side - maybe he made them uncomfortable, maybe not‚Ä¶"
Doctor John,He got in trouble for it years ago though. Why punish him again now?
Doctor John,"Why? Why would he have to be punished for something that people laughed at, wasn't harmful and he stopped when told it was not ok?"
Doctor John,"> I mean they should face some consequence for it

To what end?  He's already learned the behavior was wrong, and corrected it.

Further punishment would only set the example that the behavior wasn't wrong, getting caught was wrong."
Doctor John,"> I mean they should face some consequence for it

Let me dig up you past and see if you'll say the same thing."
Doctor John,"Ok, let's have some fun with this. Have you ever done anything bad? Of course you have! Now, if you did not steal, physically hurt someone or inflict massive emotional trauma to where the person has PTSD or something, do you think you should be punished for that action 12.5 year later? Or are you actually a saint that has never wronged anyone in their entire life? Because if you are, then we can go call the Vatican right now and work on getting you canonized."
Doctor John,"Uh. Did I miss something? What did Patrick Stewart do?

(I totally agree with your overall point though)"
Doctor John,">Maybe I'm just seeing it differently because I do know some gay men who love whopping their thingies out at parties or **even during lunch breaks**

Say what?

At my job that'd be an instant firing, lol."
Doctor John,"It is creepy by 2021 standards. If someone does this today, I think overall consensus would agree with you. At the time that it happened, and the many years before, this sort of thing would be accepted as quirky edgy humour, especially since it was a gay man doing it. I think at the time, there was considerably more leeway given to gay men as a counter to homophobia. John is a guy who basically grew up in the theatre world. For those not familiar with theatre from Greek + Roman antiquity, basically a boatload of comedies were dedicated to phallic humour, where the actors would basically wore massive boners as a costume. I'm totally not surprised that he found weird circumstances of penis exposure as funny, because it sure as shit can be."
Doctor John,"I mostly agree. But I would add that artistic workspaces just weren't treated the same as office environments. This has changed now, but I don't believe it was the case during the mid 00's."
Doctor John,Puppetry of the Penis is not something you'd want just thrust upon you.
Doctor John,"Weird for you to equate public flash mob with middle 00's artistic workspace. My point is, there was a weird penis thing going on at the time. John was not exposing his penis in public - it was a closed set. It crossed a line, but I believe that line was much murkier then than it is now."
Doctor John,"Sorry, I'm a chronic editor, so you probably didn't see the last paragraph, but it's very obvious that Barrowman's old stuff is being dragged up in the wake of new [allegations against Noel Clarke (Mickey)](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/29/actor-noel-clarke-accused-of-groping-harassment-and-bullying-by-20-women). The Guardian article and Barrowman being removed from the Immersive Experience happened within days of each other."
Doctor John,"He's not being ""punished,"" they're removing him to make their product more appealing to potential customers"
Doctor John,"I guess I'm fine with him facing some sort of consequence that isn't just ""Hey. Stop that."" But I fully understand it's not at such a level I'd not support him in the future anymore."
Doctor John,"
>To what end?  He's already learned the behavior was wrong, and corrected it.

Because that's what justice is? Not just 'I did something wrong to others, but I stopped so we're all square.'

>Further punishment

There would have to be initial punishment, for anything to be further punishment.

>would only set the example that the behavior wasn't wrong, getting caught was wrong.

...how? I don't follow this logic."
Doctor John,"Sure. I've never exposed my dick to people I work with. It's pretty easy to not do. 

Is that the reason I'm downvoted? I'm here saying that it's a bad thing and surrounded by redditors going ""Oh come on, it's not like it's at all unusual to commit minor sex crimes!"""
Doctor John,"Patrick Stewart didn't grope anyone or anything (that we know of yet), but he's super obnoxious and immature IRL, completely unlike Picard. Watch a few of his interviews and you'll understand what I mean."
Doctor John,[deleted]
Doctor John,People like harvey Weinstein thought their  behaviour was ok at the time too and that it's just the spoils of showbiz
Doctor John,"I mean marital rape wasn't accepted as a real thing in the UK until 1991. Does that mean a man raping his wife in the 80s is ok? Because it was a different thing? No, sexual assault is sexual assault no matter the time, sexual harassment is sexual harassment no matter the time"
Doctor John,I certainly wouldn‚Äôt want it shoved down my throat‚Ä¶
Doctor John,"What the fuck are you talking about?

You might think that everybody in this thread is like 16 years old and can't recall the '00s but plenty of people on reddit are 30, 40, 50+...

There was no such thing as a ""weird penis"" period in the '00s where people just casually whipped their dicks out, and people were not cool with it happening either.

Like why even make up that bullshit?"
Doctor John,"That's what I'm thinking. There aren't actually any ""allegations"" against Barrowman. It's just the info resurfacing in the wake of actual allegations of abuse. Info that makes people uncomfortable."
Doctor John,"So the issue back them was him showing his dick to people. What sort of punishment do you think that deserves other than his boss saying ""cut that out""? I mean if he kept doing it after being told to stop it would be one thing to fire him, but seemingly he stopped."
Doctor John,"-Punitive action is not inherently justice, its just the basis of our system of law to arrive at something approximating justice.

-The recrimination of his peers and employers was a form of punishment, and it apparently was enough to change his behavior.

-Basic conditioning: the behavior was already corrected, a new negative stimulation enforces the idea that the original correction was flawed and a new sollusion must be drawn to prevent further negative stimuli.  Simplest solution, don't get caught."
Doctor John,"There is a point where someone could do something as a joke back then & not mean any harm. That's different than someone knowingly doing something that would be offensive. If he was swinging his penis in someone's personal space-yea he should know. But just coming out naked and dancing around??? Like I said nowadays, yes they should all know better, but back then....."
Doctor John,"Doesn't it depend on the people you work with?  Take Clooney, Pitt, etc-I see them joking around like that. An office setting, no.  Grocery store, no. But these are actors, directors, tv set people, etc who had been working together for a awhile. We don't know what their kind of ""comraderie"" was."
Doctor John,"Okay that wasn't their point. There's been a thing in the past few years especially of dragging up whatever bad shit people did forever ago, as if all of us are perfect and never did or said really inappropriate things 12 years ago? 20 years ago? 40 years ago? 

DexterRileyisHere was clearly speaking in a general sense, they weren't like ""Oh yeah I'm sure you never showed a coworker your penis before""."
Doctor John,"Clearly, you feel that way. Only an idiot believes he speaks on behalf of everyone from all time."
Doctor John,Thanks for stating this. I feel it is completely batshit crazy to equate what Weinstein did with what we are discussing here.
Doctor John,"It is tremendously problematic that you equate exposed penis jokes with rape. For shits and giggles, talk with someone who has experienced the horror of rape, and see what they think. I'm stupefied that anyone could actually believe they (morally) weigh the same."
Doctor John,Yeah I must have skipped that phase.
Doctor John,"Is this a segue for your flat earth theories? Cause if you haven't actually seen the round earth with your own eyes, it therefore must not exist, right? I am curious - what field of entertainment (and in which country) were you involved in that makes you believe your perception on this is definitive? Remarkable, but unsurprising, that you insist that someone would actually be making up bullshit, when in fact they might be drawing on personal experience. 

Let me blow your mind with a single example - what was known as the Mangina - and not to be mistaken with the modern urban use which is a strike against feminism. http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/mangina
Pay attention to the 2002 and 2005 citations, describing a routine where a male would tuck in his balls and his penis between his legs, thus giving a comical appearance of a vagina. Believe it or not, back in the 90's (likely was done even earlier outside of me personal experiences) and 00's, I personally experienced several different men perform this routine, both in public and closed environments. For the most part, the multi gendered observers laughed about it, and I do not recall any instance of anyone speaking out in offence (though I very much concede some may have felt it, but did not speak on it).

For the record - I have not seen anyone do this since around the mid 00's.

In any case - could cite other things, but why bother engaging with a flat earther mindset whose limited experiences prevent the feasibility of believing that strange penis things within artistic communities did actually happen,"
Doctor John,"I mean, it is a crime. 

I think removing him from a ride isn't disproportionate to what he did wrong. Yeah, it's silly that it's happening 12 years later, but that's what's happening in culture now. The shit people for away with before because they were part of the boys club, doesn't fly."
Doctor John,">as if all of us are perfect and never did or said really inappropriate things 12 years ago?

I mean repeatedly showing your dick to coworkers as an 42 year old adult, isn't just like a bad joke you made as a college student. 

I'm not arguing for a lynch mob, just noting that facing some consequences for that, in this case a very minor one, doesn't seem out of line. There's tons of people who behaved poorly that got away with it because they worked in a boys club where no one took women's complaints seriously. Generally speaking, accountability for those past wrongs, is a good thing."
Doctor John,[deleted]
Doctor John,"> Only an idiot believes he speaks on behalf of everyone from all time.

You're talking to this generation. These kids really do think this way."
Doctor John,The connection is it's both behaviour that was explained away as  normal/ok for the time.  Now you see the excuse doesn't work.
Doctor John,"Wtf. I didn't equate them at all. Read what I said. Also don't fucking assume I've never dealt with that, that's disgustingly ignorant. 

My actual point, if you bother to read it rather than try to make me seem bad, is applying your logic to something more horrific, to show you it's flawed. Rape has not always been seen as bad. That's horrible. That doesn't excuse rapists at the time rape wasn't considered as bad. The same is true for other things too, things that aren't anywhere as bad as rape but the logic still stands. Getting your dick out in front of you coworkers might have been considered fine 10 years ago but that doesn't excuse the person who did it.

I nowhere even hinted that they're morally wiegh the same, in fact the fact that rape is so much worse is entirely the basis of my argument. To say otherwise shows you either didn't engage properly or you just wanted to accuse me of dismissing rape because i disagree with you, which is honestly pretty horrific."
Doctor John,"> though I very much concede some may have felt it, but did not speak on it

You could have stopped typing there because I GUARANTEE you that this was the case. Like you have to not have good social skills if you think this wasn't the case. I don't know why you even bring up flat earth theories like it's supposed to convince anyone of your side. 5head."
Doctor John,People can get really salty about the suggestion that it was *never* a good time to show your penis to your coworkers repeatedly.
Doctor John,"I think it speaks on how the value of ""wrong"" has shifted over time. I agree that it is wrong by today's standards. I disagree that there was unanimous consensus on it being wrong back when it happened. If you can't recognise this distinction, that just speaks to your limited reasoning skills."
Doctor John,"It genuinely is frightening how historically illiterate some people are, and how they can't even conceive something that isn't from now."
Doctor John,I think there are better ways to express values changing over time then comparing a disturbing sexual predator with a guy who tried to make stupid ha ha's with his dinky. I'm fairly sure most people would have condemned Weinstein if they were aware of what he was doing. I'm not so sure that most people would have condemned John. I think awareness of consent has vastly improved within the public Zeitgeist.

Someday or One Day,"Everyone I knew at one point pirated music, everyone. Even my dad. Then Spotify came out and now everyone has access to basically any song ever for a decent fee.

And rather than spending money on an attempt to provide an affordable comprehensive easy-to-use service they instead are becoming more consumer hostile with preventing VPN, password sharing, and DMCA take downs and court cases.

They'll continue to try to build in watchdogs into computers (I'm looking at you Windows 11 hardware requirements) to enforce licensing issues, but that's a losing battle.

The number of people pirating is just going to increase as pirating becomes easier and easier with Kodi integration, home streaming devices, etc.

Maybe someday some upstart will embrace the new economy rather than fight it. iTunes was a huge hit because it did just that. And seeming indomitable Spotify and the like managed to embrace it even more and be successful.

But then business dinosaurs fight for their lives the only way they know how until eventually their species is gone. And nobody will miss them."

I don't understand television watching, I could never sit through ads, or paying multiple sub services.

Already backed up 30 Rock and IASIP right after some episodes got needlessly yanked while the seeds were still fresh.

So just in case we all need to get punished again for daring to let a guy try to buy cigarettes with counterfeit money, I'm gonna have to buy some more storage devices to back up American Dad and Family Guy, too.

Someday or One Day,Fun fact: no matter where you live piracy is not bad and anyone trying to convince you it's a crime is an ammoral dumbass.
Someday or One Day,Why would you pirate something you believe has no quality?
Someday or One Day,"Just have a good adblock on your phone or laptop and use soap2day or bflix. It‚Äôs so painless you can watch anything.

I airplay from my phone to my tv"
Someday or One Day,"adults.  that's the demo.

yes the Reddit crowd is probably 90%, but many folks raised during the 80's or before were raised not to do this kind of thing."
Someday or One Day,But that‚Äôs like half the content on Reddit!
Someday or One Day,"I mean, if people do not pay for television, soon enough you will have nothing to pirate.
Better keep thanking they can afford to pay."
Someday or One Day,Way to brag about being a deadbeat. If there weren‚Äôt good people who paid then you‚Äôd have nothing to steal.

Someday or One Day,"An antenna has served me well.  I have a Tablo that puts the broadcast on my network where I can watch off connected devices.  It has a DVR, and there are programs that allow you to take the shows off the DVR and move them to wherever you'd like.  I also use commercial removing software before putting the show on a Plex server.

Everything I paid for up front.  The only monthly subscription available is the guide data to the Tablo.  I bought the lifetime option when I got the device.  It's more than paid for itself already.

The only issue is that there are fewer and fewer quality suites in standard broadcast TV.  I've got a great catalogue of NFL games though."
Someday or One Day,What is stopping you in this instance
Someday or One Day,"No, pirates are the ones who need to grow the fuck up."
Someday or One Day,"This also includes sports, mind. Which is heavily overpriced."

I think you're going to be disappointed.  Whomever ends up owning Bally is going to have the rights."
Someday or One Day,"Wasn't just this posted recently? 

That companies are seeking (legal action even?) Reddit posts/comments about ppl who share pirating stories/tips, etc?

Someday or One Day,"Ya I believe that number for sure. I'm a 20 something that isn't an idiot when it comes to tech, but I hardly ever even try to pirate anything. Can't remember the last time I did. If I can't get it on YTTV or one of the streaming services I have, I just don't bother. Forget people my parents age."
Someday or One Day,Removing episodes that have blackface when they‚Äôre poking fun at the concept of blackface is so stupid.  Always Sunny in particular is mocking the stupid characters who find it acceptable and constantly pointing out that it‚Äôs racist.  Same goes with RDJ in Tropic Thunder.  That‚Äôs a brilliant use of blackface to poke fun at both the absurd nature of method acting and also Hollywood in general.
Someday or One Day,"This also includes 65+ audience that likely has no idea what any of these questions even were and thats ~20% of the sample.

And there is an additional 5% that is ""prefer not to say"" which means yes.

Its probably 20-25% of the 18-64 population would reasonable assumptions who pirate, if not more"
Someday or One Day,Streaming is far more convenient than pirating. It's not really surprising that people opt to stream.
Someday or One Day,"Its more like the torrent protocol simply breaks any idea that a user is not ""sharing""  and copying the content, since inherent in torrents is that you have upload and download. There's a lot more to say, but yeah, lets not kid ourselves about how torrents work"
Someday or One Day,Anyone who try to convince you to pay for shit is amoral?
Someday or One Day,"the irony of using ""ammoral"""
Someday or One Day,How is it not?
Someday or One Day,Fuck the deadbeats who steal.
Someday or One Day,Because it's not worth the asking price?
Someday or One Day,Well since Zaslav had his way a lot of great HBO content is only available on the high seas.
Someday or One Day,"Are you kidding, those raised during the 80s are why anti piracy in the gaming industry became a thing. 

Go out buy a game and a pack of blank cassettes, a few hrs with a duel tape deck and your mates all had a copy. Just had to remember to turn the volume way down or deafen yourself with binary screeching.

Then came code cyphers / word look up in manuals etc. Tho those were quickly beaten as usually there was only a limited selection of challenges which wasn‚Äôt difficult to determine with patients and a pen."
Someday or One Day,"People even born later than that too. I'm 28 and none of my friends pirate anything really. I know it's anecdotal, but it's not like every young person out there is pirating."
Someday or One Day,"That's really not true though.

It's not like a multi-billion dollar industry is just going to disappear."
Someday or One Day,I don't know.  Even when I know I can get away with it I'd rather go without than feel dishonest
Someday or One Day,College hockey enters the chat
Someday or One Day,"MLB is possibly going to just purchase them and remove the blackout

RSN's are dying friend"
Someday or One Day,Link? Also that does not seem actionable if it is just words
Someday or One Day,"That's because the executives just care about the bottom line.

whoah BLM and chatter about racism? Then it's either ""better safe than sorry, this could be bad, even though nobody is talking about it"" or ""if we do this people will like us! We'll appear anti-racist!"" Alternatively ""people'll get mad, it'll boost us and we lose the potential risk of hosting the episode. Win win."" There's no ideology involved.

And then there's the Fawlty Towers thing which was obviously shady as hell when you look into it. 

and in the end you just get all the BLM and anti-racist activists getting the blame even though they're confused about the episode delistings too."
Start-Up,Crackle alone seems to fly low on people's radars. I'll definitely check this out.

Start-Up,"All I could think of when he says, ""This is your mess, and I'm going to clean it up for you, so you're welcome."" is how Crackle has not really been a very popular service and they probably paid him a ton of money to bring viewers to their service. "
Start-Up,"Crackle's ""Chosen"" has flown under the radar, and it's a great little thriller with a decent cast. I pimp it whenever relevant."

Start-Up,"They most certainly aren't. Take this for example, I don't think game of thrones is as good as everyone makes out. It's 8 filler episodes then 2 really great ones."
Start-Up,Big oops. I thought of all other enticements and forgot the bang-on obvious. Fuck. At least it's not another post about Stranger Thongs ;)
Start-Up,So. Just because it's free doesn't excuse the fact that it was mess.

That had to be intended."
Start-Up,s2 true detective felt like it was trying too hard to be dark and you can't top s1's source material- it pretty much wrote itself.
Start-Up,"S2 was definitely not all over the place. It was more focused than S1, even, with its redundant storyline of the Supermarket King."
Start-Up,Yeah I have to agree for the exact reasons you gave. S2 had its moments but overall I wasn't as affected by the storytelling.
Start-Up,"> I don't think game of thrones is as good as everyone makes out. It's 8 filler episodes then 2 really great ones.

The last season (6) was pretty much balls to the wall... to each their own."
Start-Up,"GOT is pretty mundane at times, so I can certainly see where you're coming from! Looking at it in retrospect, the high sparrow plotline basically went nowhere and almost put me to sleep (only for them to cheaply 'solve' that situation by having a big explosion), Arya's storyline never felt fully developed or well explained enough, and all the Greyjoy stuff from this season was pretty boring.

I've realised that I mainly enjoy the spectacle and individual moments of GOT, but as a whole I don't think I've ever felt it was as incredible as the internet tells me it is.

But OK, got it re the opinions. I'll amend mine to say that Fargo season one and two are equally the most amazing bits of television I've ever seen, they are faultless pieces of high art created by some kind of higher power - they are just that good and I see now that their status is irrefutable.
"
Start-Up,"Well, it is a trailer and it is cut rather wildly. So I'd argue that (1) it is probably not that much of a mess and (2) yeah, something that is for free should get a little more leeway, maybe...hell, even stuff that costs money shouldn't make us feel entitled to expect more than an average level of quality. But that's just me."
Start-Up,"other random comments of mine are all hitting 0 and -11 now so Im pretty sure it's like, 1 redditor and his alt or 1 redditor and a friend of his following me around hitting the downvote button, that or the random karma score fuzzing is focusing on my account :S "
Start-Up,"Yeah, most folks saw US Office before UK Office so to them he's British Jim, as opposed to our American Tim."

Start-Up,PS Mr Robot is...pretty alright.
Start-Up,"Yeah, no one gives enough shits about your random comment to do that. "
Start-Up,"Most American folks.

As a Brit I found myself unable to watch or accept the American version."
Start-Up,"Yeah see I just don't get Mr Robot, What am I missing? 

Fargo TV series are amazing as was True Detective series 1. "
Start-Up,"Mr Robot is a good show. But it's not an amazing show like cirtics and every early adopting, thinks-they're-cool nuckbeard on reddit seems to think.

The main guy is good but the rest of the cast aren't. The plot is...pretty good, but it's nothing revolutionary.

Overall the show is just as I said...a pretty alright show.

It seems clear to me that the nuckbeards of reddit only elevate its status because the lead character has social anxiety and everyone on reddit presumably relate to him so much OMG.

Fargo s2 I found entertaining, and I liked it, but it was entirely forgettable to my mind when compared to its far superior first season. That's just my OPINION everyone!
"
Start-Up,"After True Detective season 2 which I found to be all over the place I watched Fargo season 2 and found it quite good while not the same as season 1 (which by the way was the movie rehashed kind of), it was fresh and still very good definitely can't wait to see what they do for season 3.
"
Start-Up,"It's not that I relate to him (I kind of do) or that I find the plot amazing (it's really not, although it got some neat twists), it's how the show is crafted. I'm a sucker for unique visuals, good editing and good music scores. That's what does it for me and I'm not afraid to admit it. Yeah, I liked Interstellar, deal with it."
Start-Up,"Yeah, they're certainly solid writers and are happy to go to really potent violent extremes, so I'm interested to see what s3 brings too.

True Detective s2! Hmm, while it was very flawed, I thought some scenes were tremendous. The inside the sex party was chilling and very well done.

Obviously not a patch on s1 though overall."
Start-Up,"OK internet stranger - I think I can deal with the fact you like some stuff. To me, Mr Robot just seems to be very try hard 'Look, we're doing the unique visuals, look at us!'

There's such obvious artifice in the show's attitude towards what it's doing. I can't say it's not entertaining, but there's a vibe about it, that same type you get when someone you hate introduces you to something you end up really liking.

And for me Interstellar was a total disaster and almost terrible.

So hey, opinions are like assholes: everyone has one!"
Start-Up,"Yeah I think it's the character development that helps to make Fargo so good and the writing is definitely top notch. TD1 is definitely interstellar (ikr) :p standout scene is the biker raid in the projects done in one shot so intense absolutely blew my mind. 

God damn gonna have to do a rewatch. "
Start-Up,"> very try hard 

I like that. They are *trying* something. I think I'm a very open person. I do have my limits, but Mr Robot and Interstellar didn't reach those limits."
Start-Up,"Yeah, a litany of strung together try hard shots is mainly what Mr Robot looks like. Intelligent cinematography that is innovative is used sparingly, and therefore I think that often Mr Robot makes itself look amateurish by trying to be overly 'avant garde'."
Start-Up,"> a litany of strung together try hard shots

I've seen stuff like that, Mr. Robot is not that. But like you said, opinions etc."
Start-Up,"Description: A show depicting the young employees of Sandbox, a Korean start-up company, who dream of becoming the next Steve Jobs."
Start-Up,"I thought the crackle show ""startup"" is pretty brilliant."
Start-Up,"I remember checking out the first couple episodes on Crackle because I was surprised they got Martin Freeman. I stopped watching though because Crackle was obnoxious to deal with. 

I'll have to watch it now that it's on Netflix. Thanks OP. Show was decent from what I remember."
Start-Up,It‚Äôs great.   It has an ending at least.  Big fan
Start-Up,"Been watching it while working out the last few weeks and just finished it ‚Äî what a ride! Some amazing performances and writing with a few salty aspects to me, for sure. I was pleasantly surprised when Ron Perlman joined the cast ‚Äî and stayed ‚Äî out of nowhere. This should absolutely would have got more attention if on something that could have marketed it effectively."
Start-Up,This show almost feels like a USA Network series (during their 'Sunny skies' era) trying to get into the 'prestige television' game
Start-Up,Definitely a few dark parts that had me hesitant to continue. I hung in there and really enjoyed the show. Too bad it ended
Start-Up,I've always been curious as to why the RT rating is so low.
Start-Up,I'm halfway though series 1 and there was 'True Romance' style gratuitous male on female violence scene and it kind of put me off. It was REALLY bad . And unnecessary.
Tayos Singalong Show,I guess you're forgetting Dinner Party. 
Tayos Singalong Show,Huge Office fan.  I would list this as a pretty good episode but not even close to the best.

Someone Has to Die,"I have my opinions about how off the rails they went after Change Your Mind (Even a slight reworking of Reunited to tie up some loose ends really would make a good finale) but the show at its peak really meant the world to me for awhile and a special room in my heart is reserved for SU at its best. 

Like I'm actually *not* a fan of how hindsight makes Pearl seem like a codependent mess here as opposed to someone who suffered a genuine loss that stings all the more because her feelings were unrequited, but as the latter it really is top notch. I was *heartbroken* for her when I first saw this, and Mr. Greg is still my favorite episode."
Someone Has to Die,"It's such a complex situation... Most shows couldn't do it well, if they dared even touch it... Most viewers probably haven't experienced anything like it. I certainly haven't. 

And along comes this kids cartoon that absolutely nails it with a 2.5 minute song and dance number. Wow. This episode gave me a whole new appreciation of Pearl. 

I almost decided not to watch the show at the last minute because it looked too childish. It's one of the best things I've ever seen."
Someone Has to Die,"That is my favourite episode. Live the entire show and future especially, but It's Over, Isn't It broke me. Outstanding song."
Someone Has to Die,"Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon, up to the Adventure Time Alzheimer‚Äôs allegory and Hey Arnold‚Äôs parental neglect in Helga‚Äôs therapy episode. This was the height of SU as a show, and was a major tearjerker in the context of the show."
Someone Has to Die,"My friend showed me this once, and having never seen the show, I had zero context for this song. And yet it still brought a tear to my eye. There was no way I was gonna pass on the show after that."
Someone Has to Die,That show as full of banger songs tbh.
Someone Has to Die,"What makes it worse is that she didn't really die, she's technically still there, just changed beyond recognition. This means Pearl has never been able to properly mourn or let go. Maybe she'd been hoping she'd come back some day, but every time she'd look at Steven all she could see was the crystal that used to be her friend."
Someone Has to Die,Wow. Never seen the show but this makes me want to watch. This is beautifully melancholy.
Someone Has to Die,It's my second favorite SU song. Pearl is so raw and real and open about how she feels. My heart hurt so bad for Greg and Steven but Pearl.... They had thousands of years together and then Rose was just gone and all that was left was little Steven. And despite all the pain Pearl was there for her son. Fricking love Pearl and Steven Universe.
Someone Has to Die,"‚ÄúNow I have to be there for her son‚Äù

That line always hit hard. Even in normal humans, that situation would be tough. In Steven/Rose‚Äôs case, I can‚Äôt even imagine."
Someone Has to Die,I'm sad this era of animation is over thanks to HBO.
Someone Has to Die,I would like to point out that later episodes show that Pearl was literally Roses slave. So it‚Äôs a slave having feelings for her master and she‚Äôs so devoted to rose even after death and can‚Äôt get over it cause rose asked her to never stop feeling for her. I wouldn‚Äôt call any of this a good thing. I‚Äôm hindsight it makes this song seem really hollow.
Someone Has to Die,peak CN was dexters/cow/jhonny/pp girls/courage/eds not this
Someone Has to Die,"Steven Universe and it's sequel Steven Universe Future was quite possibly the most emotionally mature show in TV. Cartoon or live action included. It handled some incredibly deep issues so well that kis and their parents can both enjoy. 

The episodes of Steven Universe Future with the ""Steven Tag"" was heartbreaking from a parent's perspective and their kids growing up but was so good."
Someone Has to Die,"Wow, a lot wrong here.

First if all, it wasn't an unrequited love, they were together for thousands of years. Rose would love humans from time to time but eventually  she'd move on (or they'd die) and she'd be with Pearl again, as Pearl and Rose were effectively (barring an accident or murder) immortal.

Secondly, part of the uncertainty (""It's over isn't it? Isn't it? isn't it over?"") Comes from the uncertain status. Rose gave up her existence to create Steven, but is that absolutely the end? Might she return again, perhaps after Steven's life, if he proves mortal?

Died in childbirth and Pearl's love for Rose being unrequited, did you just watch like...that one episode?"
Someone Has to Die,Pink/Rose really messed Pearl up. Just so much damage and none of it hashed out before Steven was born. Poor soul.
Someone Has to Die,This show sucks.
Someone Has to Die,"Err... Pearl is a born slave with a toxic, almost pathetically dependent one-way relationship with a childish space Nazi. Steven Universe is a dark, inappropriate for children mess. The song is fine (some of them are good tbf), but Sugar's show is not okay in many ways. When Season 2 ended, it took an immediate nosedive. The series finale was the rotten cherry on top with the one-episode redemption arc of a genocidal villain.

Also... if fusion is meant to represent an... *intimate* bond between two or more Gems, what is going on between Steven and Connie (two underage kids) and Steven and Greg (father and son) when they fuse? ‚ò†üíÄ

Someone Has to Die,"A pretty good quartet sang a pretty good arrangement of this at our international contest [this past summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiChRPulzdc). 

I still haven't seen Steven Universe, so at the time I had no idea what it was from, or that it was even from anything, but the lyrics are so heartbreaking even without context."
Someone Has to Die,"Honestly the last moment I remember being impressed and moved by Steven Universe. I dropped it soon after this episode, it was just really starting to make me sad. It's plot had run it's course, the 10 minute long episode runtimes were killing it, and I just didn't think it was as good anymore. But there were some really amazing episodes, mostly focused on Pearl, Rose and Greg, that I'll always hold close to my heart."
Someone Has to Die,This episode fucked me up for a while- because it made me realize i was hanging onto a past relationship. Im happy to say i was able to move on and find new relationships. But i still think about that person everyday like the one that got away.
Someone Has to Die,"I swear I have some kind of misophonia variant. Musicals and such irrationally irritate me. I like music (particularly early 90s grunge), but when a song becomes part of the plot of something, I can't bear it."
Someone Has to Die,"Didn't like how From Here to Homeworld played out so fast, but the ending of the SU movie and Future left a satisfied taste in my mouth.

Wait, hang on...bit of phrasing there."
Someone Has to Die,"I remember my father, brother and I were having a conversation while I was trying to watch this episode. We all got quiet when this part came on. I was on the verge of tears, and then the conversation picked up like normal. The power of art."
Someone Has to Die,"Well, I think Pearl IS a codependent mess.  After all, she's a pearl, ""bred"" to be obedient to her diamond. Love came into play for Pearl, which just made kind of a mess of her head.  Part love, part obedient servant."
Someone Has to Die,"I have no context for anything you‚Äôve just said, but your description of its effect upon you has left me wanting to give this series a try."
Someone Has to Die,"Future was fucking stupid in how in sets up a bunch of new plotlines that dont get resolved. 

Volleyball was a super important Pearl development and then she disappears. 

Bluebird was a random ass new threat that just disappears after vowing to kill Steven. 

PERIDOT AND LAPIS DON‚ÄôT HAVE ANY DIALOGUE TOGETHER. Don‚Äôt know what the fuck Sugar was thinking"
Someone Has to Die,Help an ignorant and dumb man understand. What is this dynamic she‚Äôs singing about because I am way off with my guessing.
Someone Has to Die,"The big ""reveal"" with Steven at the end of the show in front of the diamonds legit makes me tear up every time I see it

The show gets a lot of flak, but it's really really solid"
Someone Has to Die,They also had to redraw the animation for Pearl because the voice actress put so much emotion into it. Epic acting move.
Someone Has to Die,"Steven Universe is a show just full of those.  One of my favorites, and that's coming from someone who was already grey of hair when he saw the first episode.

I do have to admit it took a while to grow on me, and for a long time it was just background noise I'd occasionally overhear around the younger folks. But then I caught little glimpses of the end of season 1 and got hooked."
Someone Has to Die,">Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon.

Then we get to ""Steven Universe: Future.""

That whole series fucked me up, man."
Someone Has to Die,"Oof, coming to realize later that Helga's mom was an alcoholic, her dad was a workaholic, and the favored child Olga was always on the bring of breaking because she felt so much pressure on her.

Helga woulda been the most relatable if she didn't have the creepy Arnold statue made of gum in the closet thing."
Someone Has to Die,Regular Show also did a good job with this. Mordecai spent the entire 8 seasons chasing Margaret before realizing it was just a silly crush and that they are better as friends than lovers and that he needed to move on.
Someone Has to Die,They did do that in a later episode when Steven was a baby and she tried taking his gem out. Shit got dark.
Someone Has to Die,"Season 1 is a bit wonky, a little too childish, but it gets going by season 2. Season 1 is instrumental for certain things to be meaningful later (most notably the Steven/Connie relationship, fusion and what the monsters they fight actually *are*, Greg's lack of wealth until this very episode, etc.). But you could start with a hand-selected list of episodes, a bigger fan will probably tell you it's *all* important but you can skip around season 1 and watch maybe 10 of its 52 episodes. Just watch in order by the time you get to season 1 finale."
Someone Has to Die,"The emotional intelligence of this ""kids show"" is staggering. Made me cry more than once."
Someone Has to Die,"I've heard one other song from this show and it was pretty damn good but I still can't separate the knowledge I have of the fandom from the show itself. Every time I think about watching the show I just get echoes of ""you're whitewashing this character that we decided is POC-coded because she's purrrrrrppppplllllleeeee"""
Someone Has to Die,*Discovery
Someone Has to Die,"You're correct. I loved SU at its peak but they really dropped the ball with the ending. You can't make the villains fascist mass-murderers and just redeem them at the end ""bEcAuse thEy'Re fAmiLy"". It's why I don't recommend the series to friends."
Someone Has to Die,"Regular Show, Adventure Time, Over the Garden Wall, etc. all received near-universal acclaim throughout their runs. It petered out a bit for me by the time OK KO came out (I really hate its animation style) but I watched these as a teenager and in college, give them a shot. CN Real was a dumb experiment and Adventure Time in particular revived the network in the public consciousness. I remember seeing the t-shirts throughout high school and not just by the nerdy kids.

HBO Max's desire to kill its staggering animation history makes it all the sadder that the last real CN show for kids *and* adults, Infinity Train, is only available on iTunes now and a persona non grata to David Zaslav due to residuals to animators."
Someone Has to Die,"Lol but it's fitting for SU....loads of double entendre in it.

But it's precisely the movie and Future I don't like....but then anything doubling down on the anti Rose agenda and leaving the Diamonds unshattered/unpunished would've left me fuming. Oh well, I am glad the other half of the fanbase enjoys."
Someone Has to Die,"Your people gave SU at least a few moments of their time?!

I can't get anyone in my circle to, but still I aspire to it one day. That sounds like a perfect moment."
Someone Has to Die,"Yeah I feel like people forget that the gems have some pretty stringent programming in the back of their minds that is shown to still be extremely present throughout characters we know.

‚ÄúDo it for her‚Äù is still a massive demonstration of this she conveys all her feelings about obligation to rose and her willingness to disregard her own safety and to die to protect her and try‚Äôs to transfer all of that baggage onto Connie who she sees as the equivalent for Steven. 

And those things are conveyed much earlier than it‚Äôs over isn‚Äôt it.

Most of pearls arc throughout the show is learning to be her own person with her own needs, wants and desires instead of the ‚Äòservant‚Äô for rose(as was her original programming) and a ton of that requires her breaking out from that dependence on rose"
Someone Has to Die,"My issue I suppose is the show reinforcing anything done on Rose's part to make her feel that way, which makes it seem worse, more noticeable, and invalidating of the love she feels. Now We're Only Falling Apart should've been the final word on Rose's feelings on it, where she's depicted as being extremely uncomfortable with it and tries to shut it down at every turn. 

Yes any leaning into those feelings is suggestive of her ""purpose"" and how much she needs to move away from it, but I like the greater mix earlier parts of the show had where the love feels genuine and something you can root for, but not the subservience. Taking into account the show as a whole it's made it seem *all* subservience and I just think this song is less tragic that way, more ""pathetic,"" and I don't like it.

Do It For Her has been mentioned but it's brilliant because it can be read multiple ways. People who didn't literally serve a loved one in real life would still die for them if they needed to and we don't call that unhealthy, and by that point in the show you feel Rose would too if Pearl would allow it, and speaking for her is the problem rather than her dedication to her. This plays out with Steven aka Rose herself in a sense where he doesn't want to stop Connie from having his back, but wants to fight alongside her. 

This part of the show depicts Pearl's relationship with Rose as complicated, but coming from a place of real love and clarity. Those ""silly games"" with Greg mentioned shows real capacity for self-reflection so she knows deep down she has issues, but maybe casting the sum total of her feelings as the issue weakens the power of It's Over Isn't It. Just my two cents."
Someone Has to Die,"If you do end up enjoying it, remember to shoot me a message if you want, I'd really like to hear about it. :)"
Someone Has to Die,"Its a very long story.  Trying to keep it as short as I can, she was the right-hand to Rose Quartz and she developed feelings for her.  However, Rose Quartz eventually developed feelings for a human (Greg, Steven's father) and, in order for them to have a kid, Rose had to give up her 'gem' to her child, which means her death. Pearl (and the other crystal gems) also had to raise Steven afterwards as they had no idea what a Human/Gem hybrid could end up like.

Rose and Pearl were together a long time.  So the song is about her still trying to move on from Rose's passing, as well as her jealousy towards Greg."
Someone Has to Die,"She dedicated and changed her entire life for a woman she loved only to have her fall for someone else. But because she loved her so much, she dedicated herself to her love‚Äôs son after she died. Steven is a constant reminder that Rose is gone forever and a testament to what Pearl lost when Rose died."
Someone Has to Die,"I love Steven Universe: Future so much. It's so rare we ever get to see cartoon characters age (anything more than a one-off scene in the future is almost non existent), and it really allowed us to explore Steven's life from a new perspective. I feel like the main show was very heavily focused on the story of a child learning about the failings of his seemingly-perfect mother and having to right her wrongs, while Future really started letting Steven become his own person. The updates in character designs and behaviors were just the cherry on top"
Someone Has to Die,"Oh yeah, and what would you make the statue out of huh? Ramen?"
Someone Has to Die,Broken people becoming obsessed with someone they view as successful and can solve all of their problems is incredibly relatable.
Someone Has to Die,"I can't comment about any race related aspect of the show, but I rarely hear good things about the fandom.

They even bullied a fellow fan-artist into attempting suicide."
Someone Has to Die,This era ended even before AT&T even involved.
Someone Has to Die,I mean you gotta admit that is all very much in brand for who stevens character is.
Someone Has to Die,The end shows that the diamonds are all working hard to be better. They're not just magically forgiven now.
Someone Has to Die,"I mean, it‚Äôs also pretty easy to recommend the show up through the wedding with the caveat that everything after doesn‚Äôt handle the antagonists well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Someone Has to Die,While it may not have been as satisfying for you you have to admit that Steven forgiving and rehabilitating the diamonds is 100% on brand for him.
Someone Has to Die,"The show had just reached its half-way point when it was cancelled following the wedding episode, everything else was concessions Sugar was able to get from Cartoon Network to wrap up loose ends.  They had no choice but to wrap it up fast :(

As for the anti Rose agenda, something they never got the chance to explore was how Steven had been learning about his mom's life in reverse, from how she was right before he was born to the spoiled monster she was when she was very young.  She had a fantastic character arc, just told in reverse.  I think there would have been an episode about realizing and grappling with this.  His mom was a wonderful person deep down, she just had to break from her toxic childhood household to become that.

Im super happy to see that the show has touched so many people, even when they didnt super enjoy the post-cancel stuff"
Someone Has to Die,"Yeah, I think when you include the movie and Future the show ends up having pretty great pacing.  Starts slow, builds in bursts of  expanded lore mixed with periods of downtime, suddenly you are going through a resolution you didn't expect, but then there's time to grow into it and move on."
Someone Has to Die,"I just found it this year, is there any other shows you‚Äôd recommend?"
Someone Has to Die,"I can't get over that the show's premise hinges on the fact that essentially a woman committed suicide in order to have a baby so the love of her life could be a single father, rather than just not doing that so they could live together as a couple. 

Like... does it make more sense in the show?"
Someone Has to Die,"I'm not sure about ""developed feelings for her"" is right. Because one of the problems of the show is that Pearl was specifically designed to obey her superior. In this case, Pearl was always supposed to be kinda obssesed with RQ/PD. By default, she was always gonna be by Rose's side no matter what. I think this is why some fans were upset by the big reveal."
Someone Has to Die,"So she‚Äôs Snape 2.0?

I feel like I‚Äôm right but Steven Universe Stan‚Äôs can‚Äôt take the comparison, oh noooo it wasn‚Äôt a totally original idea"
Someone Has to Die,Oh shit I had it right. That is a pretty complicated character for 2010 cartoon.
Someone Has to Die,Snape vibes.
Someone Has to Die,"I think the ending was fitting, but the way it was done in the ""shippuden"" was not great, also the villain of the movie was kinda reviving a plot that was already finished, which seemed like a ""do it for money"" type of movie."
Someone Has to Die,"I'm not sure if there would've been that episode or not, but I did notice the reason Steven and so many fans who eat up anything vilifying Rose is because her story was told backwards. But Greg nailed it when he said at some point, I forget when exactly in the story, that who she was then doesn't matter, it's who she was when they met that counted. I feel like more characters, including Steven and including Sapphire when she and Ruby split apart, should've taken that to heart more quickly.

But I'm not judging by the show by what they should've done or perhaps would've done, it's just I hate where they leave us with Rose. Big swatches of the early emotional thrusts in the series mean less when that person is depicted as being as bad as they would later treat her. Your last bit is spot on though, for my gripes and for how imperfect I feel the show is as a whole, it does mean a lot to me."
Someone Has to Die,"She-Ra definitely (Reboot), and Infinity Train. :)"
Someone Has to Die,"I second Reboot She-Ra.

Also the Owl House and Gravity Falls.  All 3 of these has some similar emotionally heavy themes as Steven Universe,  especially Owl House. These are shoes that both adults and kids love and get different things out of. 

Also another surprisingly emotionally mature cartoon is Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel on YouTube. The are adults only due to themes and language but are surprisingly emotionally mature in ways that adult shows like Family Guy are not."
Someone Has to Die,"BoJack Horseman.  Adventure Time. 

And Yes! Love for Infinity Train!!"
Someone Has to Die,"It does with...later revelations.

>!Rose Quartz wasn't actually who she said she was. She was actually Pink Diamond and was tasked with colonizing the earth for Gem kind...by wiping out all organic life. She refused and created an alter ego (Rose) to lead a rebellion (the Crystal Gems) against...well, against herself. She was playing both sides. Eventually she faked her death by making it look like Rose killed Pink. She figured the other Diamonds wouldn't care, and she could now live in peace on earth as Rose Quartz!<

>!Bad news. The other Diamonds *did* care. They launched an attack on earth that drove 99% of the Crystal Gems mad, turning them into mindless monsters. Only Rose and a couple others survived. For thousands of years they've been fighting these monsters, their own fallen comrades, to protect earth. And ""Rose"" knows that she's responsible for all of it. Giving up her life to create someone new, someone who can live free on earth as she wanted to, but without the centuries of guilt and trauma, is her way of finally achieving peace!<

Yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff for a kids show."
Someone Has to Die,"Rose's feelings for Greg are questionable. She doesn't ever really understand human love.  Her love for Greg at least on screen is more of a fascination, like an alien studying what humans are like. She is an alien after all. 

She falls in love with Earth and the human race's ability to grow and change, since gems are born for a single purpose and are not meant to change. A human being growing and changing is the greatest thing she had ever seen, and that's what she wanted to experience and give to Greg and Steven."
Someone Has to Die,Yea I mean. I think rose knew that her cause was best represented and achieved by a half human half gem who is raised surrounded by love. She believed he could do what she couldn‚Äôt.
Someone Has to Die,"Just saying, some women go through delicate pregnancies, so this situation is very real, idk why you would think it's nonsensical."
Someone Has to Die,Except Pearl tale care of steven after the death of Rose
Someone Has to Die,"She was also created to be a slave and given to Rose (a member of the monarchy) who started encouraging her to have her own thoughts and feelings and talking to her like a friend... but still very much treated Pearl like her sidekick and assumed Pearl would do what she said. Most prominently and horribly when she made Pearl participate in faking Rose's murder, and gave a magically compelling order for it to be kept secret which was still in effect thousands of years later, even after Rose's death - like, we eventually see Pearl trying to break the order and tell Steven what happened, and she's repeatedly forced to shut herself up. It's kind of disturbing.

Pearl's love for Rose was all mixed up with the servant role she was created to play, and as much as she missed and grieved Rose, I also don't think their relationship was healthy and equal, or that she really got to be her own independant person until after Rose died."
Someone Has to Die,"Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children, and convincing Steven she hates him."
Someone Has to Die,"Damn, that's some real heavy shit right there."
Someone Has to Die,Holy fuck that‚Äôs indeed a show worthy of the praise it gets then. I always thought it was one of those things the internet gets insanely attached to for no apparent reason but that summary changed my mind.
Someone Has to Die,The sucky thing is Steven ended up inheriting all those problems.
Someone Has to Die,"I've seen enough anime to know this is not the most traumatic thing shown to kids through animation by a long shot 

But that's an interesting plot"
Someone Has to Die,Didn't Snape do the same of Harry after Lily's death?
Someone Has to Die,Sweet Jebus.
Someone Has to Die,">Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children

Not intentionally, hard to argue her training of Connie didn't at least border on abuse"
Someone Has to Die,"""Dang Steven, when did you get so mature?""

""Right around the time I learned my mom was a war criminal."""
Someone Has to Die,To be fair its not a perfect show. Pacing is off and too many deux ex machinas. But the plot and world building is fascinating.
Someone Has to Die,"The show really throws out conventional storytelling structure for a kids fantasy show (the central mystery of the show revolves around a deceased character who we only ever learn about from the incomplete pov of other characters revealed and foreshadowed across five seasons, and that‚Äôs just one story thread) and I think it mostly but not entirely succeeds."
Someone Has to Die,One thing I really appreciate is they don't shy away from how awful Rose often was. But it's not like you find out she was secretly a villain or something. She's just a very complex sometimes very selfish person.
Someone Has to Die,Generational trauma is a bitch.
Someone Has to Die,"Taking care as in building a house,living with and raising Steven."
Someone Has to Die,"No, she actually becomes one of his primary caretakers, the episode this song is from is also all about her bonding over shared grief with Greg, Steven's father who rose ""left"" Pearl for"
Someone Has to Die,Isn't this literally dialogue from the show?
Someone Has to Die,"It definitely isn't a perfect show, but also to be fair CN didn't exactly make it easy for them to manage their pacing"
Someone Has to Die,"Rose isn‚Äôt awful, she was a messed up child who rebelled and ran away from her family as a teenager and grew up to be a loving but flawed and regretful adult. She just lived in a society with no concept of childhood or growing up. Actually, now that I think about it, Greg had a pretty similar relationship with his parents (overbearing, ran away, estranged), just without the cosmic consequences, but it makes it more obvious why they made sense together."
Someone Has to Die,"Yes, hence the quotes."
Grand Army,"legitimately one of the best shows Netflix has made. Cast/writing is top notch. The story is definitely interesting as well, and the way it's shot is so damn good. 

It is way better than all these coming of age dramas out there right now. 

Only issue was a couple storylines in the show seemed irrelevant, but they all fit in well for the most part. 

Really hope there's a season 2"
Grand Army,This show actually surprised very well written amazing cast and great story overall kudos netflix
Grand Army,"I'm liking it so far a lot more than I expected. 

I honestly don't think a season 2 is in the cards though, the show came out over a week ago and it's barely gotten any buzz or talk at all, much bigger Netflix shows have gotten cancelled after their first season so I don't think it's looking good for this."
Grand Army,"I agree Joey was literally throwing herself at them and fucking around with the dildo making everything so sexual. My only thing is I don‚Äôt know why she said Tim raped her if he just didn‚Äôt do anything because I‚Äôm her own words she literally said,‚ÄùI can do this if I want with him and whoever.‚Äù So I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs getting arrested ? & she‚Äôs annoying as fuck because after they raped her she continued to hang out with them like wtf??? I also feel like it would‚Äôve been more powerful if they used a woman of color I‚Äôm sick of seeing white feminism on tv. They also focused on her story way more than the others and I think the other storylines were way more interesting."
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,"I think it‚Äôs up there with Euphoria when it comes to teen dramas, this is how a teen drama should be written. All the characters seem genuine, real and it hits on a lot of social issues teens/young adults face in the American lifestyle. It‚Äôs a bit preachy but with great intentions. Not sure it‚Äôll get renewed as I‚Äôve seen little noise but I got hooked on episode one and the storyline kept getting more interesting with each episode."
Grand Army,"Can you help me understand the significance of the email/ the bomb threat sent by Leila Kwan ... it felt like it was being escalated really hard with the writing of the email being the opening and closing of every episode only for it to be literally the most irrelevant thing in the entire series come the end of it.

The final scene was truly beautifully shot and the perfect closing imo... for a Netflix series top notch, but as you said a lot of irrelevant plotlines where I felt like I just wanted to skip them"
Grand Army,It made the top 10 list..I need a season 2 tbh üòî
Grand Army,"I was actually annoyed by Joey going on and on about how ‚Äúi can do this with him and whoever i want‚Äù for so long, but she‚Äôs right she can. she can do what she wants. but the very second she says ‚Äúwait im not ready‚Äù then it‚Äôs no longer consensual. I don‚Äôt care how sexual she was or how much she was ‚Äúliterally throwing herself at her them.‚Äù she withdrew consent and they continued so it‚Äôs rape."
Grand Army,I agree with some things u said but there is a lot of people of color activism and it‚Äôs kinda racist you think every important character have to be a person of color get over yourselves
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,"honestly Euphoria as much as I liked it was mainly aesthetic, and almost unrealistic. This show seemed much more grounded"
Grand Army,Yea reminded me a lot of Euphoria as well.
Grand Army,"I have a huge issue with most season finales especially Netflix shows. This was done extremely well. It provided a huge monumental moment for Joey, and Dom, while also keep us on the edge for what could happen with Jaysons storyline. 

That last shot brought me to tears. These actors are phenomenal."
Grand Army,"I think the significance of the Bomb threat in season one is to show Leila feeling like she's taking control, and to juxtapose the consequences she faces (none) against the other situations like with Owen and the wallet, or Joey's sexual assault.

Over all, I think it is something that would be explored more in season 2."
Grand Army,yea that was one of the storylines that was irrelevant to the plot. Her character overall was strange and wasn't used effectively at all.
Grand Army,I think they had to cut the show a few episodes short due to COVID19
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,"Euphoria is not unrealistic at all, growing up in FL lots of what happens in Euphoria is definitely plausible. The aesthetic was amazing but to say it was unrealistic is a stretch and a half."
Grand Army,"It‚Äôs a callback for S2. In the scene where Leila is coming back to school after the threat, you can hear someone mention that there‚Äôs a 5 year sentence for the person who did it if they were caught. 

I‚Äôm guessing that S2 is gonna probably involve a storyline where she may or may not get caught."
Grand Army,"I don't think it was irrelevant. It was to juxtapose against other incidents and the consequences characters face for them.

It also helped aid in Leila's characterization by showing her additional irrational bland criminal behavior."
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,The struggles are real but idk parts of it like including a 10 year old drug dealer with no explanation??

Grand Army,[deleted]
Grand Army,Never heard of it
Grand Army,"I'm sad about this one. This show felt real without being so stylistic. They did have behind the scenes ""drama"" though, so I saw this coming."
Grand Army,"a pity it was cancelled, it was very good but I was waiting, the buzz of this series was very low."
Grand Army,"My boss‚Äô daughter was in this.  Pretty sure she was new to acting‚Ä¶ well at least tv/movies.  Did hope it got another season just because it was cool to know someone living their dream in some way.

Overall it was better than I expected.  I actually thought it may have already been cancelled.  Feels like it has been forever since he told me she was in it."
Grand Army,"This show had potential. The first three episodes had me hooked, the remaining episodes were sad. 

This show didn‚Äôt receive the proper promotional efforts it should‚Äôve received to get it off the ground. The trailer for the show doesn‚Äôt do it justice imo. I had just watched this about a month ago out of curiosity not knowing it had been on Netflix for a little while now. 

I read there were issues with staff behind the scenes which wasn‚Äôt great either."
Grand Army,"First time I hear about this but oh well, i wont watch it since it probably didnt have a proper ending anyway"
Grand Army,Yet another piece written by a woman failing due to a sexist and low browed audience.
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,"Watched it. There's some great shots but that's it. The quote they added at the end sums it up. 

 Really similar to Kim's convenience in terms of how the behind the scenes reflected on the content on screen."
Grand Army,üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Grand Army,"Again and again many potential shows get cancelled but shitty show like never have i never still go on.

Grand army have euphoria vibe, and shot is really beautiful too. I give my heart to this show to get s2üòî"
Grand Army,Me either. Guess that's why it was cancelled.
Grand Army,Probably because they all froze to death following the emperor into Russia...
Grand Army,Same here. Expected but a pity. I considered it the good US Skins we didn‚Äôt get with the original adaptation.
Grand Army,Would it be indiscreet to ask which character did she play?
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,"I‚Äôm a guy and loved the show, I personally love shut like this"
Grand Army,"I know I hate how Netflix is literally the only streaming service to cancel shows! Why can't they be like FOX, they've never cancelled a show before and always give there shows AT LEAST 10 seasons and a movie. It's sad üò≠."
Grand Army,Their library is a graveyard. Why would anyone invest in one of their shows?
Grand Army,What happen in bts of these two show..?
Grand Army,"To ask, which quote do you mean? I tried looking for it and couldn't find a closing quote"
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,You know it's weird because with a lot of shows that get low viewership's and get cancelled people chalk up to them not getting marketed enough which reminds me a while ago Netflix wanted to try a way of advertising their shows and movies by having them play trailers of other Netflix shows before movies or tv shows you watch like how HBONow/Max does. You could even skip them too if you wanted but then people bitched about that when they heard they were trying to do that so they backtracked on it  and now so many of their shows whether they be good or bad still suffer from the lack of marketing.
Grand Army,"He isn‚Äôt my boss anymore.  We have both moved on, so probably not a big deal.

She played Leila on the show."
Grand Army,which character/story?
Grand Army,Netflix are fucking amateurs tbh. Never even cancelled a show before airing a full season.
Grand Army,"What is this magical alternate universe where Fox never cancels a show? :p

Netflix cancels more because instead of ordering a pilot, they order a full first season instead. When they don't perform how they want or are too expensive to produce, Netflix cancels it."
Grand Army,"Why do people still watch Freaks and Geeks, Firefly, My So Called Life, Pushing Daisies, Party Down, etc, etc, etc.

People (outside of Reddit) don't look at TV shows as ""investments of time"" - if there's one season to enjoy, that's what they get - if there's 6, that's what they get."
Grand Army,"Writers got into a fight, because one of the white writers didn't like that an asian one showed up to the office with an *""unprofessional""* hairstyle or something. 

Everyone was speculating this show would never get a second season due to the writers not liking each other."
Grand Army,"What show you talking about..?
Riverdale..?"
Grand Army,"Well that's certainly a plus, shame it was cancelled then."
Grand Army,"> 30 year olds playing high schoolers who spend 10% of their time in school

I guess if the premise is about school, that would be a valid criticism, but otherwise, why would you focus on them being in school? If you make a show about adults, do you want them always to be at work?"
Grand Army,"Do you want to watch the parts of high schooler stories where they‚Äôre sitting in class?

The target audience of those shows are people who are in class most of *their* days. The idea is to present stories and adventures as their between class escapism.

It‚Äôs cool to be into the stuff your not the target audience for, but you should try to understand when you‚Äôre preferences aren‚Äôt going to fit the goals of the creators or the audience they‚Äôre making the show for."
Grand Army,Yeah that's an issue. Really Netflix needs to expand to marketing on other platforms and venues like other shows do.
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,*WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH*
Grand Army,So that things happen in these two show..?
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,"haha i actually have seen the show, it's just been a while. i agree, that storyline was...a fucking lot"
Grand Army,im 2 months late but man leila's story line was very difficult to watch. i was so confused to the point where I had to just skip her zombie sex erotica scenes because they weren't adding anything past...weird? the other stories were pretty good i thought
Grand Army,"Add on to what the last person said, the white writer was actually the creator of the show and total of four poc writers left due to ""racist exploitation and abuse"".

The show is loosely adapted from creator's play and they added four new, non-white characters to make it more diverse. However, it's pretty obvious that these four storylines are not authentic and generic (what the article review said) due to the lack of diverse voices behind the screens (re: writer situation). 

Regarding Kim's convenience, I suggest you go directly towards the source and check out what Simu Liu and Jean Yoon (both main cast members) have said. 

basically: both shows pride themselves on their diversity on screen but is a fucking mess behind the scenes."
Grand Army,"Eh, Euphoria and Riverdale wouldn‚Äôt be put on the same category. Grand Army was very similar to Euphoria IMO but it had a ton of production issues, think that‚Äôs why it got cancelled and why it got little to no promotion.

Shame cause it was really good."
Grand Army,"A bit off topic here (and a bit late) but do you have any other recommendations? I would put Gilmore Girls in there as well, btw. Rory's progress through the years was very good teen drama. Already watched that and Skins and Freaks & Geeks. Couldn't really stand Euphoria. Even watched Elite, the Spanish show which is pretty good. And Grand Army could have been the next thing but here we are.

I'm currently watching an Australian show called Heartbreak High which I heard good things of. So, any other suggestions, of any language would be great!"
Grand Army,[deleted]
Grand Army,[removed]
Grand Army,How has no one mentioned 90210 yet?
Grand Army,"Not sure how you came to that conclusion. I encourage you to be more openminded and learn about this topic. But no, diversity is not ruining shows. It's how the crew/behind the scenes have handle diversity.  The non-white cast of these shows gave performances just like any other show out there. The problem are the stories being put out because most of the writers are non-white and they have no experience on the topics they're writing about.

Grand army had problems where their (non-white) writers are being treated horribly, and Kim's convenience only have one korean writer while being a show about a korean family.   
 

This problem doesn't just apply to diversity, it applies to pretty much everything in writing. Actually living through something and writing about it is always going to be more authentic and real then research. 

I don't want to make a long  comment. I've told you that Simu Liu and Jean Yoon, cast member of kim's, have gave their thoughts on problems within the show. That's the source. 

In conclusion, these two shows' problem comes from being  exploitative of poc-releated stories because despite diversity on screen, the majority of their writers/crew are white who doesn't have any respect to the stories they're telling behind the scenes."
Grand Army,"Ah well. Yea OC was good for that first season,  OTH was sort of good at the beginning and pretty good s4,s5 . I had the right idea to look for shows in other languages then I guess."
Grand Army,"Not to me, haha but I'll put that on my list. I finally caught up to FNL btw which I confused for the movie and thought I had watched it."
Grand Army,"Its insane to me that in a situation where the original work has been changed arbitrarily to include 4 more poc when they, as you said, don‚Äôt fit the story, that the problem with the show is not enough poc writers and not the fact that they forced 4 new characters into something making it not work.

Like the issue here is forcing poc stories into show for the sake of diversity, not white writers aren‚Äôt good enough.

Pretty insulting to white writers don‚Äôt you think."
Grand Army,"Everyone thinks every show on Netflix has so much fucking potential lol, if it did it probably wouldn't have been canceled because clearly it wasn't performing well enough. 

Stranger things is one of their, if not their biggest show. I'm not even that big of a fan of it, but it's pretty clear why they prefer keeping a show that big and not a show I have not even heard of. Netflix is a business, they aren't going to keep putting things out that aren't going to perform well enough."
Grand Army,I've literally never heard of this show before today.
Grand Army,No need to trash other shows because your show got cancelled.
Grand Army,It wasn't a good show IMO
Grand Army,Chill.
Grand Army,Sounds like you need to invest less emotionally into these shows.
Grand Army,"If anything, a show they need to revive after being cancelled by Syfy is Wynonna Earp."
Grand Army,Thats reality. Shows that lose money dont get to keep losing money. And eventually Witcher will end too.
Grand Army,"The show got cancelled because it was trash. Like cool, they bring up some really woke topics, but don't add anything new to the conversations, and do a bad job at developing their point. 

I mean how da fuq do you start with a terrorist bombing in new york, and then just end that conversation then and there in that episode, with the kids being more concerned about a party than the fucking terrorist attack or their missing friend. and the show just kept making so many questionable choices that i couldn't even finish the taxi scene in episode 3"
Grand Army,"Idk why the canceled grand army but the canceled the society because of covid and budget. FYI this show was planned for a second season and renewed but Netflix dropped it.

Yeah."
Grand Army,"That‚Äôs cool. I didn‚Äôt hear about Grand Army till it was trending on Twitter. I didn‚Äôt actually start watching it until recently tbh. 

The society however is just all around great and I recommend it."
Grand Army,I don‚Äôt think I was trashing strangers things. It‚Äôs a good show but honestly I just felt like it could‚Äôve ended at the first season or the second season the third wasn‚Äôt that great for me personally.
Grand Army,I said the show had potential. Honestly want to see the second season for just one character.
Grand Army,üòÇüòÖ
Grand Army,Idk if you seen society but if you have might understand why I‚Äôm upset it got canceled.
Grand Army,Right it was pretty crazy. Have you seen the other shows I mentioned?
Grand Army,">  the canceled the society because of covid and budget.

Right. Adding 30% or more to a shows budget changed its feasibility. That sucks for the people involved, and i know people who lost jobs over this stuff, but it makes sense."
Grand Army,If it ended after the first season then there would be a hundred posts talking about the potential lost when Netflix cancelled it lol
Grand Army,"Which character was that?

I legit forgot about them all..

It did have potential I agree but the storylines I remember were not very well written."
Grand Army,I haven't and I doubt it would.

Dream Home Makeover,"A family near where I lived got their house redid on the show- we even drove through while it was being built. It was in the newspaper a bit after that episode, but the family ended up selling the home. Their bills tripled, because Ty and his team had turned their tiny 1100 square foot home into a massive McMansion, so heating, electric- all of that was ridiculous to pay for. Their property taxes went up like crazy since I live in an area with pretty high property tax. IIRC they ended up selling the house and moving into another house about the same size as their old house. They got remodeled because the daughter was in a wheelchair and needed wider space to access the kitchen, bathroom, etc. It couldn‚Äôt even fit through doors without someone pulling it through."
Dream Home Makeover,"Not a deep dark secret, but dear god the decorating choices are insane. The idea that a child should get a room completely devoted to their current interests is just terrible (unless they want to live in like a Minions themed mini hell for the foreseeable future)."

Dream Home Makeover,"The corner cutting construction stuff they did always made me uncomfortable, stuff that looked dangerous."
Dream Home Makeover,I thought it was a pretty realistic depiction in the episode ‚Äúthe gang gets extreme:home makeover edition‚Äù. The family they ‚Äúhelped‚Äù ended up with a huge house and couldn‚Äôt afford the taxes.
Dream Home Makeover,"It's no secret that chronic medical conditions in the US are very expensive.  These homes usually get sold because the ""winners"" can not afford the bills, taxes, maintenance, etc."

Dream Home Makeover,"Yeah I figure these people are getting houses worth 3 to 4x as much as they could normally afford and then get hit with a $10k tax bill and go ""uhh..ok?"""
Dream Home Makeover,The tax thing didn‚Äôt come up until several seasons later in the episode where Dee is looking for Barbara‚Äôs money.
Dream Home Makeover,"For Pimp My Ride they actually charged everyone who got their car 'pimped out' for everything they did. Yea a lot of people lost their car. 

Same with that ""*you get a car*"" episode of Oprah. They *did* get a car, but only if they could pay the sales tax or whatever tax for the car then and there."
Dream Home Makeover,"How did you post after a year?

Dream Home Makeover,"4 seasons later, I had to look it up.  But my point still stands. And we don‚Äôt know how long they had the house. We just see him doing the yard work."
Dream Home Makeover,"It‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt the Sales Tax- GM covered that cost. It was a Prize Tax that the Federal Gov‚Äôt required- similar to winning the lottery- they had to pay about $7000 in taxes on each car. Even worse, Oprah had stacked the audience with people in need of new cars, so not a lot of people had money in the audience, so many people couldn‚Äôt afford it. I believe it was an honest mistake, because in the future doing promotions like this, they just handed out checks for the price of the car rather than the car itself."
Dream Home Makeover,"If they couldn't pay the tax on the car they were allowed to take the cash value of the car instead.

Also ""then and there,"" is complete nonsense lol. Oprah's powerful but she's not the IRS. She doesn't collect the tax at all, let alone ""then and there."""
Dream Home Makeover,"Just a small caveat, there isn't a separate prize tax imposed by the federal government, it's just regular income tax. Those recipients on Oprah's show would have also owed income tax to the State of California (where Oprah films) for the state income tax due as well.

It's the same as if you won it big on a scratch off, the mega millions, won a prize on Jeopardy or won on the slots at a casino. The recipients received something of value and thus owe income tax on it."
Dream Home Makeover,But did they on that episode? I mean they obviously knew about the taxes each person would have to pay. I think it was Oprah just gaining a bigger following because 'she gave out cars' and with the money she could have paid off the cars to give to them
Dream Home Makeover,So sell the cars and profit
Dream Home Makeover,"Oprah filmed at Harpo Studios in Chicago, meaning they would have to pay Illinois income tax on their prize/gift."
Dream Home Makeover,They didn‚Äôt give out money that episode- GM had just had lined up a bunch of cars and their intention was to have everyone drive away in the car after signing paperwork. They definitely learned their lesson the first time around. Oprah says that she regrets overlooking that detail and feels responsible for screwing over a lot of audience members that episode
Dream Home Makeover,"


>If you mean the people who couldn't afford them, then no. They had to be able to write a check right then and there for thousands of dollars. Unless I misunderstood you.

- u/maplebaconchicken (for some reason I can't reply to your comment)

Huh? Why would they need to write a check then and there? They should only be liable for the tax on the cars after lodging that year's tax return. And even then you don't have to pay your tax obligation immediately. They'd have plenty of time to sell the car for it's fair market value and get the cash to pay their taxes, then yay free money.

The show also offered cash alternatives for those that didn't want the car (even if it was less than car value minus tax it's still free money).

Do you not know how taxes work? Or are you just making crap up for upvotes?"
Dream Home Makeover,"Gotcha. I assumed CA because most shows are filmed there. It's interesting that you use the word gift, that's actually a separate classification for tax purposes. For tax purposes, only individuals can give gifts (corporations cannot give gifts).

Any person is able to gift up to $15,000 to another person in a single year and not have to report anything to the IRS. Once the gifts total more than $15,000 then a separate gift tax return is due to the IRS (not covered by the annual income tax return). 

Any gift tax due is paid by the person giving the gift, not the person receiving it."

Dream Home Makeover,"Charlie's emotional breakdown in The Gang Carries a Corpse Up a Mountain hit harder for me for a few reasons.  Charlie has for the most part been the most positive of the gang despite constantly getting shit on by them (while still being for the most part an asshole).  He craved Frank's attention when he though he might be his father, going back to like season 3, something Frank originally didn't really want.  He's had a difficult life, he lives in squalor, and his only real goal in the show was obtaining an unobtainable love interest, who didn't fill the hole in his heart once they started dating. He had an odd childhood with a loving but fairly absent minded mother, numerous hints that he was molested as a kid, etc. >!He finally finds his father and goes 100% in on building that relationship.  One of his friends gives him COVID and kills him.  His friends help him carry the body up the mountain but one by one they leave him except Frank who Charlie tells to leave anyway. Then  after an episode of building up Charlie trying to bury his feelings, he finally breaks down after 15 seasons and most of his life never going his way. !< And I thought Charlie Day sold the fuck out of it.

Dream Home Makeover,"They discussed it on their podcast. I believe it was this scene that Ryan Reynolds saw then contacted Rob and that was how they became friends.

Dream Home Makeover,"Laughs are cheap, I‚Äôm going for gasps."
Dream Home Makeover,I thought this was gonna be a post about the dance off with Dennis lol
Dream Home Makeover,"I think he's said that he spent over a year getting in shape and training for this one scene.

Between the weight gain, the weight loss and this, the amount of stress that Rob McElhenney has put on his body in the name of that show is beyond unreal. The discipline the man has is inspirational."
Dream Home Makeover,I prefer the dance they do it at their high school reunion
Dream Home Makeover,"I always feel like the most emotionally affecting moments are not in dramas, but in comedies, because the laughs let your guard down and leave you vulnerable enough to hit you hard when it gets sincere. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve cried more at like, the Office, than any dramatic program I‚Äôve seen.

Sunny has very very few sincere moments, so seeing one like that, while definitely out of left field, still works so well because at the end of the day we‚Äôve stuck with these characters so long and have love for them regardless of how vile they are."
Dream Home Makeover,Oh my god... I get it
Dream Home Makeover,I was so impressed to find out that Rob had no previous dance background and learned everything you see in that dance in a year - That is incredibly **hard** and Kylie Shea (his ballerina partner) had to put 100% trust in him since lifts and catches can go terribly wrong with even the most trained male dancers.  Shout out to the Alison Faulk and Leo Moctezuma the choreographers as well.
Dream Home Makeover,Is there a clip online where I can see this dance scene?
Dream Home Makeover,"I loved the part where he spins around and pretends to blow Dennis. Ah wait, wrong dance."
Dream Home Makeover,"https://youtu.be/pSiCn0KKZIg

Here‚Äôs the link in case anyone wants to watch it. Truly a beautiful performance."
Dream Home Makeover,"Looking back I think its far less out of place than people think.  Along with Charlies breakdown after his real dad dies.

They STARTED the show with these horrible people who you wouldnt mind seeing fail and have bad things happen to them. They were just supposed to be sociopathic and unlikable.  

But then they started with Charlies illiteracy and being molested, his mom being a prostitute, and him not having a dad.  Macs obviously criminal parents and his supremely toxic dad and religion.  And then you bring in Dennis/Dees dad and mom and how their mom was this cold woman and Frank being, well, Frank.  And Dees is truly tragic once you realize she was a fun, soon to be successful ""Sweet Dee"" prior to what was a brain injury.  

You start to realize these people were doomed by their horrible families (and the skating injury with Dee) and what was just a dark comedy slowly becomes a tragedy."
Dream Home Makeover,Out of left field
Dream Home Makeover,It felt out of place for a show about shitty people being shitty
Dream Home Makeover,The Grilled Charlie is a good analogy for the show. Weirdly layered in a way that shouldn‚Äôt work but does.
Dream Home Makeover,I thought you were talking about the dance in ‚ÄúThe gang dances their asses off‚Äù and was very confused for a sec.
Dream Home Makeover,"Going to possibly step in a pile of shit here...

First off, love Sunny. Probably my favorite show ever. Huge love and respect for Rob, Glenn, Charlie and all the rest.

I hated it. 

It was so profoundly unearned from a character and show perspective. Mac has never once demonstrated the emotional intelligence about his sexuality to put something like that together. He was willing to either come out or stay in the closet depending on whether he was awarded a scratch off ticket. The same character willing to cheapen his sexuality like that can also put together a performance that mines the depths of his soul? Eh.

Also, the show never treated his homosexuality with dignity. It was always a punchline. Which is fine! That's the show. But you can't make gay jokes about Mac for numerous seasons and then come back trying to appear extremely enlightened just because Rob trained a lot. 

Not taking anything away from the physical performance, it was great. Had that just been a thing that Rob had released on YouTube or something, I'd be blown away. But trying to tack it onto a show that has never once taken itself seriously felt wrong.

Please be kind to me."
Dream Home Makeover,"It‚Äôs very well choreographed but for her personally Charlie finale of s15 breakdown was way more emotional and impactful for me.

But dear God I love this fucking show"
Dream Home Makeover,"Based on every other episode of the show up to that point, I was just going along with the scene waiting for the joke to come. 

It actually felt insincere to the show to have a scene that sincere. I get what Rob wanted to do, but Sunny simply wasn't the place for it. It was completely unearned. Maybe it's better on repeat viewings, but at the time I hated it."
Dream Home Makeover,"For me, it‚Äôs that when Mac describes it to Frank, it‚Äôs so INCREDIBLY absurd, it sounds perfectly like classic Sunny.

And it is, but the flavor is different. It is EXACTLY what Mac said it was, but the fact that it‚Äôs so beautiful and raw, the thing that something so Sunny can be so deep and real and true is what caught me totally off guard.

I wondered why it hit me soooooo deeply. And then I few years later I came to terms with me being trans, and understood why it hit me so hard."
Dream Home Makeover,"I thought it was pretty awful personally. Yes, it‚Äôs an artistic dance, but didn‚Äôt fit the show at all and just seemed like something Rob wanted to do outside the show."
Dream Home Makeover,I just had tears streaming down my face watching. I did not expect it to be anywhere near as emotionally charged and just ‚Ä¶ amazing as it was. And Frank being so moved by it got me too.
Dream Home Makeover,I thought that Ep wasn‚Äôt good *ducks*
When My Love Blooms,5 years between season 2 and 4 will do that.
When My Love Blooms,"They should have just lengthened the timeline of the show, make the time in between seasons be a couple years instead."
When My Love Blooms,Reminds me how the Lost writers shelved their plans for Walt because they hadn't anticipated that 12 year old *Malcom David Kelley would outgrow the show's timeframe of like 100 days for the first four seasons. It's not as if he became a giant either. Even in adulthood he's like five and a half feet tall.
When My Love Blooms,"As punishment for the puberty, he got to keep that same goofy bowl cut hahahaha"
When My Love Blooms,"I mean, who could have known that taking a decade to make five seasons of a show starring 12 year olds could present such logistical problems?"
When My Love Blooms,"The whole puberty thing is why Sadie Sink moved from Broadway to television; in an interview she said that once you turn 13 you get told to come back when you're 18. Too old for the ""child parts"" (she did *Annie*) and too young for the adult ones.

She was 18-19 when filming Season 4 as the 14-year-old Max. She's fortunate/unfortunate that she looks younger than she is. Considering the state her character ended up in, they could easily make her look a bit older."
When My Love Blooms,"Keep talkin, Noah. We‚Äôre never gonna let you fix that haircut.

‚Äîthe Duffers, probably"
When My Love Blooms,They coulda changed his god awful haircut.
When My Love Blooms,"Yeah, no shit.

An 18yr old pretending to look 12 will typically wind up looking 30."
When My Love Blooms,So they hit him back with that haircut??
When My Love Blooms,Neither did Drake
When My Love Blooms,"Either work faster or move the show timeline with the actors ages.

It took the Harry Potter series 10 years to cover 7 school years."
When My Love Blooms,"When you cast people that young, you have to plan your timeline with the fact that they will age. If the show has to take an extended break, you need a matching timeline gap."
When My Love Blooms,That boys haircut bothered me.
When My Love Blooms,"To be honest, even though shows are getting shorter, it feels like they take even longer to produce now than they used to back in the day, when they were much bigger. It‚Äôs an annoying trend."
When My Love Blooms,I remember when the series first premiered and the Duffers played with the idea to have a supernatural/horror anthology with new setting/characters every season but with an overarching theme of ‚ÄúThe 80s‚Äù. I wish they did this
When My Love Blooms,"Obviously they were not committed to their roles. Should‚Äôve hired Christian Bale, he goes to crazy lengths for a role. He would‚Äôve stopped going through puberty in a heartbeat."
When My Love Blooms,They all look fine except Noah looks looks Lloyd from dumb and dumber
When My Love Blooms,"tough shit, that's the gamble you take when you hire child actors."
When My Love Blooms,"It‚Äôs weird because Noah was actually younger than his character to begin with and even in season 4 would have been 15/16 during filming - when his character was 14/15. I‚Äôd imagine the older actors would have had some issues, but it seems odd that he was being asked to slouch etc when he was the accurate one."
When My Love Blooms,"The good news everyone who has a kid, deals with kids or works with kids ""just not loving it"" when the kids hit puberty."
When My Love Blooms,They could have went The Simpsons route and use anti growth hormones.
When My Love Blooms,"I didn‚Äôt really love it either, it became a little awkward. That being said it‚Äôs not the actors fault  that this show took so long to produce. The writers should have had a time jump, or the Netflix should have pressured them to produce the show faster. That being said I think a little awkwardness aside it hasn‚Äôt really been a big deal."
When My Love Blooms,"Noah Schnapp was born in 2004 and would have been 11 when they first started filming season 1 of Stranger Things (November, 2015).  He was pretty much guaranteed to hit puberty while filming unless they were only planning on doing a single season..."
When My Love Blooms,Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have took 10 years to make the third and fourth seasons
When My Love Blooms,"They know how time works, right?"
When My Love Blooms,They never watched Harry Potter ?
When My Love Blooms,"Still just not loving that haircut. 

Love the show , holy cow what a great show."
When My Love Blooms,Probably shouldn‚Äôt have waited ten years between the 3rd and 4th seasons. /s
When My Love Blooms,"Uhhhhh that's not really something they can control, duffs"
When My Love Blooms,What the fuck do you expect it takes 3 years for a new season of this show to air.
When My Love Blooms,Drake wasn't too much of a fan either.
When My Love Blooms,"To be fair, have you been in a room with a teenager hitting puberty? Yeah, it stinks real bad."
When My Love Blooms,Noah Schnapp looked rough in this latest season. They did him up like he was 13 and the dude looked like a creepy 28.
When My Love Blooms,It is Evan Hansen weird how they keep trying to make them look younger
When My Love Blooms,"It was a great gig for the bowl they used to cut his hair, though."
When My Love Blooms,"In Riverdale years, they're still 10 years too young to even go to highschool yet."
When My Love Blooms,Would anyone really care if the characters ages weren't synced with real-time? Like they could have progressed time 1 year per season but presented the characters as 2 or 3 years older.
When My Love Blooms,Well if they didn‚Äôt  take 3 years to put out each season ..there kids ..it happens o swear Hollywood is the weirdest fucking place on the planet way too obsessed with children
When My Love Blooms,Then don‚Äôt take years to make 1 season?
When My Love Blooms,Maybe if they didn‚Äôt take ten damn years between seasons this wouldn‚Äôt have happened
When My Love Blooms,"He was such a bad, useless, and creepy character that last season"
When My Love Blooms,I still dont get why it was an issue. Would the story not work if you just had a bigger time jump that fits with the time of the real world. Theyd just be juniors or seniors instead of freshman. Eddie could still be a multi year senior to give off that mentor vibe to the kids.
When My Love Blooms,He is a grown-ass man with a 1970‚Äôs little kid haircut and it‚Äôs the most disconcerting thing I‚Äôve seen on television in a long time.
When My Love Blooms,"As a fan I never harbor any sort of 'sucks that the little kid grew up' feelings. 

Shit happened to me, too. Just stick with your craft and before you know it you won't be 13 anymore."
When My Love Blooms,I feel like the time between the seasons didn't matter. They easily could have had the characters grow with the actors and it wouldn't have changed anything. Them being freshman or seniors in high-school wouldn't have changed much other than writing a way to bring the older kids back in to the plot from college.
When My Love Blooms,"Oh man, what a concept, people age‚Ä¶ I wonder if they could have accounted for that in the story?"
When My Love Blooms,"The story is in no way tied to a specific year, just make the gaps longer and have the characters the same age...

I get that people love the 80s again and you want to stick with that, but it's the show that made that happen, not the other way around.

Tell a good story in the 90s and people will watch and love the 90s too."
When My Love Blooms,Am I mistaken or was there a similar discussion about the Harry Potter cast and how they were starting to look way older than they should have?
When My Love Blooms,I guess that's why other shows keep casting young looking 22yo actors as high schoolers.
When My Love Blooms,The teen characters are hitting their midlife more like it.
When My Love Blooms,They should have produced faster then
When My Love Blooms,That‚Äôs what happens when you work with child stars and pandemic happens.
When My Love Blooms,"Will‚Äôs haircut made me cringe EVERY TIME I saw it.  It‚Äôs like they were lampshading his age.

Hmmmm, maybe it‚Äôs symbolic that his haircut looked like a lampshade?"
When My Love Blooms,"Maybe the writers should have planned for that possibility‚Ä¶ 

But what do I know"
When My Love Blooms,All I can imagine now is they are going to be pumping child actors with drugs that halt or delay puberty
When My Love Blooms,It‚Äôs like the Harry Potter movies. For a while I thought Daniel Radcliffe might be around 37 by the time the last one of those came out.
When My Love Blooms,When I hit puberty it hit back twice as hard
When My Love Blooms,I just want more 90s shows and movies.
When My Love Blooms,No one to blame but them for taking so long between seasons.
When My Love Blooms,Don't cast prepubescent kids if you're not going to be happy about puberty happening
When My Love Blooms,then write faster bitches.
When My Love Blooms,"How do you not plan for this when casting 12 year olds in a show that‚Äôs going to run for multiple seasons? I get not being able to account for Covid but write around it. 

‚ÄúOh no! Who could have foreseen these teenagers growing rapidly around the ages of 13-19!‚Äù

I remember watching an interview with Joe Keery (Steve) where he was saying that the kids are just his regular coworkers now, Gaten (Dustin) drives him to work sometimes."
When My Love Blooms,So they punished them with those haircuts?  I was alive then. No one looked like that!
When My Love Blooms,What an idiot. Just add a cut scene that says three years later and no one will know the differences
When My Love Blooms,"The fault here is with Netflix and the writers, not with something natural that has been happening since humans existed and therefor something they should have planned for better since it was going to happen lol If Netflix didn't take so long to renew it, and the writers take so long to write it (like, this has been going on for years, why haven't they wrote the whole show yet?) and took so long for production to actually start... if they'd have renewed it for 2-3 seasons at once then they could have written and filmed it closer together to avoid the drastic maturing of the actors. COVID was something they couldn't help, but if they had done everything faster, Hopper probably would've been kidnapped by then and the age could've been explained with a time jump, or if they'd have gotten to the story now, they could have used a time jump to explain the change in between the opening of the gates and all their battling and season 5 is the culmination."
When My Love Blooms,"The show isn't based on any book, and I don't get the obsession with the 80s and how they can't leave it.

Just seems like Netflix saw [Children + 80s nostalgia = Profit] and never want to change it."
When My Love Blooms,The showrunners fuck up big time by no allowing the characters have the same age of their actors.
When My Love Blooms,That haircut is ridiculous
When My Love Blooms,Know what I was ‚Äújust not loving?‚Äù Then getting rid of Eddie after we all became huge fans of his while keeping Johnathan who hasn‚Äôt done anything for 2 seasons.
When My Love Blooms,This kid really likes talking.
When My Love Blooms,Teenagers have aged over the past 6 years: more at 11.
When My Love Blooms,Maybe do a time-jump to the actors‚Äô IRL ages instead of committing to the unconvincing assertion that these people are in their early teens for nostalgia points?
When My Love Blooms,stupid fucking teenagers getting older. Can nobody act anymore‚Ä¶
When My Love Blooms,*directors were 'just not loving it' when he and his costars hit puberty AND LOOKED INCREDIBLY WEIRD. lol You know if they got lucky and the cast still looked right for the roles after aging a little they would have no issue.
When My Love Blooms,Should've thought about shooting it back to back
When My Love Blooms,An absolutely rational gripe to have with child actors! /s
When My Love Blooms,That‚Äôs the thing about kids.   They grow up.
When My Love Blooms,What did they expect though? Can they math? Parently not.
When My Love Blooms,Saw an interview with the main cast and Duffer Brothers around season 1. The Duffer Brothers spoke to the actors (kids at the time) like shit. Can imagine they gave them a hard time for this too.
When My Love Blooms,I mean. Seasons 2 and 4 were 5 years apart. What did they think would happen?
When My Love Blooms,"Director: ‚Äúcould you like, just not please?‚Äù"
When My Love Blooms,"So glad you hit puberty, you‚Äôre getting the mushroom head haircut. You‚Äôre the awkward one now."
When My Love Blooms,"While interesting, so what? They are actors and actresses. So act."
When My Love Blooms,That is something pretty noticeable in the new season. The kids are nearly fully physically mature and being asked to play 2-3 years younger than they are
When My Love Blooms,We‚Äôll some kids do hit puberty much early than others. I was shaving before I got to the 8th grade.
When My Love Blooms,oh Schnapp
When My Love Blooms,"Seriously how old are they even suppose to be by now?

Cause whatever age it is, the actors are not believable as being that young"
When My Love Blooms,What the fuck kind of title is this?
When My Love Blooms,Shouldn't have taken a filming break then. It seems pretty obvious to me that if you're making multiple seasons of a show  with kids and they need to remain certain ages then you film consecutively.
When My Love Blooms,"It always seems to come as a surprise to filmmakers that kids grow up. They literally knew this would happen, but still took _years_ to film season four. I know the pandemic happened, but plenty of things were still filmed during it. It only caused a few months of complete stand-still.

Same thing happened to His Dark Materials. They filmed the first two books back to back, but took _years_ to get to the third book. Especially Dafne Keen is suddenly going to look _way_ too old, for a story that is supposed to be just an immediate continuation. And that is worse, because the entire point of that story is growing up and coming of age.

But still the producers will apparently be surprisedpikachuface.gif when Dafne Keen suddenly looks like an adult woman playing a thirteen year-old."
When My Love Blooms,Shouldve pulled a LOTR after how successful the first season was ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
When My Love Blooms,GET THIS CHILD A NEW HAIRCUT
When My Love Blooms,They were 12 in the first episode. That‚Äôs when puberty happens for most kids.
When My Love Blooms,Then they should have filmed and released a new season every 8-10months instead.  Not 2-3 years like they are doing now
When My Love Blooms,Gotta hate when  time itself doesn't adhere to your plans.
When My Love Blooms,Well‚Ä¶ what the hell did they expect half a decade to do to the cast?
When My Love Blooms,Mike‚Äôs gonna have a beard by the time Season 5 comes out.
When My Love Blooms,Especially when Max is at least 20 lol
When My Love Blooms,Why is his hair cut like that?

72 million people don't. A lot of them do, sure, but not all of them. His support came from a variety of reasons: Party affiliation, single issue voters, money, racism and/or just pure hatred of anything perceived as liberal or progressive. Most of his sound mind supporters won't blatantly admit that they think Trump himself is an idiot/liar even if they think he is one. But they were going to support him anyway because he was being backed by something/everyone else they believe in."

And I thought kneeling - personally, so I don't speak for everybody, I don't speak for every veteran. I've been told that numerous times by many people. But I thought kneeling was more respectful, and I will say that being alongside his teammates was the biggest thing for me.

> And, you know, people - in my opinions and in my experience, kneeling's never been in our history really seen as a disrespectful act. I mean, people kneel when they get knighted. You kneel to propose to your wife, and you take a knee to pray. And soldiers often take a knee in front of a fallen brother's grave to pay respects. So I thought, if anything, besides standing, that was the most respectful. But, of course, that's just my opinion.

Social Distance,"They do it because accusing your opponent when they've got a much lesser puny version of the same scandal you know you're going to be facing soon is an effective tactic to prevent the outrage at one's own scandal from getting traction.  It works like this: People too ill-informed to realize that the accusations are credible in one direction but not credible in the opposite direction will now see the accusation as ""hypocrisy"" when it's leveled against you by the very same people who had to defend against that accusation themselves.  It lets you pretend both sides are equal and therefore nobody has the right to hold you accountable for your scandal.

Take the Hunter Biden example.  It was an accusation of business conflicts of interest that would be bad if they make Biden beholden to Ukraine.  This was chosen specifically because it will look to the uninformed like it's the same thing as Trump's own much bigger compromised position of Putin bankrolling Trump's debt.

Take the various claims about Biden's mental state being affected by age based on the very thin evidence of an occasional stumbling over a word or having a spoken gaffe - again this avenue was chosen specifically because it's a deflection against the much more valid accusations about Trump's mental deterioration.  (Trump may be a narcissist but he's ALSO getting dumber as he ages so this is a severe problem and the only good defense against it the Trump team had was to pretend Biden is just as bad.)"

A wealthy privileged son of a multi millionaire who inherited $400M and lives in a golden penthouse in NYC.

Social Distance,"I forgot where I heard it, but someone recently said that conservatives have been brainwashed into believing they are essentially at war. The word 'war' isn't explicitly used of course but a lot of the same rhetoric during wartime scenarios is spouted off quite frequently. That there are active threats trying to take away the livelihoods of them and their children along with everything they could use to protect themselves. It's no surprise how deranged people act when they're constantly being mislead into thinking satan worshipping socialists are trying to make them destitute and defenseless."
Social Distance,"This is exactly it. Baselessly accuse your opponent of wrongdoing, and because there's no actual wrongdoing to prosecute they ""get away with it"", therefore because they ""got away with it"", you are therefore entitled to *actually* engage in wrongdoing consequence-free, and anyone who complains about it is either a hypocrite or engaging in political retaliation.

So mark my words, expect there to be MASSIVE election fraud on the Republican side next election and them justifying it with ""We're just countering the Dem fraud"" or ""You're just trying to retaliate for us going after your fraud"".

Just like with their racism, their whole strategy is to invent a problem that isn't happening yet, pre-establish a scapegoat as being the ones responsible for it, then cause that problem themselves and make bank while everyone is attacking the scapegoat now that the problem is visible."
Social Distance,"Exactly. It provides them the opportunity to scream, ""BOTH SIDES!""

My father believed that both sides did the illegal stuff that Nixon did, but he just happened to get caught."
Social Distance,"This is completely false.  We found out that Trump has a bank account from the NY Times when they divulged his tax records.  These are the tax records that Trump refused to release.  This is a secret bank account.  He used this secret bank account to pay almost $200k in taxes to the Chinese government while only paying $750 in taxes in the US.

At the very least the POTUS intentionally misled the American people about a politically damaging activity while in office, while railing against the Chinese government.  Since we don't know what the account was entirely for though, we don't know if he was using it for corrupt purposes.  This is the EXACT reason the emoluments clause exists."

Social Distance,"What worship for Obama is there? Did I miss the ""Million Obama March"" or the giant obama flag back when he was in office?"
Social Distance,"Fascists don't suddenly appear out of the blue one day and call for mass genocide. It's a slow system of misinformation, infiltration government agencies and dismantling of democratic systems. By the time anyone ""calls for mass genocide"" it's already far too late to do anything about it. The bar should be much lower to call out dangerous belief systems than ""Well, they're not openly calling for genocide so everything's fine."""
Social Distance,"> I myself am pretty much the exact opposite of a Trump supporter, but you can‚Äôt really call this unedited.

From what? All the well-reasoned, logical, fact-based explanations of how Trump won the election despite getting 30 fewer electoral votes, 6 million fewer actual votes and a whole team of his own lawyers testifying in front of judges that there was no fraud?

It's just that the people who watch this show tend to be the same kind of people who would enjoy it.

Also, most people have no idea what good pacing/writing even is. I think they just see the scene with the fucking babies and think that it's marvelous or artistic, and that's it's deep... that you need maturity to understand this show...

That's poppycock. This show is not mature. This is aimed towards young adults, with the action-packed story, and cheesy romances between the main characters. You want a mature show? Mr. Robot. 10/10 show right there. Good writing. Good directing. Good everything. Just watch it. It's much better than sense8, which was written by people who didn't know what they were doing.

At times I felt like it was a David Cage production with how ridiculous Nomi's story got. And I know trans characters haven't had many huge roles in television or film up until now, but she felt like such a cliche. Especially when she was doing her vlog before the Pride Parade. 

The cop guy had his weird moments as well, and he was the character I had the most interest in apart from the African guy. He rushes into a hospital with a kid bleeding to death and they turn him away? What hospital in America would do that?"
3 Non-Blondes,"This is a love-it or hate-it show.  (Go to Netflix and look at the reviews and marvel at how the vast majority of ratings are either one star or five stars.)

I love it.

It's flawed, it's clumsy, sometimes the show takes inelegant routes to get to moments of spectacular beauty and emotion --and we viewers tend to fall into two categories: those fixated on those moments of spectacular beauty, and those fixated on the clumsiness it takes to get there.

I admire that it is sincere and heartfelt in an age when we expect everything to be cynical and ironic.

I admire its messages about the interconnectedness of humanity in an age when we are disconnected from each other.

I love a lot of small touches that hint at metacontextual meanings that I think are interesting and complex.

There is so much that I admire about this show, that I chewed on it for a good six hours or so before deciding whether I loved it or hated it.  After I had some time to digest what I had seen (to stick with this imperfect metaphor), I found that the clumsiness of its construction and its various flaws had melted away, and what I continued to think about were its messages of hope and humanity and its optimistic outlook about the nature of being alive.

And I realized: yep.  I'm on board.  This is a train I want to ride to the end.  Season Two, please."

The Chicago hospital turning away someone brought to their ER saying 'We've become a better hospital since we stopped taking kids like him' was just over the top ridiculousness.  It's like they want to feel superior in their outrage over non-existant issues.  
I would love to love this show, but I can't take any of it seriously.  The writing is so out of touch.  "
3 Non-Blondes,"I've only watched two episodes and I love it, not a great deal has happened but I dont particularly care. Its very beautifully visually and I love the fact i'm seeing India, London, SF, Korea etc all at once. This show feels like a celebration of humanity, of culture and different places and I really like that. The characters being linked to each other, i'm excited to see where they take that, at the moment its a lot of doubt and disbelief but there is clear potential in a cracker and cop coming together etc.  "
3 Non-Blondes,"I haven't seen the show...been thinking about watching it. 

However, I really did enjoy reading your rant. "
3 Non-Blondes,It isn't perfect but it isn't terrible.  I'm glad I watched it. It is only 12 episodes and you're not spending any money if you already have Netflix. I think it ended better than it started. 
3 Non-Blondes,"**NO SPOILERS BELOW**

I think you're being very dramatic.

The story definitely feels like its walking on a treadmill. It doesn't move much of anywhere very quickly. I also agree with the cringe worthy 4 Non Blondes scene and that the villains are a little uninteresting and dumb.

But I actually think its my second favorite Netflix original (behind HoC of course). 

* The cinematography is **gorgeous**. Absolutely amazing. It might be one of the most well shot television series I've seen in recent history, and its a Netflix Original to boot. While watching it just remind yourself to look at how well its shot and you might start respecting it a bit more, because its easy to forget something as simple as the camera. 

* The characterization behind the heroes is super good (thank JMS). I can't think of another TV series which so quickly made me care about the well being of so many lead roles, and I think its in part because of the fact that the first season is 90% building the world these people live in. 

* The dialog is *fantastic* (again, thanks JMS). There are so many scenes where its just two of the sensates inside each others heads and I love every single one of them because it gives you a glimpse into how much of a coping mechanism this power could be.

I definitely feel a bit of Jupiter Ascending in this where the Wachowski's create the world that is HUGE with deep lore and then they completely miss their story execution because that's not their strong suit. 

But if you ignore the fact that the execution of the story is a bit bad the rest of the series is very good. I'd be very disappointed if it isn't renewed for a second season. "
3 Non-Blondes,">He is given no motivation outside of ""he is an evil scientist who wants to lobotimize the sense8!""

Actually he blurts one line that kinda gives away his motivation. He tells the cop guy ""You are a cop, you swore to protect us. You would not want all of us die.""

Looks like he seriously thinks sensates are an existential threat to humanity, on the level of maybe alien invaders. So it is a war of the worlds. Kill or be killed.
"
3 Non-Blondes,The best description I heard was that it feels like something white baby boomer liberals wrote on their yacht
3 Non-Blondes,"I watched maybe 50% of it, skipped around in most episodes because everyones story seemed long and drawn out.  Possibly if they had cut it down to 6 episodes and had as much going on I would have liked it more.

Honestly it felt like 8 c+ stories tied together with a B+ concept. "
3 Non-Blondes,"Add me to the list of people commenting on this review months after it was written. The show just got renewed for a second season and it's picking up followers mostly by word of mouth so don't be surprised if a few others stumble upon it.

I disagree with OP on pretty much all counts, but that doesn't make OP a bad person. My advice to anyone who stumbles across this review and is on the fence: watch up to episode 3. If you get through episode 3 and you hate it then you've lost three hours of your life. Could be worse right?. If on the other hand you hit the scene involving Capheus, Sun, and Will and you think the story just got pretty cool, then strap yourself in and may Jean Claude watch over you my friend."
3 Non-Blondes,">I swear the only good robot to show up in media recently is the fucking Transformers. 

I'll just point out that the robots in Interstellar were pretty awesome.  They didn't turn evil, they were just helpful little robots."
3 Non-Blondes,"On epsiode 6 now of season 1. Almost ready to quit. Big dissapointment. Non of the characters are likeable except perhaps the mexican actor guy. The story is all over the place, and as you said, some scenes are way too long and boring. Some of those scenes are kinda cool, but just too many."
3 Non-Blondes,"I believe this is an unfair assessment. I admit one of the things I kept saying to my wife was ""Holy crap, I wish they'd get on with the story"". The Wachowskis spent forever exploring the slow, teasing the slow exploration of people experiencing other peoples' experiences, but that's okay. Because we are standing at the dawn of a whole new story-telling experience. Never before has a filmmaker been able to give us 12 hours of content all at once. No theater would run that. No major network would air it. But Netflix has changed the game. Now we can sit and watch as much or as little as we want and that's what this show was made for.   I would never have been patient enough to watch this story unfold week by week. But in chunks of my own choosing?  It was sublime. I was okay with the over the top, ham fisted story style because, well, goddam it, many of these stories are not being told properly. We are at the dawn of a new understanding. A new acceptance. A new awareness of what it can mean to be human. And not everyone is on board and educated yet. Not everyone lives in San Francisco. So it was a little obvious, a little hammer to the head. But goddamitfuck was it good in all the right ways.  A TV show wanted to tell us we're all connected, that every breath we take has been in someone else's lungs, that the actions we take today can hurt someone tomorrow. What kind of monster would reject that message?  
I liked it. And I'm there for season two. "
3 Non-Blondes,"I could not even finish the first episode in one try... It was so bad but I told myself herp derp this can only get better it might require some investing so I tried it again and forced myself to watch the first 3 episodes... Still sucked not going through it again, I'd literally rather watch a compilation of taint shots in pornos than this. "
3 Non-Blondes,"> Can we as a society quit using ""science"" and doctors as the villains of pop Scifi?

Yeah, why is there so much science in science fiction!"
3 Non-Blondes,"I think your TL;DR covers why a lot of people didn't like it, the actors are good yes, the visuals are good yes, but if I wanted that I'd go out and look at the REAL world.

On the individual storylines I agree with you on capheus though I liked wolfgang's story just as much, something actually happened, the characters were in some kind of danger.

There were a few funny moments (like lito getting menstraution and wolfgang appearing naked in front of the indian girl at her wedding.) But if the jokes were balls and the plot was a swinning pool the jokes would be balls on no water. There's simply no reason to watch this show if you're interested in good television and actual plot/story"
3 Non-Blondes,Least we finally find out where Brandon Stark ended up..
3 Non-Blondes,This show is the disaster show of 2015.
3 Non-Blondes,"It's the Wachowskis, of course it sucks."
3 Non-Blondes,"It kinda reminded me of Orphan Black in some ways but its much worse. People being brought together, science bad people, bla bla.   

Its one of the most poorly done tv series i have seen.         
The people involved dont seem to understand tv series compared to movies...You dont just throw in 5-10 min scenes of people crying/singing or doing stupid stuff just because you have the time.            

The pacing is terrible and most episodes feel just like ""parts"" cut.      
There are other shows that are trying to be ""long movies"" but their episodes actually work the way they should.            

          

"
3 Non-Blondes,"Not surprised at all. I tried to watch Babylon 5 but the writing and acting was atrocious. The plot lines were interesting, but Piers Anthony is a better writer, and that man writes for 6th graders."
3 Non-Blondes,Just watched all the way up to Episode 6. The show for me could be good I like the concept be damn it just seems like this is just a porno trying to make it's way into the mainstream entertainment. Like I understand sex scenes could spice things up but not when every episode there just has to be a 10-15 minute free for all sex scene.
3 Non-Blondes,The show could‚Äôve been better
3 Non-Blondes,"Also, who are the hardcore fanboys who came in here and literally downvoted every single comment that criticized their precious show? I'm going to literally upvote every single comment that criticized the show because of this."
3 Non-Blondes,"> I think they just see the scene with the fucking babies and think that it's marvelous or artistic, and that's it's deep... that you need maturity to understand this show...

This. And feel free to send me your review. Yeah this show created this weird disposition in me. It really made me despise the overly positive notion that propagates reddit that like everyone is beautiful and respect everyone opinion and whatnot. This show made me think ""no humans are like naturally disgusting... birth is fucking gross, sex is fucking gross, all of this is so fucking gross, and whoever made this is just plain stupid but thinks they are smart"". And honestly I never really felt that way before, but this put it to the forefront. 

Also this show but more so its fans and reddit has made me more ambivalent to LBGT causes really. I remember in some other thread that I was called homophobic for saying that I wasn't a fan of the explicit gay sex in the show. And it brought up this notion of this ever moving standard of acceptance that I have seen growing and growing in reddit and the world at large especially among those more liberally inclined (which I am as well). I support gay rights, I have gay friends, but I don't want to watch gay sex and thus I am homophobic. I don't like the work that a transwoman wrote so now I am transphobic because if I don't I'm not supporting the transcommunity. And I know that these people commenting on this stuff on reddit don't represent those communities at large, but it still makes such stupidity hard to remove.

Sorry I went on a rant here. It is actually kind of fun this review persists to get comments and as such I have gone through this weird journey of just giving less of shit. "
3 Non-Blondes,"Glad you enjoyed it and really I am glad you enjoyed the show. I feel like my tolerance for serialized TV tropes are wearing *very* thin ie not killing a villain when you easily could, and this show just played on a bunch of them. Also I had just watched Orphan Black which has sort of a similar feel, and it was getting into some frustrating tropsey stuff. "
3 Non-Blondes,">  but she felt like such a cliche. Especially when she was doing her vlog before the Pride Parade.

This. So much. I am glad to hear you stopped honestly because it doesn't pay off. Nomy just felt like Lana Wachowski's ideal self put to paper. And it makes me kind of sad that it is such a cliche. It is like a teenager wanting to be the dark brooding guy in high school or something. Glad to see this topic still getting responses months and months later though, So thank you for the post! It is funny there was a time that this post had 50+ upvotes but then was mentioned on the sense8 subreddit."
3 Non-Blondes,I just really hope the next season is going to be better in some cases the actors need to be more convincing as well. But now that they know each other more and some relationships have been established I hope we can get to the good stuff straight from the first episode next season.
3 Non-Blondes,I'm with you. Loved it.
3 Non-Blondes,Me too. I loved it. It was awesome and just so different 
3 Non-Blondes,"Personally, I don't think those two things are different. It's the dilemma of the glass being half full or empty. The clumsiness builds the spectacular beauty. If you don't care for the beauty, the clumsiness is just that.

3 Non-Blondes,Agreed! I loved it and am looking forward to season 2. 
3 Non-Blondes,"Ah shit you are right. Don't know why that slipped my mind, the robots in that are my favorite. But Interstellar is actually a great example of how Scifi should be.

This is true but it revels in that celebration at the expense of the plot. I know the first few episodes had this kind of vibe to it, once it starts getting to the actual plot though these moments feel a bit out of place or indulgent. "

I literally muted my TV and put on captions during this scene. I did so to insure:

A) I don't want that song stuck in my head

B) I didn't want my roommates to think I was actually listening to that song. This is from someone who didn't mute one of the sex scenes, and my roommate opens the door to see me watching very explicit gay sex. I'm comfortable with my sexuality, but that is still awkward as fuck. "

The pacing was okay at first and seemed like it was really going to be working towards something. This is why I wrote this review, this is a warning more than anything. It entices you by saying it is from the Wachowskis and the writer of Babylon 5, and then never pays off. Thanks though for reading my review. As you can tell from the upvotes downvotes it is pretty controvetial (I don't see many posts with 400+ votes and only up 10 points)."
3 Non-Blondes,"Yeah I know I kind of said to myself after episode 3 ""if you keep going you will finish it"". Sadly I did."
3 Non-Blondes,"I feel like the point that the OP was getting at was that the villains were ""evil"" because they were scientists, not simply because they have an evil agenda. What is the point of lobotomizing the Sense8? The complaint isn't that the villains are evil scientists, it's that the villain is evil because he is a ""scientist"".

I think back to the quote that a great villain is the hero of his / her own story. What the hell is the villain's story that they are the hero of? To draw to another Netflix series, Daredevil clearly portrayed that Fisk's motivations were to grow and help the city, but doing so in a twisted way."
3 Non-Blondes,"The issue is that Hollywood constantly feels the need to portray science as fucking black magic eating away at the morality of society.

To tie this back into what others have said, it's all part of that ""rich white liberal baby boomer"" need to vindicate some self-loathing idea of the beauty of nature and the evil of man *and it's bullshit*."
3 Non-Blondes,I've read plenty of books where the technology is just a part of the story and isn't really portrayed in a negative light. Star Trek does this beautifully as does Star Wars. Why are people so resentful of technology? Is this just coming from Babyboomers who resent having to learn to tech?

3 Non-Blondes,"No, it's okay. I understand how you feel. Attacking someone's character is a very easy way to discredit someone, and fans of the show who don't want to admit that the show has some major flaws just attribute all criticism to ""being unable to cope with liberalism and feminism""... but I think this show does more bad than good with being so obnoxious with LGBT. Hell, in the opening sequence there's a scene with two bearded men sloppily kissing an ice cream. It's disgusting, and makes me skip the opening sequence 10/10 times.

I don't think I'll post my review because it hardly brings up any new points, but one thing I think you haven't pointed out is how all of the sensates just happen to be friends/lovers. Like, they don't know each other. More than half of them should be extremely confused, and there should be someone who's very reluctant to want to share their sense with strangers. There should be a source of conflict within the cluster of sensates. Yet they all just accept it without a problem. Really? Some random dude comes into your head and you just accept what he tells you? Instead the writers just pair up the main characters one by one. Okay, that seems natural. Two strangers who meet up only through this mysterious ability suddenly fall in love and act as if they've been lovers for years.

I'm not a writer, but if I was, I would capitalize on that source of conflict instantly. It would be much more interesting than the one-dimensional cardboard box with superpowers they have as the current villain. But I think the writers were focused on creating their perfect masturbation material instead of actually writing an interesting story."

3 Non-Blondes,"It's a bummer cause I really wanted to like it. I have been wanting a weird paranormal type show to watch to hold me over until Twin Peaks comes back, but there just isn't anything that hits all the marks Twin Peaks did for me. 

Twin Peaks was a show that seemed like it was trying to be a normal crime drama, but somewhere in there David Lynch slathered  weirdness all over the show and the characters. At first you don't know what to think. ""What's going on, why is he talking to his Tape Recorder like a secretary? Why is a sheriff's deputy breaking down and sobbing? Whoa, what the hell was up with that dream?"" Then you let the weird wash over you, and you like it.

But I suppose there is no one who can make Twin Peaks but Mark Frost and David Lynch, so I'm very excited for it's return in 2016. Shows like Sense8 just portray themselves in a way too serious light to get weird."
3 Non-Blondes,"They didn't refuse him because they weren't equipped.  They rejected the kid because they'd made an *administrative decision to save money by refusing to treat gunshot victims*, even little kids bleeding out on the floor of their ER, which is nonsensical horseshit.

In reality if a hospital tried that they'd be sued into oblivion, if it didn't lead to actual criminal prosecutions."
3 Non-Blondes,"You are out of touch if you think that article supports your point.  ERs don't tell bleeding kids being carried in to GTFO.  They may have policies where they try to make sure ambulances are routed to hospitals more equipped to care for them, but that happens everywhere at every level.  My (white) Dad has amazing insurance and when he had a heart attack in NYC his ambulance got re-routed halfway through the trip from the closest one to the one best equipped.

3 Non-Blondes,See there you go. I'm left leaning and I hated it. I don't think left or right has anything to do with it and it's a bit weird to bring up frankly. 
3 Non-Blondes,"I'm pretty right wing too and I don't have too many issues with regards to the politicization. I mean a lot of it is drawn from Lana Wachowski's life (as I understand) which makes it somewhat interesting. That said, it's still not a good show.

However, if the show was only the Capheus parts, I think I'd stick with it."
3 Non-Blondes,"Yes! I agree. People need to be wary of the comments telling them to watch it if they like a few scenes in the third episode. The bad parts of the show don't just disappear; they persist throughout the entire season, and probably for the rest of the series. I only continued watching it because of the vast majority of the reddit comments saying it only gets better... but it didn't. At least you tried to tell people how it doesn't get better.

The only reason I found this post is because I searched it on google. Most people will never see this, which is a shame, because you bring up a lot of good points."
3 Non-Blondes,The point of the lobotomising was so that villain could neutralise these people without having to go around covering up hundreds of murders (just a surgical procedure that went badly) while also creating a minion that he could control at any time.
3 Non-Blondes,"Or you know, the genre is called science fiction, there's only so many different ways you can write that up.  Antagonist, Protagonist, Setting, one of these things has to be science in order for it to be sci-fi.  

Are you advocating that sci-fi should only portray science in a positive manner, all other instances be outlawed?"
3 Non-Blondes,"If memory serves, Robert J. Sawyer gave an interesting talk a while back on why sci-fi films and TV shows tend to be anti-science rather than pro-science.  (Including Star Wars.)  I believe the gist was that people fear technology and change and therefore want to watch fiction which assures them that people will blow up any scary new technology that comes along."
3 Non-Blondes,"You can have science gone wrong too without the villain being a one dimensionally scientist. You can give them more dept, you can have them not be scientist, you can have accidents."

3 Non-Blondes,"You could have people using the new tech being the protagonists and luddites trying to stop them being the antagonists.

This is essentially what happens in The Fifth Estate.  The sci-fi invention happens to be a real one, the Internet, but the protagonists are using it to usher in a new paradigm of whistleblowing, while the antagonists are trying to stop them, to preserve the existing paradigm.  Contrast this with most sci-fi films, say Jurassic Park for a typical example, in which the antagonists try to usher in a new paradigm of genetic engineering, while the protagonists stop them, to preserve the existing paradigm."
3 Non-Blondes,"Governments or corporations are usually the culprit.  They use technology, but so do the heroes. Tech is a device and people are still evil. 

Or in the case of Jurassic Park it's dinosaurs (and Newman!)"
3 Non-Blondes,"Personally I have only watched the matrix from them, I don't know how they came so far off with this, but maybe Jupiter Ascending will be good, also wanting to watch cloud Atlas.

I think overall the show has some cool moments (lito experiencing menstration, kala seeing wolfgang naked at her wedding) but all shows have these, they are just not bound to a general plot.

I can't remember if you watched the whole show, but the way the finale went down was how I hoped more of the show would be like, it just paced WAY too slowly and had very little to no focus on the main storyline, basically the first two minutes and the last five minutes of the episodes had significance to the plot and something was happening, inbetween it was just boring and nothing happened, just people speaking about their day to day problems, I couldn't give a bigger shit, if I wanted that I'd go out in real life.

I also have a hypothesis on how the responses might be from SJW's who are like ""muh transphobia"", it sucks to see such responses and being labeled because you didn't like it, but it probably has something to do with the show coming off as a means to some sort of political agenda more than it is a TV Show, but that was just my perception."
3 Non-Blondes,"Marco Polo S1 was hardly a bad show, it's on 4.3/5 based on 1.6 million ratings. It was significantly more entertaining than HoC season 3, GoT S5 (up till last weeks episode), and Sense8.

"
3 Non-Blondes,"They got as far as ""The Wachowskis"" on the cover page and greenlit it on that basis.

If the Matrix Sequels -> Cloud Atlas -> Jupiter Ascending sequence proves anything it's that the Wachowskis have got a serious dose of George Lucas disease, where a film-maker's pull comprehensively outstrips their actual talent... and instead of having great ideas that are cleverly shaped by smart, critical, creative people around them they end up surrounded by yes-men and are reduced to squatting out a series of increasingly self-indulgent turds. :-("
3 Non-Blondes,My guess is Netflix just gave them a bunch of money and sent them off to make the series. Maybe they will regret that and change in the future.
3 Non-Blondes,">  I think you haven't pointed out is how all of the sensates just happen to be friends/lovers.

This is true but honestly I think that this is like the Wachowskis view of the world. There are certain special people who are open and capable of understanding this sort of thing. All of their stuff has this same kind of predestination aspect. The Matrix only certain people could escape the Matrix, Cloud Atlas people fit to certain roles and these keep reoccuring (an evil person is always evil), and lately Jupiter Ascending (second only to this as the worst piece of shit I've ever seen) had the same reincarnation/predestination plot as well.

God I pissed myself off by mentioning Jupiter Ascending. But I should point out that seeing that film and this show back to back made me realize what total hacks the Wachowskis are. Before this I defended them a lot, even going as far as to correct people for saying Lana was a crossdresser. But between these two projects they managed to recycle every decent idea they had with the Matrix and douse it with shit. I actually don't know if I could watch The Matrix again and still enjoy it now. They are that fucking bad. "

I had this notion as well, but again it felt pretty preachy and not in a smart way. 

>Dude. There's at least 4 more seasons. Leave something for later :)

You need to establish your villains early. BSG did this and it made the changes that happen later in the show much more compelling. Lost did not and the show suffered from it, and honestly Lost never really got around to this.

Also dear god don't let their be 4 more seasons of this..."
3 Non-Blondes,"> Are you advocating that sci-fi should only portray science in a positive manner, all other instances be outlawed?

You know what you're doing. No one is saying that. "
3 Non-Blondes,"No just not use ""science is evil"" as the jumping off point. Not everything has to be a fucking commentary or warning about stuff. This really started in the 50's when there was a serious threat of nuclear war. But now the threat is just basically research science. Star Trek and Star Wars use technology to tell their stories but the technology/science isn't the story. "
3 Non-Blondes,It depends on the type of science fiction. Having science fiction take place in the present. I don't see how there isn't going to be an evil scientist somewhere.
3 Non-Blondes,">I also have a hypothesis on how the responses might be from SJW's who are like ""muh transphobia""

I haven't had too much of this from this one review. However on another board when I was in a particularly dark mood I believe I stated that this show made me not want to be concerned with any social issues ever again. Basically my conclusion there was that if this is how progress looks I don't want anything to do with it. This also devolved into a conversation about how I was ""homophobic"" because I didn't emjoy graphic gay sex scenes. This legitimately pushed me to the decision that words like homophobic and misogyny have lost all meaning when their definitions have become a moving metric. 

Your plot analysis of the last episode is pretty spot on, except I would extrapolate it to all the episodes. The overall plots move so slowly it is inherently self-indulgent."

3 Non-Blondes,"> Not everything has to be a fucking commentary or warning about stuff.

And yet, you're suggesting that because the antagonist in this story is a scientist, or works for a scientific organization, the whole story is a commentary on science being evil.

3 Non-Blondes,"Watch black mirror, they do a different scenario for that in each episode. "
3 Non-Blondes,"> I haven't had too much of this from this one review. However on another board when I was in a particularly dark mood I believe I stated that this show made me not want to be concerned with any social issues ever again. Basically my conclusion there was that if this is how progress looks I don't want anything to do with it. This also devolved into a conversation about how I was ""homophobic"" because I didn't emjoy graphic gay sex scenes. This legitimately pushed me to the decision that words like homophobic and misogyny have lost all meaning when their definitions have become a moving metric. 

I saw a few user reviews say things about how people didn't like it were all sorts of things, from stupid, to unable to comprehend the show or understand it, transphobic, homophobic, not wanting innovation, rather would stay with clich√©s.

I did not know of the word Misogyny before GG, but it instantly started meaning absolutely nothing to me because of how over used it is when there was no reason to use it.

>Your plot analysis of the last episode is pretty spot on, except I would extrapolate it to all the episodes. The overall plots move so slowly it is inherently self-indulgent.

Exactly, that's my main critique of this, there's way too little substance. I saw one user review saying that it has read that the wachowski's didn't create a meaning with this but wanted to see what they could get away with by making absolutely no plot, I can't really verify the accuracy of it, but it's an interesting hypothesis."
3 Non-Blondes,"Interesting choice of adjective there.

Not ""clever"" or ""intelligent"" or ""profound"" or ""a rollercoaster thrill-ride for the ages"". Not even ""coherent"".

Just ""beautiful""... that nobody really disputes, but is a really shallow basis on which to recommend a three-hour film.

Hell, even Prometheus or Jupiter Ascending are *pretty*. They're just also as dumb as a bag of hammers."

Bureau of Magical Things,Performer of the week? You must be outta your damn mind!
Bureau of Magical Things," Ha! I love that an actor gets accolades for a currently running show and we all just run with jokes from a show that ended 9 years ago. Psych is still my favorite show.

Bureau of Magical Things,Oh cool I didn‚Äôt realize he was using his real name now! I love it
Bureau of Magical Things,I'm Shawn Spencer and this is my partner Lavender Gooms
Bureau of Magical Things,You know that's right
Bureau of Magical Things,I beg your pardon? My name is Black. His name is Tan. I can‚Äôt believe you just made that assumption. You should be ashamed of yourself and your family.

Bureau of Magical Things,"Although most people probably will never remember him for any character other than Shawn Spencer, I'm really proud that James is getting praise for his drama skills. This isn't a super famous show and it's airing at the same time as big productions, so it's really cool that he's being recognized for it."
Bureau of Magical Things,"[I‚Äôm Shawn and this is my associate MC Clap Yo Handz](https://youtu.be/CefU27YmuAE)

[Gus‚Äôs many aliases](https://youtu.be/KLicgtao6f8) were a great running gag that built over time."

Bureau of Magical Things,"Huh, I'm generally pretty aware of TV but I've never heard of this show despite it having five seasons and featuring a number of people I've heard of.  Is it any good?  I'm getting ""This Is Us"" melodrama vibes from the description."
Bureau of Magical Things,Say it again. Use a Jamaican accent.
Bureau of Magical Things,"If I wanted to watch depressing porn, I‚Äôd just set up a camera in my bedroom.

Bureau of Magical Things,"Gus, don‚Äôt be this crevice in my arm. We‚Äôre going to be fine!"
Bureau of Magical Things,Great actor!! The show Psych was brilliant. This man truly has talent.
Bureau of Magical Things,"In his heyday, he could've easily played a live action Nathan Drake. You know that's right."
Bureau of Magical Things,"I remember seeing him and  Michael Weston off-broadway in 2010 during his Psych run of a performance of  Gabe McKinley's Extinction. He got very dark in the play, and did some heavy things that made me literally watch Psych differently. Like, I didn't see Shawn, the loveable goofball but a alcoholic asshole who was doing bad things.  Great show but I've been waiting for his big break and I'm glad he's finally getting it. I still can't watch Psych though lol"
Bureau of Magical Things,I love James Roday Rodriguez and I‚Äôm not afraid to say it!
Bureau of Magical Things,Good for James getting some recognition after a down week for The Last of Us. Good luck to anyone who isn‚Äôt Henry and Sam from TLOU getting this recognition next week.
Bureau of Magical Things,"This episode had me BAWLING. I'll miss this show a lot when it's over, and will rewatch for sure."
Bureau of Magical Things,I am loving all the Psych comments.
Bureau of Magical Things,TIL ‚ÄúA Million Little Things‚Äù is still airing.
Bureau of Magical Things,"Judging by the comments, I really need to finish ‚ÄúPsyche.‚Äù"
Bureau of Magical Things,"Him and Martin Sheen, I never knew where of Hispanic descent. I knew Emelio took his mother‚Äôs maiden name, Estevez, but based on his roll as a white bread sports jock in the Breakfast Club you never would have guessed."
Bureau of Magical Things,Imagine you've been working as an actor for decades and finally get praise for your dramatic acting skills and all the internet can do is reference something from a comedy show that ended nearly a decade ago.
Bureau of Magical Things,"Is this show actually any good? The ads always looked a bit cringe so I‚Äôve never watched it, but happy to have my mind changed"
Bureau of Magical Things,His Psych character always reminded me of Ace Ventura.
Bureau of Magical Things,Sean! My man. Where's gus at these days?

Bureau of Magical Things,"Yeah, but they're getting ready to start the fourth movie."
Bureau of Magical Things,"Funny thing is, I had no idea about Psych until I saw the poster on a streaming service and recognized James from AMLT and decided to watch because of him. So maybe I've watched it both ways?"
Bureau of Magical Things,You hear about Pluto?
Bureau of Magical Things,Psych 3 came out recently
Bureau of Magical Things,No you have not!
Bureau of Magical Things,"Love the one time he's all ""No, no I haven't heard it both ways"""

Shawn: ""This is my partner, Burton Guster-Rodriguez.""
Gus: ""Rodriguez?""
Shawn: ""It's always been there."""
Bureau of Magical Things,"yeah, he started doing it during COVID because he felt bad for betraying his heritage - and now he isn't an unknown so he can get offered roles instead of going to auditions like someone trying to break into acting"

Bureau of Magical Things,"Yes we all know that, but Gus isn't ON the show that this actor is getting praise for."
Bureau of Magical Things,"This is the last season, so not for much longer. I dropped off last season. It‚Äôs a perpetual depressing show that tries to one up each terrible things that happens with an emotional epiphany."
Bureau of Magical Things,"Same. I haven't watched since the pizza night episode.

Lady was essentially like ""I know my husband killed himself because I cheated on him with your husband, but it's pizza night so we have to be friends"""
Bureau of Magical Things,I only knew it as the same kind over emotional sad fest as This Is Us but also one time I tuned in accidentally and they were covering up a kidnapping and murder??
Bureau of Magical Things,Lisa from Temecula was one of the funniest sketches in a long time. She finally did a balls to the wall character and it was perfect.
Bureau of Magical Things,"Lamar Johnson (""The Last of Us"")"
Bureau of Magical Things,This is my partner **Burton Guster.** (To the head of a crime organization).
Bureau of Magical Things,Guy Buttersnaps
Bureau of Magical Things,"You're getting those vibes because it was made by ABC as counter-programming to NBC's *This is Us*, after the success of its first season."
Bureau of Magical Things,The first two seasons are really good. A little mystery hidden behind the drama. But it nosedives with bad writing after that.
Bureau of Magical Things,It feels like Brothers & Sisters and a little bit of This is Us
Bureau of Magical Things,IMO it's a great show. I like it better than This Is Us to be honest (maybe because of the cast).
Bureau of Magical Things,"In Psych 2, Henry is watching This Is Us, and Shawn says, ‚ÄúThey have the same show on ABC, but newer!‚Äù

Cracked me up."
Bureau of Magical Things,"It's knockoff This Is Us, but instead of cathartic tears, it just wants to make everyone depressed"
Bureau of Magical Things,"I knew of this show but didn't realize it was still on. 

Tv is too busy telling me about this fucking dumb bitch hiding shrimp tails in a jar as a way to convince me to switch to State Farm to actually tell me about other tv shows that are airing."
Bureau of Magical Things,"Michael Weston was in ""two"" episodes of Psych. Cloudy with a Chance of Murder. Then they remade the ep in Cloudy with a Chance of Remake. He was great in both!"
Bureau of Magical Things,TIL there are Criminal Minds spinoffs; and a Hallmark show with time travel
Bureau of Magical Things,do it
Bureau of Magical Things,Estevez isn‚Äôt Emilio‚Äôs mothers maiden name. It‚Äôs Martins real name. He was born Ramon Estevez and took the name ‚ÄúMartin sheen‚Äù as a stage name. Same with Charlie sheen (born Carlos estevez). Emilio just opted to keep his real name instead of adopt his fathers stage surname.
Bureau of Magical Things,That‚Äôs just how beloved that show was. It‚Äôs a cultural phenomenon

The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,[deleted]
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"bert kreischer displays a numebr of traits which would make a grocer feel uncomfortable while he was getting chips and dip at his vacation spot. is this type of person safe to be viewed? he plays with bees, handles a gun and abuses fruit. if i were to write a first letter to the white house about a topical issue, i'm confident that the folly of burt kreischer is what that would be about. god save us, from this type of attitude."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Definitely scripted.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"love the guy and fun moments - but overall feels really forced. 

also - i dis not get it. does he like jenner or not?"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,cant wait to mute that horrific death-screech of a laugh

The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"**""Comedian known for doing a thing does the thing, news at 11!""**"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,A ^hundred percent
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,It‚Äôs an inside joke from Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer‚Äôs podcasts. Tom got the internet army ready to say that Bert fucks dogs and smells really bad. You will see these jokes on any thread involving Bert.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,It‚Äôs...it‚Äôs average size

The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Dang it, thanks! Thought it worked"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,I saw it on comedy central. Not sure if it's online. Ben was eliminated his second appearance.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,I mean the one's he filmed. His videos gloat that theyre still up but theyre not on his page...
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,They were there last week.. maybe YouTube pulled em
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"That was.. HILARIOUS! 


Definitely recommend his podcast with Joe rogan and segura on their weight cut challenge and also his special. 

Man he is just full of so much joy it's hard not to love life and laugh with him. 

Plus he does this awesome thing every gig where he gets the audience to put lots of tips in and they give it to one of the staff in the place as a kind of lottery win. Generates a lot of love "
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"The best and worst thing about working in local television were the comedians. It could make Friday mornings either amazing or a cringe fest if they weren't on their game. Bert is the man, though. His act is great and his ""The Machine"" bit is legendary but his weight loss challenge and subsequent Joe Rogan podcasts with Tom Segura were epic as well. "
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I AM THE MACHINE.

His story about fighting a bear on Comedy Central's ""This Is Not Happening"" is fucking hysterical."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I've seen him live a few times and it's always worth it. His podcast is great if you like comedians and hearing them talk about being comics,  which I really do. He just seems like an all around really nice guy who always has good intentions in what he does. Check out his podcast Bertcast, full of comedians. The Danish and Oniell ones are great.  "
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Those two hosts are also pretty hilarious. They talked to Bert like they were best friends.

The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"watch until the end
"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Is the show any good?
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I refuse to click the link, but, ""*baggage* and showcase""? 

Fuck that headline. Seriously... 

Lol."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Coincidentally Kaley Cuoco, the star in the Flight Attendant, looks like the real life flight attendant/CIA asset Vivienne Templeton who featured in Bill Fairclough's fact based spy novels in The Burlington Files series. Vivienne Templeton (real name withheld) was a CIA operative in Haiti and the Caribbean. She was based in Fort Lauderdale working under the cover of being an air hostess who moonlighted by managing holiday lets in the Bahamas and Florida. The Burlington Files series is based on the life of a genuine spook, Bill Fairclough aka Edward Burlington. Have a look at TheBurlingtonFiles + Everipedia websites for photos of Vivienne in the seventies and see if you agree that she is like a twin of Kaley Cuoco."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,The premise is good but honestly I don‚Äôt think she is good enough actress for the role. It‚Äôs the same issue I have with The Batman.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"It‚Äôs certainly watchable. Plotwise I would say it‚Äôs a pretty standard ‚Äòregular person stumbles into a massive international assassin/espionage caper‚Äô story and leans into a lot of the associated tropes, but it‚Äôs pretty fun, Kaley Cuoco does  a lot better a job then I expected (with the help of a strong supporting cast), and it moves along so briskly there‚Äôs hardly time to complain unless you‚Äôre real curmudgeon. Perfectly good Thursday evening viewing."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"It started out pretty good IMO, but by the end it was kind of absurd. The whole show is just one plot twist after another. It was interesting at first, but it just got to be too much for me by the end."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"We watched the entire first season, but honestly, we had a hard time.  While fun at times, the main character was so unlikable, and constantly made bad/worse decisions each episode.  Kaley Cuoco was great in it though, it's the writing we had trouble with."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Season one is very good, definitely worth checking out if you haven't."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Kaley Cuoco is a good actress and has fun energy, on top of a story that keeps moving with little slowdowns.

It's fun and fast paced which I liked certainly worth a watch and the pilot is really good."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"No, it‚Äôs not. Some of the worst writing I‚Äôve come across. COVID shoulders some blame but there are a couple season 1 episodes where I was spoon-fed plot or _not-so-clever ideas_ to re-engage the plot and get moving along. Too many convenient coincidences.

And of course, acting suffers with crap writing too. I will not be watching season 2. There are hundreds of things I would rather do with my time."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I had a good time with it! I don't think it really ever misses, and it had a good mix of humour and drama."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I'll occupy the middle ground and say it's decent. Entertaining enough if you don't mind some pretty cliched storytelling. Due to the premise, I probably unfairly compared it to The Night Of too much, which I enjoyed far more. But it's not trying to be like that show.

Only watched the first ep of season 2 so far but it feels like a slight step down. I didn't love the sequel hook in season 1 to begin with, though. Should have been a miniseries imo but I hope to be proven wrong"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Not from what I heard.  Ive read far more meh reviews than good.

Only has 7.1 on IMDB which is pretty low for a show."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Yeah, she imbues everything with sitcom energy.  Like she maybe killed a guy and she has to cover it up because the boss is coming over for dinner."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,what actress was not good enough in The Batman (2022)
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,critically its very well received
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I mean she starred on one of the most popular sitcoms of all time, I think she'll be okay here"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"What the hell was I watching about a year ago that had her, Joel Mchale, and some comedienne out in the woods or at a cabin or some shit. I can‚Äôt remember the name of that show for the life of me now."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Err, the plot twists are what makes it good."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"> Some of the worst writing I‚Äôve come across.

Comments like this are useless. Your opinion is your own and no one says you have to like it but you must have a STAGGERINGLY limited viewing history if this is some of the ""worst writing you've ever come across""."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Robert Pattinson. He‚Äôs handsome but I don‚Äôt believe him as the character. He‚Äôs like Caspar Van Dien from Starship Troopers with 95% of the acting is twitching his face muscles.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Thank Jebus I‚Äôm not a professional critic then. it‚Äôs the curse of watching her play that same witless but determined character in Big Bang.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Thanks for letting me know. I was concerned for her.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,The Cabin with Bert Kreischer!
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Just my opinion on the show. After a while it just becomes pretty bonkers with everything that keeps happening. Kinda like M night movies. It‚Äôs not really interesting if you can predict it‚Äôs gonna take a turn somewhere.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Comments like that are informative. People are sharing their comments, and as per Reddit standard, those that deviate from their own get downvoted into oblivion. They're opinions people, relax.

The show does suffer from a handful of convenient writing moments. In order to enjoy it, switch brain off and watch the cartoonesque sillyness happen and itl be fine to watch.

Gotta be honest here, I thought this was going to be a 1 and done season show."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"No different than your opinion being your own. The person asked if it‚Äôs good, I said ‚Äúno‚Äù and gave my supporting reasons.

And yes, still some of the worst writing I‚Äôve sat through. It was only compounded by the fact that the show was on while my spouse really wanted to finish it. I worked on my laptop while she watched, and I cringed, bit-my-tongue and occasionally blurred out, ‚Äúoh come on!‚Äù

If you‚Äôre annoyed by my previously softened assessment, you won‚Äôt like my true feelings.

The show isn‚Äôt even garbage, it‚Äôs the slimy, nasty fluid that leaked out of the bag and somehow left a stank stain on my garage floor. And despite my multiple attempts of trying to scrub it out with a wire brush or high-pressure power washer, the nasty simply won‚Äôt go away. I thought it was gone, but then I read this post that indicates somehow this got a second season. I can promise ‚Äî there is no way in hell I will let a second trash stain infiltrate my garage floor."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Well you were criticizing her so apparently you were concerned. Happy to help.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"You say bonkers and think that is bad, I read bonkers and agree to bonkers because bonkers is good sometimes.

I reject the MNS comparison. MNS has gone full bad, while Flight Attendant is fun.
Bonkers twists that are presented in a fun way are fun.

MNS trying to repeat his big ""I see dead people"" success for 20  years is just sad."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,I agree it‚Äôs a trash and very clich√© moments show. Typical /r/television just downvoting anything that goes against there opinion
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Sure, but if they just keep doing the same thing for multiple season, well then you‚Äôve entered MNS territory. 

I just don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôre going to keep it up when it was already getting tired after 1 season."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"They might fail in season 2, but, no, still not even remotely comparable to MNS if they keep it fun at all.

MNS takes his weak repetitions serious.

""Old"" was just annoying and bad. The ""twist"" wasn't even the problem. That would have been fine if the movie until then wasn't so bad."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer," ‚ÄúIt went from satire to the thing it was satirizing.‚Äù  

Sounds like a Sam Levinson project."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"> ‚ÄúIt was a show about a woman who was finding herself sexually, turned into a show about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.‚Äù 

üò¨"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,">Casting K-pop superstar Jennie of Blackpink was the biggest get for Levinson. Under the show‚Äôs hashtag and teaser trailers, her stans steamrolled comment sections to cheer on the singer in her first acting role. But crew members claim Jennie has barely any air time and an inconsequential story arc. ‚ÄúIt was like three or four lines per episode for her,‚Äù a production source says. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt let her talk that much. Her job was to sit there [and] look pretty, basically.‚Äù 

Like YG Entertainment would have agreed to anything more. They now have a well-established reputation for overhyping and underdelivering."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Sam Levinson seriously needs to jerk off before coming into work.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,">The first public inkling of trouble came last April, when director Amy Seimetz, of The Girlfriend Experience and She Dies Tomorrow, suddenly exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished. HBO addressed the news by confirming The Idol was set to have a major creative overhaul and would be adjusting the cast and crew. There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a ‚Äúfemale perspective.‚Äù

&#x200B;

I mean, the protagonist is a woman, how is leading too much into a female perspective is bad?"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"I understand that Levinson is a fucking creep, but let‚Äôs not forget that The Weeknd is co-creator, co-writer, exec. producer, and apparently put in the request that turned the show on its head. Whatever comes of this, he deserves just as much blame as anyone else, and it‚Äôs crazy that most people are kinda glossing over that."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,It‚Äôs insane that Euphoria will coast over 100 million for the next season.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"Man, I was mostly interested in this show just for Amy Seimetz. Replacing her killed my interest even before all that shitshow."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,Every single thing I read about Sam Levinson screams *‚ÄùI‚ÄôM THE SON OF A FAMOUS DIRECTOR SO I THINK I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!‚Äù*
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,I seem to recall that the original director had wanted episodes exploring Lily rose depp‚Äôs character‚Äôs personal life and relationship with a childhood friend- good reflective stuff that gives the show depth. Anyway The Weeknd vetoed it for being too feminist üíÄ
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"> Levinson allegedly stopped sending scripts to HBO and certain department heads, according to two people familiar with the matter. ‚ÄúI got the vibe that the mood on set was, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs HBO gonna do, pull the plug? Yeah, right. If they want a third season of Euphoria, they‚Äôll give me what I want‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre just gonna shoot what we want and if [HBO execs] have a problem with it, that‚Äôs their problem,‚Äô‚Äù they explain. 

wouldn't be surprised if Euphoria gets canned after this, the arrogance is astonishing"
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,"*Seimetz seemed set up to fail from the start. When she arrived on set seven weeks before the show started filming, she was given half-finished scripts, a first-time showrunner in Epstein, a tight schedule, and near-impossible expectations from HBO, those sources say. ‚ÄúAmy was doing her best in an impossible situation, but she was going to lose this no matter what,‚Äù one production member says. ‚ÄúHonestly, I think HBO handed her a shit stack.‚Äù (Seimetz declined to comment.)  HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria‚Äôs upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...  It's sounds like the developmental execs at HBO are terrified to do their job well given all the projects getting axed by the new overlords."
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,I went from wow that sounds like a mess to work on to wow an egg where and she is begging him for what?!?! I like dark shows and shows that push the envelope but this is not it.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,I know several people worked on this show and I‚Äôve yet to hear a single person say a good thing about it. Such a fucking mess and it definitely crossed into dangerous territory once Levinson was there.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,They gave The Weeknd too much power and not surprisingly he went on an ego trip. He has that movie with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan that he's also writing and producing up next which is too bad because we'll probably hear something similar there.
The Cabin with Bert Kreischer,All of Sam Levinson‚Äôs projects seem like a dumpster fire to work on. His sets are always chaotic and messy and unorganized. And this torture porn thing is not a good look.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Love both of these so much. Their chemistry was off the charts in Bly Manor, funny to think about how it was gonna be a straight couple originally with Oliver Jackson Cohen playing the gardener. The show doesn‚Äôt get enough love. 

Genuine romance stories in genre settings in general need to be done more."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Who really finds being gay or lesbian strange anymore?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,The Last of Us really managed to pack an emotional gut punch into that episode.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I just wish it had a graphic docking scene
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Finally a tv show with a gay couple
The Haunting of Bly Manor,There‚Äôs a The Last of Us tv show?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Outside the western world? Billions of people unfortunately....

The Haunting of Bly Manor,Out of the western bubble which around 7 Billion people
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Lots and lots of people, sadly."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Come on, man. This can‚Äôt be a real question."

The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I tried to watch ep 3 with my neighbor and he refused to watch ""zombie brokeback mountain"" and made me skip most of the episode because it bothered him that much. I had already seen it so I just sat there and just made fun of him for it.

 Lol"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Do you see the news in the U.S?

Many people unfortunately. Same in the rest of the world.."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Unfortunately a massive % of the population of the US.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,About 35% of Americans and billions elsewhere.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Sadly, about 98% of the Neanderthals I work with in the warehouse.

Absolutely disgusting, the shit I gotta hear said sometimes. I got one coworker who still believes there are litter boxes for Furries in High Schools and believes being gay is just some disgusting choice sexual deviants choose to engage in.  Oh yes, every gradeschool teacher that's not a straight white person is ""Doing CRT to groom the kids to become gays!""--I wish this were a made up quote......

2 of them were stunlocked by the revelation that I am 1/2 Jewish.  Like, they're fused to believe it.

The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Yes, 'Muppet's The Last of Us', starring Kermit as Joel, Miss Piggy as Tess and Mandy Patinkin as Ellie."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Yes, on HBO. Three episodes in so far"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Have you been trapped under a rock or in a coma?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Unfortunately I think you're giving the western world a little too much credit too.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"My mom is the same, but she watched the episode and cried and said it was her favorite so far. I didn‚Äôt really push her on anything and I hope maybe in her mind she‚Äôs slowly becoming more accepting."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Your mum is gross :(





I meant her views make her gross, in case that isn't clear lol"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,IMDb has been review bombed so much user ratings are meaningless

Makes episodes like this one really special though!"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Anyone that has a pile of dolls is just asking for trouble.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I'm glad they're bringing back a lot of the original cast from season one. As much as I loved the scary aspects of the first season, honestly the story about the family and their struggles and what they all went through was half the horror and added a whole different layer to the series, and a lot of that had to do with the talent of the actors."

The Haunting of Bly Manor,So thankful it is not related to the Hill House plot. That season really had no need for a sequel
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I love that the trailer begins with the same creepy song as the 1961 movie (highly recommended). Looks great, can't wait for October 9"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"The first one was one of the best TV horror in years. Probably one of the best of all time. I'm glad they keep the same team, this looks like a wild ride."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I have been on the Flanagan hype train for a couple of years now. I will watch anything he puts out tbh.





....he'd also be a perfect choice for A Nightmare On Elm Street reboot"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Victoria Pedretti is the next big thing.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Holy fucking shit finally! Hill House was one *hell* of a show!
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"October 9th. That's right around the corner!

I'm ready for more Flanagan in my life. Hill House was the last show I legitimately binged in one go. Here's hoping this one is as good!"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Coming out October 9th!!
I‚Äôm so excited!"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Lmao that little girl told that ghost to shut the hell up
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Is this... a non-spoiler-full Netflix trailer?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Haunting of Hill House was the first time in the five years since my dad died that my fianc√©e and I had a deep, meaningful discussion about grief. It was incredibly cathartic to watch and I really hope to see similar themes in season 2!"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Found a new show after watching The Boys. (Ending on October 9)
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"So is it the same actors playing different characters, or are they the same characters in the same family but in a different house?"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Same cast. So it‚Äôs American Horror Story but actually good?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,[deleted]
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Isn‚Äôt a little early? I‚Äôd expected it in October, but more like October 16 or 23. 

I‚Äôm not complaining, though."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,The creepy song [O Willow waly ](https://youtu.be/mL02joX6OpQ) used in this trailer is from the film ‚ÄòThe Innocents‚Äô starring Debra Kerr which is also an adaptation of Henry James ‚ÄòThe turn of the screw‚Äô - it‚Äôs an absolutely amazing psychological horror movie and if The Haunting Of Bly Manor is anywhere near as good as it I will be very happy
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"ooooooooohhhhhhhh myyy goooddd I'm excited. 

I hope /u/The_Dalek_Emperor had a hand in writing this one as well. The haunting of hill house was one of the best TV shows I've ever watched."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I'm so excited for this! The first season was incredible. The actors were amazing. The little details in the background were absolutely terrifying.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I got goosebumps when I realized that the song they used was Flora's song from the 1960's movie!
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Honestly the first season was possibly my favorite horror series of all time. I can not wait for this! If the acting and character arcs are as good as the first one it‚Äôs gonna be amazing. Despite if it‚Äôs scary or not.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Unrelated to the first one? Like ahs sequels?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I heard Hollywood‚Äôs Bad Boy Rahul Kohli is in this? Why not in the trailer?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Not to be mean, but do people not know what an anthology is?"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I am so hyped. 

Feels like I've been waiting forever since this was announced. The original was such a pleasant surprise, if this is half as good I'll be thrilled."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I'm hoping they don't pull a Terror Season 2, but I think this will be great!"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I can‚Äôt wait to look for spooky ghosts in every scene again. That shit had me on high alert.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Really hyped for this. Season one was fantastic, but episode six (the one-shot ep) was one of the best directed episodes of television I‚Äôve seen for years (and probably the best directed horror tv I‚Äôve ever seen)."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I just realised the guy who plays the dad is the little kid from E.T.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,They used the Willow song from The Innocents! That's kind of amazing... I really don't like horror at all except for The Innocents and Turn of The Screw so... I guess I am obliged to watch this
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Hope it has the same spectacular long takes like in THOHH
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"That's a very good teaser, holy shit"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"While I wasn't the biggest fan of Hill House, I loved Victoria Pedretti in it (and in You) so I'm so glad she seems to have the lead role in this."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Looking forward to this. Coming out sooner than I thought as well.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I didn't care for this trailer... but a horror show needs to play its cards close to the chest, plus Netflix trailers are usually hit or miss.  Hill House has made this show a much watch regardless."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I'm looking forward to this. With them reusing part of the cast from the first season, I think it'd be interesting to see some of the principle cast acting against those that played their younger selves in the first season, but something tells me they were likely dropped."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Is this a 90s period piece like The Turning too? Those jeans and Victoria's hair scream early 90s/late 80s.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Is this going to be set in the UK since its an adaptation of The Turn of the Screw?
The Haunting of Bly Manor,This has to be better than ‚ÄúThe Turning.‚Äù That was the worst horror movie I‚Äôve seen in a while. And I saw ‚ÄúThe Boy 2‚Äù...
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Hell yeah, been looking forward to this since it was announced. We‚Äôre all in need for a decent (if loose) retelling of the Turning of the Screw, especially after that disappointing and misguided adaptation earlier this year. 

Flanagan, let‚Äôs see what you got."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I gotta say, I usually don‚Äôt comment on these sorts of things, but the Haunting of Hill House was so good that I‚Äôm pumped for this. I love scary shows/movies but I hate the ‚Äúcheap scares‚Äù like jump scares/gore. 

Hill House had basically one jump scare and they fucking nailed it. The only time in my life I actually screamed while watching something."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,i hope they put little easter eggs in the background of scenes like they did with Hill House. My favorite part of my rewatch was looking for those..
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Screaming meemies here we go !!
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Granted it's only a teaser, but can't help but be a little disappointed. Very standard imagery"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Based off ""The Turn of the Screw"", which is a really great story despite the awkward use of commas throughout.

Very excited - Loved ""Hill House""!"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"Im pretty excited for this. The Haunting Of Hill House was awesome. Nells storyline was so heartbreaking and engaging, as were the rest of the plots"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"This makes me miss *You* even more.

Legitimately one of my favorite trash-TV shows--- way too much fun to deny oneself. *Love Quinn* is one of my favorite revelations in recent TV."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"nope nope nope..... you guys enjoy but i draw the line at creepy ass dolls....

&#x200B;

\*shiver\*"
The Haunting of Bly Manor,I really do trust Mike Flanagan whenever he directs anything related to horror so obviously I‚Äôm excited.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I loved the Haunting of Hill House, but to be honest i feel that using these 'child-voice' songs and dolls is becoming quite dull and uninspired."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,Hopefully they don't bitch out on the ending like they did with Haunting of Hill House because I really really enjoyed it before the last episode.
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"It looks so good. Being an horror fan , the first season is one of my favorite TV seasons of all time and it looks like they nailed it again."
The Haunting of Bly Manor,"I had my issues with some of the last season, but overall it was some great horror. I‚Äôm also really glad they brought back the main actress. She was phenomenal."
Deaf U,This seems incredibly niche.  Netflix going after almost ever demographic alive
Deaf U,That's interesting. I like to see how people with disabilities or unusual physiological situations live day to day. Like that show about a little people family.
Deaf U,The first girl from the left is for every demographic. She is going to be famous.
Deaf U,I haven't watched the Korean version but the Philippine version is a waste of time. 
Deaf U,"haven't watched the Philippine version. I only have watched the Indonesian version and Malay-speaking Malaysian version. those two versions are entertaining enough. Anyway, in your opinion, is that OK to have the American version of the show?"

Private Lives,"The Great British Bake Off would fit this description.

Watching a group of nice, normal people bake without any drama whatsoever would seem, to anyone who hasn't seen it, really boring. But I have to admit, there was something refreshing and soothing about it.

People in the UK love that show. I'm not in the UK and have to watch it from online sources and miss out on the hoopla that goes along with the show, but I really enjoy it. It's a guilty pleasure.

Also, in a very similar vein is The Great British Sewing Bee. Again, just a lovely group of people competing against each other to see who can win weekly sewing challenges.

As far as non-competitive reality shows, none come to mind. "
Private Lives,"My favorite reality show of all time is Frontier House, with Colonial House at second place. Sometimes the order is reversed :)

Of course the show itself is high concept which might not be what you are looking for, but it's ""real"" in the real sense."
Private Lives,"**The Amazing Race** has essentially zero production interaction. Racers are followed by a cameraman and a guy holding a microphone (who you almost never see) and all decisions are up to the racers in order how to progress, what transportation to take, what tasks to perform, etc. 

In the later series there is a bit of manufactured drama based on some of the ""talking head"" clips being edited in a way to make some teams seem like they hate each other, but overall everything is quite smooth and non-scripted. 

Oh! Another good one is **The Mole**, especially the Anderson Cooper seasons. One person is hired by production before the show begins and infiltrates the cast. Players have to perform and complete tasks in order to add prize money to the jackpot, while the Mole is attempting to fail those tasks without being discovered by the cast. Pretty great show, too."
Private Lives,what you're looking for is Terrace House. it ruined my life.
Private Lives,"It's survivor you want. Non-scripted, no in-game production involvement, personal and although it's edited to tell the story of how/why someone won (or occasionally, lost), it's 100% real. Some moments have quite the emotional punch and as the season progresses you start feeling like you know some of the players. 

This refers to the US format. AUS most recent season too.
Currently US Survivor is at season 33 ""GenX vs Millennials"" and with only 1 episode to go, and I believe it fits the description of what you seek. For me it felt the most personal in a while. Beware of the gimmick theme, it gets repetitive and somewhat insulting to my generation. Otherwise you can check survivor subreddit's spoiler-free ""What season should you watch next"" and  choose something from there. Keep in mind even though the base rules of the game haven't changed all that much besides a few major twists, different seasons have a very different taste.

Private Lives,"I was pretty impressed with 60 days in.  As someone who went through a pretty dark time in their life and spend some time in jail, it was surprisingly accurate.  Of course they still used overly dramatic music and definitely edited it in a way to make it seem crazier than it was, but overall it was pretty much what life is like inside a county jail."
Private Lives,"I'm not sure what you're looking for, based on your responses, actually exists. "
Private Lives,"Meerkat Manor. It's got politics, family drama, betrayel, exile, action, suspense, death, and it's all 100% real. It's so real that people complained when the crew let some meerkats die rather intervene with the nature they were documenting. "

Private Lives,"The US version of Big Brother has 24/7 live feeds so people can verify what really did happen and make sure it wasn't scripted.

In the first few seasons there's a strong focus on explaining technique to the audience.

Private Lives,"There's a show called ""Alone"" on history channel about people trying to survive alone in the wilderness. There is no production or camera crews (they film themselves using tripods, etc).

It's extremely compelling"
Private Lives,[deleted]
Private Lives,Unreal
Private Lives,"So you want to watch the news...

"
Private Lives,"Yeah come to think of it,I almost think of the same thing.Because in documentaries the people who are interviewed by the interviewer speaks real answers."
Private Lives,No drama whatsoever? Ask that to Iain. 
Private Lives,"> without any drama whatsoever

Have you somehow forgotten the BAKED.ALASKA.INCIDENT?

Seriously though, GBBO is awesome. It's the TV show equivalent of curling up in front of a fireplace with a cup of tea in your hand."
Private Lives,"LOL! Okay, okay... There was THAT ONE TIME when someone accidentally removed Iain's Baked Alaska out of the freezer..."
Private Lives,"You know you said about ""The Great British Bake Off"" is considered  refreshing and soothing especially with The Great British Sewing Bee. I guess i am okay with those shows


"
Private Lives,"I like how they're willing to help each other when needed it's a nice change. Everyone feels like they're being themselves instead of playing up a character.
"
Private Lives,"I loved Frontier House in its day, just the right amount of drama. Did you see it recently, some small channel re-aired it a few years ago with an extra segment that caught up with everyone.

I wish it were on streaming, somewhere. I'd love to see some of the others, which I missed when they aired."
Private Lives,"You know i heard two shows are considered experimental to know how modern people felt like if they live in the past.

And besides since they  aired on PBS which is a  Public broadcast  company and is funded by people I can give them an okay (I think)"
Private Lives,Both these two shows are considered cliche reality shows because the other show survivor has the similar effect.
Private Lives,"Yeah i heard about it from the news ,some say it is considered mundane that it was aired in netflix from japan.(the later seasons that is)"
Private Lives,">no in-game production involvement

I'm a huge Survivor fan, but this is in no way true. The mere existence of immunity idols and advantages proves that. Never mind Jeff goading people into reactions every tribal and at every challenge."
Private Lives,[deleted]
Private Lives,That's another reality cliche show.
Private Lives,"Yeah it may be a documentary series despite that it has some of the reality show elements in it 

"
Private Lives,Really what is it 
Private Lives,"Oh yeah I heard about that it's just ""documentary series"" in the form of any reality shows with meerkats. "
Private Lives,Good point
Private Lives,Thats just a cliche reality show why do you ask that.
Private Lives,"Skip it.
"
Private Lives,Well it might have a bit of reality tv concept like the man vs wild thing but i might give it a shot.
Private Lives,"Yeah,AIrport I heard about that ,It's a documentary about the lives of people working in different airport in th UK"
Private Lives,Um that's a behind the scenes show in the life of NBA stars but close enough.
Private Lives,"its a cliche reality show
"
Private Lives,"mmmm,I see but not interested."
Private Lives,"I rather not.Because it's a cliche reality show

"
Private Lives,"Yeah cops i heard about that show it's one of those Reality legal programming shows though it end up as one of those ""Trash tv"" shows
"
Private Lives,You know it feels like a ripoff of survivor
Private Lives,Okay that might make sense though it is part of the reality show cliche with people doing extreme stunts without professional skills also  they air on the network decay channel whose name is 'history'
Private Lives,I already said that.
Private Lives,Verry funny. |:(
Private Lives,Uh yeah because it's 'news'
Private Lives,"You might have made my life. I did not know about this extra segment.

I had kind of looked into it on my own at one point, and saw some updates on line of a couple of divorces. Some gorgeous photos of Nate and Kristen and their kids traveling the world.



"
Private Lives,"Actually, Amazing Race is very different from the other two. Though it features talking heads, the contestants are only interviewed during moments where either:

* Their partner is performing a task, so the other partner is interviewed
* Contestants are currently on a mode of transportation (taxi, plane, train, bus, boat) or waiting for transportation
* Contestants are between Pit Stops.

It's not like Survivor where the producers have direct influence over the game by influencing players (and, thus, can influence the way the vote). In Amazing Race, it's just a matter of getting to the mat at the end. You cannot influence any other team's race, so how you feel about another team has little to no impact on the race (until the later seasons, where they introduce the Yield). "
Private Lives,"Seriously watch Terrace House. The people are young but not deliberately immature, they have real conversations, there's awkwardness but never manufactured drama. It's amazing.

Also there is Arman"
Private Lives,"I believe that twists and advantages, as well as the format of the given season (final 2 vs final 3, timing of challenges etc) have to be predetermined before the game begins. Production cannot change those unless a situation requires them to (a medical evacuation as happened is s29 for example). That's what I meant by in-game production involvement.

At this point advantages/idols have been around for 20 seasons now, and can surprise no one. And their placement is random. They're meant to shake up the game in some direction, not to shape the outcome the way production wants it.

Tribal councels go on for *hours*. He proms them all for reactions, and they edit in the most interesting and relevant (to the story) parts. This isn't poker after all. They're supposed to talk. Jeff would never intentionally compromise anybody's game. If he had, survivor would have been long burying under a pile of lawsuits."
Private Lives,"But those are pretty randomly distributed aren't they? Immunity idols are either discovered or won, production doesn't really decide who gets them. "
Private Lives,"This isn't really as deceptive as it seems. In order for a response to end up in the final broadcast it has to be said in a way that the audience can understand, which often means removing [pronouns and vague terminology](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/57c3lm/production_was_really_pushing_the_millenials_vs/d8qs7r7/?context=3&st=iwgov5a6&sh=998ce09b)."
Private Lives,"They ask the contestants to incorporate the theme of the season and talk about strategy/social dynamics, not do product placement ads. On rare occasions they recreate/repeat only important stuff that the crew camera has failed to tape, like finding an immunity idol. I've also read they are careful about doing the press photos and rewards but otherwise they try not to interrupt."
Private Lives,"Super early seasons of the Real World maybe? Or American High, but that's kind of closer to the documentary side of things. "
Private Lives,It's amazing television and it's kind of a miracle that kind of thing just happens with meerkats naturally. 
Private Lives,That's what I thought too before I started watching!
Private Lives,"Seasons 5 and 6 are on netflix right now. The host, Steve Rinella does ""spot and stalk"" style hunting for many different types of animals in different locations. There's a few episodes where he's in south america that are fairly reality show-ish, where he goes deep into the jungle to hunt and fish with a native tribe"
Private Lives,That show is about as real as you're gonna get.
Private Lives,[deleted]
Private Lives,Yay! I was really happy to discover it when I rewatched it. It was nice to see people who were on reality TV go on to have boring normal lives.
Private Lives,"If you read around in interviews, the producers WILL influence the race, but only to keep it competitive...for example if one team is getting crazy far ahead, they might limit their flight options so that everyone else has a chance to catch up.  Or, if for whatever reason one team gets a flat on the way to the airport and they're in the middle of nowhere and the next flight is 24 hours later, they might delay filming for a day to keep the playing field even."
Private Lives,"Okay that kinda makes sense .Almost
"
Private Lives,"Okay i might give it a shot though.

"
Private Lives,"I'll give you that idols are random, but you can't say that Jeff doesn't outright manipulate the game himself as host."
Private Lives,Yeah before The real world  devolved to what we saw today so i'll pass at least american high is part of PBS
Private Lives,True.
Private Lives,"It's really an interesting concept. I watched a few episodes way back when this guy named Will Kirby was playing. 

This dude was a master at manipulating people. If I recall, he wasn't even good at any of the challenges."
Private Lives,"oh,i see :|

"
Private Lives,True
Private Lives,Hoenstly no
Private Lives,First season is the only one where they didn't influence the teams at all
Private Lives,"I think he just tries to churn up drama. I really don't think he's some psychological supergenius that can bend wills to his desires with a few questions or really predict what a question might prompt voting wise. 

Like half the game of Survivor is watching people fail again and again at social engineering the group. It's pretty clear that it's kind of a crapshoot with a lot of luck involved as far as people actually going the way someone predicts they will after speaking with them. 

"
Private Lives,Yeah that guy is seen as one of the legends of the game. He was playing the game before people realized there was a deeper game than just hanging out waiting to be eliminated.
Private Lives,He purposely threw competitions so he wasn't seen as a threat. 
Private Lives,[deleted]
Private Lives,"He's a skilled interviewer. An interviewer's job is to wring information out of someone until you get the quote you desire. On top of that he has access to hours and hours of footage of these people, specifically footage where they're revealing their plans in confessionals and alliance chats, so he always knows exactly what's happening. What's more he's dealing with people who are sleep deprived, exhausted, hungry, which makes it easier for him to get that information. This is all by design. 

It's no coincidence that in recent seasons tribal has become harder to predict, votes changing on the fly, crazier things happening. Because plans are more likely to get divulged thanks to whatever line of questioning Jeff has, plus we're basically living in an age of post-post strategy Survivor where you have to play hard and fast anyway, and those are things drummed up by how the show is structured.

Listen, like I said, I love the show, but I think it's naive to think that there isn't at least some manipulation in terms of what we wind up seeing."
Private Lives,"Okay that makes sense.

"
Private Lives,Wringing things out is a lot different than making people act the way you want on info.
Private Lives,"Unfortunately it's sometimes on in the break room at work, it's truly awful.

The way they dealt with covid filming was truly ridiculous."
Private Lives,Nahh you've gotta be trolling
Private Lives,"Funny enough, the only time I've seen it is when I'm waiting in the doctors."
Private Lives,"It's a day time soap. Made for people at home ill for work or the unemployed. 

It's also not the longest running anything."
Private Lives,"it's not that good, man. Not even my mum can stand it"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Wait what? Just three weeks ago I was told it wasn't at risk, what happened in the meantime? That's crazy"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This is a crazy show
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Everything I hear about this Zaslav guy is helping me understand why sports fans can develop such vendettas against shitty new coaches.

Edit - Sports fans have weighed in to suggest ""shitty new owners"" is a better comparison, and I am convinced by their argument."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Campion! Campion! Where are you!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Salim is my favorite actor on that show, probably one of my favorite actors of all time"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,The show is being cancelled? Why? Utterly ridiculous on the part of HBO if true. One of the best Sci fi show indeed.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,What acquisition? Did HBO get sold?
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Come on, can't end like that... literally WTF"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"it's getting cancelled? that such a bummer, really enjoyed it."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I love Raised By Wolves. I think the premise of the story is awesome. there's so much mystery and you're constantly learning new things about the world and the characters.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,What?! This is one of my favorite shows of the last five years!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Noooooooooo
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"What the fuck. I had no idea this was getting cancelled. Horrible decision. 

This show I randomly put on cause it looked interesting and was hooked from the first episode cause it's so fucking weird, but in a good way. Entirety of season 1, after every episode I was like wtf did I just watch; I can't wait to put on the next episode. 

If these are the kind of shows they're not willing to fund, then HBO content is about to get very formulaic and boring."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"They did this with Netflix as well. So many great shows axed as part of the the deal, which then fell through anyway"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Damn, this really bums me out. Legit one of the best sci Fi shows I have ever watched. Really hoping for the best"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"That's truly unfortunate. Raised by wolves is a gem in the current era of remakes and adaptations. 

Even if it isn't your favorite show of all time, letting ""risky"" TV shows with original premises die like this is bad for the sci-fi community at large. As much as I enjoy the seemingly endless amount of star wars/ star trek/marvel shows that come out these days, the reason they get produced is because of risk-aversion at the expense of quality and originality. We have to cherish the original productions."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Damn it, every time I get into something. Every time."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"The quality of season two dipped so hard in my opinion. Overuse of terrible cgi didn't help. Made it feel super campy. I loved season 1, but couldn't get into the second. Maybe ill have to try again just to support the show anyway."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I mean, it was ok."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This would be a huge loss :(
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Loving the energy here. Keep asking questions and pushing. Big love.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"i was disappointed with season 1 after a strong first half of the season

i haven't watched season 2 yet though"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"This show is amazing, this will be devistating"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Wow. This is news to me and not good news either. I loved RBW when I first discovered it and wouldn't want it to end after just two seasons.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I really enjoyed it but I understand why some viewers just might not have the patience/attention span for it or just think it's too out there. I think it's one of the coolest things I've seen in recent years though.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Raised by Wolves is excellent, one of my favorite shows of the last 5 years."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Whelp! Sadly there goes my interest in watching it.  Not going to invest time into it ff it's not getting a proper ending.

Not going to pull a Reaper on me."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I enjoyed the first season but became a little disinterested in the second.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Such a great show.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Lame - love this show
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Big fan of season 1. Fell off of season 2, it just got too messy for me. First season felt much more focused"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I enjoy the show. Hope to see a season 3.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This actually is one of the better scifi shows I‚Äôve seen the last decade. It‚Äôs pretty shortsighted to cancel.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Apple+ might be a good fit. They've shown a willingness to spend big on sci-fi with Severance and Foundation.

Amazon is likely looking for something to fill The Expanse shaped hole, and this would do it."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,My favorite current show other than Stranger Things and Severance.  I hope they at least give it another season to wrap things up.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I love Sci Fi, it's my favorite genre in movies, tv, books, etc.

I just couldn't get into Raised by Wolves. Blame my attention span maybe, but I just found it confusing. I watched the whole first season, then ending was bizarre. And I watched the first episode of the second season and I had no idea what was going on, so I did what I rarely so with shows that Ive started watching. I gave up."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I gotta say, i went with the hype and was excited for the show when it premiered, went in, looked great super cool, but it just failed to drag me in. And i guess since it¬¥s cancelld already im not the only one.
But i still cant pinpoint what it was that was missing."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Thanks for posting this.  I‚Äôm new to the series and just found I can watch Episode 1, Season 1 on their YouTube channel (for anyone else who‚Äôs curious)!  I‚Äôm going to have to get a HBO subscription just to watch the full season asap.

https://youtu.be/YIAIiw8UAfA"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I am truly struggling this show. I love the characters, the scenery but man, it just seems to move too slow for me. I keep going back to it. On S2E2 at the moment."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Please Sol help us
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,That's a real shame..... a really great and original sci-fi show that was nowhere near an end point.  I really hope it gets picked up.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Noooo. I'm halfway though rewatching. Don't leave me like this :(
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Thats a travesty its epic scifi and hilarious too.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I can't help but love how crazy and wild a ride this show is. It's really unpredictable, totally batshit, and a ton of fun. Plus lots of mythology and mysteries to unpack, in a really eerie and cool sci fi world. IIRC, the show creator said he had about 5 seasons worth of story.  This is a major disappointment. #RenewRaisedByWolves. I hope they can find a new home on another streaming service and finish telling their story. I mean, who wouldn't want to boast of having a Ridley Scott program? Seems like a mistake to cancel this ..."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I enjoyed it, but I have to be honest and say that it felt contrived and like the story was being written on the fly, even though I know it wasnt."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,It started off very promising. Then it turned out to be religious BS camouflaged as scifi by the end of the first season and I lost all interest.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"As much as I liked the aesthetic and potential, the first season just went off the rails in a way that I couldn't appreciate. Not that I don't like weird stuff, but this comes across as very ""stream-of-consciousness/Jackson-Pollock/throw-whatever-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks"" - esque, and I'm just not down for that. From what I've read about the second season it sounds very doubtful that there's a path to tying all this zaniness together into anything meaningful.

I'll support the movement for people that like the show, because I think unique sci-fi like this deserves to exist, but I won't be watching it.

&#x200B;

\*edit\*

Reading the Tweets, it looks like they have a fleshed out story. I'll come back and check it out after another season or two or after the series finishes (assuming it hangs around)."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This is literally the most imaginative show I‚Äôve seen. Why. Why is this being cancelled
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Bad news for HBO if they are cancelling creative shows like Raised by Wolves with great communities. I watch HBO for their great show library and if they are no longer interested in expanding it with original shows then I might cancel.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Oh no, i'm afraid the show is as good as dead. If HBO Max, a new streaming service in need of good concent and willing to experiment, is passing on this show, a show that's definitely not cheap to make, then who would pick it up? They trimmed down the budget for season 2 and if they're cancelling it it still didn't manage to perform well. I doubt Amazon will pick it up like The Expanse which didn't even get a proper, full final season."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Damn. I took a risk on this show because a friend recommended it to me and I was instantly hooked. Now it's just yet another HBO show that's left me hanging.

Barry is the only thing left on HBO that I enjoy."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,What the fuck?!?! WHY would they cancel it?! Raised by Wolves is some A++ killer sci-fi! It's so fucking good!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,What??? It's seriously the best sci-fi show currently.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This show was one of the two reasons i bought HBO. Big disappointment
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This show is seriously amazing! An acid trip worth taking!!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Season 1 was incredible. Season 2 had some really weird pacing and character choice issues- but was still good.  

I loved the introduction of the new character at the end of S2 though and really wanted to know more about her."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This just ruined my day. I adore this show.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Bye bye HBO!

You ruined GOT, let WestWorld go down the drain and now cancel this amazing show? Bye!"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"No no no.. I lost Final Space, I can't lose this too."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This is a shame.  I was watching Season 1 but it's a very slow boil up to the episodes I watched so I figured I'd let a few seasons come out.  It's a great show and don't understand the decision to pull the plug on it.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,why on earth would they cancel it? Probably high budget
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I love this show! Please don't get cancelled!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I've created a suggestion post on the Hulu community site for them to pick it up, please feel free to vote it up here: [https://community.hulu.com/s/idea/0875f000000dn4XAAQ/detail](https://community.hulu.com/s/idea/0875f000000dn4XAAQ/detail)"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,If it does get cancelled; I hope someone publishes the rest of the story so we can have an ending.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"It's not a remake, reboot or sequel and it's a bat shit crazy premise we've not really seen before. I love it!"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I love the show
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I would hope that another content provider sees the value in this show and will pick it up!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Noooo what?! That show is awesome!!!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,First half of season 1 maybe.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I'm torn between wanting to watch it now in the hope that my viewer numbers will increase the likelihood of renewal, or not watch it now because I know the story won't be finished."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"That fucking sux, I‚Äôm so invested in it"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Fuck. I waited for Season 2, loved it, and have had Season 3 as one of my most anticipated seasons of all of the series I watch.

Why would they cancel this!?"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Insane
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I'm absolutely pissed. This is the shit that made my wife and I leave Netflix after pulling this type of crap about cancelling shows after one or two seasons. I'm talking specifically about Santa Clarita Diet.

I convinced my wife to watch Raised By Wolves which I thank for being the spark that made her give sci fi a chance, first it was this show with many others to follow, we went on youtube and reddit to read and learn and analyze the show, the theories, then religious symbolism, etc; and all the time invested in this show is now is lost and wasted. 

I really started to believe that HBO Max was going to turn into the next big streamer. I really really hope that this show gets another chance or at least give the viewers some kind of closure."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I've enjoyed this and was looking forward to catching more.

When expanse was canned I wondered out loud about crowd sourcing the dollars to get the rest made.  Gauge interest, set a minimum share cost and let people chip in. Each member then owns as much of the risk and reward as they chose.

We're a long way from getting the most out of the internet."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,One of the best sci-fi shows I have ever seen. The scope and story are very well done. Hope we can finish on the screen!
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Such an amazing show.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I hope it finds a new home. Rough not to see how it was supposed to end.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Please don't cancel such a great show! I need to know what happens next, and what's happened  before. Such a great show, doesn't deserve to be cancelled."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Son of a bitch! They could have at least finished it
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Abubakar was great on the show, hope to see him on many other projects"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,[removed]
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,It's been years since I really got involved with a save a show campaign but I will be tweeting daily for this one.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"It was misery porn with no direction, typical late Ridley Scott."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"HBOMax completely won me over with quality.  I cancelled Netflix bc of the BS shows they started using their money on (reality shows and basic cable junk). 

If the merger means HBOMax is going the way of Netflix, I‚Äôm out.  

These companies need to know we fled Cable for a reason."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I'll be real, I watched most of the first season and it didn't really do it for me. Sorry a show you like is getting canceled."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Unpopular opinion here but, I felt it was written by a 13 year old boy who is really into sci-fi but his parents make him go to church."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"The first season was amazing, second season felt like it was partially running off that momentum. I'd love to see more, but I'd also like that more to feel less like random things happening."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I am fine by this, despite having seen both seasons. Some of the concepts were interesting, but it was going nowhere. It was basically just ""weird people going camping""."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Imo it had so much potensial, but it becane very corny and bad"
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"The first season was interesting. Second off the rails. Not surprising.

The loose rules of the acid lake comes to mind as an example.

They can chop west world while they're at it that third season was just a long winded I Robot."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Nooooooo
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This is an amazing show.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"I really enjoyed the first 2/3 or so of S1, was disappointed in the last couple of episodes, but figured they'd right the ship in S2.

S2 just wasn't good. I tried to force myself to keep watching but couldn't. It committed the worst sin a TV show or movie can make: it failed to be entertaining.

As others have said, it looked cheap, which also made it dull. More importantly, the main characters became a lot less interesting. I can't succinctly point out how, but I simply lost interest in them. The show felt meandering and played out; even formulaic."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Who the fuck cancels a scifi show by RIDLEY SCOTT. Fuck I hate WB. This is such a brilliant show.
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,This show is too crazy for the world
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Hate to say it but ppl should get Amazon to pick it up. They saved the expanse after all
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,"Shit was just starting to get real, even after the last times shit got real. What a waste."
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,Father and Mother were excellent
Do Do Sol Sol La La Sol,I couldn‚Äôt finish the first season. Best sci-fi according to who? Volkswagen?
To the Lake,Ira is the most hateworthy character I've seen in a while.
To the Lake,"Needs to be a sub for this.  Many of the characters are amazing and even more amazing, they are all shapes and sizes.  Very different to many us series, Russia is depicted as a harsh place, hopefully not as harsh as in the film.  In fact, I've heard the people there are friendly, who knows...

The English dub is awful, Russian original plus subtitles"
To the Lake,"I binged nearly half of it last night and plan to finish the rest this weekend. 

I'm also enjoying the soundtrack quite a bit too."
To the Lake,"Just finished the first episode, absolutely loved it, going to watch the second episode now.  I watched the dubbed trailer and friggin hated it lol am watching it in Russian with english subs and it adds so much more."
To the Lake,I love it since the first episode gymnasium scene where it's all colourful until with kids playing and then it went more grey as the military walked in. It was subtle but I loved it
To the Lake,Am I the only one that actually likes Ira?? Oops
To the Lake,Iras hot as fuck
To the Lake,"<no spoilers>

Finishing ep 5 now.  Like the show but damn this group is some of the dumbest and unluckiest people around.  The youngest kid makes every mistake imaginable and Ira gets even worse if you can believe it.  

No idea still about the zombies but it's kinda leaning more towards 28 days later vs TWD.

Edit: Finished the series, did not expect that ending.  Good show, good soundtrack, high quality but I stand by the group as a whole being both stupid and possibly cursed with bad luck.  About the only 2 I was even hoping lived were the blond daughter and the doctor.  I can't say any of their backgrounds were that unrealistic...just made them more unlikable (except for one of them)."
To the Lake,"Man I hated it. It's entertaining but it's a bunch of unlikeable assholes doing stupid and shitty things, like hell didn't everything start going badly like what, 1 hour after everything started? It took no fucking time for militias and gangs to form and start looting and raping. And then is problem after problem after problem, and more than half of those 100% their own fault.

But fuck Ira specially and in particular, the only one I might kind of like is Misha because it was hillarious how for half the series he was just a horny fuck in his quest for pussy. Go get her champ.

I did love the little town militia arc tho, best part out of everything."
To the Lake,"I watched the first episode.  Definitely a pretty stylistic show.  I liked it.  Plan on finishing it at some point, glad to hear it's good."
To the Lake,"At the 2nd episode, at the gas station scene, they used the 28 days later soundtrack. Anyone else noticed it?"
To the Lake,It's not like an American zombie series. Russia and specifically moscow has a completely different culture - it's actually more interesting because it's different from other shows from the western world that we are used to! Some topics they discuss and glimpses of their culture and differences between the generation - the way the show demonstrates some things that was left unspoken like how people lost religion dhring the USSR - is really new for me.
To the Lake,"I honestly didn't know I could hate a character as much as I hate Ira. Holy shit, I hate when writers do this, to make someone this unlikable is just not at all how it would be in real life, I mean.. she's a bitch in every single frame of the show. To be honest, she turned me off from the whole show."
To the Lake,"Dubs on anything on netflix sucks so bad.

ALWAYS watch original with subs, dub is just awful on everything except anime"
To the Lake,What's the song that always plays when the one kid thinks of having sex with Polina?
To the Lake,"Btw if anybody is googling and looking for answers if there will be a second season, There will be a second season;

 ""In an interview to Meduza, the producers of the series said that the scenario is ready, they will shoot season 2 in winter and release in late spring 2021.
Only clue they gave is that the group will be forced to find another place to hide. Some fans say that the Chinese may be interested in the lake itself (not the group) as ithe lake may be the source of infection (first scene of the series).""

These are words from the creators of the show."
To the Lake,Is it zombies? I saw the trailer but couldn't tell
To the Lake,Love the show but anton‚Äôs voice is like nails on a chalkboard to me. Anya has like zero redeeming qualities- but the kid‚Äôs voice makes me want to scream. Anyone else? Just me?
To the Lake,"It's soooo fucking good, it reminds me of The Walking Dead back when it wasn't shit. I hope that it gets renewed for atleast 2 more seasons."
To the Lake,"First half of the series is better than the second half. But the series is only 8 episodes in total, so by the time you get to the second half, there are only a few more episodes remaining, and you'll feel you might as well just finish the whole thing since you've come this far

One thing that I noticed - there's a distinct lack of characters wondering out loud if the US was behind it all. Because in a US series like this, there'll always be that one character who asks ""Is it the Russians? (or Chinese/North Koreans/whoever)"""
To the Lake,"couldn't help but feel like it was some rpg with random people appearing like there is no trust issues?

""car problems.. i'll tow it for you"" 

""car not starting? i'll fix it for you""

""an event has started in the area near you.. go towards the lights""

&#x200B;

i like my apocalypse scenarios tho.. bit of a lame cliffhanger on last episode. i was expecting like a horde of sick people. 

honestly of all the things they could of had as a cliffhanger.. i feel like a pack of wolves would of been more entertaining lol."
To the Lake,Who are these guys in all black some rogue military group?
To the Lake,I like the show but did anyone else notice that the soundtrack during the dramatic moments is straight up copied from the Inception soundtrack?
To the Lake,"I think it's okay, so far. But I'm watching the bathhouse scene. In a lot of shows that feature a pregnant woman, they rarely show much of the stomach uncovered. I kept wondering how they made her look so realistically pregnant."
To the Lake,If anyone wants a subreddit for it here it is : https://www.reddit.com/r/ToTheLakeSeries/
To the Lake,Just finished the first episode. It bothered me that some of the soundtrack is pretty blatantly copied from [28 Days Later](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXFBqNGugk4) (start at the 43:00 mark in episode 1 to hear) but I did enjoy it. Interesting story and characters so far.
To the Lake,"Such an amazing show! I binged it all in a couple days. I thought the show‚Äôs pacing and suspense were top notch. The characters were very diverse, but I ended up hating many of them, even the protagonist. I still felt like the plot and atmosphere did such a good job, that it made up for such some of the one-dimensional, predictable characters. 

Overall I would highly suggest."
To the Lake,It‚Äôs a great show.  Definitely worth watching
To the Lake,"Really enjoyed this series. Don't think I've watched a Russian show in god knows how long so it was cool to see some of the cultural aspects play out, like the reaction of the people living in smaller villagers to the main characters when they say they were from Moscow.

Looking forward to a season 2!"
To the Lake,"SEASON 2 IS COMING! Late 2021 or 22.   


[https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/when-will-season-2-of-to-the-lake-be-on-netflix/?utm\_source=spotim&utm\_medium=spotim\_recirculation](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/when-will-season-2-of-to-the-lake-be-on-netflix/?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_recirculation)"
To the Lake,Great show and loved the homage to Silence of the Lambs in episode 8 in the cabin. I‚Äôm really excited for season 2.
To the Lake,"I like it, not bad, but I am on episode 5 and why are the military killing civilians, they have been doing it since ep1 pretty much and there doesn't seem to be any reason why.. Will this get explained? What is the end game?"
To the Lake,R/tothelakeseries
To the Lake,"*Spoiler*

Can someone explain to me what are the freaking Chinese doing in Karelia?"
To the Lake,Does anyone know the name of the book this is based on?  Loved the first season! I don‚Äôt want to have to wait for Season 2 to find out what happens :)
To the Lake,"[SPOILER ALERT]

I just finished the last episode and I need answers üò≠
Do you have any theories about that ending? My mind is ü§Ø and all I can think about is how that Asian pilot saw the doctor if it was showed that Anya couldn't see a thing when she was sick"
To the Lake,"I didn‚Äôt mind the show that much but everyone is so stupid.. especially the Marina chick. She‚Äôs just worst, possibly worse than the lead in homeland if anyone has seen that. I‚Äôve never wanted a character to die so badly lol"
To the Lake,I hate the pregnant women she is insufferable
To the Lake,"Ay I dont know why but i just cant watch it, it is like black summer 2. 
Maybe it has somthing to do with how dumb and slow the desicion making of the characters is..
The whole show is just things happening to the families.
I dont understand the world building, is Russia gone crazy in a few days? or is it still atleast half good?
It's never shown.
What is the state of the government? 
It's never shown. 
(maybe it is shown later i stopped watching at ep. 5 but that would be to fucking late.) 
I saw good plotpoints and ideas but they where managed poorly.

my whole promblem is i ussually can watch ""ok"" or ""poorly"" written shows but here.. idk man.
I'm part russian so i watched it in russian dub.
i feel like this series tries so hard to be American or somthing idk.
But im glad to see some people can enjoy this series tho!"
To the Lake,I watched the first three episodes last night on Cinema HD before all streams suddenly disappeared. Never seen anything like it. No streams on the Kodi add-ons I have either. All very weird.
To the Lake,"Man, after watching the show I had a nightmare that I directed a show for Netfliz but Netflix gave it to the same post-production house as To The Lake, and I was scared shitless that they‚Äôre gonna fuck it up with repetitive music choices and editing"
To the Lake,"The show is ""ok"" but using the theme from 28 Days Later in a show that's not about Zombies ought to be criminal ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
To the Lake,"!!!(spoiler present)!!!

It started great and ended very boring and predictable, couldn't stand the last three episodes. 

It's basically a soap opera. One dramatic event after the other, sometimes two at the same time..No idea for storyline ? No matter, make something explode out of nowhere. 

I joke to my wife that the Chinese army would arrive when we were laughing at how melodramatic the show was and...guess what ? They did. üòí. 

I don't understand why people are all over this show but then again, I never understood why people like soap operas so whatever, to each their own.


!!!(spoiler present)!!!"
To the Lake,"So im halfway to episode 5 and i feel like everyone is happy but I have to say that every single girl in the show acts so against survival that it took me out of the experience. Like every single one of them needed to be struck unconscious for their own good. I heard this was written by a woman, which surprised me because it had every single ""women are too emotional to be useful"" trope in the book.

I hope everyone died because they deserve to. Sergei for getting his first wife and then allowing the betrayer back into the group who continuously does shady shit. The kid for being a kid and ""i dont wanna do things cause im upset"" kid go fuck yourself the entire country is dying (i hate this trope as well). Every woman for not being able to think rationally to get through a situation and letting themselves get overwhelmed emotionally and then also trying to be in charge in an emotional frenzy. Hell I was only rooting for Mika (the autistic teen) but he was gettng used by the teen girl (which i agree with teens do stupid shit and even then they acted in their own self survival better than the adults).

This got more ranty than I envisioned but its so pervasive throughout the survival genre that it frustrates me and it was so egregious in this show"
To the Lake,I'm super late to this thread but God damn. I loved it at the start but as it goes on its like I can see second by second these people losing their common sense and turning into idiots.
To the Lake,I am watching it too and it's infuriating how many stupid mistakes the group makes and the boring conversations and tasks they must do to get back on the fucking road.
To the Lake,"It's certainly well executed.   Great shots.   Terrific acting.   I  rewatched some scenes with the English dubbed audio (where the actors say Eye-rah for Ira, as if its a Jewish man, instead of EE-rah, short for Irina, as well as other silly stuff) to find the right emphasis on some lines (reading subtitles can make one lose the ..ha...subtle...emotions or inflections)

Though I have to say, the whole thing seems a bit bound up by hewing to current Russian state propaganda concerning the sanctity of marriage, the duty of men and women to make babies, and the strong duality of the male and the female.   Not a lot of diversity or divergency from the stereotypes.

!!EDIT MAYBE SOME SPOILERS BELOW!!:  just watched the last episode....yeah....i gotta say it reads pretty much as state propaganda.  Marriage as a cure-all.   The scheming psychologist gets her comeuppance.   And the last shot...which i won't divulge here."
To the Lake,This kid Anton is the worst. I‚Äôm about to schedule a vasectomy
To the Lake,[deleted]
To the Lake,hated this one terrible unlikeable characters bad acting bad screenplay felt excessively conceded just a mess
To the Lake,"Is it just me, or does ambulance guy look just like Roger Daltrey?"
To the Lake,"Wait a minute, people actually like this show? All of the characters are terrible, and every time that music starts playing when Misha looks at Polina I just want to slam my head into a brick wall. I made it 4 episodes in and that's about all I can handle."
To the Lake,"Sorry to Necro your thread but shocked on Ira hate in this thread. Ira is honest at least, Sergey is the one I take issue with especially in episodes 5-7."
To the Lake,Ugh. They ruined what was going to be a perfect ending to the show with a last-minute complication. I guess they wanted to create a cliffhanger for the next season. This is why I generally prefer movies‚Äîthey have a planned ending.
To the Lake,I absolutely love this show. I didn't know a Russian show could be this good. Is there going to be a season 2?
To the Lake,Ira has every right to be a bitch. Any woman that goes after married men are disgusting! honestly her and Sergey deserve each other! Anyone who can't understand why she's a bitch obviously never been done dirty or has no understanding for morals.  Relationships that start out like that are miserable. When he was about to die he was dreaming about Ira. You can never trust anyone who has no balls to end a marriage before sleeping with someone! Especially never trust a person who goes for a married or person in a relationship!
To the Lake,"Just saying, polinka could hit me up anyday of the week üòé"
To the Lake,The hateworthy character for me is Anya for going out of her oath and hooking up with a client going to couples therapy. Also her having no regard for the other kid in episode 5 further proves her type of character.
To the Lake,"She only has bitch mode on, all the goddamn time."
To the Lake,"So true, she is so annoying, however (no big spoilers) but closer to the end it‚Äôs more obvious that all women in group have some issues. 

What‚Äôs funny is that this is based on a book written by a woman, otherwise I can even imagine that some even would have accused authors in misogyny."
To the Lake,I firmly believe Marina is the most annoying character. Hands down. Most annoying character I‚Äôve watched in a long time. All she did was whine and then yes something terrible happened to her. But before the terrible thing she was AWFUL
To the Lake,"YESSSS!

I Googled: to the lake TV show Ira is a b!tch 

That's how I landed here, lmao!!"
To the Lake,"I'm a few episodes in and loving it.

But man, poor Sergey. Getting yelled at by somebody for every decision he makes. None of them give him a moment to breathe to figure shit out. I can definitely relate so it's pretty hard to see the guy suffer when he's trying to do right by everybody."
To the Lake,All of her bitchiness was pretty justifiable imo. She got cheated on and then was stuck in a  stressful survival situation with her ex AND the other woman.
To the Lake,By ‚Äúin a while‚Äù i hope you mean of all time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a character I‚Äôve hated more. She is literally the worst lol
To the Lake,I stopped watching just to see if people hate her as much as I do. Bitch needs to get her priorities straight instead of flaunting around like a fucking woe is me ostrich
To the Lake,"""Ira"" also means ""wrath"" in Spanish, which seems kind of fitting for this character.

Also, I'm rooting for a Russian zombie show made entirely with dash cams."
To the Lake,It‚Äôs harsh like that.
To the Lake,the subs have bad translations too
To the Lake,"The dub is shite. I've switched over to original with titles, much better. I really struggle with dubbing when it is so bad."
To the Lake,Like how awful? Completely ruins the story or just doesn't sound good?
To the Lake,"Well, they stole it from Danny Boyle"
To the Lake,"Oh god, I found the soundtrack to be absolutely horrible."
To the Lake,"I am lucky to be fluent in Russian and oh god did I enjoy the show. I just read that there‚Äôs no talk about the second season but how so with that ending??? Also, that timing with the covid hitting. Crazy coincidence"
To the Lake,"Yeah the dubbed version is hilarious.  The most serious scenes, defanged and neutered.   I love/am puzzled by the choice that they made to pronounce the names of Ira in the dubbed version as EYE-rah, a male name in the West.   Also, I found the the entire story draped in a sort of Christian/monogamy/male-female dogma that is popular in Putin's Russia currently."
To the Lake,Just saw that scene right now !
To the Lake,"There was a consistency to her ferocity that was quite inspiring. Could see it getting tiring quick if you were Sergei, mind."
To the Lake,She had more balls than Sergey. Sergey was pathetic
To the Lake,yeah but also a bitch
To the Lake,"The group was dumb from episode 1, which is where i‚Äôm stopping. They knew the violent, murderous gang was going to come back so why did they take their sweet time packing and getting coats for Ira? Come on! Hurry and with a sense of urgency dummies!"
To the Lake,The bed scene right?!?
To the Lake,"Ahah at episode 5 too but and how can these people survive being so dumb and slow in making decisions :)

Love the show tho (and I cant stand Ira obvi)"
To the Lake,"Spot on on most of your comments.

Is Russia really that fucked that people start killing each other day 2 of the epidemic?"
To the Lake,Hated it but watched it all uh?
To the Lake,Ep 3 in the house  had the Interstellar soundtrack also.
To the Lake,"I instantly recognized it. I was thinking whoa, are the people who made this show the same as 28 days later?"
To the Lake,"We never lost our religiosity, we just switched our prayers from Saints to the members of the Central Committee of the Party. We really lost it only after 1991 crash."
To the Lake,"Wow, I'm on episode 7 and don't hate her.  Not sure where the ira hate is coming from."
To the Lake,"One dimensional character aggravated by overreacting is annoying and boring to watch.

Not sure who to blame more: writers, director or actress."
To the Lake,"It's so funny and cheesy, makes me cringe lol"
To the Lake,"It‚Äôs Marilyn Monroe - Teach me, Tiger"
To the Lake,Would like to know also!!!
To the Lake,[April Stevens ‚Äì Teach Me Tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNj0YuOlPEY)
To the Lake,And they drank water from the lake.
To the Lake,"It's not zombies, more like hardcore Ebola"
To the Lake,[deleted]
To the Lake,the focus is not on the zombies but on the non-zombies
To the Lake,I've just finished the first episode and yeah def zombie vibe but not like twd zombies.
To the Lake,"I've seen the entire thing, it is zombies. 


Spoiler 

Theres a part in which infected are eating human flesh so it's either zombies or cannibals"
To the Lake,"Are you watching the show in english dubbed? 
Because the dubbed voice made me want to fly to russia and slap the kid"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Holy shit, thats a long wait"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Was expecting fall 2023 so this nice
Jujutsu Kaisen,This was a great arc so I‚Äôm super hyped.
Jujutsu Kaisen,Hyped af for more of this show
Jujutsu Kaisen,Mappa has like a bajillion animes being worked on at the moment. Their animators aren't gonna see their families for the next several years
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Thought the same but they're doing up to the Shibuya Arc and it'll be a 6 month run, so makes sense.

The SA is going to be insane."
Jujutsu Kaisen,It will come in no time. I was expecting Fall 2023 in fact.
Jujutsu Kaisen,"yeah, that is tru, i understand completely, its stressful for them. im still excited for vinland s2 tho"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"That's ideal

They need to do the shibuya arc right"
Jujutsu Kaisen,About time
Jujutsu Kaisen,"The next few arcs, that I would assume a second season would cover, are pretty top tier in my opinion. Like I was impressed with season 1 but it wasn't like my favorite anime. Read the manga and now I'm a huge fan."
Jujutsu Kaisen,Wait it didnt alrdy?
Jujutsu Kaisen,It was one of the few shonen that I liked. Hope it doesn't go MHA way.
Jujutsu Kaisen,Purple
Jujutsu Kaisen,"This is the only anime series I have ever watched, and I was shocked to learn there wasn‚Äôt a second season. Why did this take so long?"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Caught up on AoT in 5 days. Now watching Demon Slayer to fill in the waiting periods. Likely give this a shot when season 1 is fully dubbed
Jujutsu Kaisen,[removed]
Jujutsu Kaisen,This show isn‚Äôt very good but the animation and fight scenes are cool and well done.
Jujutsu Kaisen,PEAK FICTION
Jujutsu Kaisen,Finally some good news
Jujutsu Kaisen,Hidden Inventory Hype!!
Jujutsu Kaisen,Shibuya roll call
Jujutsu Kaisen,Nope only S1 and a movie
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Seriously I went from loving MHA to absolutely not caring at all, it was a real shame. The first season of this was absolutely amazing so here‚Äôs hoping!"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I‚Äôm caught up on the manga and this season is gonna be unreal. The arc it covers is widely regarded as one of the best in shounen already, even outside of the main fanbase."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"It‚Äôs much, much, much (x1000000) better than MHA."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"trust me, not slowing down any time yet!"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Anime studios are often overworked, and MAPPA (the studio producing JJK) has had their plate full for years. So it was probably a scheduling issue more than anything else."
Jujutsu Kaisen,The 1st season is pretty new it aired between 20 and 21. One punch man was another super popular one and that didn‚Äôt get a second season for years after the first one.
Jujutsu Kaisen,"it aired less then a year ago, nothing strange."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"it takes a bit of time before they offical announce a new Season. idk why but if its rly popular u can guess it will take a new Season in the future. They might have waited to announce it because they wanted people to watch the JJK Prequel Movie. Demon Slayer did a similar thing, tho it was a direct sequel where s1 ended instead of a prequel. If u liked Jujutsu Kaisen I recommand u also to check out Demon Slayer. They are both Pretty high Quality Animes."
Jujutsu Kaisen,It's already fully dubbed
Jujutsu Kaisen,Dubbed???
Jujutsu Kaisen,Demon slayer today bouts go NUTS watching it starting now
Jujutsu Kaisen,"No it‚Äòs just fine. JJK is peak visual fidelity compared to most shows airing these days, anime studios are also overworking their animators a lot and I‚Äòd rather have a better work environment for the people working on a show and wait longer in return."
Jujutsu Kaisen,I appreciate this
Jujutsu Kaisen,My name is Kevin
Jujutsu Kaisen,My name yuji and I üò≥
Jujutsu Kaisen,"what's the movie based on?

Idk much about the manga but loved the first season and was hoping for no 2 but now I might read it."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Season 2's going to cover the best arc of the manga, so there's no risk of that happening"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Yeah, I haven‚Äôt even watched season 5 yet, which is crazy because I was super into the show up through season 3. I‚Äôve never fallen out of love with a show so quickly."
Jujutsu Kaisen,What's MHA? My Hero Academia? And what's wrong with it?
Jujutsu Kaisen,Never watched MHA but this is how I felt about Bleach years ago
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Yeah, loved season 1 but all characters are one dimensional garbage characters and when season 2 slowed down to show their one dimensional trash personalities I just tuned off and have no idea what happened to the show now"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Dropped the show after the S4 Gentle criminal arc. Was just bored. Not hearing positive stuff about the show either.
Jujutsu Kaisen,is it because of the community behind it? because fuck that weird shit tbh
Jujutsu Kaisen,Well that‚Äôs definitely awesome to hear.
Jujutsu Kaisen,">  The arc it covers is widely regarded as one of the best in shounen already, even outside of the main fanbase.

You're the only person I've ever heard say best in shonen. It's really good but nowhere near the best in shonen. That's an insanely bold claim. Especially to claim non JJK fans say that too."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I think that's a bit much, I'm a JJK fan but Shibuya was better and the Culling Game arc is shaping up to be as good if not better.

It's a good arc and better than a lot but it's first I've seen regarding it one of best in Shonen."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"MHA peaked at United States of Smash, should have ended there tbh"
Jujutsu Kaisen," Doing JJK, God of High School, Attack on Titan season 4, and Chainsaw man is definitely trying to get their animators dead from stress and overwork. The quality is absolutely ridiculous and deadlines always looming."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Sorry, I understand why it wasn‚Äôt rolled out already, but when I saw only one season available I searched around and read that season 2 hadn‚Äôt got a greenlight for production. It‚Äôs a great story and I was surprised multiple seasons weren‚Äôt guaranteed all along."
Jujutsu Kaisen,Yeah. Anything animated I watch in English. Anything live action I watch subbed
Jujutsu Kaisen,I‚Äôm only about 8 episodes into DS. Story isn‚Äôt as great sadly but the fight scenes are mint
Jujutsu Kaisen,That is my name
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Volume 0 I believe, didnt get to watch it yet"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"It's a prequel to S1 that takes place (I think) a year earlier? The event it's based around is referenced obliquely in the early parts of S1 and it follows Yuta, another Jujutsu High student who hasn't shown up yet officially but is an important character later on."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Yes it is and the anime slowed down to a snails pace in my opinion. Honestly I know I should care more about the side characters but the show just doesn‚Äôt give me enough to care about though and sometimes the episodes are so self contained they feel like filler even though it‚Äôs not. I have faith it gets back on track though. 

I also didn‚Äôt like MVA at all sadly."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Yeah. I feel like the story started out strong but now in both the manga and anime it‚Äôs somehow become both meandering and rushed. The series also doesn‚Äôt really develop any of the side characters but the author keeps adding new ones. Not to mention the general awfulness of how all of the female characters are treated in the series. For example, Uraraka should be able to solo most of the characters in the series with her quirk, but she doesn‚Äôt because ‚Äúplot reasons‚Äù. She‚Äôs basically just reduced to Deku‚Äôs hype-women and kinda love interest."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I still enjoy the show, but it's become a bit boring. In some episodes of the latest season it feels like barely anything happens. The animation also doesn't look as great as it used to. For sure there's some absolutely standout scenes, but ever since they decided to make movies for the show the latter's overall animation went down a bit. It doesn't help that the scenery is kind of dull and grey."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Pacing is awful. They turned one of the shortest,most boring arcs into an entire half-season that was a slog to get through and one of the most interesting arcs into a 5-episode footnote."
Jujutsu Kaisen,MHA and Bleach are a good comparison. Both started out super strong and only went down from there.
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I mean, have you seen it mentioned in any anime subs? If you ever see mention of it, it‚Äôs constantly praised and compared to the Chimera Ant arc, which is considered peak shounen. I didn‚Äôt say non-fans, I just meant casual fans, not people keeping up weekly and the like. Just look at the thread in r/anime about it. 

 It‚Äôll speak for itself when it comes out, but I know it‚Äôs gonna end up being an all timer arc once it‚Äôs released."
Jujutsu Kaisen,Bro said one of the best and you are purposely claiming he said something he didn‚Äôt to fit your narrative lol
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Really? Any time I‚Äôve seen it been mentioned in different subs it gets nothing but praise. A lot of comparisons to Chimera Ant arc. I think that‚Äôs closer to the Culling Games, but the consensus I‚Äôve seen is that it‚Äôs a highly regarded arc in a lot of shounen fandoms. Maybe I‚Äôm just looking in all the right spots I guess."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Can you recommend a casual viewer some good television anime? I loove Attack On Titan (well i do not like the new animations). HunterxHunter is okay but i did not finish it although i was episode 100 or so‚Ä¶ full metal alchemist was childish? Dont know. Cowboy bebop is also okay. That were all my animes besides DBZ lol

Would appreciate some tips"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"It definitely should have ended before the left the academy, it‚Äôs literally in the fucking title?"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Because they were working and advertising the movie that just came out in Japan at the end of December so they wouldn‚Äôt announce season 2 until that would be finished.
Jujutsu Kaisen,"1. They have to make sure the anime is worth it. So after the first season if it didn‚Äôt do well and didn‚Äôt boost manga sales then it won‚Äôt be greenlit for a sequel 

2. The movie as stated

3. Many studios have other projects, while I can‚Äôt say for this studio, they may have been working on something else and had to hold off on the second season 

4. Even if they plan on a second season, announcing too early kills all hype for it. I‚Äôd almost argue that it‚Äôs still too early and they could‚Äôve waited another couple months."
Jujutsu Kaisen,Also gotta remember the manga is still on going. In the past a lot of popular shounen (teen boy demographic) manga had their anime catch up super fast which resulted in the anime creating entire seasons of straight filler episodes that weren't in the manga. It still occurs but generally they try and steer clear of it these days.
Jujutsu Kaisen,"It‚Äôs totally subjective, of course, but man do I prefer subbed anime to dubbed. The Japanese VA‚Äôs are almost always way more into it, and any ‚Äúbad acting‚Äù is masked by it being a language I don‚Äôt understand. Not to mention, the original lines are changed for dubbed ‚Äî sometimes dramatically ‚Äî in order to match what has been animated. Just seems like a suboptimal way to view the genre.

There are a few exceptions, like DBZ, MHA and Mob Psycho, but that‚Äôs mainly due to a few specific English VA‚Äôs that are very talented."
Jujutsu Kaisen,For me it‚Äôs all about the animation. The story isn‚Äôt super great but the villains get cooler and the animation is era defining
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Unfortunately, you quickly realize they only care about Izuku, Bakugo and Shoko. Everyone else is basically useless in comparison and its made very clear."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I really had to crank out a few, Really had to force myself to watch all the times it‚Äôs a group of students Vs another in some training thing"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Season 4 was pretty slow. Season 5 I enjoyed the angle they went with and started getting hyped again. Not to the level of Season 3 but still really good
Jujutsu Kaisen,"That‚Äôs just like, your opinion man"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"That's a bummer. I watched the first season awhile back and always wanted to catch up cause I like the characters.. But man maybe it's cause I'm older but I have absolutely no interest in these anime series that plan to go on into infinite until ratings are in the ground. 

I love me some 26 episode *series* anime."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"> Not to mention the general awfulness of how all of the female characters are treated in the series.

Yes! The way women are handled in this series is atrocious. You remember when the Big 3 were introduced as the strongest students in the school? It might as well be called the Big 2 because Nejire has basically done nothing. I love how the other 2 got multi-chapter fights and focus in the Overhaul arc...while Nejire's biggest accomplishments are an offscreen ""let's lump all of the female fighters together"" group fight and winning a beauty pageant.

>She‚Äôs basically just reduced to Deku‚Äôs hype-women and kinda love interest.

The second that Aoyama randomly said ""You have a crush on Deku, don't you?"" in the middle of their exam, Ochako's character plummeted off a cliff."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"All of the female characters have great set-up for complex character building stuff, but it almost never gets addressed. It's like, you went to all the effort of coming up with motivations for these characters, can we see that developed please? Oh okay, we need to save screen time for the grapist."
Jujutsu Kaisen,Talking about the little girl getting kidnapped vs the school festival?
Jujutsu Kaisen,"not at all

Bleach started out strong and went of a cliff like 10 to 0 in just a few months

its not a good comparison toe mha that slowly become bad over years."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"Ooh that's really high praise, especially since JJK's author was heavily inspired by HunterxHunter when he first made the series."
Jujutsu Kaisen,I've never seen it mentioned and I'm a regular at r/manga. I'm mean I've seen the HxH comparison (Mostly on how the author writes his power system)  and I love the arc but I never seen the peak shounen comment. Also don't agree since Chainsaw Man was running around the same. That's probably the best Shounen manga I have read in years.
Jujutsu Kaisen,Chimera Ant is not peak shonen...
Jujutsu Kaisen,Making comparisons to Chimera Ant arc is some major business.
Jujutsu Kaisen,"HxH is worth it but you have to stick with it to the Chimera Arc, though it seems you're already half way through it and if you're not hooked already then it's cool, same with FMA. 

For more casual viewers, One Punch Man is pretty easy to follow though the 2nd season changes studios and there's a drop off in quality.

Mob Psycho 100 season 2 is one of the best seasons I've seen of any anime. If you like what you see in season 1, you'll be blown away in season 2.

Run with the Wind is also a very nice running themed anime that's big on character development and a surprisingly heartfelt ending.

Death Note if you haven't already seen it and the Kaiji series if you like psychological shows.

Not sure what else without more information, maybe Devil Man Crybaby but it is a bit dark."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I was wholly unaware, but that makes sense. I‚Äôll admit that I didn‚Äôt know the movie was coming, but after the trailer and some reading will look forward to that as well!!  Thank you internet stranger."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"The AoT dubbed Actors are arguably better tbh. Watched with both. The English VA for Eren, Erwin, Sasha and Levi are üëåüèª"
Jujutsu Kaisen,"TCB is a bit gimmicky lol. Also, Tanjiro keeps exhausted then proceeds to carry a big ass box with Nezuko inside it lol."
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I'm sorry.  Are you speaking ill of our cheeselord, Aoyama?

Just kidding.  You're absolutely right."
Jujutsu Kaisen,Isn't that how every ensemble anime works though? That there's a core group of useful characters that are horribly overpowered with a larger group of gimmicky ones on the periphery?
Jujutsu Kaisen,The author really dropped the ball with Tsuyu. She became so uninteresting despite early on becoming a popular character.
Jujutsu Kaisen,">and Shoko

Well duh. How can you not like Komi?"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Oh absolutely! I‚Äôm big on that too that‚Äôs why I never said it sucks or anything just that I didn‚Äôt like it.
Jujutsu Kaisen,No I'm talking about the battles between the two classes that should have been six or seven episodes max that they stretched out into 14 vs My Villain Academia that deserved that 15 and got 5.
Jujutsu Kaisen,I can see the influences there
Jujutsu Kaisen,I absolutely hated the Chimera Ant arc.  The slowest arc with the worst characters involved. Really the only good part of the arc is the reward at the end for having to sit through the rest of it
Jujutsu Kaisen,"I‚Äôm excited for the reactions because I know season 1 was pretty standard shounen, but it switches things up a ton directly after season 1 basically. The stakes and format are really reminiscent of that arc. A lot of moving parts and consequences in Shibuya"
Jujutsu Kaisen,Only thing I dislike about the dub is that they also dubbed the titan roars. It sounds so friggin weird in the dub
Jujutsu Kaisen,Still holding out hope they kill him

Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"The BMW people talk about how they still get residuals today. They were just joking about getting another 9¬¢ check.

They actually just had an episode where they talked about it.  They got different amounts depending on where it aired."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"All I know is Jaleel White came up with a brand of weed called ""Did I Do That"" and got rich again."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Absolutely, and even worse."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I don't have any specific knowledge to contribute, but there's a bit of a chicken and egg thing here.  Those shows pay non-stop because they're inexpensive to run. If the contracts were better negotiated, something else would be playing in their place."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Aren‚Äôt these agreements governed by union contracts?  And don‚Äôt they have professional agents negotiating on their behalf?
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Jodi Sweetin was on Steve-O‚Äôs podcast and briefly talked about her Full House residuals; it‚Äôs enough to pay a bill a month, but nothing else. She also talked about how Netflix pays out on their shows as well. The whole interview is really worth checking out."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"It's Hollywood accounting.  According to CBS, ""Star Trek"" has yet to make a profit."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"If you get more on the back end, you get less on the front end."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"As actors, I think they caught a huge break. If they got screwed, they should talk to their legal guardians. There are industry groups and unions that do nothing but make sure that their members get a fair deal. If they didn't use those, their guardians should be sued."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,It‚Äôs the Nickelodeon and Disney kids that don‚Äôt get residuals.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Lol isn‚Äôt it called purple urkel?
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"There is much truth to that. That is why I Love Lucy and Andy Griffith and many black and white sitcoms were a staple of tv reruns in the 70, 80's and 90's ,and many sitcoms post 1970 quickly faded after 1st run syndication. The agreement of the 1970 SAG strike excluded pre 1970 shows from residual pay for performers. Ironically we are seeing something similiar play out in real time,where streaming Networks to save money will start cutting recent shows  but back catalog shows will be fine because per the terms of contracts of most contracts signed 15-20 years ago they don't have to give them any residuals for streaming even if a show is popular because streaming did not exist."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"They're supposed to be, but if the show is owned by (for example) Disney, and they sell it to ABC affiliates for $1.  What percentage of that goes to the actors?  Zilch."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,It‚Äôs weird I never really thought about it but I feel like millennials and older have knowledge of these old shows that the younger people haven‚Äôt been exposed to.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"You'd be surprised perhaps, the younger kids are doing this thing where they get really into older media or time periods and make me feel OLD for not being into the stuff my parents were. Things kinda just work their way back in cycles, like clothing trends or hairstyles."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Blame Lord Byron. In TV we've recently moved away from Don Draper and Walter White to Ted Lassos but I think they are all cool.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"There was an annoying wave of the Dickhead Genius subgenre of this after the success of House, and I'm glad it fizzled out. Halt and Catch Fire outgrew it live, which was fun and a big part of its sudden S2 glow up."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Give some examples
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,It helps if he's a hot guy.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Are they? You are the first I have seen to be suggesting that this is the case.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,You can thank Lord Byron for that. Storied on YouTube has a great short video on the Byronic hero.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Of course they are. Angel from Buffy, Jesse from Gilmore Girls. That's such a common trope."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,It may be but it is not one that ever rises to my conciousness. I just watch good TV with good actors. I guess from my perspective it‚Äôs more about the story as a whole :)
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I really enjoyed season one, so when it comes to reading reviews about season 2 I never even thought to read any, in fact seeing this post on reddit is the first I‚Äôve heard about bad reviews..

Anyway as far as I‚Äôm concerned season 2 has carried on where season 1 ended, I‚Äôm still enjoying it and while I love to binge a whole series wastching it weekly gives me something to look forward to."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"are people really review bombing because of a weekly release

like it's not even political nonsense it's because you don't get it all at once?"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Really enjoying S2 so far.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Hell hath no fury like a mildly inconvenienced American.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"One of my friends loved the first season but was out off by the reviews. Didn't read em, just heard it was getting bombed and has decided to stop watching. So dumb."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,People should just have a Fresca and chill out.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Imagine liking something so much that you freak out about not getting it all at once so you try to get it cancelled. What kind of logic is that? This world is full of straight immature children.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,[deleted]
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,I‚Äôve watched the first four of this season and I liked it. I don‚Äôt get the bad feedback. Am I dense or something?
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Rest assured, true believers, the quality of season 2 of The Boys and its diabolical sensibilities live up to its phenomenal first season.

This is the salt of baby tears."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Personally, I‚Äôm fine with the weekly schedule. Sure, I‚Äôd happily binge the entire season this weekend if I could, but I‚Äôm not going to act like a spoiled brat, over not getting all the episodes at once. And hey, at least I have something to look forward to each week, and discuss with other people, instead of this season being completely forgotten after one week."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Well the problem here, is changing the model in between season was a mistake  no matter how you look at it. It‚Äôs not fair to get review bombed but if you  released your most popular show in a certain way the first time around then suddenly change you gonna get backlash."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,I just started today and was wondering why the fuck it was only 2.5 starts.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Season two is great so far.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Season 2 is just as good if not better than the first.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"This is part of the deal with paying for streaming services. If we wanted cable, we would watch that. I‚Äôm not for review bombing. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what reviews are for. But there‚Äôs no other recourse for customers who are unsatisfied other than canceling their service."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"If Amazon did weekly releases for all their original content I would get it.  But to change how they releases for this one show is BS.  I will not give it a bad review because of that but I will wait and binge it when season two is fully out.  I enjoy binging shows, I prefer streaming because of this fact."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I just wished they had established a weekly release like, six months ago. Instead, tons of people all got geared up to watch it only to find out it was a weekly release.

I stopped watching until October after watching the first episode, and I'm not afraid to admit that I assumed the whole season was out like... literally every other Amazon original release. 

The negative reviews aren't about the show itself, it's about Amazon's complete bungling of marketing that left so many people thinking it was going to drop in full. Part of the reason I like to watch shows on streaming services is because I *don't* have to put up with weekly releases. I don't think it's unfair at all for people to leave a bad review for that reason."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I don't understand why people care about this so much. User ratings have been a joke for ages where people rate 1 or 10 stars for the stupidest reasons. People constantly review bomb stuff now and I doubt that many people trust user reviews more than critics and youtubers and whatnot. It's not like The Boys is going bankrupt from kids giving them a bad rating, just let them be."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"But isn't the release format at part of the show? I mean, if people are upset about the weekly release that is a valid issue. You can love  a show but be pissed about how its released. The shows release schedule cant be separated from the show"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I like how the people here are acting like the viewers are spoiled for trying to avoid a return to cable era formatting, not the multi billion dollar corporation attempting to squeeze a few more months subscription money out of us. Nah it‚Äôs the people paying for a product that are entitled by leaving reviews that accurately reflect their experiences with the distribution."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Review Bomb is one of the ways that the fans can make their voices heard. Nobody asked for weekly episode.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"At first I was instantly against this review bombing but after reading a few pro comments and thinking about it, I can see why people are doing it and I somewhat agree with them. I dont do it but they feel like there is no other way to tell amazon how much they hate the release schedule."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I don't see what the big deal is. I watched the first episode, saw that they were not releasing them all at once and stopped watching. I will watch them all when they are all available. If you want to watch it weekly good for you, if you want to binge it just wait a little longer."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"There are lots of great shows I've binged in a week or two on Netflix.   


And I say without much doubt, I don't really remember most of them that well.   


I think the weekly release schedule gives you time to think & reflect on what happened & something to look forward to each week as well."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"So they review bomb a show because they like it so much and are mad that they don‚Äôt get it all at once? This is hurting the show they like so much, I don‚Äôt know if they understand that."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Fuck the whiners.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Can I just say that I sort of see the point of these reviews?

I didn't bomb it myself, I think that the review score should generally match the quality of the content, not the distribution decisions of that content. But Amazon has made an unpopular choice to stagger the release of this show, which as far as I can tell is the first time they've done that with an original Amazon show. How else are their customers supposed to convey their displeasure with this choice? I mean, I've already paid for this, I expected a full season release, and now what I'm receiving for my subscription is less enjoyable to me. I'm upset about this, and I can understand why others are, too.

I sincerely hope that this doesn't hurt The Boys in terms of who the show reaches and whether or not it gets renewed. I assume it's still going to be a mega-hit, but I am worried."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Hopefully this means Amazon Studios has learned their lesson. Don't change things up because your audience might not be so kind. I haven't participated in this type of behavior, but I am not about to judge those who are doing so.

Edit: Basically, if you're going to go weekly with your show, you better do it from the show's outset, not because you don't have enough filmed content to fill the many weeks due to not purchasing enough series. They have the money, buy more content."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Weird.  I like it so far
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I watch the show and so far is as fun as it was before. At times it can feel disjointed at times. But a bad show? It is not. It‚Äôs hella fun, actually."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"There's no better way to complain about the release schedule than leaving a negative review. 

This sub keeps calling everyone who complains about it incels and babies but it's not like these people are making thousands of accounts to complain about it, they leave a review and then move on."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Although I was looking forward to binge watching, I think they should have managed expectations before launch, bad PR on their part, so they do deserve this to some extent. 

However, I don't personally mind the weekly release, every episode so far has been so packed full of information and development that I think a lot of it may not have the same impact if binge watched. Though I can understand if someone literally has nothing else to watch right now."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Season 2 is awesome
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I didnt review it , but shows that release weekly on a streaming service really annoy me.  I don't want to wait a week between episodes for something I like.  I have been looking fwd to this season and now I have to keep waiting because of some cable holdover decision.  It ruins the flow of a show.  After a week I barley remember what even happened in the previous episode and it loses its momentum for me."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Honestly, giving a bad review because you don‚Äôt like the release format seems fair game to me. I mean, I truly dislike the weekly releases and didn‚Äôt go out of my way to give the show a bad review, but if someone feels like it, seems like a perfectly acceptable platform to do so. That‚Äôs not entitlement, it‚Äôs just people using a platform to show their discontentment. Entitlement would‚Äôve been harassing crew members who have nothing do with this choice, for example. If the main argument here is that poor reviews might discourage people from watching the show, then shame on them for caring so much about numbers."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I'm not watching it till it's all out. I don't wanna wait to continue the journey each week, I'll have enough waiting for the next season. I dislike them trying to make streaming services more like tv"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I see 90% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.7 IMDB, seems fine."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,2nd season is still a damn good one. Why bother to give bad review if you dont like the distributionethod. The society today is so wrong.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Fanboys don't care about the reviews
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Don‚Äôt knock it till ya try it
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"All the reviews I see are people just butthurt at the weekly release format, don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs still just as good as season 1"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,So far I like season 2. Its clearly building up for a big bang at the end.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"The release schedule is part of a show. If people are irritated that the release schedule is changed then they have the right to review accordingly. 

Everyone in here frothing at the mouth about ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù is ridiculous. The insults you‚Äôre hurling are far more childish than a random review you consider unfair."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Review bombing doesn't mean shit really, Madden 21 was review bombed a couple of weeks ago and is EA's best selling Madden. EA must be so sad.

It lets people think they're making themselves heard but trust me that the people complaining about the Boys will be singing from the rooftops about The Mandalorian comes out in October and that's also a weekly release. 
It's fake outrage over a non problem.

 The Boys season 2 is great so far btw."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Review bombing? Have a seat and let me tell you the tale of ‚ÄòThe Last of Us 2‚Äô and how people bombed the hell out of it mere hours after its release. 

People who go and review bomb are some of the worst souls on the planet"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Lol just remember the people doing this are most likely adults, who can legally reproduce and vote."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"To be perfectly honest.... I hate an ‚Äúall at once‚Äù release model.  With shows I really like I love participating in online communities, listening to weekly podcasts, reacting to one episode and theorizing on the next.   I think shows are benefited in the long run and can build communities with that standard release model.  

It‚Äôs nice to be able to binge everything at once and all, but the Netflix model has kind of destroyed that.  A show will get a bit of attention, will be discussed for a week or so.... and then just vanish from public consciousness for an entire year.   It‚Äôs not fun to participate in the communities for a show when some people could be 1,2,4,10...etc episodes into a season and some are elsewhere.  Theorizing and discussing what might come next is impossible for anything but the end of the season.  Podcasts have no long life, and lose listenership after a coupe of weeks...etc. 

Shows like Lost, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad...etc were all built on the fact that they were ‚Äúwater cooler‚Äù shows.  Shows that we‚Äôre helped by the fact they were hyped week-to-week.  Helped by the fact that they were appointment viewing experiences...etc.  And I can‚Äôt help but think, other than a few of the really big Netflix shows (Stranger Things for example) that a few of the binge-style shows would have a larger viewership if they had a standard release model.  

Case and point...  The Mandolirian remained in public consciousness for all of December last year, and into January.  It‚Äôs release format helped keep attention on itself.  If that show had released all at once, I‚Äôm sure it would have been as well received and reviewed..  but dose anyone really think it would have anywhere near the cultural impact it had?  Would S2 be anywhere near as hyped up as it is now?  I really don‚Äôt think so.  

I‚Äôm glad The Boys is on a week to week schedule, in the long run I think that will only benefit it.  And I hope more streaming-based shows follow suit.   ‚ÄúThe Expanse‚Äù is one I hope to get week to week."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I am struggling to watch S2, it hasn‚Äôt sucked me in at all, seen first two episodes."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Besides the review bombing, anyone else feel the hype around season 2 is kinda dead?? Like.... season 1 started raves and it was all rave until a few months ago, then *poof*, everyone stops talkin' about it and the series premiered to crickets."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Hahahaha! People review bombing because of the trickled out release... Don't get me wrong, I enjoy benging like anyone, but its such an entitled attitude to take."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I mean, this release schedule was just done as a greedy subscription scheme, so how else are people supposed to show their dissatisfaction with it? Whatever executives approved this made a big mistake - this isn‚Äôt cable tv, let me binge if I want, you know, like every other streaming show."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"\>Showrunner outright states the staggered release was an 'artistic choice'  
\>People review the art low to show their displeasure with an 'artistic choice'  
\*surprised pikachuface\*  


Yeah, no, I added onto the review bomb pile.   Don't pay for cable, HULU, or HBO for a reason.  If I want to enjoy media, I want to finish it on my time.  Not wait a week between every episode, forget half of the smaller plot-points, or outright forget/drop the show entirely.  


""BUT WHY NOT JUST WAIT ITS NOT HURRRRRRD DUR""  No. If you don't watch a show when it comes out but sitll around the release? You'll get spoiled.   


Or, in my case, had no idea they were pulling this staggered release BS when I started the show last week. Picked it up due to a youtuber recommending it and I""d never guess in 1000 years that Amazon would take a step back like this."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I mean sure the fact Season 2 is being pushed literally everywhere I look at the moment (genuinely can‚Äôt escape it haha) and only the first 4(?) episodes are out is a bit misleading. Only on one banner Did it specify ‚Äúepisodes 1-3‚Äù. 
But come on, that‚Äôs hardly reason enough to review bomb a show. Content wise it‚Äôs more of the same great stuff from season 1. I would ask if people are really that entitled......fucking diabolical."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"I'm way out of the show this season because of the weekly release schedules. I don't mind it for episodic TV, but these streaming shows aren't even serials. They're 10 hour long movies. It's not fun watching a movie broken up in to chucks one hour a week.

Doesn't help that the story is dragging and the focus has strayed too far from Hughie, the most relatable character."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Season 2 is horrible so far. Nothing really happened
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,I think its pretty good.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Aren‚Äôt the bad reviews because they didn‚Äôt release the whole show?
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Wait reviewers didn‚Äôt like Season 2? I feel like I‚Äôm watching a different series to them haha
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Why would you need to read reviews about a show you already know you like?
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Lower decks in a nutshell.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Season 2 is amazing. 

Come at me bro."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,This show is great
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,I just recently started watching and man this show is amazing. This anti hero theme is completely new to me. All the actors are solid.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Great show, fuck the reviews!"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"What is this talking about? It has a metascore of 81.

https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-boys/season-2"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"It's 2020, nothing requires logic anymore."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Til people actually read reviews of shows and movies and value the reviewer's opinion enough to not watch something... Jfc we are doomed aren't we.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"My only complaint is that the recap was just like...a flashing of scenes that didn‚Äôt really give me a recap? I got five minutes into 2.1 and realized I‚Äôm gonna have to go back to season 1 because it disoriented me so. 


I can‚Äôt wait to get back into it, though."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Thought it was getting review bombed over political crap. Then I realized it was because it‚Äôs going for a weekly release which is somehow a even worse reason for review bombing.
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,If you enjoy homelander I highly recommend Banshee. A fucking great show that suffered from being on the wrong network but had a cult following
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Keeping the show in the public eye, twittersphere, social media blah blah longer can only be a good thing imo. Weekly release hurts now, but we're better off in the long run I would like to believe. I would have loved to have seen Banshee and Antony Starr get this kind of attention, hell any Cinemax show to be honest."
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,"Homelander is the perfect example how the world see‚Äòs america. 

I love it!"
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,Idk what they‚Äôre talking about. This shit is great. Fuck y‚Äôall I‚Äôm not gonna listen to you
Bad Boy Billionaires: India,I briefly watched season 1 and just binged 4 episodes of season 2. I really am loving this show.

But seriously though ‚ÄùAmerican Buffalo‚Äù is one of the common names for the species and is a perfectly valid and correct way to refer to it.

It‚Äôs kind of telling that upon seeing the name of this movie,m people think Burns managed to do all that research and interview all those experts and still got the name of the animal wrong and not that they themselves might be wrong about Bison being the only correct way to refer to it‚Ä¶."

That being said, really missed out by not naming it ""Latinos in Space"""

I understand why, but slightly disappointed that it looks like it‚Äôs only gonna be popular mainstream artists. Especially if it means less podcast episodes. 

Nothing against those artists, I still like them and am definitely not a ‚Äúpop = bad‚Äù person, but pop song structures are essentially the same most of the time. It won‚Äôt be as interesting without weird artists like Caribou. But I‚Äôm excited for the Ty$ one, that guy is crazy talented."

Song Exploder,1 billion dollars!!
Song Exploder,"I am not going to argue that the writing is stellar. I have my own issues with it. But some of the things make sense in context.

The Harfoots are a nomadic tribe - constantly on the move. It would make sense for them to leave people behind who couldn't keep pace. It's also being strongly implied that the Harfoots are a precursor to the Hobbits and have a similar disdain towards adventuring/anything out of the ordinary. The ""taking of wheels"" was a tad harsh, but not jarring to me for a primitive culture who would want to retain as much resources as possible. And FWIW it's a suggestion by the token superstitious woman who is not taken seriously by the lead.

The Numenor piece was indeed weird and could have been easily avoided, rewritten to make it look less suspicious.

My issues with the series so far are faltering pace and lack of motivation for lead characters. Galadriel is on a war path against an enemy she doesn't know even exists beyond a symbol. She somehow convinces a continent to match with her without any tact or diplomatic skills. I get that as a character trait, but not as a plot device. 

The Harfoots are going... Somewhere, waiting for something to happen to them. They have a mystery character who continues to be a mystery 5 episodes in - and it's getting old. 

The people in the South are the worst - everything in that storyline makes me feel like someone is making it up on the fly to pad the episodes.

Elrond at least has a clearly defined goal, and Durin has a conflict. Which is why their scenes look like a real story than filler.

I am still invested in the story it seems to be building towards but a lot would depend on how/if they stick the landing."
Song Exploder,"Yup, I‚Äôm watching just for the beautiful and ethereal visuals, which look direct heirs of the movie trilogy. 

Occasionally they manage to get *something* right in the script, probably by random chance - like the friendship between Elrond and Durin."
Song Exploder,When they suggested taking a families wheels I was like these cold blooded bastards have definitely done this before and if they did they left it out of the book cause it's so messed up.
Song Exploder,"

The harfoot family that we follow are nice and look out for one another, it is one of them who is singing the song. Even if it wasn't though, it's lenny Henry and his wife who are awful (and they are the leaders, so the other harfoots do what they say. We have seen that hobbits dont like to rock the boat or change their routines and customs so it is unlikely that they would be challenged) and I would imagine their behaviour is deliberate and that we will see their views change throughout the series, probably influenced by the wizard and the main harfoot girl. There are these things called character arcs, sometimes they take longer than 5 episodes.

I don't see what is so hard to believe about a bunch of very scared people, who's ancestors had previously bowed down to the orcs, being easily swayed into surrendering when they feel there is no other choice. I think it is more surprising that anyone stayed to fight against them. 

As for the ship fires, Why would anyone suspect either of them? We, as the audience know a lot more about the intentions of the politician's son than any of the other characters. And isildur would have no reason to blow up the ships as he wanted to go with them, not stop them from leaving. 

It's fine to criticise bad writing or dislike the show, but your criticisms don't really make sense. 

I swear, some people just want to hate this perfectly acceptable tv programme for no reason."
Song Exploder,"This post is peak ""I don't pay enough attention or understand the things happening on screen therefore it's bad writing.""

>When they get threatened again, a nobody character who is barely established convinces half the town to surrender to Mordor. It makes no sense!

Are we watching the same show? Waldreg is one the more established characters in the Southlands. He's the innkeeper and revelead himself as Sauron follower to Theo literally one episode before.

>two of their ships explode and they don't critically question the two characters swimming away from them, who have suspicious motives and no reason of being on them

Isildur is literally the last person who would sabotage the boats. He was trying to stowaway there ffs. He wants to go to Middle-Earth with others and his father knows this, because you know, Isildur literally begged him to go. So of course Elendil believes him and lets him go easily when he arrives at the scene and Isildur says they had nothing to do with the explosion."
Song Exploder,"> Firstly, The Hobbits sing a song about never leaving eachother behind, and then read a list of everyone they left behind. They then condemn a family to the back of the migration line, and literally leave them behind. They even talk about stealing their wheels so they can't move. The plot contradicts what Hobbits are like and even the precedents it set for the audience clearly in the last 10 minutes.

Well this song is the ENTIRE REASON they are still alive. For the good of the community, they can't save everyone. And they are also not hobbits, they are harfoots. So your first point doesn't make any sense. And we can only assume that any subtlety quickly goes above your head

> In the Southlands, the main female hero has led the town to relative safety for days and established herself as the leader. When they get threatened again, a nobody character who is barely established convinces half the town to surrender to Mordor. It makes no sense! Then the leader and the elf have a conversation that the whole town can hear, about whether to surrender because they may all die.

Yeah it's MUCH MORE LOGICAL for a bunch of untrained humans to fight against an army..... They aren't convinced by the argument, they are convinced by the situation. It absolutely doesn't make any sense what the ""leader"" is suggesting. But again, subtlety is not your strong point. 

> Finally, Moving on to Numenor, two of their ships explode and they don't critically question the two characters swimming away from them, who have suspicious motives and no reason of being on them. They just let them go and forget about them.

It is a country that has absolutely no enemies, is it that weird not to expect sabotage? Who would even do such a thing???? They are living in absolute paradise.

The writing is on par with the Lord of the Rings MOVIES, which is what is actually popular. Sure the books are too, but that's only the hobbit and the story of the lord and the rings. The other books about history sold only a fraction and are not enough to support a billion-dollar franchise. And if you look at it from that point of view, this series is EXACTLY the same. Down to the pacing, the scene choices, the establishing shots, the multiple different plots at the same time and the dialogue."
Song Exploder,"I like the writing although the plots are too disconnected.

There is no group I can think of where I don‚Äôt like them and/or understand what they‚Äôre doing.

It all just needs to mesh but no issues with the dialogue."
Song Exploder,"I‚Äôm not a book reader but i like the LOTR and the  Hobbit films.

I can forgive the ridiculousness of some scenes like the OP mentioned but what i don‚Äôt like in the series is there are many storylines that makes the whole show slower than I prefer."
Song Exploder,I couldn‚Äôt even finish the first episode
Song Exploder,"I feel like the writing is pretty average with most television, so not great but passable. There are much better shows, and much worse shows available right now

but these three reasons are really dumb and don't actually address the writing issues the show has at all.

1. the Hobbits, that's the point. The Hobbits are the meek creatures of a cruel world, they form the traditions they need to cope and survive with this but ultimately their progression is to move beyond that.

2. isn't he the tavern keeper? probably everyone in town knows and trusts him and he offers subjugation versus death.

3. Isildur's father makes the call, protects him, gets him into roles he hasn't earned. Like they kinda beat you over the head with this one.

What I think the issues are is that the thesis of the show seems pretty barebones/derivative of LOTR and while they obviously wanted this to feel like lord of the rings, if it doesn't act as a progression of the themes and thesis then what's the point? It just doesn't say very much as compared to Tolkien's works which obviously have a lot to say, a well formulated thesis, and a beautiful prose"
Song Exploder,i very much disagree. it's not going to win any awards for writing but I think its been solid and am very invested in the story.
Song Exploder,"Be careful OP, that‚Äôs starting to sound like internalised racism /s"
Song Exploder,You and your family sat down and laughed together about a song about hobbits being contradicted? Sounds fun!
Song Exploder,When is your series dropping? I like the show.
Song Exploder,What's the difference between what OP is talking about and something like the unreliable narrator?
Song Exploder,"they are not hobbits, they are proto-hobbits. The rest of the writing is a million times better than peter jackson and phillipa boyens. Those two morons had perfect dialogue and completed characters and they still fucked up almost everything. 

This show is pure fan fiction and has more freedom because they are telling stories in between known plot points, and it is still better than anything peter jackson and phillapa boyens ever wrote."
Song Exploder,"They are not Hobbits.  

Hobbits are the descendants of these people just 1000 years later.  While my personal culture is in the US and has a US attitude and society.  1000 years ago my relatives were living a much different life in the Transalpine and Normandy."
Song Exploder,"As a LOTR fan, it pains me that I can't find one good thing about this show."
Song Exploder,"* duck was just downvoted for stating a fact.

Never change, Reddit hive."
Song Exploder,"> Elrond at least has a clearly defined goal, and Durin has a conflict. Which is why their scenes look like a real story than filler.

At this point, I am just watching the show for Elrond and the Dwarves. For one thing, they all seem to be the only ones on this show to have any sort of personality. Everyone else is just so one note. When Elrond and Durin call each other friends, I believe it. We see how even though they argue and have their conflicts, they care for each other. 

I thought I would love the Harfoots because I loved the Hobbits in both the books and the movies. But there is nothing to them here. It's like the writers are going, ""Hey, we heard you loved the Hobbits. They were a fan  favorite from the movies. So, here is some filler Hobbits for you."" And expected the audience to like them just because without realizing the fans liked the Hobbits because they were well defined characters. 

The Elves except for Elrond....they act like Humans and look like Humans. I can see why they gave so many of them short hair. The only thing that sets them appart from Humans are their pointy ears. So, you need to be able to see their ears constantly in order to go, ""That's an elf."" 

The only ones that seem to have a distinct culture are the Dwarves. This is not what you want in any fantasy world let along in a Lord of the Rings themed show."
Song Exploder,"> The Harfoots are a nomadic tribe - constantly on the move. It would make sense for them to leave people behind who couldn't keep pace. 

They also have an attitude around them of smile and wave. Just pretend everything is going fine and don't mention the bad stuff. Like how the friend of Nori has lost her entire family in a blizzard and nobody mentions it or takes her into their family. The entire song is meant ironic by the writers. ""We will never abandon any Harfoots, except for this long list of poor bastards that we abandoned."""
Song Exploder,"I agree with all your points. I hope the story starts coming together by the end of the season as well. I'm still enjoying the show, but if I'm being totally honest I would likely have stopped watching by now if it weren't for the incredible visuals and music. Those have made for some really memorable moments, I just wish the story and characters were hitting those highs as well."
Song Exploder,"Yeah, it's nothing like what Tolkien establishes Hobbits like. It makes me lose connection with that storyline because the town are all such assholes. Haha"
Song Exploder,"To my knowledge there is no writing regarding the migratory habits of the ancestors of hobbits, but it sounds reasonable in a world where either one party gets sacrificed, or the entire tribe dies.

Human history literally has records of civilizations sacrificing individuals to appease some god or exiling people who didn't fit in. Demanding that everything created today is viewed through modern sensibilities seems arrogant."
Song Exploder,"To play devil's advocate: it's the show writer's job to write a show that people want to watch and be invested in. If someone isn't paying attention it's becasue the writer did a poor job of creating something that the watcher wants to watch. 

If the show is as good as people say it is why is there a copious amount of valid criticism about writing, uninteresting characters, poor costume choices, etc.? (I'm obviously not talking about racially charged critiques of the show and not even talking about creative liberties taken, something that typically happens when adapting literature to film.)"
Song Exploder,"At this point, I think people who don't like Rings of Power are just ignorant of The Silmarillion and its appendices, or are just the type of people who love to complain.

One easy test is if any of these dickheads know who the Istari are. If not, they should just shut up and see how things unfold.

I've enjoyed how the writers have been working in the gaps within the appendices thus far. All that's been happening so far is building toward the entrance of Sauron (sidenote: my personal belief based on Tolkien's writings regarding Sauron is that there is zero chance the stranger who is with the Harfoots is Sauron)."
Song Exploder,Show is dog üí©
Song Exploder,Deep inhalation of copium right here.
Song Exploder,"A harfoot is a type of hobbit. I don't know why the writers are pretending that they're some kind of precursor to hobbits, lol."
Song Exploder,">It is a country that has absolutely no enemies, is it that weird not to expect sabotage? Who would even do such a thing????

""We suspect a passing brigand"" Is the very next thing we hear daddy say to the queen and that fancy beard man. You're just talking out of thine posterior. Now, very easily it could be that daddy already knows but doesn't wanna fuck his son, so maybe that entire scene isn't another example of bad writing but you are just dead wrong.

>The writing is on par with the Lord of the Rings MOVIES

Ha

Haha

AHAHAHAHAHAHHA

 ok."
Song Exploder,The writing is on par with the movies? You have got to be joking.
Song Exploder,"Well said all around though I disagree it needs to ""Say Something"" or progress themes."
Song Exploder,"Go sit in a corner, this is just stupid railing against stupid."
Song Exploder,Yeah. And it's a running joke in the family now!
Song Exploder,The difference is this isn‚Äôt being narrated.
Song Exploder,"> The rest of the writing is a million times better than peter jackson and phillipa boyens. Those two morons had perfect dialogue and completed characters and they still fucked up almost everything. 

Now that's a spicy take. Although I would also say the things people have problem with in the ROP also are present in the LOTR trilogy, so it's entirely hypocritical to be this nitpicking of the show's script when the movies do the same (or worse as you point out as they had the entire manuscript to the events they are depicting) things. The one edge the movie trilogy has over the show is the directing, which is understandable as it's a movie and hardly any TV show comes close to the cinematic language shown in movies. I also like that the trilogy was shot with a film camera, so there's a slight downgrade in terms of visual aspect but it's a small issue for me. Script-wise, the trilogy shares the same faults the TV show has but let's see for the season to wrap up to compare the two in better health."
Song Exploder,"Maybe try reading The Silmarillion, which this show is actually based on? I find the show pretty enjoyable. These episodes are mostly reasonable when set within the confines of the Akallabeth.

Since I've read them, I can see what the writers are trying to accomplish, and it's pretty awesome.

Sidenote: if any of you enjoyed the movie adaptation of The Hobbit, you should turn in your ""I'm a LotR fan!"" badges. That movie trilogy was an abomination when it comes to adapting the text of The Hobbit."
Song Exploder,Yes because that is how downvotes are supposed to work.  Downvoting is not supposed to be a disagreement button it made to be used to mark content that is irrelevant or does not contribute to a conversation. Saying the show cost 1 billion on it own adds nothing to this conversation. If he said it cost 1 billion and explained why he felt that helped or hurt the show that would be a good comment.
Song Exploder,"Yes exactly. The elves are indistinguishable from people. The short hair doesn't help. Galadriel acting like she's 20 doesn't help. 
Every other seen has epic music and tries to be grand and it all feels so fucking cringe and hollow.
Where is Galadriel's magic? They try to make her seem powerful but considering she's supposed to be an immortal magic elf it ends up being a huge insult to the character and kind of embarrassing"
Song Exploder,"I still like the Harfoots because at least they have a bit of personality and humor, and I've really enjoyed the performances of the actresses playing Nori and Poppy. I just wish they would give them a bit more to do. They are the most stagnant of the storylines, and you can only get so much mileage out of the whole ""mysterious stranger"" thing before it starts to get boring. I hope they meet up with some of the other main characters by the end of the season because I think that could inject some life into the proceedings."
Song Exploder,"Well to be fair one of the hobbits becomes Gollum, so we know that there‚Äôs the potential for evil and corruption among them. Also, there‚Äôs a lot of small feuds and pet rivalries among the families of the Shire, and so we have to wonder if those conflicts were more serious and less comical in other times."
Song Exploder,"""These cavemen are just grunting at each other and hitting things with clubs, this is nothing like what Humans are established to be"""
Song Exploder,"You know they're not Hobbits, right? Why are you calling them Hobbits?"
Song Exploder,"> harfoot 
Because they are precursors of the current hobbit. 

It's very clear current hobbits settled down and don't migrate. Which implies agriculture and no danger anymore."
Song Exploder,"Yes? It‚Äôs not just on par, it‚Äôs EXACTLY the same.

The movies also didn‚Äôt resemble Tolkien‚Äôs writing. And that‚Äôs why people are complaining. They didn‚Äôt want a Peter Jackson series, they wanted a Tolkien series. 

Yet these people are an unimportant minority so no one is ever going to listen. Nor should they."
Song Exploder,the movies really hacked down the writing from the books in my opinion
Song Exploder,Reddit‚Äôs no fun anymore. Nobody can laugh at themselves.
Song Exploder,"My bad, i forgot we were watching live footage of the 2nd age of Middle Earth"
Song Exploder,The snow isn‚Äôt based on the Silmarillion. It‚Äôs based on the appendices from The Lord of the Rings. They don‚Äôt have the rights to the Silmarillion.
Song Exploder,">That movie trilogy was an abomination when it comes to adapting the text of The Hobbit

Yes. It was still much, much better than Rings of Power in that regard. The Hobbit was a bad adaption. Rings of Power is (very) loosely inspired fanfic written by writers who are about as bad as it gets at their jobs."
Song Exploder,">Maybe try reading The Silmarillion

Lol. If you'd actually read this you'd never suggest people do this"
Song Exploder,"""I find the show pretty enjoyable because I read the Silmarillion. Their writing is awesome""

Is this a joke? Are you alright, mate? Did you lose your brain cells while watching RoP?"
Song Exploder,Did my explanation marks not explain... For 1 billion dollars you think they could have hired actual writers.
Song Exploder,Just a fraction of that billion could hire Aaron Sorkin or Christopher McQueirrie.. so it's kind of a tomato and tomahto argument.
Song Exploder,"Yes they are Hobbits: https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Harfoots#:~:text=As%20with%20most%20Hobbit%20terms,Old%20English%20construction%20h%C7%A3r%2Df%C5%8Dt.

Harfoot is a subgroup of Hobbits."
Song Exploder,"The three subspecies of hobbit existed simultaneously. The harfoots were simply the first to migrate. Idk what you're implying, though. I'm just going over what I assume you're trying to say."
Song Exploder,Are we watching the same show? Nearly every character in the movies was interesting and the relationships seemed real. With ROP Durin and Elrond have a good relationship. Everything else is god awful.
Song Exploder,Can u please give me ur dealers number?
Song Exploder,Reddits a shithole but why would anyone laugh at themselves when they can laugh at you?
Song Exploder,Do you not know what a narration is?
Song Exploder,"There is heavy overlap between Akallabeth, which is in The Silmarillion. The writers wouldn't be able to tell any sort of meaningful story without some overlap. You are correct though, and likely there will be no real storyline that involves the Silmarils. I'd guess that the deal between Amazon and Tolkien's estate is that they couldn't touch the Noldorin story involving Feanor, Beren, Luthien, Earendil, Elwing, etc, but they could touch the story of Numenor's downfall in the context of Sauron's rise."
Song Exploder,"They should have bought the rights to fanfic, because nothing can be worse than what we have here."
Song Exploder,"This show came out months ago and you're trawling old threads to then reply? That's pathetic lmfaooo

No TV adaptation for any series is going to be 100% true to canon, yet some of you miserable fans believe otherwise. There are concepts within RoP that are more enjoyable/understandable after having read the Silmarillion. Of course there are some things that aren't canonical, but it doesn't keep me from enjoying the series."
Song Exploder,"But they're not hobbits yet, as far as you might understand them from the books or the films, they will become that over thousands of years and possibly the plot of this show will show them settling down.

Not to say your points on the writing being a bit fluffy aren't valid but you can't compare these characters to ones that won't exist for thousands of years."
Song Exploder,Does anyone on Reddit have an attitude other than ‚Äúsmug prick?‚Äù
Song Exploder,Do you?
Emily in Paris,Ashley's a bench now.
Emily in Paris,"This season has Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez, Paul Rudd, Meryl Streep and I think I read Sting is back as well.  Stacked as fuck cast.  
  
This show rules."
Emily in Paris,"""Only Murders"" is the most absurdly entertaining show on my must-watch list. I still look up my favorite bits from S1 and S2 on YouTube. I can't wait for S3 to premier."
Emily in Paris,Awesome. This is such a fun little show
Emily in Paris,I was at the Mean Girls previews premiere in DC and I thought she was the best actor of the cast.
Emily in Paris,So were gonna have singingüòè
Emily in Paris,"Hopefully she doesn‚Äôt sing as much as she does in the newest season of Emily in Paris üòÇ 

Joking aside, looking forward to watching her on the show!"
Emily in Paris,Acceptable only if she still wears her crazy outfits from Emily in Paris.
Emily in Paris,It is coming along nicely.
Emily in Paris,Her agent works so hard
Emily in Paris,Fuxking here for THIS comment #Girls5Eva
Emily in Paris,[removed]
Emily in Paris,Is it worth trying/watching if I was a fan of Steve Martin and Martin Short when I was a kid but lately have found material like their two-man shows more tedious than funny?
Emily in Paris,I‚Äôm falling for Selena Gomez. I used to think she was an absolute pain in the butthole but after I saw her in The Fundamentals of Caring I‚Äôve been smitten.
Emily in Paris,"I love seeing Steve and Martin bouncing off each other. It could be the dips, though."
Emily in Paris,Such a good show that I hope catches on. The writing and acting for Wickie makes me sincerely laugh out loud. Ren√©e Elise Goldsberry does such a good job with that character. CEASE AND DESIST BITCH
Emily in Paris,"I would say yes.  I had no intention of ever even watching the show for reasons like you just described.  Then I was talked into it and was surprised at how entertaining it is, it‚Äôs not what I expected."
Emily in Paris,The show is much more fun than tedious. Steve and Martin's characters are both pretty good and balanced well by having a third lead in Selena Gomez. Definitely give it a shot.
Emily in Paris,Absolutely! It's a completely different type of vibe than their two-man special. The episodes are only 30 minutes so you'll be able to see pretty quickly if you like it or not.
Emily in Paris,"I was never a Martin Short fan, but I am enjoying the show a lot.  IMO the whole > the parts."
Emily in Paris,It's heartwarming and has a lot of Family^TM love.
Emily in Paris,They're definitely streets ahead.
Emily in Paris,Hopefully people will discover it on Netflix. It‚Äôs just so good! Who put this piano here!
Emily in Paris,"I have heard it is good and I watched a few episodes through less than legal means


but I am just gonna wait until it is on netflix"

Emily in Paris,"‚Äú[The French version of this show may give the impression that Emily speaks our language well. Trust us, this is not the case.](https://imgur.com/gallery/GpL3Uam)‚Äù"
Emily in Paris,"Every time I think of Emily in Paris (which is a terrible show that I love watching), I think about an interview I heard with Lauren Lapkus who spoke about auditioning for the role of Emily. That would have been a very different direction for the show, but I think I would have enjoyed it more."
Emily in Paris,i like how mad people get about this show being very popular
Emily in Paris,I thought I was going to hate this show and that it looked stupid until everyone kept saying it was good so I watched‚Ä¶. Not only do I LOVE it but I‚Äôm really feeling lost after finishing season 3 and not having anything worthy to follow with!
Emily in Paris,At least there‚Äôs some self awareness there
Emily in Paris,Love this show. I don‚Äôt take it too seriously and enjoy it for what it is. I find it very entertaining
Emily in Paris,"When Netflix flashes little descriptive hints about what a show is about, I've never seen it more off than listing Emily in Paris as ""campy.""

Hahaha, talk about damage control."
Emily in Paris,"I'm way outside the intended demographic for this show but I'm a big Lily Collins fan and it's my one and only TV guilty pleasure. And FWIW, it's my understanding that she's actually quite fluent in French IRL."
Emily in Paris,"My only issue with the show is that at this level of light comedy I want to be able to enjoy it without paying strict attention to it, and with so much subtitled I can‚Äôt."
Emily in Paris,bahahahaahahahah
Emily in Paris,There‚Äôs a French version?
Emily in Paris,Lauren Lapkus as Emily would be HILARIOUS!
Emily in Paris,Why are people mad about it ootl
Emily in Paris,"I never would have watched it if my wife didnt start it, but I enjoy watching it with her. It's a bunch of extremely good looking people (particularly the men, Gabriel and Alfie are preposterously handsome) in beautiful places, doing low pretty low stakes stuff and is generally fun and entertaining. I'm not giving it any awards but it's fun to watch."
Emily in Paris,"You could check out a Younger, it's from the same creator. I really enjoyed the first couple seasons although it went downhill after. Still good background trash tv though, in the same kind of fun way."
Emily in Paris,Same. I couldn't find a good followup so I'm just doing another rewatch of Gilmore
Emily in Paris,If you haven‚Äôt already give Ted Lasso a chance. It‚Äôs kinda like a guy version of Emily in Paris.
Emily in Paris,Her outfits are campu
Emily in Paris,"I‚Äôm on the second episode of season three and am quite enjoying it, despite her character‚Äôs inability to respond spontaneously to human emotion or display any capacity for emotional growth."
Emily in Paris,French classes finally paid off for me for this reason haha
Emily in Paris,It has dubbing in french
Emily in Paris,This would make an excellent SNL skit if she ever has the opportunity to host
Emily in Paris,"Because it‚Äôs a tv show that isn‚Äôt aimed at males in their 20‚Äôs-30‚Äôs, which is a cardinal sin here at r/television"
Emily in Paris,"The short version is that Emily goes to Paris and makes a lot of mistakes ... But then magically manages to fix them all in unrealistic ways and come out on top.

It's massive plot armor.

What makes it worse is that she's an American in France who doesn't speak French. This gives the impression that Americans are these magical people who can always come out on top eveb without speaking the local language (and conversely that the French are useless and old fashioned and backwards and can't fix anything themselves.)"
Emily in Paris,"If you haven‚Äôt already watched it, Derry Girls is a perfect follow-up - especially if you loved Gilmore Girls!"
Emily in Paris,"Knowingly though? Before the public reacted to the show as they had?

Doubtful."
Emily in Paris,"> despite her character‚Äôs inability to respond spontaneously to human emotion or display any capacity for emotional growth.

Lol -- yeah, this show defines ""superficial"" but it's a fun ride."
Emily in Paris,That seems to be a problem in many subs actually lol
Emily in Paris,I don‚Äôt think the creators of this show thought they were making prestige drama.
Emily in Paris,"I guarantee you the makers and costume designer thought Emily‚Äôs outfits were A+ top tier true to modern younger ppl style until people on social media started ragging on her outfits. The character is as obnoxious as her outfits and I‚Äôm believe that was absolutely unintended, but now in the name of damage control they can claim it was intended."
Emily in Paris,"I think they definitely meant her to be obnoxious, but they miscalculated the part where her ineptitude was supposed to make her ‚Äúendearing‚Äù"
Emily in Paris,"As an orthopedic surgeon - what possibly could the the physician do? 

The treatment: stop"
Emily in Paris,"She had a good joke on Fallon about a future season being ""Emily in flats""."
Emily in Paris,"She was like, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt dance‚Äù

*Doctor begins to reply in French*

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk‚Äù

*doctor starts to examine eyes/ears and lily pushes doc‚Äôs hands away*

‚ÄúOnly thing about me is the way that I walk‚Äù"
Emily in Paris,"Honestly if she has to go to a doctor weekly for pain because of wardrobe then they should change the wardrobe. I'm all for ""realism"" but not at the expense of the actors.

E: alright guys you can stop telling me it's not realistic. I put it in quotes, there's not much to read into here."
Emily in Paris,"Was she also wearing a vintage tee, holding a brand new phone, sequin smile with black lipstick?

They assume Emily knows nothing."
Emily in Paris,"But they don‚Äôt call it a doctor over there, they call it a ‚Äúroyale avec fromage‚Äù"
Emily in Paris,"No, this is just an anecdote she told on Jimmy Fallon.

Like, if she was suing Netflix for health problems, or if this was some leaked doc, that would be news. But when celebs talk about stuff on talk shows, that's not news. It's often not even true. It's part of their repertoire, which they put together with their publicist and people from the studio, to make the show they're plugging seem more interesting. 

They didn't have her wear heels 8 hours a day wandering through her daily life. She filmed some scenes outside, and wore heels for those, but most scenes were indoors. Paris doesn't have THAT many cobblestoned streets, and they apparently couldn't even find a photo of the character walking on cobblestones for the article. Actually, she doesn't even mention cobblestones in the interview, that was Fallon's contribution."
Emily in Paris,"I‚Äôm a french woman who lived in the neighbourhood they filmed, on rue Saint Jacques (also they trashed the place bc they never bothered cleaning the catering, first time I saw rats there ! ), and who wears high heels daily and never had a problem n√©cessitent medical oversight. However, during the filming of season 1, I was unable to see my therapist on time because they blocked the way to it (the office is in front of the little square Place de l‚Äôestrapade)."
Emily in Paris,So like the one Jurassic park where they kept that woman running from dinosaurs in heels the whole movie
Emily in Paris,"If they did Emily in Rome, it would have turned into a Jackass movie."
Emily in Paris,Slow news day
Emily in Paris,"Taylor Swift voice: *high heels on cobblestones‚Ä¶ When you are young, they assume you know nothing*"
Emily in Paris,"She needs to hire new directors/ etc. Wear the heels for wide shots that are like a few seconds long and then flats during closeups, and then scooter from one location to another."
Emily in Paris,Worst show ever it‚Äôs offensive how basic it is
Emily in Paris,"Walking the cobblestone streets of Paris is going to wear you down even if you're wearing really good walking shoes. 

So yeah, I can see where Lily had big problems with her feet during the filming of her scenes."
Emily in Paris,I don‚Äôt know how she did it.  I fell on my face under l‚ÄôArc de Triomphe wearing sneakers.
Emily in Paris,"As long as there‚Äôs important articles like this being written, we should be OK as a society."
Emily in Paris,I got a stress fracture in my foot from wearing heels on cobblestones for one night in Edinburgh years ago! Was so painful!
Emily in Paris,Why is this at the top of the subreddit? Who is upvoting it?
Emily in Paris,"My uncle had issues with his back for years, but nothing that required surgery. Then he went to Europe for a few weeks on a trip right after he retired...walking on cobblestone streets screwed his back up the rest of the way. So much that he was laid out for days after he got back home. He had surgery a few months later."
Emily in Paris,and did the doctor have anything different to say each week? Would imagine cortisone shots would maybe lasted more than a week.
Emily in Paris,So is everything about the show grotesquely out of touch then?
Emily in Paris,"God, I don't know why, but I really hate this show with a passion. I read the tittle of this article and I was like ""Good."". Like I hope people know you can't show up to France with a beret to ""fit in"", no one wears that lol. Jesus, I hate who this is for."
Emily in Paris,And for what? A mediocre show? Money I now know she doesn‚Äôt need because she‚Äôs Phil Collins‚Äô daughter? Netflix free this girl and her knees!
Emily in Paris,Who gives a complete and utter fuck
Emily in Paris,Sign me up for who the fuck cares
Emily in Paris,still can‚Äôt feel as terrible as watching the show
Emily in Paris,"Seems like it would be more practical to only have her wear heels when her feet are in camera, and let her wear comfortable shoes otherwise."
Emily in Paris,What would a doctor even do for that?
Emily in Paris,Legit question‚Ä¶ how often can you see her heels?
Emily in Paris,[deleted]
Emily in Paris,"Everyone laughs, but foot pain sucks."
Emily in Paris,Worst method actor ever
Emily in Paris,She is wearing her beret all wrong and looks like an idiot. Women who live in Paris wear flats and carry high heels to put on at their destination. Stilettos are the modern equivalent of foot binding
Emily in Paris,"Sorry, no sympathy here coming from me.

There's millions of people out there who have jobs that do a lot more damage to their bodies in a single day than walking in heels on cobblestones does in a week, and nobody cares about them. 

And the vast majority of those people can't afford to even see a doctor, at all, unless it's an emergency, to say nothing of preventative visits that happen weekly."
Emily in Paris,Stupid director is just throwing dumb stereotypes about French and France. It‚Äôs just outrageous. I wish they‚Äôd get sued for saying that much bs
Emily in Paris,She literally only has a career because she's Phil Collins' daughter
Emily in Paris,Kinda sounds like similar to Joaquin Phoenix losing his weight for Joker
Emily in Paris,"I‚Äôm happy that highly compensated professions get the medical attention they deserve. Reading as someone with a labor intensive job that isn‚Äôt highly compensated, I sure would love some of that medical attention."
Emily in Paris,All that pain and none of the outfits are cute
Emily in Paris,"‚ÄúHello doctor, my feet still hurt‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Lily, still wearing those high heels on the cobblestones?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes it‚Äôs a nightmare, any medical advances this week that might help?‚Äù

‚ÄúNone yet, but check back next week you never know‚Äù

Seriously‚Ä¶ after the first week what do you talk about?"
Emily in Paris,Someone get Peyton manning on top of this
Emily in Paris,Thank you for your sacrifice. It must be a hard life.
Emily in Paris,Why the fuck is this news?
Banana,I thought his name was Tall?
Banana,They are married in real life. They also do a great podcast together with Jason Mantzoukas aka Rafi from The League. It‚Äôs called How Did This Get Made and where they break down bad movies.
Banana,Anything that isn't another crime or reality show on network TV is a positive step.
Banana,That's... bananas.
Banana,I'm surprised a major network is giving a show to actual funny people who aren't senior citizens
Banana,Andre in The League was so hilarious can‚Äôt wait to see this!
Banana,Arsenio Paul is one of the dumbest funny things I've seen and he was great in The League. June I feel has been in everything. I really loved her in Black Monday and her part in FOTC.
Banana,Calling Marta Kauffman the Grace and Frankie creator multiple times before mentioning Friends is quite a choice.
Banana,What exactly is an improv comic?
Banana,They always say her full name every time. I love it.
Banana,https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-did-this-get-made/id409287913
Banana,That's bonkers
Banana,CBS trying something new? Colour me surprised.
Banana,Amazing podcasters
Banana,JDR was incredible on *Burning Love*. Can't wait.
Banana,"Not a fan of improv, but Paul is consistently funny in his many small roles he popped up in. But then again this is CBS so im conflicted in what to expect"
Banana,I really don‚Äôt care for Paul Scheer. I find him more annoying than funny.
Banana,"She was hilarious in Long Shot, will have to check this out"
Banana,It‚Äôs John. Tall John Scheer to us who didn‚Äôt work at Blockbuster and didn‚Äôt French our moms after drinking V8. (There‚Äôs a great supercut of all of Paul‚Äôs childhood stories on YouTube)
Banana,GEOSTORM!
Banana,The Daredevil (Affleck) episode is one of my faves
Banana,Feel like every episode is just gonna lead to a Jacob's Ladder situation
Banana,When I started to read the headline I became worried I was reading a divorce announcement
Banana,"Saw them live for ~~Deadly Runway~~ Designed to Kill. They started almost twenty minutes late, and it was a fantastic show from start to finish."
Banana,Hey nong man. Don't you mean they do a podcast with Jeffery Characterwheaties? Jason Mantzoukas is just a deep character he plays.
Banana,Love them both! What‚Äôs up jerks???
Banana,FUCK THE MOON! FUCK THE MOON!
Banana,Team Sanity
Banana,It's fucking BONKERS!
Banana,"I love love love this podcast. If anyone out there hasn‚Äôt listened, they should. Seek out the Drop Dead Fred episode. June and The guest, Casey Wilson get into a screaming match so bad that Casey Wilson damaged her vocal chords. It. Is. Bonkers."
Banana,Funny you mention that because Scheer and Raphael have worked on parodies of crime shows (NTSF:SD:SUV::) and reality shows (Burning Love).
Banana,You say that as if CBS hasn‚Äôt consistently aired a ton of sitcoms.
Banana,What's up jerks!!!!
Banana,Child please
Banana,"""itz da crawdad man"""
Banana,The League also was a lot of improv so it can work.
Banana,I'm inside me!!
Banana,Try the veal!
Banana,The Dre
Banana,They both KILLED in Black Monday that‚Äôs where I first heard of them and then the podcast. So funny.
Banana,June Diane Raphael was a regular on Grace and Frankie. They probably felt it would be more relevant to people reading this article.
Banana,"they make it up on the spot, no script"
Banana,What‚Äôs its mission?
Banana,"That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs her SAG registered name. Like Michael J Fox or Sarah Jessica Parker.

No one knows who James Jones is. But James Earl Jones is a legend."
Banana,Well that's just your opinion and your opinion sucks!
Banana,"I wonder if his dad still has the hat that says ""I may not have lots of hair, but I get lots of head"""
Banana,What‚Äôs up JERKS!
Banana,Kumate!
Banana,This is the way
Banana,The whole Fast and Furious series with Adam Scott is great too
Banana,I wish they didn't lock all of their old episodes behind a paywall so I could listen to it.
Banana,Lmao I just listened to that one and it‚Äôs so good
Banana,My first reaction as well‚Ä¶was all ‚Äúawwww fuck.‚Äù
Banana,Team Fred all the way!
Banana,It's so bonkers they're putting it on vinyl. I have my copy pre-ordered.
Banana,"Her character on NTSF:SD:SUV has a line like, ""No! The eyebrows are the frame to the face"", just before hers get shaved off. 

I always think of this line when I see somebody with weird eyebrows."
Banana,"Oh man Burning Love was brilliant, have never seen it brought up before but honestly made me lose my shit"
Banana,No networks have been airing a ton of sitcoms recently. NBC didn‚Äôt even have one comedy in their fall lineup a few years back.
Banana,Try the veal
Banana,Ya got to keep ‚Äòem separated
Banana,bobbum
Banana,Yeah I loved everyone on that show especially Casey Wilson. That's also where I got introduced to Andrew Rannells.
Banana,Did you just chug a bottle of ipecac? Is that chili?!
Banana,"Oh, yeah I know. I was referencing something from their podcast where June asks ‚Äúwhat exactly is a street fighter‚Äù. Still appreciate the response."
Banana,Right but even paul says it for the show.
Banana,"Maybe it‚Äôs by the Arli$$ swag hat his dad won him, autographed by Robert Wuhl himself."
Banana,ZOOOUUUUUKS!
Banana,They release them as matinee Mondays
Banana,You could...pay for it?
Banana,Team Fred!
Banana,"As someone that is trying to grow back eyebrows, that line is painfully accurate.

(I had a very stressful bad November and apparently that evolved into me developing trichotillomania and my eyebrows have yet to recover. It looks bad.)"
Banana,"It took me a long time to find decent-quality downloads of that show. Can't get mad though, that's just Blaze bein' Blaze."
Banana,"Cool, but I wasn‚Äôt talking about NBC. CBS currently has 4 ongoing comedies plus another 16 that have aired in the past 5 years. Yes, they have an inordinate amount of crime shows, but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs popular; it doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt also have comedies."
Banana,"I got it. Probably a balcony monster, just ignore them"
Banana,"oh i didnt know that, looked like a straight up question"
Banana,"True. I think he‚Äôs just doing her a solid because it seems like everyone mispronounces her name like the artist (or let‚Äôs be honest, like the turtle)"
Banana,Don‚Äôt forget about the time Clarissa signed his homework and his teacher accepted it.
Banana,What's its mission?
Banana,give me that baby
Banana,Paying for content you enjoy to support its creators? On Reddit? Are you new here? /s
Banana,I'm not paying for Stitcher. Fuck that company.
Banana,Is 4 really a ton though?
Banana,But did the monkey get paid for his work?
Banana,No worries. At least you were nice about it
Banana,I‚Äôd say 20 is.
Banana,That‚Äôd still be around 4 a year. Way too few!
Banana,"Sure, I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree; but people just don‚Äôt watch them."
Banana,PRAISE CHIRAX
Banana,"5,000 wings!

10,000 beaks!

I was laughing so hard it took me 2 watches to realize they got that math wrong."
Banana,Man I don't care what anyone else says this had me dying. Chick-Nobyl. Cement chute. Brilliant stuff.
Banana,This is the funniest bit I have seen on SNL in years - well done!
Banana,"This at first felt like the spiritual successor to Taco Town, but it went so far off the rails in a good way.

I'm sure Binging with Babish with find a way to make an episode out of this."
Banana,I‚Äôm having wings tonight for my LoU viewing
Banana,Some of those prices seemed decent. Maybe Chirex ain‚Äôt so bad?
Banana,"Looked up BWW flavors to see how they named their ""ethnically troubling sauces"" cuz that seemed so accurate, and they literally have a flavor called Asian Zing hahaha"
Banana,Who wrote this? It's giving Sarah Sherman vibes.
Banana,Great sketch. Gives me Taco Town vibes for some reason.
Banana,I needed oxygen I was laughing so hard.
Banana,It‚Äôs not often something makes me cry laugh. This was one of them.
Banana,Yo. This. Was. Bananas.
Aliens,In Noah Hawley I trust
Aliens,"Cannot fuckin wait.

Between this and Fede Alvarez's upcoming movie (that has absolutely zero to do with any of the previous films other than there's an Alien in it) I feel like fans of this property are going to be eating really well for the first time since... what, 1991?

I know you're not supposed to be getting your hopes up (it's kind of a bad era for that, as it turns out) but goddammit... I'm getting my hopes up here.

fun fact completely beside the point, so I'll put it in spoilers: >!""Xenomorph"" isn't the name of the Alien species (it doesn't have a name) since the reason Cameron used the word in the first place was much like how ""unobtanium"" was used in Avatar: It was just used specifically to replicate emptyheaded corporate speak and you were supposed to think the person using it was a dipshit for using it. it worked in Avatar (worked too well there, really) but for whatever reason hardcore Alien fans legitimately think ""xenomorph"" sounds better than just calling it an alien, and completely missed the satire!<"
Aliens,"I'm sure it'll be a fine series on its own, but seems like taking place on Earth would kind of undermine every movie where the whole point is not letting it get to Earth."
Aliens,Hope it's an origin story for the aliens so we can find out why they are so angry all the time
Aliens,"As cool as an 'Alien' series is, I'm just excited about some Fargo news. Hope it revisits the characters from season 1, especially."
Aliens,"This will be shooting around the same time as the new movie, Alien: Romulus. Though honestly I‚Äôm more excited for this."
Aliens,The balls it must take to take this on knowing how fans of the franchise will destroy anyone who does it wrong. God's speed Noah. Don't fuck up
Aliens,"Speaking of FX, when the fuck does their Shogun series comes out?

It has been years since they talked of it."
Aliens,"Ooo, Fargo S5‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt wait"
Aliens,Please don‚Äôt suck.
Aliens,David is Michael Fassbender‚Äôs best role. So chilling
Aliens,"One of the leads of this show is a 10 year old in the body of an androgynous warrior lady. This performance can make or break the show, Danai Gurira is the frontrunner for the role last I heard."
Aliens,Can they please retcon those awful prequels?
Aliens,"Wow only three years after they announced. Way to go, FX. What happened to this Damn network. In the mid-late 2000s FX were on their way to becoming an upper echelon network. And then they just threw in the towel."
Aliens,"Jeezy, I thought this must be about to come out. Seems like I've been hearing about this production for years."
Aliens,Yes yes yes
Aliens,Okay then
Aliens,"Alien show that's not really about the alien, but about people - pass."
Aliens,"So can we get male hero for this show now

/s"
Aliens,"I look forward to the blatant and heavy handed overuse of the soundtrack. 

(Edit: I know it‚Äôs a jerk thing to say, but every Hawley product has several, several scenes with an extended, loud and clear music-only or music-high-in-the-mix scene, usually to lazily show the viewer how cool the protagonist or how badass the antagonist is. Once you notice it it‚Äôs all you‚Äôll notice.)"
Aliens,"I only wait the movie not this series. Xenomorphs on Earth before Ripley and after the first Prometheus, why do we need this..."
Aliens,No CGI!
Aliens,‚Ä¶ bro sick
Aliens,So airdate probably early 2025
Aliens,"It'll probably suck, but I'm excited nonetheless."
Aliens,"Hope it doesn‚Äôt get cancelled after two seasons and leave all kinds of plot points unresolved!

The *door* that finally *opens*"
Aliens,Will it be cancelled like Raised by Wolves?
Aliens,Looking forward to this and the new film but I can‚Äôt lie there‚Äôs a part of me that‚Äôs gutted we won‚Äôt get to see the completion of the prequel films. I personally enjoyed covenant and I would‚Äôve at least liked for them to finish that series
Aliens,This crap is really happening?
Aliens,ALIENS is my favorite movie. Noah Hawley is one of my favorite authors. And I love Fargo.  I cannot freakin wait for this!!
Aliens,I did too until I saw Fargo season 4. It wasn't the worst series I've made it through but it was a big step down in quality from the first 3 seasons.
Aliens,He might be the perfect person for this.
Aliens,"After Season 4 of Fargo (the first I didn't finish), I'm a little worried.

This show has the capability to be great, but it has a lot of conceptual red flags going around.  The fact that it seems to be surrounding this transhuman ""lost sister"" plot makes me worry.  Don't get me wrong, I love transhumanist science fiction.  But I also don't want to see the Alien get sidelined in its own show."
Aliens,"Damn, I did not know that fun fact you added. Anywhere you can direct me on where you got that?"
Aliens,"I liked 3 and Resurrection too, as different as they were. And I also ate very well with the AvP games and Isolation.

But yeah the Ridley nustuff was not good and neither were AvP movies."
Aliens,"Xeno = Alien/Strange, Morph = Genetic variant of an animal.

It makes sense to use that word, instead of the generic ""Aliens"", specially after the ""Arcturians"" line or when the franchise is linked with franchises like Predator (which are aliens too). And also if we consider than the aliens adapt to the animal they come from..."
Aliens,"Since 2012, Prometheus was pretty entertaining. Can‚Äôt say the same for Covenant, though."
Aliens,"That's a cool tidbit.


But I'll still call it Xeno. It DOES sound better. In my opinion at least."
Aliens,">unobtanium

That's still very much a real term used by real scientists and researchers."
Aliens,Does that upcoming movie have a name? I haven‚Äôt heard anything about this.
Aliens,"There's plenty to mine from having xenomorphs on Earth and under the control of Weyland-Yutani or whoever else. There was a great graphic novel trilogy in the 90s or early 2000s that covered this: Outbreak - Nightmare Asylum - The Female War.

All done by Mark Verheiden (before he did BSG) when they wouldn't use his script for Alien 3."
Aliens,"Not sure exactly how canon they‚Äôre considered, but Alien vs Predator takes place on Earth, so they‚Äôve been on Earth already, just isolated."
Aliens,"Some of the books have the aliens on Earth, I think. Might not be remembering this exactly but it's something about harvesting alien honey as a cure for something. Technology has advanced enough that we have suits that completely withstand their acid, we can neuter them with pheromones etc"
Aliens,"It's cuz they got all those teeth, but no tooth brush"
Aliens,A human jumped on their mother and pushed her over a cliff.
Aliens,They watched Alien: Covenant
Aliens,"Oh man I can tell you so much about Season 5, ive been watching the pre-production of that series like a hawk.

Here is something: Jon Hamm plays Roy Tillman, the corrupt sheriff of Stark County North Dakota, who has formed a militia and turned his county into a lawless autonomous zone. Roy has built a political persona for himself and his campaign slogan is ""A Hard Man For Hard Times""."
Aliens,"Hasn't the show been anthology seasons so far, with different stories, characters, arcs, etc? I think it's basically zero chance the newest season has anything to do with season 1."
Aliens,I read this in Brian Cox' voice
Aliens,"Honestly, this might be the perfect time.  It's a fanbase that has already seen extremely low lows.  I think it really only has to not be a mess to have people enjoying it. Loving it is a different story."
Aliens,This year üòä
Aliens,I'd say they are pretty much second to HBO in terms of quality series on cable. Their Hulu deal is sweet too.
Aliens,What are you talking about? FX has been killing it
Aliens,Isn't that the general concept of the series?  Even the original Alien was about Ripley and her team.
Aliens,They wanted to do too much. none of the storylines were bad but none had enough time to be good either.
Aliens,Anybody who has seen Lucy in the Sky would not have blind faith in him. It‚Äôs *bad*.
Aliens,Season 4 also suffered heavily because of Covid. So it's somewhat understandable.
Aliens,"It was weird. It was the worst season by far, but the black and white episode was probably my favorite in the entire series."
Aliens,Chris rock just isn't a good actor either.  A lot of those scenes were really hard to watch.
Aliens,"I didn't mind it, I think a good amount of the episodes were finished prior to the pandemic so we can't really blame that.

Although I do think it was next to impossible to do anything that could conceivably compare to the first 3 seasons of this show. We'll see what happens with S5, but I feel like they might want to end it after that just for the sole fact that the bar was set so high with the first several seasons its just hard to duplicate or even come close to reaching that bar."
Aliens,"I agree. It was a huge departure even tonally and I feel that Chris Rock was miscast. I remember wondering how much of the production was hindered by Covid at the time. It‚Äôs unfortunate because I liked the premise, but the execution was just not up to par with the first three seasons (of which I feel #2 was the strongest). It gave me reservations for sure on Hawley‚Äôs handling of the Alien series."
Aliens,I watched the first couple seasons again recently and I've gotta say they don't hold up as well as I hoped. The seams are starting to show. The dude seems like a bit of a hack who did a serviceable job with those first two seasons then made a couple seasons that IMO weren't that good. Not gonna mark my calendar for s05.
Aliens,"Not a hardcore fan but .. it does really sound better. Alien can meaning anything from xenomorph, independence day aliens to E.T. or maybe Paddington.

However Xeno already has this dark vibes swinging with it. While most people obviously (hopefully?) know Xeno just means ""foreigner‚Äú so people should hopefully recognize that Xenomorph is just slang / combo to describe a foreign thing that well .. morphs, drastically changes it‚Äôs form/mutates"
Aliens,https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/the-throwaway-line-in-aliens-that-spawned-decades-of-confusion/
Aliens,"I very much like Alien 3, but the version of it that made it really work as a conclusion to Ripley's story didn't come out until the DVD era. Not a fan of Resurrection, though. 

Isolation is flat-out amazing at making you feel like you're in that world, absolutely. Love that game to death. I don't think the STORY in the game is all that notable, but that's not why the game works anyway, so it just needs to be good enough to get you to the next level/setpiece."
Aliens,I only hated that they killed off Hicks and Newt like they did.   Rest of part 3 was ok.
Aliens,I like ‚Äòem all
Aliens,">Xeno = Alien/Strange, Morph = Genetic variant of an animal.

I didn't say people were confused by what it meant. I said they misunderstood why Gorman was using it, or why Cameron put it in his mouth.

It's not a name for the species. It's a name to specify what a fuckin nitwit Company Man Gorman is.

And then the Fandom started *talking like him*"
Aliens,"Am I alone in wanting a conclusion to David's story, even though Prometheus and Covenant had problems? I hope Scott finishes the trilogy."
Aliens,"I really liked the first 1/3 of Covenant, it felt ""Alien"" but afterwards falls apart into a convoluted mess with so many different things happening at once."
Aliens,"Covenant is a better movie than Prometheus is. Or at least it's more consistent at being what it's trying to be. Prometheus literally doesn't know what it wants to be and halfway through becomes a half-assed Blade Runner movie instead of an Alien one.

Covenant knows what it wants to be from jump and sticks to that pretty solidly. Prometheus is just a confused, frustrating mess (which makes sense once you watch the making-of documentary on the blu-ray).

I wouldn't say either of them are as good as the Alien 3 ""assembly cut,"" which isn't a GREAT movie by any stretch, but is at least - fundamentally broken as it is, even in its best version - better at being a thematic closer to Ellen Ripley's story than either Prometheus or Covenant are at being chapters in the birth of the Alien.

edit: what in the world about those 3 paragraphs is setting people off. Jesus Christ."
Aliens,I also enjoyed Prometheus.
Aliens,I thought it was solid until David shows up
Aliens,"you always were an asshole, Gorman"
Aliens,Alien: Romulus
Aliens,Love that novel series. Great recommendation
Aliens,None of the AvP movies are canon to the original Alien universe. They're just fun alternate history fanfiction films.
Aliens,Aliens Earth War begs to differ. I seem to recall several Aliens stories set on Earth. Before and after Aliens took over.
Aliens,Mah m-m-m-mama says
Aliens,"If you had a double set like they do, I think you would have a hard time cleaning them. I think they have lockjaw from the inner set of teeth moving forward."
Aliens,"I, uh, liked that one better than A^3 and Resurrection"
Aliens,"Sounds interesting. Is it set 2006ish, or did I mishear that?"
Aliens,There's always one character that connects it the previous. I kinda remember Hawley saying in an interview he wanted to do one more season that ties it all together.
Aliens,You better be sniffing your fucking armpit
Aliens,"Yeah I would agree but maybe for different reasons. I think Ridley Scotts contributions have carried the franchise. James Cameron made an awesome action movie, but didn't add to the world that much. So I'm hoping this results in more world building like we saw in Prometheus and covenant"
Aliens,"It‚Äôs not really a Hulu ‚Äúdeal‚Äù. They are just all owned by the same parent company, Disney, and so a guy at a computer is just able to upload and bury it all on Hulu. What I‚Äôm saying is that they are nowhere close to having the same batting average as HBOMax in terms of quality, but they are horrific at marketing. It‚Äôs almost like they are keeping it a secret sometimes. I was just complaining about this earlier but I didn‚Äôt even know that the damn Sex Pistols tv show was out until like a month after it aired. When Hbomax is ready to drop new Game of Thrones, everyone in the WORLD knows about it."
Aliens,I‚Äôm still convinced that COVID messed things up in the later episodes.
Aliens,"Also, it seems that actors known primarily for comedy (Rock + Schwartzman) are not that great at playing believable and intimidating mob bosses..."
Aliens,"I thought the whole ghost thing was out of place (which is odd when I loved the UFO in Season 2) and the whole thing with Satchel being Mike was too on the nose.

Still I love Salvatore Esposito and I'm glad he got to be in a Hollywood production."
Aliens,So like Rome Season 2?
Aliens,I had the displeasure of going to the world premiere. So disappointed. Hawley was there to introduce it and it was clear he knew it was dogshit. He really didn't want to be there - and seemed to almost have contempt for the audience
Aliens,"I only just watched that recently, the first half was alright"
Aliens,Also because of Chris Rock. He's a great comedian but was terrible in Fargo.
Aliens,He gave it a try but he‚Äôs terrible. Saw and Amsterdam sealed it.
Aliens,"did you decide he wasnt a good actor before or after the whole academy awards thing,because its funny how nobody brings up will smith's holier then thou attitude he had before that incident

i will agree with thrillhouse though that the saw movie he was in sucked"
Aliens,"No way S1 was really a well done show, Key & Peele, Billy Bob, Hobbit dude

It may not be Breaking Bad but it‚Äôs really good."
Aliens,"Yea not sure why OP is trying to act like ""Xenomorph"" is some strange hardcore fan only name that should be changed. It's an awesome name and it clearly denotes which movie monster you are talking about. It's not ""satire"", it's a good name. Imagine trying to talk about your favorite movie monsters and being like ""Oh I like the Alien!"" yea which alien. ""You know! The Alien! From... The space... movie..""

The Thing fans already have this issue."
Aliens,"> Not a fan of Resurrection, though.

Resurrection is just not a good movie.  It's too tonally jarring, and took a lot of talented people and put them in a place where they weren't working to their strengths.  The took a talented French arthouse film director and tried to have him make a boilerplate sci-fi film. And then they took a comedic writer and tried to have him write a serious science fiction script.

So what you have is basically an Alien film that is bizarre in both its aesthetic and its plot, trying too hard to be clever and funny while still trying to remain horrific.  Cast with a bunch of fairly good actors who all seem to think they are in different movies.

Alien 3 is a flawed film from a great visionary director like David Fincher, and as much as Fox screwed with him and the production, sending him into shooting with a film where the sets were already half finished, but the script was still being changed, you can see David Fincher's directorial vision stamped all across it.

Resurrection has this weird mishmash of Jean Pierre Jeunet (Amelie, City of Lost Children, Delicatessen) trying to direct a film written by Joss Whedon (at the time, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and rewrites for Speed, Toy Story and Waterworld), as a sequel to a franchise that was dark and horrific body/creature horror set in a bleak corporate future.   Whedon's script not only abandoned the bleak corporate future (there's a deleted scene joke about Weyland Yutani, the company from the first three films, having been bought out by Walmart), Jeunet seemed to struggle with the ""dark and horrific"" part.  About the only part of the film that seemed ""on brand"" is the fairly great scene where she comes across the other Ripley clones. It's the one part of the film where there are no attempts to cram in a joke, a visual gag, or be anything other than horrific, and Jeunet's flair for the bizarre actually helped the film rather than hurt it. 

The main reason some Alien fans hate Alien 3 is they never got over Noot and Hix dying in the opening scene. Otherwise, the Assembly Cut (later remastered as the ""Special Edition"") is a fantastic character piece about sacrifice and redemption.  That original ending where she just falls into the molten lead and the Alien isn't born is incredibly powerful, ruined completely in the theatrical release with a chestbursting scene that removes the sacrifice element. The score by Eliot Goldenthal is top notch too, probably the best of the franchise."
Aliens,Ditto. Will never forgive Alien 3 for that. I was happy to see everyone die in 3. Fucking nihilist bullshit. Watching that movie is like having the flu for two hours.
Aliens,If I remember correctly it had something to do with contracts or some such? There is a back story to that you should look up to that script I know it‚Äôs enlightening
White Teeth,At the point you‚Äôre at they‚Äôve only been on the island a little bit and have a bunch of toiletries from luggage. They definitely look a lot more haggard as the show goes on.
White Teeth,">	white teeth and don‚Äôt look the least bit like people stranded on an island trying to survive.

You have some kind of idea that your teeth will rot out of your head as soon as you stop regular brushing but that's just not accurate, especially in the age of dental sealants.

Prior to the advent of the Caribbean sugar trade, people rarely had cavities or gum disease and usually didn't do any mouth care except rinsing and periodically picking bits out with a pick."
White Teeth,"The first 3 seasons are across like 108 days.  Hair fine, teeth you see people using plants to brush.  It‚Äôs such a random thing to nitpick when there‚Äôs plenty available or you can just enjoy it for the great show it was especially when it comes to character development."
White Teeth,Within the first few episodes there's a scene where Sun finds something in the jungle that takes the place of the toothbrush and teaches Walt how to use it. They literally dedicated a scene on this subject.
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,FWIW I really rate Lost highly for their insistence on access to fresh drinkable water. They did well.
White Teeth,"Some things along these lines actually will get explained.   Teeth is easy though, they have lots of peoples luggage which is going to include toothbrushes / toothpaste.  The hair you just have to accept but if you didnt notice the women do go without makeup.  You'll see flashback scenes of Kate with makeup and she looks much different."
White Teeth,Lost is not a show about survival despite what the synopsis say. It's a sci-fi/fantasy show.
White Teeth,"Jesus what a stupid, petty complaint. Even dumber than people complaining than Hurley never lost weight. Not to mention they haven‚Äôt even really been there that long. Not long enough to ruin your teeth."
White Teeth,I love Lost but Hurley staying the same size always bothered me.
White Teeth,"That happens on TV, the walking dead is the same way."
White Teeth,You are already past the point that the extras match up. First half of the season they were able to make it look like they had the same crew of extras. Made you think they would maintain that forever.  Then ether they stopped trying or just couldn't keep it going.
White Teeth,"That‚Äôll be the Least of your issues, once you get to the final season‚Ä¶"
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,I always wonder how awkward it is when someone walks to Sawyer and asks for tampons.
White Teeth,"How exactly do you think folks survived before toothpaste/brush combs, were all invented?"
White Teeth,You've just described a British soap opera.
White Teeth,"there's a wide chasm between 'bad' and 'perfect'. Bad isn't the only other option besides perfect.

That wide chasm is where creative design enters the picture. If the show had good wardrobe design, it would be able to stray from the narrow corridor of 'fashion perfection' for different scenarios in a show."
White Teeth,"Everyone is still wearing makeup, but it's a ""natural"" look."
White Teeth,Why?  There was a whole storyline centered around him stealing food.
White Teeth,"The fact that over 15 people can manage to find enough food to feed themselves is pushing it in itself. There's only so many boars, fruit trees or fish I can imagine they can find."
White Teeth,"The real mystery of Walking Dead, is who the fuck is mowing all the lawns?"
White Teeth,"You probably think they were dead the whole time, don‚Äôt you"
White Teeth,"First couple seasons were pretty good but they obviously had no plan and just made it up from week to week. I will say if them having nice hair is ruining it, probably not gonna have a good time when the show goes off the rails a couple seasons in."
White Teeth,This is a spoiler. A major one. Why are you telling a first time watcher the names of characters he hasn't seen yet?
White Teeth,Hey...our hair is fine thank you very much!
White Teeth,PALLOTS of food
White Teeth,"Season one takes place over the course of 44 days. That's not that long. The show explicitly goes out of its way to show how food from the plane was being rationed initially, on top of characters like Jin and Locke hunting and fishing, as well as people freaking out about food supply shortages, such as when Locke abandons boar hunting for his hatch obsession. And the island is *huge*--there's more than enough for people to survive for that long. People aren't just eating nonstop. And as other people have pointed out in this thread, season two addresses these things even more in a *very* direct way."
White Teeth,Mate keep watching. All this gets slowly explained.
White Teeth,"The grass got infected too so it has become zombie grass, never growing."
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,It's gotta be to distract from our teeth.
White Teeth,They also had a whole storyline showing how/why the pallets of food kept showing up.
White Teeth,"You're wrong. But I won't explain it because OP is a first time watcher.
And it's not only the names. Why sway a first time watcher with your misguided opinions on some of the characters? Let him make up his own mind."
White Teeth,"If you haven't already seen it, check out Hannibal. You'll probably like the way it looks."
White Teeth,"As a huge fan of the book for many years (having even planned vacations around visiting places in the book), I was terrified that they were going to fuck it up with the show. 

The first episode was *awesome*. The casting, the cinematography, the music. I'm thrilled, and shocked, by what a great job they appear to be doing. I hope the rest of the season hold up to Ep1, I have high hopes. "
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,Am I the only one who thinks the effects are pretty terrible looking? I've seen better SFX on the CW.
White Teeth,Yeah it was good. I love Swearingen. I just realised that is his name because he swears. Looking forward to the rest of the series. I've read the book but I cannot remember much. I loved it though. I remember that much. Opening titles are boss. 
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,Should I read the books first? Or could I watch it and then still enjoy the show while reading in tandem?
White Teeth,The sound editing was terrible. In some parts it was really hard to understand anything through the carpet of music and effects.
White Teeth,"Really enjoyed it. Thought it did a good job adapting the book, and it works and looks fantastic on the screen. 

I'm excited to finally have another show on TV to be excited about."
White Teeth,"We've only seen the pilot though, it's very possible that the quality declines. Hopefully it doesn't."
White Teeth,Shadow moon has a JO video FYI.....
White Teeth,"Haha, this is a Bryan Fuller staple and very much a signature thing. I love it since it does add something unique, but does get in the way of judging the show on it's own merits."
White Teeth,"glad to see I'm not the only one who found the oversaturated colors and buckets of blood as over-the-top.  I'm interpreting it as a signal that Shadow is experiencing it all in a somewhat dream-like state.  Everything is exaggerated on purpose to give the viewer the sense of magical reality.

btw, the ""black lady"" is Bilquis/Queen Sheeba: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Sheba
looking up the background of the dieties has helped me enjoy the book so much more.

edit: word"
White Teeth,"upvote for Hannibal, can't recommend this show enough"
White Teeth,Pushing Daisies used color in a phenomenal way as well. Really beautifully filmed. Very different from Hannibal though. 
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,"I love the cinematography of Hannibal, even in S3 when it might've gotten a tad too pretentious, but I felt like it was a little much with American Gods so far. I guess I just don't appreciate the surreal elements as much when you don't spend enough time in a base reality to contrast it too. Felt like the show was just jumping from one trippy dream to the next."
White Teeth,Hannibal had amazing cinematography. Sometimes it went a little overboard with its imagery but it somehow made disgusting things look beautiful haha 
White Teeth,"Or maybe not.

My only problem with the first episode was it felt like Hannibal instead of its own unique thing."
White Teeth,If american gods is as good as Hannibal I will be sooo happy
White Teeth,"I guarantee it

Source: Men's Warehouse   "
White Teeth,"My wife finished the book just before episode one and she loved it. Her only complaint is that the technology kid's supposed to be fat, apparently. "
White Teeth,"The show follows the book so well that there is this feeling of ""Have I seen this show before"" to it. Such wonderful respect to source material. "
White Teeth,"As such a huge fan of the book, what is it particularly that you love about it? I was really hyped but I've gotten past the reveal and can't bring myself to finish it."
White Teeth,"yes I love pushing daisies.

Really too bad about that show"
White Teeth,Can you imagine if that writer's strike had actually gone through the other day? He'd be pulling his hair out.
White Teeth,"Do you know where to find this show??  I've wanted to watch Pushing Daisies for a while, but I can't find it streaming anywhere. "
White Teeth,"thank you!

Book and TV series‚Ä¶ Two different things!"
White Teeth,"I think it gives it this over-the-top comic book feel to it, which I happen to like, but I could see how some people might find it too cheesy. I feel like it adds to the surreal events that happen throughout the show."
White Teeth,Wow so it's not just me . Many of the CGI looked shoddy - shadow's wife inside jail cell to blood spill in the end - pretty mediocre of you ask me
White Teeth,"It's definitely not great. Very True Blood / Sparacus level buckets of blood. Actually, True Blood was probably better. 

Still interested in the show though."
White Teeth,"While watching the show I couldn't stop thinking how the monotone darkish effects make it look like a horrible low-budget production. So yea,in full agreement on this one.... 
Even story wise the show just doesn't cut it."
White Teeth,"Not sure if joking. [Al Swearengen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Swearengen) was an actual person in the real Deadwood, like a good 80 percent of the characters from that show."
White Teeth,"I find it funny that people expect shows to spell everything out in the first episode. The book is the same way, in that you're in the same shoes as Shadow in not knowing what's going on. He is the vessel for you to learn about the gods. As it goes on, you uncover more and the seemingly one off vignettes (like Bilquis) tie together with the main story. You have to give it time. People who haven't read the book are acting like the first episode was the most confusing thing ever made, and it's really not. It wasn't hard to follow."
White Teeth,"> it didn't even try to make any sense at all

That's largely in keeping with the book.  For example, the weird sex scene of which you make mention appears out of nowhere in the show, and it does the same in the book. It's just there. The book just branches off to tell us what some gods are doing. However, the book-- and probably the show since it seems to follow the book closely-- makes more sense as it progresses."
White Teeth,"This! The music was consistently irritating, and scenes which would have been much better served with silence instead had droning, too-loud background music that took me completely out of the story.  I LOVE the book, but if the music supervisor doesn't take it down a notch I may give up on the show."
White Teeth,I agree I really wanted to like this show but the first episode was very off putting. Don't think I'll continue watching.  Never read the book but heard a lot of good stuff.
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,"I haven't read the books at all and I loved it.

some people are complaining It was confusing‚Ä¶ I wasn't confused at all. I mean there are a ton of unanswered questions, but that's to be expected

then again, I like shows whereyou don't really know what's going on rright away. Keeps me interested"
White Teeth,Up to you. If you like being surprised then I wouldn't read the book yet. But if you're like me and you can't hold off that long then just go for it. They are changing some stuff so even people that have read the book won't know everything that's going to happen
White Teeth,I think the quality declines within the episode. I could watch more of that narrated Viking history for hours.
White Teeth,where?
White Teeth,This is because people forget that this sort of thing is down to the cinematographer.
White Teeth,"I think I only watched an episode or two of that show, so I can't recall at all."
White Teeth,Dead Like Me had an overall duller color pallette and then certain elements we're brighter for contrast. 
White Teeth,"I wasn't particularly hooked either. It felt aloof. 

But I'm willing to go along for the ride and see where they'll take me."
White Teeth,Season 3 of Hannibal are my favourite season. It was amazing and so crazy. 
White Teeth,"bhikshubliss, i agree w/ you 100%. i felt the same way (your wrote) about FX's show LEGION as well. "
White Teeth,"That's just how the book is too though. It hops around a lot. It all gets tied together, you just have to stick with it."
White Teeth,"> My only problem with the first episode was it felt like Hannibal instead of its own unique thing.

Auteur TV."
White Teeth,"I'm not trying to argue with you but I don't understand why if one liked the way American Gods looked, they might not also like the way Hannibal looks-- Hannibal (especially after the first season) looks very similar to American Gods. Certainly more similar than any other show. "
White Teeth,"He was fat and pimply in the book, but Gaiman approved some updating of the characters that he thought were improvements/needed due to modernization of technology. So now the tech god is more like a startup CEO stereotype vs. an outdated computer nerd stereotype."
White Teeth,"There was osme reasoning behind that that I read a while ago. Basically, when the book was written the stereotype of the ""techie"" was fat/greasy/acne etc and smoked cigarettes, but that techies have evolved to more of the show version (vaping, millenial, hipster hair), so that was fine by me. "
White Teeth,"Yes! I feel like I have been burned so many times in the past by film adaptations, but this is just so perfect. Every single character and scene meshes so well with the pictures in my head, its kinda creepy. "
White Teeth,"With a few exceptions. It seems insanely brutal constantly and it also looks like Shadow is gonna figure out the whole gods thing practically already. That digital contraption made things a lot weirder earlier too. 

But except that I felt exactly the same. So familiar it was like I'd already seen it. "
White Teeth,"TBH, I think the book just clicked with me because it combined a lot of things I love anyway. I've always had a soft spot for mythology and Americana. I like to read things that are a little dark and a little magical. I love roadside attractions, too! So if you take all of those things and mash them up you pretty much get American Gods. 

Additionally, I've read the book a few times over the years and each time I relate to a different character and get something else out of the book. I can certainly understand that it's not for everyone, though!"
White Teeth,It's streaming on all the less-than-legitimate sites I've seen.
White Teeth,[deleted]
White Teeth,It was on CWs seed app for a while
White Teeth,You can buy it on Amazon Video for $2/episode.
White Teeth,Get ad-block if you already have it. http://project-free-tv.li/free/pushing-daisies-season-1/
White Teeth,Source material and something based on the source material! I expect the thing based on source material to be wildly different in every aspect!
White Teeth,"The visuals make it look kind of like a play to me, as if I'm the God watching this performance of an epic story. 

I think that's why I like it at least, I have been searching for the right words but it seems tough haha. I get why people wouldn't like the buffalo with flaming eyes for example, but for some reason the kind of puppet-like look to it worked for me. And I don't even like plays, I just think the look really fits with the world."
White Teeth,"It think he meant the terrible CGI animations and rendering. For example those dream sequences where you can tell they cheaped out on render farm time. I nearly started laughing when the noose came down in the dream sequence. It was just so terribly animated and rendered.

You're probably talking about all the CGI blood and particle effects in live scenes. Those look dope, gives it that comicbook/Spartacus feel."
Familiar Wife,Righteous Gemstones is lampooning Christian mega churches. It‚Äôs not a religious show.
Familiar Wife,"I'm a big fan of Danny McBride and Co.


What I love most is his ability to let his co-stars shine. Alot of writers who also act would want to have the best lines but in all his shows his co-stars are the ones who truly bring the laughs. Stevie is my favourite comedy character ever."
Familiar Wife,All three are top notch. You don't need to be a Christian to enjoy Gemstones lol
Familiar Wife,"Kenny Powers is his greatest role and it's not even close

Too many quotables"
Familiar Wife,"In reference to The Righteous Gemstones, a satirical take on the lives of a family that runs an Evangelical megachurch, you said:
‚Äú‚Ä¶but outside of the religious tone it was pretty great.‚Äù 

What in the hell is even that?"
Familiar Wife,"If you want to dig through the internet you might be able to find an old clip of him on his promo tour for ""The Foot Fist Way"" (dark comedy about a shitty kids karate instructor) where he was on Late Night with Conan back in the mid 00's. He came on in character with some of his students to do a karate demonstration (punching boards, flips, etc.) and was berating the kids constantly for screwing up.

This was before people knew who Danny McBride was so they thought it was some drunk guy legitimately yelling at kids for ruining his big late night appearance and the audience was *very* uncomfortable the whole time (Conan as well, maybe he was in on it, I don't know). I remember watching it when it aired and feeling the same then seeing him in Tropic Thunder or something the next year and laughing my ass off realizing what he did."
Familiar Wife,"All three are great but Vice Principals is the best imo. It really benefits from having such a tight storyline that appropriately evolves throughout the entire show and a satisfying finale. It just feels like such a complete story with no filler or boring, distracting b and c plots to fill time. Not only are the characters fantastic (Lee Russel is the funnest character out of all three shows imo) but the way the show changes course or changes tone throughout the story is really fun. Great pacing."
Familiar Wife,"If you haven't seen it already, This is the End is an absolutely hilarious Danny McBride performance."
Familiar Wife,‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fuckin out!‚Äù
Familiar Wife,The Foot Fist Way
Familiar Wife,"I too just showed these to my girlfriend and she loved them. 

They do an incredible job of humanizing awful people.

Agree that Vice Principals is the best one."
Familiar Wife,I‚Äôm from Southeast NC and I love Righteous Gemstones! Hits the nail precisely on the head as far as Christian hypocrisy goes. Also love his other comedies. Dude is one of NC‚Äôs favorite sons!
Familiar Wife,everything he has been in is fucking amazing. and walton goggins ffs same thing.
Familiar Wife,"i've been trying to let everyone know about the gemstones. a couple episodes into the second season and i think it's just as good as eastbound and down, which i think is one of the funniest shows ever made. the crew that makes these shows just nails the type of comedy they are going for. always perfect casting too."
Familiar Wife,"Vice Principals is illegally funny. 

I went on a Danny McBride rampage after Righteous Gemstones, and VP was soo goddamn funny. Man what a series lol."
Familiar Wife,"The frustration in his voice when he screams (I think in episode 1, it's really early) ""I'm Kenny Powers!"" during an argument with his brother is hysterical to me. I can't not crack up watching it. The prince trying to command the tides."
Familiar Wife, McBride is funny as hell especially if you grew up white trash and actually knew people like his characters. Saying he nails it is an understatement.
Familiar Wife,"Eastbound & Down is super awesome, Vice Principals is really great.

I wish these were available on Netflix!"
Familiar Wife,How in the absolute fuck could Edi Patterson not get mentioned in this post????
Familiar Wife,"The man is absolutely top tier. 

I'd fallen off of Eastbound and down and never gone back to it, then watched vice principals as it was airing and ended up going back to eastbound and down while waiting for VP S2. What a fuckin treat that was. Don't know why I ever stopped watching I'm the first place."
Familiar Wife,Did you feel it in YOUR PLUMMMMS?
Familiar Wife,‚ÄúI love you in a make me cum kind of way‚Äù
Familiar Wife,"I actually found S2 of Gemstones to be pretty bad.  Especially Kelvins storyline, that shit was absolutely awful."
Familiar Wife,"> McBride's first HBO show, it started off to be a little mediocre

You are saying this precisely because you watched the other shows first.  At the the time EB&D came out, it was a monster hit and the talk of every water cooler in every office."
Familiar Wife,"Not my cup of tea.  I gave up on him after Eastbound and Down when I decided he always plays the same loud obnoxious narcissist character.

People tell me that Righteous Gemstones is good but I am now at the point that I won't enjoy something just because he is in it."
Familiar Wife,"I really haven't been able to get into Righteous Gemstones. Adam Devine is extremely grating and is too transparent of an actor - even when he's playing different versions of himself, he's still always basically just himself. 

I couldn't stand Edi Falco in Vice Principals so I don't know if I can handle her increased role here."
Familiar Wife,"I liked VP, gemstones was alright. East Bound (I know came before) but I just didn't like it."
Familiar Wife,"> Vice Principals, and Eastbound & Down

Ugh, no."
Familiar Wife,Interesting I‚Äôve always heard Season 2 of EB&D fell off but came back strong in season 3
Familiar Wife,He don‚Äôt miss! I‚Äôve loved every show he‚Äôs made.
Familiar Wife,Who wants to suck an old man‚Äôs dick?
Familiar Wife,I fuckin' love his shows.
Familiar Wife,"I could not agree with this more. I had the same realization in the winter. I‚Äôve always been a huge McBride fan (Eastbound & Down is hilarious) but I didn‚Äôt see Vice Principals or Gemstones until this year.

And as much as I love Eastbound & Down, I absolutely love Vice Principals. Yes the whole Gamby/Russell thing is classic and insanely funny, I couldn‚Äôt get enough"
Familiar Wife,Danny mcbride and walto goggins is a good duo
Familiar Wife,"Gemstones is fantastic, it starts out trying to make you hate everyone but with time you actually grow sympathetic to most of them and realize that while they're kind of shitty people that take advantage of people's faith, they're mostly just a product of their environment, and all have a good side and slowly grow as characters."
Familiar Wife,"great rec, thank you"
Familiar Wife,"At the same time, it‚Äôs pretty respectful to religion/Christianity. It doesn‚Äôt mock Christians, even the ones who might find an appeal in a megachurch. Even the Gemstones- their faith is not what makes them foolish and they seem to believe in what they are doing."
Familiar Wife,I really don‚Äôt understand how OP can watch that much Danny McBride stuff and still get wooshed so hard that he thinks Gemstones is a religious show lmao
Familiar Wife,"In Stevies voice: ""A sock on the the doorknob is the international sign that someone is getting laid. AND IT WAS ME DOOOG!"""
Familiar Wife,I feel like christians would be the minority in liking it. Especially the groups that love Joel Osteen
Familiar Wife,"Right. In my eyes the show shits on religion, especially the mega churches."
Familiar Wife,Practice is the crutch of the talentless
Familiar Wife,I can throw a ball faster than fuck!
Familiar Wife,"""Can I wear the Scream mask? The mask from Scream? When I do you from behind?"""
Familiar Wife,Hehehe...what's his name? Shrek?
Familiar Wife,"They also said Eastbound and Down ""started off to be a little mediocre"" so it's important to remember that anyone, literally anyone even the bar drunk, can make a post in this sub with their all important opinions."
Familiar Wife,"My thought too. Does op think the show is trying to glorify Christianity? Or that they are trying to proselytize? If so, the whole theme just went way over their head."
Familiar Wife,Daddy chill
Familiar Wife,the foot fist way is a translation of Tae Kwon Do
Familiar Wife,"Conan was definitely in on it, he just has to play the straight man for the joke."
Familiar Wife,and awesome soundtrack
Familiar Wife,To me Vice Principals just was not consistently funny. It had some great highs but only one or two an episode. The first season of EB&D is unquestionably his best work in my opinion.
Familiar Wife,"Big Agree, I like Danny as much as the next person, but his schtick, is just that. We are always gonna see Danny being Danny. I loved that even though he still did his routine, the whole show just lampoons himself nonstop. Same with Goggins, and I'm not gonna spoil for those that haven't watched it. Just do yourself a favor and binge Vice Principles."
Familiar Wife,"The man plays very slight variations of essentially the exact same character in everything that he does, and it‚Äôs fucking hysterical every time. His character intro in *This Is The End* is to this day one of the funniest [scenes](https://youtu.be/ckJygL_Bq84) I‚Äôve ever watched"
Familiar Wife,I've been dropping loads around this fucking house like a dumptruck!
Familiar Wife,"This is the End was the first time I've ever found him funny. Now, he's grown on me. Vice Principals and Gemstones are both fantastic, but his earlier work leaves me really cold."
Familiar Wife,"""You're just being petty... Tom Petty!"""
Familiar Wife,[Fred Simmons was on Conan ](https://novids.com/video/2468596_456239101#).
Familiar Wife,Probably because of all the Hep C loads everywhere
Familiar Wife,"> I couldn't stand Edi Falco in Vice Principals so I don't know if I can handle her increased role here.

I'm not sure you're watching the show you think you are"
Familiar Wife,"Ah, glad to hear. I‚Äôve avoided the show because I assumed it was dumping on Christianity"
Familiar Wife,It‚Äôs called not alienating a large swath of your target audience. Never a bad idea ‚Ä¶
Familiar Wife,"If Die Hard can be a Christmas movie, then Righteous Gemstones can be a religious show, I say."
Familiar Wife,I'm 10ft tall and strong as a ox
Familiar Wife,"""I was dwiving?"""
Familiar Wife,"Agreed. Unless they have a good sense of humor about their faith, Christians would detest Gemstones."
Familiar Wife,I put on broadcast TV at 6am this morning.    A worship show was starting.   It was SO MUCH THE SAME.   Catchy ditty being sung live and everything!
Familiar Wife,Osteen types would hate it but the show is always very careful to never make fun of faith just grifters.  The jokes are also ten thousand percent funnier when someone knows what in the real world they are referencing.  McBride was raised in a church and it shows.
Familiar Wife,"It shits on mega churches and hypocritical religious folks but I think it's pretty tolerant and respectful of Christianity as a whole. Like, believing in god or christian views are essentially never the joke but rather the people and culture and how they abuse them are."
Familiar Wife,"Look at ya'll, jumpin' around like a bunch of child molesters in Chuck  E Cheese"
Familiar Wife,"...so that is why I am better than everyone in the world. Kiss my ass and suck my dick, everyone."
Familiar Wife,"Lol exactly, the first season of Eastbound is by far the best."
Familiar Wife,"If he is anything like me, stories about religion/religious people bore him. It doesnt matter if it glorifies or not. I just dont want to see it. Everyone can believe in what they want, im not bothered by it, as long as they dont use it as justification to make life worse for others. This happens a lot unfortunately and it has gotten to a point where hearing about it exhausts me (just look at the whole abortion thing recently. We have really big problems in the world and these people are still stuck on that, like its 1890). So even in entertainment I try to avoid the topic. No matter how it is portrayed."
Familiar Wife,"I felt the opposite and think Vice Principals is the most consistently funny of the bunch. Maybe it‚Äôs setting or the characters that just land with me more, but I think it‚Äôs way ahead of the other two. Easy Bound and Down was honestly my least favorite by a country mile. I had the same feeling for that one that you do for Vice Principals, it‚Äôd get a laugh here and there but most of the time I thought it was meh"
Familiar Wife,*\~Fatalities\~*
Familiar Wife,Edi Patterson was obviously what I meant.
Familiar Wife,It‚Äôs not dumping on Christianity at all imo. It‚Äôs really hyper-focused on showing the flaws/hypocrisy of an absurdly rich family that runs a megachurch. Regular parishioners are never made fun of.
Familiar Wife,"The show has an unironically good soundtrack full of country/southern Christian songs (not talking about the songs performed by the cast)

The only aspect it seems to mock is vapid modern praise music"
Familiar Wife,Thank goodness you're safe
Familiar Wife,"As a Christian, anything that mocks the mega churches makes me happy. They're like 90% of what Jesus preached against in the Bible. 

And even ignoring my faith, the show was just fantastic anyways. Edi Patterson (Judy) is so amazing in it."
Familiar Wife,"I think McBride and Edi Patterson kinda grew up in that world, hence why they're so spot on with it."
Familiar Wife,"Which was pleasantly surprising. I went into it expecting ""Christians dumb lol"" but it really wasn't that. The Gemstones are believers and truly think they're doing the right thing, especially Eli."
Familiar Wife,"Yeah I'm the same. I'm just over hearing about Christianity or dealing in its mythologies. Being in the west it's the most prevalent and ubiquitous religion. Shows that center on religious individuals are generally a turn off for me. But I'm glad I checked this show out.

I'm pretty sure this sentiment is exactly what OP meant. People either can't understand the notion or are offended by it."
Familiar Wife,Misbehavin'!
Familiar Wife,"I'm fine with either, I do think religion is a very stupid thing to genuinely believe in. But cool that it isn't the main crux of the show."
Familiar Wife,"I watched the show, too. Because I like Danny McBride and the rest of the cast. Its okay, but any other theme I would have preferred. Vice Principal‚Äôs was awesome."
Familiar Wife,"If that was mockery, they fucked up, because ""Misbehavin'"" is a banger"
Familiar Wife,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt‚Äôs destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Familiar Wife,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Familiar Wife,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn‚Äôt get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Familiar Wife,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Familiar Wife,[deleted]
Familiar Wife,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Familiar Wife,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Familiar Wife,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Familiar Wife,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There‚Äôs frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn‚Äôt be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don‚Äôt see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Familiar Wife,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."

Familiar Wife,"They should have played the opening animated intro (not the CG) to Witcher 3. Briefly explains magic, the conjunction, witchers, people's attitude toward both, and touched on the wild hunt.

Code Lyoko,Was great until they made it live action
Code Lyoko,Yes! I watched Code Lyoko when I was a little girl. I remember my mom was sick of having to hear me sing the theme song every single time I finished an episode üòÇ
Code Lyoko,Holy shit this is that show from my memory that I remember watching and loving but completely forgot what it was called so I could never find it. Thank you for this.
Code Lyoko,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn9zTBZVl6lu72s-6fXttZg
Code Lyoko,"That show was my childhood. If they bring it back, they need the original creators. American producers and CN would ruin it."
Code Lyoko,Yes! One of my favorites.
Code Lyoko,Great show!!
Code Lyoko,yus. 
Code Lyoko,That was my shit when I was a kid. I found a YouTube channel that is nothing but the episodes in order 
Code Lyoko,"I enjoyed it somewhat but to me it was always like a replacement for ReBoot. And I just wanted ReBoot back.

"
Code Lyoko,This is a name I haven't heard in awhile.
Code Lyoko,"Great to see it mentioned here. Loved that show, always watched after school."
Code Lyoko,"Ah, memories. I loved watching that show when I was younger. The theme song was pretty catchy, too."
Code Lyoko,"I haven't seen it in years, but it still has one of my favorite premises for a kids show: a team of teens at a boarding school who have access to a secret lab that lets them enter a digital realm where they have to fight to reset the timeline after the weekly catastrophic event happens in reality? Brilliant.

Also, the theme song is still very catchy to this day."
Code Lyoko,"Yep, I used to rush home after school just to watch Code Lyoko, and sing the theme song at the top of my lungs..  I still watch it on [YouTube](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8E15wc0MoOap139fhJcf-o8xL7YY416C) sometimes..

Code Lyoko,"Yes yes. Omg yes. I love the company Marathon. They make some great shows

But for real Code Lyoko was an amazing show. I didn't even notice the 5heads they all were sporting. Show was amazing "
Code Lyoko,I rewatched it a few years back. It's not bad but I feel as if we're seeing it through Nostalgia goggles.  It was mostly episodic and those episodes were really generic and predictable. 
Code Lyoko,I watched here and there after school. Wasn't my favorite but it wasn't bad either. The opening theme was amazing.

Code Lyoko,"Reboot is getting another series called ReBoot: The Guardian Code.

IIRC, it's going to be live-action, though."
Code Lyoko,I still do
Code Lyoko,"Yup! Came out around 2013, used a live-action cast for the school scenes and new CG models for Lyoko. I myself was very excited to find out they were dubbing it...until they only dropped one episode with 60s Godzilla-style dubbing."
Code Lyoko,Have that intro on my iPod. I love that song
Code Lyoko,"It's recently started to remind me of Cher's ""Believe""."
Code Lyoko,I think that's their point. That changing it to American animators/etc. would ruin it.
Code Lyoko,"The original creators made the show good. For a show from France, it wasn't bad. If it was the early 2000s and it was made in America, I think it would've been just as good.

If they brought it back and it was made by American animators and put on Cartoon Network, it would look just like something straight out of Teen Titans Go.

As the seasons went on, the animation and 3D improved by a lot. Season 5, IIRC, wasn't made by the same people, and was on a lower budget, which was why it was live-action.

Plus, if it was a terrible show, why are you here? lol"

Code Lyoko,"Like many small studios, they might have been the victims of their own success. You create something as groundbreaking as ReBoot and suddenly everyone wants your business. You go from working on passion projects to trying to meet deadlines for those of other people, and things slowly go to crap. It's like with the video game company ""Rare."" When we think of the good old days, it was back when they were tiny. Same story with other legendary companies.

It's just sad that The Guardian Code doesn't have any of the original creators on board. In a way, thank god, but it shows that Netflix is only interested in the property and not the reason it was successful."
Code Lyoko,"Don't compare Pixar to other studios, it just isn't the same. Not just creative output, but they don't really have to worry about budget or anything like smaller studios. 

It's a terrible time to be a CGI studio that isn't named Pixar. Bidding for projects gets brutal, and ends up with budgets being too low for quality for most. Then add in burn out from animators and modelers, not to mention everyone else, all while salaries and job security are low. Everyone talks about easy CG is, but it's more art than telling computers to make a good show. 

Another thing, i was job hunting in animation in the mid 90s, when Mainframe was hot, and i don't know if it's still the case, but they had major incentives to hire Canadians over anyone else. Yes, there are very talented Canadians, but it might limit their pool of talent, and might not be able to compete with salary. 

That said, the Reboot remake is a fucking travesty. "
Code Lyoko,"Barbie: Life in a Dreamhouse was a fantastic show.

I am not kidding. It was very funny and smartly written."
Code Lyoko,Ok i want to ask now: did anything change for 4 years?

Wow,I guess you are right about that and it seems that these things happen to small companies let's hope I don't en up in this type of fate.

Code Lyoko,"The only thing I really remember about this show was that every time the old man had an assignment for the girls he would forcibly kidnap them from their school using some really elaborate mechanical trap and transport them to his secret base.

I always admired that; most people would get lazy after a while and just call them on their phones to tell them about their next spy assignment or whatever.

Code Lyoko,I remember in like 2014 I was friends with this girl whose boyfriend got drunk and started talking about how when he was a teen he had a crush on Sam from Totally Spies and he used to jerk off to her all the time after he came home from school and turned on Cartoon Network lmao I was like ‚Äúah cool‚Äù
Code Lyoko,"This show, teen titans, code lyoko, megas XLR and fosters home changed the way I viewed animation /art for the better.

Miguzi was the shit when you came home from school and I hate how they ended it"
Code Lyoko,Someone realized there were fetishes they still hadn't used
Code Lyoko,Now give me Martin Mystery.
Code Lyoko,Meh. Lemme know when Martin Mystery returns.
Code Lyoko,Ok what about Martin Mystery‚Äôs
Code Lyoko,Are they preschoolers now? That's all the rage these days. Ruining cartoons from my teen years by turning the characters into infants. CN is about to do it again to Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.
Code Lyoko,"I remember they played this show at a dentist I'd go to.

I enjoyed Nick more than CN because they had more live action shows didnt solely depend on animated shows."
Code Lyoko,Ah totally spies a friend told me it‚Äôs one of the shows who ‚Äúmade‚Äù her gay‚Ä¶oh god are we finally going to get the yuri bait episode that she has always joked about.
Code Lyoko,"Let‚Äôs be honest...

More guys watch this show than girls do. üòÇ"
Code Lyoko,"Don‚Äôt even know what this is, but was reminded of the movie Top Secret."
Code Lyoko,This show was never good. Most episodes were just The Writers‚Äô Barely Disguised Fetish. Look it up and prepare to have your childhood ruined.
Code Lyoko,Oh my god. I loved this show!!
Code Lyoko,Why are you linking an article from January? This isn't news.
Code Lyoko,Has it really been 20 years?
Code Lyoko,Hot Take: GLADIS wasn‚Äôt terrible.
Code Lyoko,French fetish fuel French fetish fuel French fetish fuel!!!
Code Lyoko,Who‚Äôs ready to discover some new fetishes?
Code Lyoko,Please help save The Wilds by signing our petition found on IG wildwavescampaign. Thank you so much ü•π #RenewTheWilds #SaveTheWilds
Code Lyoko,I was born on 2001 (aka when the first season aired) so I grew up with the show. I think what made ts popular was the aesthetics of the show and the personalities of the characters. Back then and even now I can‚Äôt name one cartoon show that‚Äôs exactly like totally spies or that got so much creativity and thought to every episode like ts.
Code Lyoko,"What I really miss about this show is

Clover: *getting a new crush every 2 sec*"

"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He‚Äôs going on about something and they think he‚Äôs done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes ‚ÄúJesus wept‚Äù under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","There‚Äôs a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it‚Äôs a must watch."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","James gets hate online?! He‚Äôs so nice to everyone though, I don‚Äôt see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",What business have you with Seamus!?
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt üòÇ Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‚Äònormal‚Äô view of life."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","‚ÄúAm I dead? Is this my wake?‚Äù 
Love that show"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","This is a fact.

It‚Äôs 3 perfect seasons - with a 12/10 finale bit

It‚Äôs wholesome and sad and funny and perfect"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","i‚Äôve re watched the first two seasons probably at least 20 times in the past year and a half. it‚Äôs easy to just have on repeat and play in the background. it‚Äôs short and sweet, but i‚Äôm still catching things i missed. truly an amazing show!!!"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Yes, the show has so much to offer. Satisfying character development, laughs abound and of course some sweet tender looks at the humanity of the family during ‚ÄúThe Troubles‚Äù. Very unique."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","It‚Äôs one of the best pilots of any show. 

James not being able to use the teachers bathroom. The old nun that steals from the girls and then Michelle‚Äôs mom saying ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm late they shut down the bridge. I told them to let me risk it but didn‚Äôt‚Äù"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Love Sister Michael!!
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I was recently thinking uncle Colm's monologue about Tommy Duddy eating paper is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, I was genuinely howling at that"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",truly one of the funniest and best shows in recent memory.  husband and i had to watch with subtitles on since we're american.  it managed to take a difficult and dark situation and make it absolutely hilarious -- charming and beautiful and bittersweet.  all the characters and the actors who played them were phenomenal.  i wish more of my friends would watch this so i could talk about it with them.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I‚Äôve been to Ireland twice to see family and explore and during my last trip while in Derry we caught them filming the episode the president visited lol. It was an awesome experience and now whenever I show people the episode I tell them ‚ÄúI was right there off screen!‚Äù Lol
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I ugly-cried at the series finale- I was totally incapacitated. The perfect blend of hope, trepidation, and just extreme sadness to realize the toll that the troubles have taken on their adolescence - a transformative bit of TV."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","It took me like 2 years, but when I finally gave it a chance, it had some really solid moments, and reminds me a lot of Father Ted in the comedic delivery and hijinx"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Probably the best comedic written show since Arrested Development. It bums me out that I only know like 2 other people that have watched it
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I‚Äôm American, but was in High School (catholic all girls high school, even) during the early 90‚Äôs, so this show is absolutely gold to me. 

The writing is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal, and it‚Äôs just so, so fucking funny. I‚Äôve watched the whole thing through countless times, and I always find something new to laugh at."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I agree I love Derry girls one of the funniest shows. I binged the first two season when I was sick with Covid and it cheered me up like no other show could. Also I think Sister michael is one best characters on any sitcom ever.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Now that it's over I need Derry Girls to become like The Sopranos where every discussion thread just devolves in to exchanging quotes because they make me so happy.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",i want more Sister Michael.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Just started this last, loved the first episode"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Uncle Colm telling the story of having his car stolen‚Ä¶. Brilliant!
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Sister George Michael stole the show.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Show is absolutely cracker
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","It really is amazing.  A sitcom about ordinary people in extraordinary times, funny in an intensely feminine way, just very very special.  I did feel like the last season lost a little bit of the perfection of the first two, as the stories got a little zanier (>!accidentally helping rob a school, getting sent across the border to clean up a house that felt haunted, planning an elaborately fancy 18th birthday party, going on TV to get backstage passes and then a parent dying, and honestly even the letter getting to Chelsea Clinton, which was a scene that's not likely to age as well as the rest of the show!<) and it felt less like ordinary life.  Regardless, BRILLIANT show and the >!voting!< storyline in the finale coupled with music choices that echoed the first episode's were absolutely brilliant, beautiful, ending on a real high."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I'm Australian and get tired very quickly of most US and UK comedy shows. Will always jump onto anything from a different English-speaking country that's offering something different. The Young Offenders (another Irish comedy) scratched that itch a few years ago and I still miss it. Derry Girls was a lockdown discovery that really got to me. Grew up during the 90's, so the soundtrack was 'chefs kiss'. 

It's a very different vibe, but I strongly recommend you check out Rosehaven. If you enjoy watching the hijinx of good friends living in a land that is foreign to you, Rosehaven is a delight. NZ is kicking Australia's ass when it comes to comedy lately, but Rosehaven is a timeless classic that will warm your heart. Two best friends writing, directing and acting as two best friends in a rural Australian town. Kinda like a far less crazy Schitt's Creek."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",100% agree. It's just a perfect encapsulation of time.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Orla‚Äôs belief that lesbians were mythical creatures was one of the funniest through lines in any comedy episode I‚Äôve watched.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The last season was so, so good! I'm so sad to see it go, but I think they ended it flawlessly."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","One of the best series of the year, they are amazing, very smart way to connect the history to young audience, insanely funny and great cast."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I love their accent
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I agree with this whole heartedly. I saw a review for Derry Girls one that said it can make you nostalgic for a time and place you never lived, and that is so true. I've told myself ""it's illegal to be sad while watching Derry Girls,"" so it's something I've often put on when I'm feeling down as a pick me up. Reading these comments has me on the verge of tears with the desire to watch the show over for the first time, but instead, I'll have to survive with a rewatch. Uncle Colm stole the show at the police department and have used the phrase ""the wee lesbian"" soooo many times."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Derry Girls and Father Ted are Ireland‚Äôs contributions to the pantheon of great TV.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","It's really great, I wish we got more but I'll take it."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Love it
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I can't believe I just got into this show and now it's over.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","ETA to correct title of a recommendation 

It‚Äôs well written and has a great ensemble cast. They work really well together.  Michelle, Uncle Colm and Sister Michael are my favorites for different reasons 

If you enjoyed it, the same writer wrote London Irish which is pretty funny as well. A few of the same cast show up."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I really enjoyed it. But I'd be happy if they never revisit it. It really felt like they had a story that would take three seasons to tell and they told it, which imo is a lot better than just trying to keep making more episodes until it gets shit or people stop watching.   


Having said that I wouldn't complain if they did do more. That episode on the train where they couldn't figure out who the woman is was fucking gold."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",What are ya? Some sort of reverse paedophile?
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I‚Äôm a Derry Girl!!!!
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I went to Catholic H.S. in the late 70's/early 80's in the USA and I feel like I went to school with these girls. 

No bombs, but the nuns and such are pretty accurate."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The relationship between Gerry and his FIL is my favourite thing. I love how it balances the lives of teenagers and the importance of the events happening around them, like the announcement of a ceasefire happening when they‚Äôre all off celebrating their prom."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",That's all well and good but when does the killer clown show up?
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",100%.  it's fantastic.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Such a great show. Just threw on the first ep on a whim and ended up binging the whole thing.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I agree, this show is fantastic. A film would be a great idea!"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I loved it very much truly heartfelt and hilarious
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Brilliant show. One of those rare gems where every single actor steals every scene they‚Äôre in. That‚Äôs a rare trick and a treat to watch.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I just started and it's a treat.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",You aren‚Äôt wrong there. I mean the show just has absolutely no misses. Every single episode is at least a 7/10.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Also, if you havent seen it, please check out Detectorists. Its another quirky show thats really heart-warming and 'cozy'. I think you'll like it!"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",i‚Äôm here for any and all poetic ruminations about this amazing show.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Yes to everything you said!

I am not sure I'd call it the best of all time, but it definitely gets  a place in my heart.

I also love to see a show about girls being human. They're not sexualized, they're not afraid to not be sexy and ever-cool. They're just normal humans. We need more shows like that in the US, because teens absolutely model what they see on TV.

I am not part of any Derry Girls discussion groups, so I didn't know James gets a lot of hate. I love him, he's obviously such a sweet guys, even with the mercilesscondemnation for being English. But the jokes about him are hilarious."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Agreed 100%! When they performed as the Spice Girls I lost it üòÇ
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I saw the cast on the Great British Baking Show and thought they had great chemistry, so I decided to watch Derry Girls. I‚Äôm almost done but I absolutely love it! The characters are so well written and hilarious. Michelle is definitely my favorite."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",The actresses show up for a Great British Bakeoff Christmas special that's pretty fun too.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I am orla
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","My favorite episode is the one in S3 with Orla dancing her whole way home. It just cracks me up how in her own world she is, and she creates the little dance numbers."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Loved the relationship between Da Gerry and Joe. At first you think Gerry's just a doormat. Then you notice he puts up with the abuse because he loves his wife and daughters that much. Then you realzie he can see right through Joe, and has the respect to allow an old, emotionally-constricted man his dignity."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",[removed]
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I've said this multiple times and I'm going to say it again because I just do truly mean it - Derry Girls is at the same level as The Office, one of the best shows of all time. Infinitely rewatchable and endlessly funny."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Watched it through for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I fully agree. It has so much heart and so much character. Would have loved more episodes, but that would have prob ruined the magic."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I didn't grow up in the 80s/90s Northern Ireland but was born in the 90s and pretty sure I knew a girl who looked nearly identical to Michelle in secondary school. My parents told me stories about growing up during the troubles, Derry girls got it pretty much spot on you just get on with it. The example I love, that my dad told me, is a song written by the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers, ""Bloody Sunday"" (released 3 years before U2 song by a similar name) which you think would be about the tragic event but no... It's about how there's nothing to do in Northern Ireland on Sunday! (No shops etc open on Sunday until I think the early 2000s)"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Sister Michael is absolutely fantastic, I love her dry responses to everything! 
It really does the nostalgia well. I grew up in the ROI during the 90s and 00s and remember the troubles and the atmosphere even down south was similar to the one up north.

Anyone planning a trip to Derry should go to the free Derry museum to learn about the troubles from a civilian point of view."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Wife and I loved it. Not sure who my favorite character is, though. Maybe Uncle Collum?"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Jeez am I the only one who that it was... Average? Watched season one and thought it was like a juvenile Irish sex education. Hardly a thigh slapper.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Honestly despise this show. The one girls acting and facial expressions kill me.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The last season wasn't as good as the previous ones. The series finale special was bad and the post-credits scene with Chelsea Clinton (yeah, that Chelsea Clinton) was down right embarrassing."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","schitts creek - derry girls - ted lasso
imo the trifecta of perfect shows with literally nothing wrong with them, incredible writing, hilarious, not strung out etc"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Season 3 was dog-shit. Felt like a half-hearted 'tie it up and forget about it' move. Season 1 and 2 were awesome though.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Shame about the new season. I thought all the characters nedflandered.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",alrighty then
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Its great. They really need to make more episodes for a season.
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I thought the last season was a bit Shit but the first two were absolutely excellent
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",[deleted]
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","Up to episode 4.  Struggling.

Its not objectionably bad, but basically all the main characters are annoyingly overacted.

I enjoyed then in-betweeners (obvs the most comparable‚Ä¶) and a wide range of other comedic styles but this just isnt doing it for me so far.  The only reason im oressing on is I keep seeing threads like this.

I seear, if I get halfway through aeason 2 and its still just as bad, Im coming for your pickle jars."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I just watched it.

Extremely generic, not of one of the best bits of television"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",L
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",I was going to try it out but the trailer on Netflix seemed absolutely terrible
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","The trouble with saying what's best about Derry Girls? By the time you're done, you've listed everything about the show."
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained","I laughed hard at the pilot, I didn‚Äôt laugh like that with the rest of the episodes but it is a good show to watch"
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Is this the girls version of the inbetweeners?
"Whose Vote Counts, Explained",Love the show. Is there a new season coming out?
The School Nurse Files,"Looks like my thing, thanks for the review, already put on my top list."
The School Nurse Files,I'm in. Added it to my list...
The School Nurse Files,"Glad to hear this is fun. It's the actress's first show in quite some time so I'm glad it's good. 

Korea has a lot of fun fantasy shows. And now more and more of them are coming to Netflix. I don't think they are as wacky as this looks but try Master's Sun or Hotel del Luna or Mystic Pop Up Bar. All on Netflix so easy access. And I don't know where you would find it now but Surplus Princess is a hoot and a half."
The School Nurse Files,"The direction, colors, photography, music, was amazing.  One of the best directed shows I‚Äôve ever seen in my life.

I also recommend Vagabond and Possessed."
The School Nurse Files,I happened to find it while i was very high. Made for a great binge.
The School Nurse Files,"She's so fucking good in Fringe. Liv can seem quite wooden at first, especially when she's opposite a man who regularly has emotional outbursts over sweets... until you start picking up on the fact she's just guarded in her expressions, and there's a million tiny ways she shows huge emotions"
The School Nurse Files,"Also, John Noble in Fringe should have gotten emmy noms or awards, he is seriously fantastic.  Awards ignoring a great performance just because its a sci-fi show"
The School Nurse Files,"also 'the newsreader' for something more recent. basically follows her as a nightly news anchor in 1986 that covers a really interesting few months where we have halley's comet, the challenger disaster, important update on ""the dingo stole my baby"" case, bombing of a police station in australia, and chernobyl."
The School Nurse Files,or Mindhunter. She's great in it and the show itself is so enjoyable and well crafted.
The School Nurse Files,"Brilliant series, one of John Noble's best roles. fun fact, there is an observer in every episode of Fringe, sometimes milling about in the background or,.. well.. observing."
The School Nurse Files,"I‚Äôm rewatching s1 right now! Been meaning to do a full rewatch of the series, so what better time to start"
The School Nurse Files,My cat is named Olivia Dunham
The School Nurse Files,[removed]
The School Nurse Files,Fringe was SOOOOOO good.
The School Nurse Files,Loved her in Mindhunters
The School Nurse Files,I'd say her best performance is from The Newsreader. The rent was due.
The School Nurse Files,"Also, Mindhunter on Netflix."
The School Nurse Files,I like the fringe so much I bought the whole DVD set
The School Nurse Files,"Funny enough, I started S1 today"
The School Nurse Files,Literally watching it right now. S1E6
The School Nurse Files,She was amazing in Fringe.  Need more of her.
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe is great. The last season is blatantly tacked on and imho, not very good."
The School Nurse Files,"Loved that series, but it got a little TOO weird towards the end."
The School Nurse Files,"I could never get through like season 4. Does it get better? Season 1 was one of the best seasons of television ever made, I just felt like they never knew where they were going after that."
The School Nurse Files,"I still can't believe that people tuned out. Such a great show but the decline in ratings influenced story changes, a move to Fridays which was considered a death sentence to any tv show, time jumps that later became a plot point. To be fair, that was a pretty genius move by the writers. The fact everyone wrote the show off at s3 but it held on for 2 more seasons is further proof of what a great show it was. It was originally intended to last longer than it did. For the time it did some pretty out of place things. For those who have yet to see it, it has multiple dimensions, multiple timelines, alternate realities, a giant conspiracy that spans the whole of 5 seasons, and multiple endings."
The School Nurse Files,"Whaaaat? I was a die-hard X-Files fan and you‚Äôre setting the expectations pretty high. I‚Äôll give you that it ended poorly ‚Äî both times, during the regular series and the reboot. 

But season 1-6 of The X-Files was insanely good. And Gillian Anderson was phenomenal from start to finish."
The School Nurse Files,"Xfiles did it first and did it better. X-files did go on too long and ended poorly, that's for sure."
The School Nurse Files,Fringe was amazing. Walter!
The School Nurse Files,Great in Mindhunter aswell
The School Nurse Files,I absolutely loved Fringe -- even bought the boxset during Amazon's prime day sales. Anna Torv was amazing. I loved her and Kirk Acevedo being partners. And when she had to play her alternate self. I miss the show immensely.
The School Nurse Files,Fringe is fantastic.100% recommended.
The School Nurse Files,Fringe is my all time favorite show. It was nice seeing Torv in LoU.
The School Nurse Files,"X files on acid in the 70s
Who cares about the science, we've got new vfx to play with!"
The School Nurse Files,"The whole cast in fringe is amazing, John Noble steals every scene he is in. It's also a LOT better than X-Files"
The School Nurse Files,"Please refresh, y memory. Didn't fringe have kind of a disappointing last few episodes?"
The School Nurse Files,Fringe is flawless. The only reason I‚Äôm considering watching the Last of Us is Anna Torv.
The School Nurse Files,The first half of season 4 is some of the best TV I've seen.
The School Nurse Files,She‚Äôs better in Mindhunter
The School Nurse Files,"i had never seen her before, and she was instantly the most believable actor on Last of Us"
The School Nurse Files,Fringe is amazing after the first season which was a bad x files clone. Credit to the writers for realizing it and trying something new and much better.
The School Nurse Files,Fuck. I thought it was Carrie Coon!!
The School Nurse Files,"Loved Fringe, but it is nowhere near as good as X-Files."
The School Nurse Files,"I liked fringe, but the science was too awful to rate the show."
The School Nurse Files,"*SLIGHTLY* higher?

SLIGHTLY?!

You take that word back!  Take it back now!

I jest with that, but seriously X-Files has nothing to compare to John Noble as Walter Bishop.  Not by a long shot."
The School Nurse Files,"I was thrilled to see she was in this new show, but very disappointed  with how that all turned out"
The School Nurse Files,"One of the best shows ever, imo."
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe was really good.

I rewatched it all a few years ago and it still holds up."
The School Nurse Files,Oh Fringe! I almost forgot about that show. Not sure how - I absolutely loved it. No one talks about it.
The School Nurse Files,Dang now I have to watch it if it‚Äôs better than the x files
The School Nurse Files,Second!
The School Nurse Files,I wish it was on Crave in Canada where we get most HBO shows.
The School Nurse Files,"I remember back in the day how many people was like ""flashforward if the new X-Files"" or ""the event is the new X-Files"" and both got cancelled after one season, in the meantime fringe was doing their own ""I'm the new X-Files"" in the corner.

I loved that show, I didn't like season two monster of the week episodes that much, but season three was awesome."
The School Nurse Files,Fringe was great
The School Nurse Files,"I thought Fringe was great in the early seasons but gradually became worse as it progressed and the world got larger.   

Torv is a great actor though and did amazing playing two different characters in the show."
The School Nurse Files,"Really? Interesting. I thought Fringe was x-files but with modern garbage TV tropes and boring characters but to each their own I guess. You watched Warehouse 13 OP? I think you might like it, it's like Fringe but a different vehicle to tell the stories"
The School Nurse Files,"I was so excited for Fringe until I saw the male actor, yes the one also from Dawson's creek (never watched) I don't know if I'm the only person that this happens to but I feel a totally unjustified hatred towards the guy, can't stand his face, ruined Fringe for me"
The School Nurse Files,Fringe definitely stuck the landing compared to a lot of shows.
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe is the GOAT, though they kinda cheated us on the ending"
The School Nurse Files,I watched the first couple of episodes and thought it was atrocious compared the The X-Files
The School Nurse Files,"I saw the first  season and for me it lacks something. Its not dark or mystical enough and a bit too much cabel tv-tv. Does the tone change? What I love about xfiles season 1-5 is that you can really feel the surroundings. The rain, the forest, the fog. Fringe is more like xfiles 5-9. Very much studio feeling."
The School Nurse Files,"I keep seeing Fringe recommended, and I love X-Files, but I did not enjoy Fringe.  It seemed too predictable and formulaic.  However, I did not watch further than a few episodes into season 2 before dropping it.  I don't know if my opinion would improve later in the series."
The School Nurse Files, This discussion really making me want to Fringe üò©üò©
The School Nurse Files,"The X-Files will always be iconic, and many of its episodes are some of the greatest in the history of television. Its experiments with the idea of a serialized mythology offered pretty mixed results at times, but the few shows were ever in their element as The X-Files doing some of those classic monster of the week episodes. Shows that followed, especially during that 2004-2010 period, like Lost and Battlestar Galactica, owed much to the X-Files. 

And none more so than Fringe, obviously. 

I think Fringe is a perfect example of taking a familiar concept or premise, and not being too preoccupied with ‚Äúfiling the serial numbers off,‚Äù so to speak. It‚Äôs totally just The X-Files, BUT the difference is that Fringe has a clear idea about the kind of mythology it wants to explore from the outset; the writers found a genuinely clever way to use the monster of the week format to build towards a larger goal, and Fringe‚Äôs mythology is truly one of the best in tv. 

But probably the *biggest* reason Fringe stands above X-Files, is *John motherfucking Noble*. Genuinely, Walter Bishop is the secret sauce of Fringe and one of the most charming and beautifully realized characters in all television. It‚Äôs actually pretty remarkable how many great characters came right out the gate after 2004; we talk about the ‚Äúgolden age of television‚Äù now (and have for years at this point) but a lot of these network television series walked so these prestige tv programs could run. They had messier endings, but still left a huge mark."
The School Nurse Files,Fringe is not good.
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe is just the Bluebloods version of X-Files, and it's also trash. Seriously weak acting performances from both Torv and Jackson. Skip Intro's episode on spooky cop shows is the best deep dive into why X-Files is the superior content, when comparing the two shows."
The School Nurse Files,"Don't fall for it. She was terrible in ""Fringe"".

The series itself is a terrible pseudoscience/police procedural with its only redeeming quality being a parallel universe long arc that was explored much, much better in ""Counterpart""."
The School Nurse Files,Fringe was better than the majority of X-Files which fell off pretty hard after the first couple seasons.
The School Nurse Files,"Hard agree on the better than X files .
I think some individual episodes of x files are some of the best sci Fi tv ever ,but as an over all series Fringe has the better story , character development,and consistency"
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe was so much better than XFiles, all the interpersonal relationships flowed so much more naturally than the ""made for fandom"" sexual tension between Mulder and Scully.

Plus Fringe kept on track with it's original premise, unlike Xfiles that started off as a really cool show about unsolved cases of strange phenomena  only to get stuck on ""They're Out There"" alien-hybrid conspiracies.

I think Fringe didnt get the attention it deserved because viewers were burned out and bored of XFiles and assumed Fringe was going to be just another copy-cat show."
The School Nurse Files,Only thing better than Fringe was Eureka!
The School Nurse Files,Fringe is leagues above TXF. It had a consistent overall mythology and story arc that ended on it's own terms in an amazing way.
The School Nurse Files,Spoiler‚Ä¶.. she dies in episode two ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The School Nurse Files,She's also great in an Australian TV series called The Newsreader
The School Nurse Files,"ya, Fringe was really effing good. if you like sci fi schlock and havent seen it, get on it. its one of the greats."
The School Nurse Files,Literally what I started on Monday lol
The School Nurse Files,"Welp, it's been a few years.  Time for another Fringe rewatch."
The School Nurse Files,Mmmmm Anna Torv as a redhead.
The School Nurse Files,HBOMAX Europe as well! Just started another rewatch.
The School Nurse Files,I completely didn‚Äôt realize it was her until someone pointed it out to me
The School Nurse Files,Didn‚Äôt even realise that was the actress from Fringe
The School Nurse Files,This statement compares to: true
The School Nurse Files,I've only watched the first episode but I really enjoyed her performance and I can't wait to see where the rest of the season takes her character
The School Nurse Files,I watched an episode of Fringe before watching TLOU and it took me a bit to realize why Tess looked so familiar. Funny how that happens sometimes.
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe had it's moments but some of the seasons were weak, if you power through it - the last season was great imo."
The School Nurse Files,She also had a great part in Mindhunter (great show).
The School Nurse Files,I've watched first season but didn't enjoy it much does it get better?
The School Nurse Files,"I got halfway through the first season. I want to get into it and finish it , but I had trouble getting through the monster of the week episodes."
The School Nurse Files,"Haven't watched the last of us show yet (loved the game), but I actually recently started watching Fringe funnily enough. I'm about halfway through the first season, and I'm enjoying it. Glad to see Anna torv getting more exposure."
The School Nurse Files,"I just finished watching her in the Australian show ""Secret City"" and I loved her performance in it. I found it on Netflix and there are two seasons."
The School Nurse Files,Fringe was fucking amazing and she was definitely great in it. I'm glad to see that she's getting some recognition.
The School Nurse Files,"I couldn't figure out who she was I. This show, I thought she was Donna from the 70s show.

The crazy thing is I loved fringe up until the last season when they had to wrap it up. At least there was closer to the show and it didn't just end."
The School Nurse Files,Well this is awkward...
The School Nurse Files,Fringe was amazing
The School Nurse Files,"It makes me feel old that Fringe is a TIL subject since that‚Äôs where I know her from the most since she‚Äôs the protagonist, She‚Äôs also on that Netflix show where they interview serial killers."
The School Nurse Files,Thank you.  I was trying to figure out where I remembered her from.
The School Nurse Files,"That ending still gives me goosebumps.

>!üå∑!<"
The School Nurse Files,I stopped watching Fringe on the last episode of the last season. I think Joshua Jackson as Peter was the past holding bastion of good things about a show that had so badly Flanderised itself that I just didn't care about the outcome. Felt like the show found all of the fan favourite traits and wrote the show to be only those traits.
The School Nurse Files,"As a fan since the original airings, I love how this show is having a small resurgence of popularity due to Anna Torv in The Last of Us."
The School Nurse Files,"Fringe was great, and if you're like me  and care about this sort of thing, it has an ending, no cancelled forever cliffhanger üòÅ"
The School Nurse Files,"always wanted to check it out, it's available on NowTV, I just have to find the time"
Sneakerheads,"This was like if someone fed a bot a list of sitcom clich√©s and made it shat out a script.


There was no real personality, selfish characters for no good reason. 

Stopped watching after the second episode"
Sneakerheads,"King Bach still out here trying to make the acting thing work lol. 

Premiere was alright. As a reformed sneaker head, i appreciate it (Seeing bach argue with the reseller, the hype beast asian rocking all supreme gear and cutting the line - this show was made by folks who get it lol)"
Sneakerheads,All the characters are way over the top and none of them are likeable. Young teenagers might like it.
Sneakerheads,Trailer reminded me of a less dramatic How To Make It in America. Anyone checked it out yet?
Sneakerheads,Call me crazy but I actually enjoyed this a lot. Was pretty funny and the characters were great.
Sneakerheads,This looks terrible. Won't be surprised when it get cancelled after 1 season.
Sneakerheads,"Such a frustrating show, characters are so challenging to ""root for"" or like. It was good to have  on while i was dungeon grinding in WoW though haha.

&#x200B;

3/10 funny

8/10 background show.. 

Perfect netflix and chill show,.

zero way you'll get ""Distracted by a good part."" Because there are none LOL"
Sneakerheads,"Its watchable but not funny ,the acting is beyond cringe and the story doesnt make sense most of the time"
Sneakerheads,Saw all 6 episodes. In summary: It was *okay* but I'm not recommending it.
Sneakerheads,"I had a great time with it.  I agree, it was enjoyable, the characters were very funny.  It could have dragged on but wrapping it up in 6 episodes was just right."
Sneakerheads,"I actually liked it too. Not something that is Emmy amazing, but it's entertaining enough."
Sneakerheads,Hi crazy
Sneakerheads,"Very silly show, loved it :D"
Sneakerheads,I‚Äôve no idea how this even got made. I‚Äôll be super surprised if this is not quickly cancelled.
Sneakerheads,"The story wraps up so I don't expect there will be a part 2 and the ""series"" is only 6 episodes long.  I enjoyed it."
Sneakerheads,"It's only 6 episodes and the story wraps up at the end.  I guess they could write ""new adventures"" for them but there's nowhere to go with the current story."
Sneakerheads,"As a Sneakerhead, this looks terrible"
Sneakerheads,This looks like what people that have never met a snakehead would make if a gun was put up to their heads.

A Perfect Crime,"You don't earn a golden globe. The studio buys it. The Hollywood Foreign Press is actually only like 140 people, all publicly known. They also have no rules about accepting payments, or gifts, from studios.The Emmys and Oscars matter because of credible and exclusive voter bases, that are also significantly large enough to protect against bribery. Golden Globes don't mean shit.

There was a bit of a scandal when Netflix paid for many HFP members to fly to Paris and stay in a fancy hotel in order to ""tour the set"" of Emily in Paris. It went on to be one of the worst reviewed shows that year, but still got a nomination."
A Perfect Crime,"Not as big of a snub a Rhea Seehorn... I mean holy fuck, I haven't seen anyone as constantly snubbed from these awards since the cast of the Wire."
A Perfect Crime,Are we supposed to care about the Golden Globes again?
A Perfect Crime,"I was at the Game of Thrones official convention this weekend and he was there. He's so nice and he really loved playing this characters, it means a lot to him.

This snub is outrageous and the Critics Choice Awards also snubbed him. I'm worried about the Emmys now =("
A Perfect Crime,"For those curious as to who he was up against

Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series, Drama

Jeff Bridges (‚ÄúThe Old Man‚Äù) 

Kevin Costner (‚ÄúYellowstone‚Äù)

Diego Luna (‚ÄúAndor‚Äù)

Bob Odenkirk (‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù)

Adam Scott (‚ÄúSeverance‚Äù)


Haven't seen old man, but I think Adam Scott, Bob Odenkirk, and Diego Luna all did a fantastic job. Kevin Costner is the one I'd potentially replace with Paddy Considine"
A Perfect Crime,Omg what a joke of an award. One of the best performances I‚Äôve seen on TV in years.
A Perfect Crime,The Golden Globes has never not been a joke.
A Perfect Crime,It‚Äôs one thing for him to not win it. To not even get nominated though is a complete fucking joke.
A Perfect Crime,Rhea Seehorn too. The Golden Globes are a joke
A Perfect Crime,"You win an Oscar, you buy a Golden Globe."
A Perfect Crime,"I couldn't believe it when he didn't get the Critic's Choice nomination. I assumed that would be an anomaly. His is, in my opinion, the greatest performance in all of Game of Thrones so far. And certainly a performance that in my opinion exceeds some of the other nominees."
A Perfect Crime,I didn't realize he was such a good actor until I saw him playing in HofD. He deserves a big dramatic role
A Perfect Crime,Meh. The final season of GoT won so many undeserved awards...
A Perfect Crime,"Golden Globes are trash, but it does show how contentious Emmys and Oscars are going to be this year.

Emmys - Better Call Saul, House of the Dragon, Severance, Andor, Hacks, The Bear, Abbot Elementary, some real peak TV with no way to give everyone the awards they deserve, but at least for once Succession isn't going to come in and take up all the air in the room.

Oscars - some really fantastic all-time greats this year including Everything Everywhere All At Once, along with popular box office draws like Top Gun: Maverick and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Avatar, and then award bait like Elvis, Babylon, She Said, and The Fablemans.

Lot of folks and fandoms will be going home disappointed, but ultimately just enjoy this great content we all have!"
A Perfect Crime,"- you‚Äôve got a moustache


I KNOW"
A Perfect Crime,It's the fucking Golden Globes lmao
A Perfect Crime,"Kevin Costner was good in Yellowstone, but Paddy was much better. He created something new; Costner is still Costner."
A Perfect Crime,"Well, the nominees are not bad, they are all pretty solid. You could argue that Bateman is the odd man out. He is good but Considine's performance was kind of career-defining. It also was like the center of gravity of the whole show, from a dramatic point of view. Like the cleft in a partiture. Every other character's behaviour took its cue from Viserys."
A Perfect Crime,"I have been snubbing the Golden Globes all my life , even Academy Awards is pointless now."
A Perfect Crime,What is even the point of this awards show?
A Perfect Crime,"award snubs are basically a tradition since time immemorial, Paddy is only the last of a loooong list"
A Perfect Crime,Crime? Come on now.
A Perfect Crime,King Lear levels mate.
A Perfect Crime,"You don't earn them, you buy them. You will see that as proof, HBO did not pay or campaign this season."
A Perfect Crime,Golden Globes have always been BS. Ever since Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depo were nominated for the Tourist that year everyone was like ‚Äúwait what?‚Äù
A Perfect Crime,"Who cares, Golden Globes are a pay to play outfit anyway."
A Perfect Crime,Award shows are a joke.
A Perfect Crime,"I‚Äôve never cared for awards. The fact that Leo been snubbed for so many Oscar‚Äôs proves that none of this shit matters. We all know who the best performances were, and let‚Äôs be real here, so do the people who made those performances."
A Perfect Crime,"His actual award will be continued work because he is displaying great acting chops.

The Globes don't mean shit"
A Perfect Crime,"No it's not, he sucked."
A Perfect Crime,Pretty sure there are actual crimes involving the Golden Globes we should be more worried about.
A Perfect Crime,"Giving any validity to the Golden Globes is a crime, is a joke of an award, and the organization behind it is an embarrassment."
A Perfect Crime,"No, it's literally _not_ a crime."
A Perfect Crime,He was incredible
A Perfect Crime,"No one cares, it‚Äôs all money and nepotism"
A Perfect Crime,The HFP members are just the bukake centerpiece of society. Whoever gives them the biggest load wins.
A Perfect Crime,All award shows are stupid and pointless. Need me to repeat it?
A Perfect Crime,"Critics Choice supremacy. Although, they didn't nominate him either lol.

They went with Adam Scott, Jeff Bridges, Antony Starr, and Bob Odenkirk for best actor in a drama series."
A Perfect Crime,"Disagree.  

He did fine, but this show was on the flat side.  Next season should be better."
A Perfect Crime,Golden Globes is as irrelevant as the Critics Choice Awards. Oscars is the one to take seriously.
A Perfect Crime,lol people still pay attention to golden globe noms? how much more do you need to learn about it to give up on golden globes? whole thing is rigged af
A Perfect Crime,All the Major awards are about Campaigning and investing heavily in the award itself through time and money although indirectly with the money. There probably are awards shows out there that pick the actual best of the year I always seem to agree more with the BAFTAs and Saturn is good for what they are looking at but the Oscars have just sucked to watch and for the movies they pick too many times. Saving Private Ryan one of the best Movies of all time lost to Shakespeare in Love that's the Oscars but one thing only needs to be said about the Globes... James Corden won one.
A Perfect Crime,"Wtf.

This was the greatest performance I've seen in a long time.

And it destroys shitty LoTR show."
A Perfect Crime,"I‚Äôm sorry, do people think the Golden Globes mean shit? *Golden Gloves* I get it but seriously, these awards are so far from a joke that we should go full-circle and just call them the Bazooka Joe awards. At least they‚Äôd be comically bad"
A Perfect Crime,The actors in House of Dragons are very one-note. It‚Äôs very monotonous
A Perfect Crime,It‚Äôs all subjective. I thought he was good but I wasn‚Äôt blown away. Not even close.
A Perfect Crime,How many times do we have to go through the ‚Äúpeople who choose these awards don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about‚Äù cycle before you just start ignoring the fucking awards?  Some people got together and declared themselves the arbiters of this shit. No one elected them.  Just ignore them and they‚Äôll go away.
A Perfect Crime,"Jesus, it really isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a fucking worthless award."
A Perfect Crime,"That‚Äôs not actually what crimes are‚Ä¶

Great show though!"
A Perfect Crime,"No it isn‚Äôt, and rich people giving other rich people awards isn‚Äôt entertaining."
A Perfect Crime,absurd. his performance was incredible.
A Perfect Crime,He should have been in a comedy like Matt Damon in the Martian.
A Perfect Crime,Even if this award were earned and nit purchased House of the Dragon was no where close to the best show of the year. Maybe for costumes but that's it.
A Perfect Crime,"Haven't we learned our lesson with the Oscars? These award shows are nothing but popularity contests. It's a political game, not a an assessment of quality or merit. I don't need a bunch of out of touch snobs telling me what a good performance looks like."
A Perfect Crime,His performance just wasn‚Äôt that good. It was standard at best‚Ä¶
A Perfect Crime,I didn‚Äôt find his performance anything special.
A Perfect Crime,"Not really, show wasn't that good.

He was fine"
A Perfect Crime,Look at the weird way they decided to split the Best Supporting categories for TV
A Perfect Crime,All the more reason to not give two figs about the HFP and the Golden Globes.
A Perfect Crime,Fuck 'em. Paddy is better than this joke of an award.
A Perfect Crime,That‚Äôs ridiculous. Best performance of the YEAR.
A Perfect Crime,"There was nothing wrong with paddy‚Äôs performance, the story was shite. Not his fault."
A Perfect Crime,Seemed like a pretty mid acting job for a pretty forgettable character. I guess I'd be shocked if House of the Dragon won any awards for any bit that involved acting.
A Perfect Crime,"Just because a you liked some obscure fantasy show, doesn't mean they deserve a international award. Especially when that show was just a cash grab by the studio and added nothing to culture."
A Perfect Crime,Meh
A Perfect Crime,Is the common opinion that the show was great? I didnt really like it tbh
A Perfect Crime,Adam Scott  was awesome.  I'm glad he got nominated for the most underrated show of the year unlike HOTD which was the most overrated show.
A Perfect Crime,"Oh, I hadn‚Äôt noticed, I thought we stopped caring about award shows years ago‚Ä¶"
A Perfect Crime,"I mean, I didn‚Äôt think he was that good."
A Perfect Crime,He wasn‚Äôt THAT good.
A Perfect Crime,"Ummmm excuse me, WHAT THE FUCK"
A Perfect Crime,[deleted]
A Perfect Crime,Not getting nominated for an award isn't a crime.  Shut up.
A Perfect Crime,"Really great show, totally killed rings of power"
A Perfect Crime,Golden Globe nominations and wins are not worth getting upset about - even worse than the Oscars.
A Perfect Crime,The writing on House of the Dragon was a fucking crime.
A Perfect Crime,It wasn't even a good show. Why should he win
A Perfect Crime,"Much like interest in movies, the woke mind virus also killed whatever interest was left in these pathetic award ceremonies."
A Perfect Crime,"that whole season was a crime for watching to begin with. so not much is lost. what a terrible season it was, hopefully season 2 will be better."
A Perfect Crime,No. No it wasn‚Äôt. Did you see that mess of a show?
A Perfect Crime,"House of the dragon should win 0 awards, mediocrity incarnate."
A Perfect Crime,"But Kevin Costner, totally deserved it."
A Perfect Crime,I kept scrolling thinking there was a mistake and I missed it.
A Perfect Crime,Golden Globes are a complete joke and shouldn‚Äôt be taken as a prestigious award show in any way.
A Perfect Crime,It's almost like awards shows are stupid.
A Perfect Crime,Awards shows are and always have been a joke.
A Perfect Crime,Yeah one of the all time best performances I have ever seen hands down.  Like ever.
A Perfect Crime,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Paddy Considine on the set of his latest film, and I was blown away by his kindness and professionalism. Despite being a huge star, Paddy was down-to-earth and approachable, and he took the time to chat with everyone on set and make us all feel valued. He even went out of his way to help me with a scene that I was struggling with, offering guidance and support. It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I will always be grateful to Paddy for his generosity and kindness."
A Perfect Crime,Why anyone cares about rich people giving other rich people meaningless trophies is beyond me.
A Perfect Crime,How the hell do you not even give him a nomination
A Perfect Crime,Man deserves recognition
A Perfect Crime,"Don‚Äôt worry, Selena Gomez got her nomination‚Ä¶. But for real‚Ä¶. How?"
A Perfect Crime,"Idk, maybe I differ from the Reddit general consensus, and while I like Paddy's acting, I think Matt, Emma, Olivia, and Emily's acting (not so much Milly's) were the standouts much much more than Paddy. Matt and Emma especially."
A Perfect Crime,Wow‚Ä¶ huge miss
A Perfect Crime,"The golden globes mean nothing. They are a fart of an award that is just used to prep for the real deal awards later in the year. Seriously, nobody in the business gives a shit except for studio heads."
A Perfect Crime,No it‚Äôs not.
A Perfect Crime,Omg ...rich assholes and elites arguing about a trophy? Who the F--k cares?!!
A Perfect Crime,"Wow solid non opinionated reporting, OP. A crime? Really?"
A Perfect Crime,Who cares? It‚Äôs a tv show.
The Playbook,Hey it's the guy from the gif
The Playbook,That's not Barney Stinson
The Playbook,Doc Rivers is overrated.

The Playbook,Yea they should have had someone like Phil Jackson on instead.

The Playbook,"Alternate title: ""Amazon Studios' Head of Diversity Seeks to Justify Her Own Job"""
The Playbook,"> Since then, the streamer launched its biggest, most expensive series, ‚ÄúLord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,‚Äù which was met with great acclaim and, sadly, with social media furor over the epic fantasy series‚Äô diverse casting. And body-positive reality show ‚Äú

I swear every article written like this feels like its paid of by mainstream studios who just cant get over they made a bad show.

""Met with great acclaim"" you could spend hours braking down how objectively this show fails in so many parameters, from dialogue, storytelling, pacing, plot convenience, plot armor, one dimensional characters, non essential characters, spending screen on non essential plot etc.

""Did we simply spend a billion dollars to make a bad show"", ""Nah it's the people who are racists, misogynists, haters"".

From Disney, to Marvel, to Lucasfilm, to Amazon, to Netflix, nobody nowadays can take criticism. Look at House of the Dragon, everyone was betting against before it even launched, because people had bad memories from season 7 and 8 of Game Thrones. Turns out if you just make a good show people will praise it rightfully."
The Playbook,can't wait for Bill Burr to find out there is indeed a job called Head of Diversity and go for the angriest tirade about it
The Playbook,"Diversity is nothing but a weapon of corporate colonialism

>We have an opportunity to increase humanity

No, you are the force of misanthropic nihilism"
The Playbook,"How fucked up is the Entertainment Industry when a position named Head of Diversity is created?

Just...fuck everything."
The Playbook,Ha ha. Indeed.
The Playbook,"I swear every post written like this feels like its written by a 14 year old who just can't understand that their personal opinion is not objective truth.

You could spend hours telling them that other people have opinions.  That saying there is ""objective truth"" about whether storytelling, pacing, etc. is good is just self delusion.

Does your disliking a show make it a bad show?  No, it means you personally dislike a show.

And yes, you can find echo chambers of other similar people on the internet to feed into your delusion that your opinion is objective truth.  Because nowadays people cannot accept an opinion that goes against their own.

I fully understand that you dislike the show.  I am just sad that you cannot understand that your disliking the show means nothing more than that you dislike the show.  I hope someday you become aware that there is more to the world than your personal opinion."
The Playbook,'The Trolley Problem' from *The Good Place* springs to mind.

The Playbook,Palestinian chicken is great though nothing for me beats the reveal (even though it was very guessable) in the season with the producers in the finale
The Playbook,The long night is such a piece of shit episode. GoT has a lot of good episodes but that is not one of them.
The Playbook,I never laughed harder at a tv show than I did at that episode of Curb
The Playbook,We can agree to disagree.
The Playbook,I watched the pilot. Yeah it hits every cliche but it's really fun watching Kevin Bacon chew scenery. And do coke while blasting Tom Sawyer by Rush.
The Playbook,"I'll give it a try, Des from ""Republic of Doyle"" is one of the costars."
The Playbook,I enjoyed it
The Playbook,"I don‚Äôt mind checking off cliche‚Äôs as long as it‚Äôs done well.

This show does it well"
The Playbook,They got it down pretty good. Especially with the snitching at the end. Boston criminals love to snitch.
The Playbook,"I was kinda disappointed by it tbh. I'll commit to a few more episodes though, see where it goes. It does seem like a show where it should have a built-in audience. The people who like this sort of thing should like it."
The Playbook,"Yes, he is. He's really good, too."
The Playbook,"By complaining about the storylines in the show, the author of this article appears to have let the themes of the show (such as the struggle to be ""good"" in this day and age--what it means, what one can strive to do to improve oneself, the complexities of every decision we make as a person and how that impacts those around us) go over his head.

Also, I'm not sure why any show needs to announce when it's ending years ahead of time.  It doesn't serve any real purpose as far as I can tell."
The Playbook,I think I agree. I'm loving the show and it hasn't dropped in quality but I don't want it to run out of steam even though it does a great job of having each season reinvigorate the show. I feel confident in Mike Schur to know when it is time to wrap things up. It's not like LOST where it would have ended sooner if the producers had it their way but NBC wanted it to keep going because of how big it was.
The Playbook,Just checked the ratings...........wayyyy lower than I expected for this show.
The Playbook,"I wanna live in the glorious post-scarcity Star Trek-ian future where artists can just be like ""Okay, so this show is going to be on the air for three seasons, and then it will be over.""  Being able to say ""Okay, this is where we're going and what we're going to do and we're going to need this guy who's a major part of season 2 to show up in season 1 for an episode, but since we already know for sure we're doing that in the second season because the entire show is plotted out we can afford to hire an actual name.""

But as long as people still need to make money to feed and clothe and house themselves ""Hey, we've got you a guaranteed paycheck for three years and then you'll just have to hope you find something new after"" is not what the folks wanna hear.   ""Hey this tv show might make you a bunch of money for three years and then it will be over and you'll have to find something new"" is not what distributors want to hear.  They want to keep making money."
The Playbook,"The fourth, fifth, and six seasons were the worst in retrospect (although there were amazing episodes). Just let them play it as they have. "
The Playbook,Disagree. 
The Playbook,"He's making a creative argument here. Of course the business incentives are going to differ, that's a given.

But to make a case for them aligning...

>But as long as people still need to make money to feed and clothe and house themselves...

Hyperbole aside, the decision-makers may not exactly be in this position. The show doesn't appear to be a big hit, at least with its Netflix numbers unknown ‚Äî that's the big x-factor. It's a hit on sites like Vulture, sure, but what's that worth financially to NBC/Comcast shareholders?

You've got an overall deal with creator Mike Schur that expires soon. He's going to be *very* in-demand, with suitors already lining up. If he wants to end the show after Season 4 (the next one) or 5, what priority do you place on keeping him happy as you try to keep him in-house?

Re: value of The Good Place as an NBCU streaming library property for years/decades to come. 4-5 seasons of A-level show, or 7 seasons of B-level show, which would you rather have?"
The Playbook,"No, the second season is the worst.  The season where they didn't know how long the show was going to be on so it was nothing but godawful filler.  "
The Playbook,Season 4 was bomb.  S2 was far from one of the best.
The Playbook,Exactly.  And this is how everyone felt while the show was airing.  Only now revisionist history has set in and people act like s2 was the gold standard or something lol.
The Playbook,"The second season was pretty bad but still had some good ideas. If they had kept in mind the grounded, interesting first season bible then it would've been a better show.

Netflix's the I-Land, despite the name, has shades of first season Lost."
The Playbook,Season four was competent because they had to plan it rather than winging it and I liked it but it had some major issues.
The Playbook,I'm extremely excited for this show. Looks like a cool concept and a good cast. 
The Playbook,"I feel with all the hype that Reddit has given this show, they are gonna be PISSED AS HELL if it's not the greatest show ever."

Some recent shows I drifted away from, that are good-ish, with some fine moments, but are VASTLY overrated:

‚Äî Ted Lasso

‚Äî Only Murders In the Building

‚Äî Sex Lives of College Girls

‚¨áÔ∏èEdit (so that you can judge me further).

These are funny shows that I‚Äôve seen in the last year that I think deserve every bit of any hype they‚Äôve received:

Stath Lets Flats, Reservation Dogs, What We Do in the Shadows, I Think You Should Leave, We Are Lady Parts, Wellington Paranormal, Hacks, Black Lady Sketch Show, Peacemaker, Pen15, Righteous Gemstones"
The Playbook,"Yellowjackets is actually not that good, or at least it's not one of the best things we got in years (or this year).

The storyline with adults set in the present is mostly just extremely boring and not interesting at all. Wow, a middle-aged wife cheating on her partner. Exciting stuff. It only picks up in the last two episodes, but that just doesn't justify the rest being so dull. 

The storyline with teen girls is okay at the start and at the end, but the middle part is just teen girls dealing with teen girl stuff (first sex, pregnancy etc.). The show hooks you on the promise of cannibalism and mystery stuff happening, but none of that really happens this season.

I can enjoy a good slow burn, but this is just too much. The premise is interesting, but the way they went about it is just so boring."

The Playbook,I think Deadwood is better than The Sopranos
The Playbook,Breaking bad was pretty dull in the beginning.
The Playbook,"* The Big Bang Theory (while its humor has still not aged well) is completely overhated, it doesn't make fun of nerds just because it makes jokes about them and Amy's actually the more believable autistic character than Sheldon

* Young Sheldon, while being a good sitcom (at its best even better than a lot of BBT at its best, seriously, that IRS episode was fucking gold), seems to treat what BBT established as Sheldon's canon childhood with casual disdain and while they take care to include some iconic moments (like the chicken chasing him up the tree) and they exclude some for the better despite how much that fucks up the timeline (like having Sheldon go to high school when he said that before college he was in the fifth grade), they also excluded some that would have been amazing on TV (like him trying to build a nuclear reactor in the shed planning to provide free electricity for the whole town but the feds got involved because of how he was trying to acquire his fissile material and he freaked out and built a sonic death ray (which he didn't use on the feds but, unsuccessfully, on his bullies) or how he tried to build his own CAT scanner but when he used it on Missy's guinea pig, the guinea pig burst into flame and Sheldon got radiation burns and had to be flown to the hospital by helicopter)"
The Playbook,Ross was a whiny asshole loser
The Playbook,"1. The Office (US) is overrated

The Playbook,"Boy Meets World is a worse show than Full House.

The original series of Roseanne is still terrific and should not be avoided by potential new viewers because of the star's off-screen behavior.

The Smelly Car is the funniest episode of Seinfeld.

Fly is a great episode of Breaking Bad."
The Playbook,"The Good Place series finale is awful.

Yes, it is cute, but it doesn't make any sense.

>!First of all, they were extremely selfish in saying that the Judge shouldn't reset the universe. Like, millions of people spent an eternity being unfairly and brutally tortured, but fuck it, their friendship is more important than the suffering of the rest of humanity, right?!<

>!But what really doesn't make sense is people turning into ""zombies"" after living in paradise for a long time. This argument that they're tired of experiencing everything they can is stupid. They were so lost on how to finish the series, they didn't even know how to make Tahani have the same fate as other human beings.!<

The rest of the show is still 10/10 though, one of the best comedy shows of all-time."
The Playbook,>!Bobby Axelrod!<'s absence on Billions is already making the show better.

The Playbook,"Band of Brothers is boring and mediocre.

Person of Interest has terrible writing."
The Playbook,"Peaky Blinders always was a yawnfest. It could be set around this time period rather than 100 years ago, and I still wouldn't care.

The Playbook,"> the books aren‚Äôt as good as people think they are.

True. They really aren't and tbh, the games are singehandedly responsible for the fanchise's popularity. The books are mediocre most of the time. Best part about it is the the worldbuilding.

That being said, the quality of the books isn't what people have issues with. Its the liberties, that in almost all cases, make the story and characters even worse, that is the issue. 

The books might not be that great, but what the showrunners are doing with the show, isn't helping."
The Playbook,The books are boring.
The Playbook,How's season two? I enjoyed parts of one but not enough to get round to two yet.

The Playbook,I'm surprised the Ted lasso fanatics haven't downvoted you to oblivion yet lol
The Playbook,"Maybe it's just me, but these shows are all the same. Big Little Lies, Yellowjackets...bored housewife shows."
The Playbook,I‚Äôm with you with this one. Season one should have been six episodes tops. The beginning of season two with the Punisher was great until the cemetary scene. After that the Elektra and the Hand nonsense was pure garbage. I dont even remember season three.
The Playbook,But that [hallway/stairwell fight scene](https://youtu.be/ZaXXoTfPqUo) though‚Ä¶

The Playbook,"> >!given the system they had, it would only wind up creating the exact same problem billions of years in the future. They were stuck with the points system and no one would try to make a better alternative because the Bad Place people loved torturing people and the Good Place people were doormats.!<

>!But the new universe would use the new system they suggested according to the Judge. So it would erase an eternity of unfair and brutal torture.!<

> >!And I don't think it's unreasonable to think that even paradise would get boring after several millennia. (..) I think they'd all be horribly depressed instead of being zombies.!<

>!I agree with you except for the word ""all"". There are trillions and trillions of possibilities in the paradise, no matter how long you live, there will always be something new. So I don't think it is unreasonable to think that there would be several people who would never be tired of living in the paradise. That's why the zombie thing is nonsense imo. That's the only reason why I didn't like the ending.!<

>!In addition to that, our memory is limited. Even though we live forever, we would theorically wanna repeat past experiences. e.g. why do people wanna visit cities they visited several years ago? Why do people wanna watch a movie they watched some years ago? Why do people wanna eat some food they eat years ago? Because we wanna remember how that experience feels like it.!<

>!And why is Tahani the only human being in existence who wanna live forever? She is the only human being that do wanna keep living forever like the immortal creatures from Bad Place and Good Place. That was a lazy ending for her imo.!<"

The Playbook,No it still is. Many people want Barney-Robin together.
Cypher,"hey man, this sucks :)"
Cypher,another streaming service
Cypher,Wow the acting on this show is *bad*
Cypher,"Roku Channel is free. (For now.)

Besides this was written on the wall for a while. Roku makes Streaming Sticks that make your TV a smart TV. Well every TV is a smart TV now so Roku has to grow their business somehow. Having their own content is the next step unless they want to double down on their shitty sound bars."
Cypher,"Oh for sure, I wasn‚Äôt really making a comment on the quality or lack thereof on Roku Channel. Just an observation. 

Also didn‚Äôt know they made sound bars, that sounds like a weird product offering"
Cypher,Doesn‚Äôt Roku get paid by TV manufacturers for using their system? Like I had a TCL smart tv but it came with a Roku remote and had the Roku software build into it.
Cypher,holy shit who cares this much. honestly. write an ebook. you're 50% done.
Cypher,JHC
Cypher,"TL;DR

My thoughts on the ‚Äúnostalgia argument‚Äù as you call it, is it‚Äôs a genetic fallacy. You try to explain how and why someone has a position instead of addressing the position on its own merits. Instead of saying ‚Äúyou like x because you watched it when you were little‚Äù you should just say why you think it‚Äôs bad when viewed with a critical lens."
Cypher,Tldr
Cypher,k
Cypher,"People are already downvoting me without having read even 1/10 of what I wrote. A post that I put so much attention, care and months writing, analysing, and thinking deeply about..."
Cypher,What does this mean? What is JHC? I really don't know.
Cypher,"I'll tell something I experienced about Super Mario Bros. 3. It's a 2D platformer that is widely hailed as a masterpiece, one of the greatest 2D platformers ever made. I said to a person online that I consider it a truly great game. He immediately attacked me, saying ""you're blind by nostalgia, take off your rose-tinted glasses"". I have no nostalgia for Mario 3, played it for the first time a few years ago, I told him so, and he went back in his criticism. But if I hadn't, he was basically going to call me out on my love for the game! Actually, he had already called me out for loving the game, and he assumed that I was nostalgic for it! But even if had very strong nostalgia for it, he would still be wrong in criticizing my high praise for the game! Even if I was nostalgic towards it, nostalgia shouldn't suddenly make my judgment and love towards it less valid and less well-thought. As if I have no critical sense, as if I don't understand and deeply scrutinize what I love, and I know why I love it, why it deserves MY love and praise! This is why I think that people who say things such as ""it's not as good as you think"" and ""you just have nostalgia goggles"" are assholes.

I highly recommend this video essay.

https://youtu.be/443b0-FAsWI

EDIT: Why was I downvoted?"
Cypher,Welcome to the internet
Cypher,Months üò≥üò≥üò≥
Cypher,"Jesus H Christ. 

As in ""Jesus H Christ, this is a long post!"""
Cypher,"I guess I overestimate the extent to which people online are willing to have long articulated discussions. For many, it's all about superficial shock, and disrespect and arrogance."
Cypher,Yes
Cypher,"Thanks for answering my doubt.

EDIT: Geez, I just thanked him, why the downvotes?"
Cypher,Damn
Cypher,"I know. If you would be willing to read my entire OP (I know it's long, but I feel like I had to write all that, though of course you aren't obligated to read it), please say what you think of all I wrote in this thread, and about my replies in the comment section too. I would love that."
Cypher,"As a complete sci-fi WHORE, I'll watch just about anything if it even stands next to the genre. 

So of course I jumped right on this. And I really enjoyed Jonathan Tucker in Kingdom, so had high hopes for him in something different.

To keep this short, basically its a fantastic concept, it's filmed wonderfully, has pretty great special effects. Even the ""debris of the week, with a serialized narrative"" is pretty great. But the writing is dismally bad. Tucker seems ill-suited for the character, his (and everyone, really) dialog is horrible, and the director seems to have no idea how to use him. The rest of the cast is ok, but the bad writing overshadows everything else.

I'm still watching it. But I find myself cringing at dialog every couple minutes."
Cypher,The overarching story is good but the writing is really bad. I liked the other listed shows.
Cypher,I gave up around episode 3 or 4. The writing is that of an 8th grader trying to be clever and the 2 main actors are boring like hell.
Cypher,"Yeah I love it, definitely sates that fringe/X-files craving, and I‚Äôm a big fan of Johnathan Tucker from watching Kingdom. Now that it‚Äôs coming up on the finale I‚Äôm really hoping it gets renewed. I also find it hilarious that there‚Äôs an actor named Scroobius Pip"
Cypher,I wouldn‚Äôt even say that the writing is bad but what they‚Äôre writing about. Every SF story on network TV needs to be about family first and everything else second. They have to write so many dynamics between people and their parents/children/siblings that everything else gets lost.
Cypher,"at first i thought it was the spiritual successor to fringe, but meh..."
Cypher,It must have gotten a lot better because the first 3 episodes were a dumpster fire.
Cypher,One of the worst pieces of shit I've ever seen. It isn't even a sci-fi show. It's just sappy ghost stories.
Cypher,I love Debris even though I don‚Äôt care for the main characters much.
Cypher,"""dang If the story isn't great""

It is dogshit.

> Having watched Fringe/OG X-Files/Millenium

It is not like any of the above. It is all sappy emo horseshit each week. I am so glad I dumped this show."
Cypher,It's gotten a bit convoluted. I watch but have no idea whats what anymore. It had such an interesting premise. Hope they can work out the issues.
Cypher,"The art department [took the day off](https://ww.123movie.date/images/106159/poster-season-1.jpg)

It's like they just said ""hey go stand and we'll take a picture and that will be the promo"""
Cypher,"I really hope that this show gets more than one season to find its footing. Network sifi shows have such a hard time finding the right voices for the characters, even Fringe had a difficult time getting the characters right, and rewatching x-files, any of overarching story episodes are basically unwatchable. 

Unfortunately I doubt we are going to get even a sliver of the Walter/Peter dynamic with Finola and her father that made Fringe so good. And while I think Debris has potential to overcome its issues the only way thats going to happen is with time and money, which is unlikely to happen without proper viewership. 

Its much easier to renew a NCISSVU:NY season 30 than take a chance on a flailing high concept sifi show."
Cypher,"Something that kinda bothers me even though it's not super important. Why is his partner British? Like, I get that they want it to have that ""uneasy alliance"" feel where they aren't 100% on the same side, but wouldn't it have been better to go with a Russian or Chinese partner instead?"
Cypher,"What exactly do people gauge the ""acting"" by? Seriously I'll see people say it's bad acting(not to this series, but any series), or bad writing.  When most of you people have no clue as it's  not something you have expertise in(for the most part). Especially the acting. I mean these actors are given the material & basically told to do this or that by the director. Yet people want to blame the acting. Sometimes it could be the acting, but unless you were standing there when it was filmed-you don't know if it was the actor, the director, or the writers."
Cypher,"I.... sadly can‚Äôt argue

I get that the dudes probably got a swamped schedule, but doesn‚Äôt it feel like in all of these failed sci-fi pilots that [Joel Kinnaman](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm1172478/) would‚Äôve helped all of these projects so much more? Or at least someone like him? I‚Äôm not saying big/dumb/brawny is the only solution but choosing a 5‚Äô6‚Äù - 5‚Äô8‚Äù actor as your former badass POW/CIA recruiter plus also you anomaly detector/problem solver doesn‚Äôt really jive. I‚Äôm with you there."
Cypher,"See that‚Äôs the problem with trying to rewrite a modern understanding of physics/time/space in a TV drama. Give it a few more, you‚Äôll begin to discard their attempts to explain the unexplainable and then you can see if the meat of their story holds water. Not saying it will, just saying it might be worth a bit more time."
Cypher,"I swear there‚Äôs a BUNCH of folks like us who just ask for weird shit,  but HBO seemingly only turns out mega-brain-drain 3-white-boards + you-need-a-hoard-of-mescaline episodics. Gets kind of exhausting after a while, trying to embrace escapism."
Cypher,"Ok so I can‚Äôt argue with this. The last episode where it was literally 1 person vs the entire universe, but it turns out that the pursuit of the one turns out to be the key to saving the whole thing, it‚Äôs kind of counterintuitive"
Cypher,It's more a reboot of Threshold.
Cypher,"I mean I dig Finola a lot more than ‚Äúguy I‚Äôve seen in everything from Episodic cop drama to punk-gangster lead‚Äù, but I dig his range and he‚Äôs TRYING to act the heck out of every scene, he‚Äôs just a bit limited."
Cypher,I mean I had some drinks during an episode or two and had to rewatch... definitely not a punishment in my book
Cypher,I mean if you think the Art Dep. are driving story narratives and creative dialogue then.... go Art Department!
Cypher,"So if what you say is true, which I can‚Äôt argue against, I don‚Äôt think the parallel is George + Finola... I honestly think it‚Äôs George + the powers that be. Peter v. Walter was direct and interpersonal and wonderful (cuz let‚Äôs be honest, Walter in his truest neurotic form was a treat) but this is a drama show as much as it is Sci-Fi... the moments of levity are brief it at all existing.

I think if this show wants to succeed it has to be George, with his half a brain + one eye + junkie daughter + cop daughter, against the entirety of the 5 Eyes international intelligence establishment. IMO, just that."
Cypher,"Well there‚Äôs the whole ‚Äú5 Eyes‚Äù alliance across English/US Nations, whereby their nation intelligence agencies share responsibilities in the field... that‚Äôs an actual thing in the modern world so I guess they wanted to reflect that in the show..."
Cypher,"Yup! And it's just so poorly written, they don't give him the chance to be badass... be smart... or even be funny. All things Tucker is completely capable of. And at least smart and bad ass is something that I'd expect from an intelligence operator. It's literally just shots of him staring and looking confused/concerned about things half the time. Honestly, its kinda weird.

Both the main characters seem just disconnected from the plot altogether. I'm not mad, just disappointed."
Cypher,"I just finished rewatching Justified and he plays a really bad character in the last season of that. That probably has me already not giving him the benefit of the doubt. 

I think she would be a better character overall if she wasn‚Äôt always making that face that looks like she‚Äôs about to start ugly crying."
Cypher,"Yeah the W/P dynamic isn't close to the one in this show but it was a similar parent/child relationship so it seemed a somewhat appropriate parallel. 

IMO for the show to succeed they probably need to abandon the family dynamic entirely for characters that they can justify brining into the debris cleanup. While I do like the energy Tyrone Benskin(George) brings to his roles, he has never shown the ability carry a supporting character role. The sister is a nothing character that was probably created because the actress had a contract and it was easy to add her to the show (season hasn't finished but I would be surprised if she ends up more than a kidnap victim). They already did some ground work with the occasional team member that shows up to help. Most notably in the 2-parter that added different partners with alternate realities. 

Honestly if I were writing for this(for which I have 0 qualifications) I would have mi6/cia/influx/whoever kill the sister and father, which would give the audience an actual enemy to root against while giving those characters a purpose. Then develop the relationships between characters that have a justified reason to be around every week and actually develop the ""world"" of the show. All of which hopefully leads to a somewhat satisfying connection to whatever the debris is doing. But honestly I'm not confident in this getting renewed."
Cypher,"So what‚Äôs weird to me isn‚Äôt so much the shots of ‚Äúhim staring‚Äù or ‚Äúseeming smart‚Äù, cuz let‚Äôs be honest Jonathan Tucker does both of those really well. It‚Äôs the moments lost therein, where a more accomplished ‚Äúactor‚Äù could deliver a line or a phrase or a pronoun that kind-of launches the plot forward just an inch beyond the plodding pace of character-development that they‚Äôre currently engaging at. Plot development? Warp-speed. Character nuance? Freaking glacial, with icebergs as their mains...."
Cypher,"Isn‚Äôt that the worst thing? A guy does a good job being a bad guy and you dislike them forever more? Happened to me with Ben Mendlesohn in ‚ÄúAnimal Kingdom‚Äù. Oh, you‚Äôre in the MCU now (which O adore for its pomp); sorry homie, you‚Äôre a really talented rapist/murderer"
Cypher,Cody please stop spamming your fan fiction everywhere.  Especially when you angrily claim the stuff you say is supported by the show itself.
Cypher,"You sound a bit like a schizophrenic seeking patterns in things to the extreme. 

Either that or someone deeply procrastinating doing their work to finish the PhD in which case enjoy your ABD degree likely in 20 years."
Cypher,His name is Cody Holder and his family is very worried about him.
Cypher,"Nice, typical Reddit comment attempting to troll away from the main content of the post. Thanks for your ‚Äòcontribution‚Äô (boring)."
Cypher,Really?
Cypher,"The fact that you don‚Äôt see how manic and schizophrenic this post and details reads is disturbing. And mental illness and math degrees do go hand in hand. Apparently even the WW sub has deleted your posts for going from fandom to obsessive.  You literally created a sub for this stuff where you are the only one posting many of these long essays. Really, you could have two PHDs with this level of effort on actual things."
Cypher,Yeah he revealed his name on Reddit which wasn‚Äôt very smart of him (and then confirmed it was his name which was even dumber).  He also admitted to not sleeping for literally days before writing that garbage manifesto of his.
Cypher,"Man, I‚Äôm sorry but I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already and I‚Äôm working with many people about it already. If your issue is concern for me, please, you don‚Äôt have to worry. I‚Äôm just highly enthusiastic about decoding this puzzle that was built for us, the audience. It‚Äôs like our own personal maze to navigate here. Along the way we get lost as we fall down the rabbit hole. At the end we find the real story and the tree of life, take from that what you will. 

The narrator of WestWorld is literally schizophrenic. Perhaps that‚Äôs what you are picking up on, the story itself is madness and it‚Äôs about descents into madness, at least part of it. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm here to discuss the details of the show and not my personal life."
Cypher,"He created multiple subs to post this nonsensical trash... AND he posts using THREE accounts at least.  And sometimes his accounts talk to and compliment each other.  It is truly a sad state of affairs.

As for the mania - here is the type of ""logic"" you get from him.  The show is set in 2058 on Earth.  Last season coordinates from an AI monitoring system occasionally would show up in the show.  So Cody here thinks hey, Google Maps in 2020 will give me clues about a fictional 2058.  That's already a leap.  But then what does he do?  He goes to the coordinates, then wanders around and around on Street View or Satellite view, and then is MILES off from the coordinates and comes up with a finding.  

But his findings are insanity:  

\- He saw a city bike rental kiosk (4 miles off from show coordinates) sponsored by Ford the car company and thought it was an amazing finding because a dude in the show is named Ford.  

\- He found a train musuem in Africa and a bus station in Indonesia and this lead him to conclude a company in the show has an OCEAN TRAIN that travels 50,000 miles through the ocean in 2058.

\- He zoomed out and saw a face in a field (more like a vaguely egg shaped silhouette) decided it was a specific character's face, then wondered if there was some conspiracy with HBO paying farmers to draw stuff in fields.  Because some random field looked like an oval / egg.

&#x200B;

Dude is NOT well at all and is completely delusional and in denial of his total lack of critical thinking skills."
Cypher,"I was the one who deleted my WestWorld posts. I was harassed there, doxxed and brigaded, it was viscous. To read the atlas post and associated material, people can find it all on r/WWElevatedScrutiny now.

Edit: I do see how schizophrenic this might appear, especially if you haven‚Äôt looked into the google maps coordinates of the divergences yet. It might seem like I‚Äôm picking out shapes in clouds here, basically, and inferring meaning from that. Ducking nuts!"
Cypher,">I have have heard all of this mental illness nonsense already

Oh yeah, ""nonsense"" sure thing there Mr. Ocean Train and I Can Hear the AI Talking To Me Inside The Music Of The Show Guy."
Cypher,"I get it now. I thought it was explaining what the ‚Äúevents‚Äù on the circle in the show meant regarding the happenings on the show. It seems the ring does seem perhaps to be a time line of the year of the show as he says. I just can‚Äôt see what he is saying about those ‚Äúdivergences‚Äù. 

The searching google maps is the part that indicates a bit of mania here, but that‚Äôs mostly just sad. I was hoping to figure out some cool story about the ‚Äúparallel realities‚Äù that was hidden in the story. But it‚Äôs really not convincing other than some stairs that change color."
Cypher,"It‚Äôs more that it is a ‚Äúhobby‚Äù that is obviously occupying you for more than the hours most people are awake. Putting off the dissertation work, it seems."
Cypher,"Cody, you spammed the board repeatedly, and used multiple accounts to do so.

People ""harassing"" you kept asking for evidence, kept asking you to explain yourself, and you got mad and would end up blocking people.

And you can't get Doxxed when you stupidly revealed your name to everyone and then rather than try to claim it was an alias admitted to everyone it was your name.  Like that's really really dumb dude.  But of course now you are claiming otherwise.  Your dishonesty is astounding."
Cypher,"Like I get it, there COULD be some clues, some meaning, in the AI Graphical Interface Circle in the show.  Fine.  But that's the last reasonable thing Cody argued and then went off the deep end.  

He thinks there is time travel in Season 3, people living entire lives as other characters, he thinks a phone app in the show is a physical place in the Middle East for some reason, he thinks one character in the show is actually Teddy when the show itself and the cast and showrunners have explicitly said otherwise publicly a hundred times.  He thinks the splatter on the floor from an injured robot is a secret map, he thinks an AI from the show is talking to him through the music of the show.

He's just a bundle of illogical nonsense and is quite obviously not thinking clearly."
Cypher,"It‚Äôs true that I‚Äôm putting off my dissertation work (I mention this in the introduction of my atlas post). Again, this is a personal detail and IMO (not yours) its irrelevant to the current state of the project. The questioning of mental health and motivations was an early phase of the project that I‚Äôve now moved past. If one aims to discredit the project, I suppose taking a personal angle on why I‚Äôm pursuing this hobby makes sense. It might make more sense though, in my view, to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory. One could start with the premise that the coordinates provided in the show are relevant to the story, and go from there. Perhaps one would take an entirely different path than I have. Anyway,   Hopefully my hobby doesn‚Äôt interfere too much with your Reddit experience."
Cypher,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm just here cause WW.  I actually though when watching it that some of the androids were brought back in different bodies.  I am kinda slow in that show though, so I guess I was wrong in that."
Cypher,">to observe and organize the data oneself and come up with a competing theory.

The show is set on Earth, the coordinates in the show are from the fictional 2058 year Earth the show is set in.  Boom, a bazillion times more compelling than your horseshit."
Cypher,A LOT of people thought that was a possibility at first.  But then the show revealed what occurred.  And everyone but Cody accepts the show (and show runner and cast interviews).  He apparently knows better than everyone who made the show smh.
Sing On!,"Well, that was amazing. I really need to catch up. Haven‚Äôt seen any of this season. "
Sing On!,Boom boom!
Sing On!,"This is the best use of the criminal lineup trope I've ever seen. Brooklyn Nine-Nine has the absolute best cold open gags.

The whole show is so goddamned funny, to be fair."
Sing On!,This was one of my favourite openings so far.  I really hope it gets renewed!
Sing On!,This show just gets better each season! GO WATCH THIS!
Sing On!,I have never loved a comedy this much since The Office 
Sing On!,"This is why I've stuck with the show, I love it, but admit it can drag a little at time; Then something like this'll pop up and laughs galore!"
Sing On!,That was awesome!  Please don't cancel this show!
Sing On!,Fuck I can't wait for season 5 to hit Netflix.
Sing On!,Just texted this clip to all my TV show friends to get them into it. I suggest you guys do the same! People need to know!
Sing On!,Best cold open I‚Äôve seen in a long time
Sing On!,Aren't they suspects? 
Sing On!,The episode with Sterling K. Brown was a highlight. Also the Halloween Heist episode.
Sing On!,"I'm watching it on Netflix in Norway, because I want to support the show somehow and not pirate it, but my god, the wait is killing me! I've only seen up to season 3, come on Netflix!"
Sing On!,Hey Bill!
Sing On!,This and Terry's tiny walk had me laughing a lot last night.
Sing On!,"During a line-up everyone isn't a suspect. Many times they will even have other officers/employees fill in spots with a line-up containing a suspect. There's often more than one line-up too. It serves a variety of purposes, not only to identify a suspect but to test a potential witness."
Sing On!,Where's my eye contact?
Sing On!,"His normal, signature tiny steps."
Sing On!,"i loved gina‚Äôs line ‚Äúaww, you two are finally gonna have sex?‚Äù"

Sing On!,Karaoke is not a contest. This is shit.
Sing On!,This reminds me of Singstar
Sing On!,Absolutely dog shit. How do the people at Netflix think this is good?
Sing On!,"Because it doesn't look good to you, doesn't mean it doesn't look good to everyone. Netflix isn't interested in only catering to one audience."
Sing On!,Nah call a spade a spade. It‚Äôs dog shit.
Sing On!,"That's an opinion. I don't think it looks good either, but I recognize that's an opinion not everyone has to share. Netflix knows that too."
Sing On!,"That's a valid point and you're getting downvoted. Some people don't realize that Netflix releases shit after shit and sometimes, it's actually not shit. That's their strategy. Just because they can. The best part is, no one is forced to watch what they don't want to so I don't understand why people are complaining."
Sing On!,Toby always gets me at the end 
Sing On!,I love how she has no idea that they are trying to whew her and she is just enjoying the performance.  Then when they forget they are in competition and forget all about the Erin.  And of course Toby.  
Sing On!,"Whoa, this is strange. I just watched this episode on netflix."
Sing On!,There's a few cases of songs being sing that get interrupted for various reasons on The Office. I really would love to hear a full version of this.
Sing On!,Just....Why?
Sing On!,"Shooting people in the head = OK

Singing on TV = Not OK

Hmmm, something's not quite right there"

Sing On!,You realize by Conservative it doesn't mean american conservative.  It is more traditional in how things are approached. Such as in the middle east in conservative areas females are still required to wear the shawl(not exactly sure what the actual name is)

Calm down, the root of all problems can't be blamed on religion as much as you want it to be"
Sing On!,"For your quip at the end, I'm going to give you a reality check. All that means to the vast swath of Americans, is that Turkish people are slightly less murderous than feral, ghetto blacks in major cities.

It's just simply a meaningless statement to the tens to hundreds of millions of Americans who live each day with absolutely zero caution spent with regards to being murdered."
Sing On!,"yeah wtf...

cant even trust the bbc sites now days."
Sing On!,What's the difference?
Sing On!,"This isn't true. The family had nothing to do with it.

Reportedly her ex-BF didn't want her to join this show. She reported him to the police four months ago when he threatened her. The BF and two others have been arrested for attempt to commit murder, but they haven't confessed to anything so far."
Sing On!,"Yeah I have no words for this, its just awful."
Sing On!,"You are incorrect because the murder of this woman was inspired by Islam.

FYI: beliefs inspire actions."
Sing On!,AKP is the governing party in Turkey and PKK is the terrorist organization.  
Sing On!,So it wasn't someone whom incessant reality shows on TV drove insane?
Sing On!,"Oh, don't be so silly. You idiots are always violating people's human rights with your BS about how everything is religion, Christianity, Islam, blah-blah.

Sing On!,"I didn't realize you were being sarcastic, in that sense you're quite correct."
Sing On!,"Barney Miller is one of those old shows I always enjoying watching. A good example of some of the quality TV that aired in the 1970s after the rural purge occurred. FamilyNet plays several episodes almost everyday, usually in a block with some All in the Family episodes. "
Sing On!,"I felt like that episode was so depressing, And I watched Bojack Horseman twice."
Sing On!,"Only ""LOST"" creator is Jack Bender. Got excited we we're gonna get another Damon show."
Sing On!,I tried searching yest for it. I was adamant it was Leonard Cohen. Can't hear the Chris Rea resemblance in it
Sing On!,"I thought it was a cover of a Leonard Cohen version. It's definitely not LCs voice, but the arrangement and the backing vocals and the instrumentation... I was also initially adamant it was him. Tbh I struggle to hear the Pixies resemblance üòÖ"
Sing On!,"I liked some of it, mostly in the earlier seasons if I remember correctly....but I do remember thinking it was getting cheesier and cheesier as the series went on.  And Segal covering stuff was kinda cringy.

I've only seen thru S5 however, so it might've gotten worse. "
Sing On!,"The music was ok, having 5 minutes of it at the end of every show in a overtly dramatic way.... not so much."
Sing On!,"Oh, it's god-awful.  Especially that travesty that was the Irish version of the theme song. "
Sing On!,"I generally hate the cliche of every, other damn show having to end each episode with  some, over-the-top, melodramatic, shitty song. 


Its tired, and over-done as fuck. "
Sing On!,"I use to really like the songs, but then every episode started having a 4 minute plus music video added in at random. This season seemed to go really overboard and many of the songs didn't fit at all. Sutter kept talking about how he had great plans for each song. When really it feels like he just hit shuffle on his Ipod and went with whatever song popped up."
Sing On!,"They did an episode in the final season that had absolutely no music, not even incidental music. It was very unusual, but I actually really liked the result. It gave it a completely different tone, it felt more serious. The other sound FX were critical because that's all you could during dialogue etc. "
Sing On!,"Yes, just awful.  If you're going to be edgy, use edgy music, not watered-down radio-friendly pseudo-metal.  That said, I did like a number of the Katie Segal covers (though there are entirely valid counter-arguments regarding them here in this thread)."
Sing On!,[deleted]
Sing On!,I've only listened to a few songs from the first season. I think [John the Revelator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6NDdF-R2uk) and the [Theme Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd9ULJf2jqU) are great. I haven't watched anything from seasons past that. 
Sing On!,It could certainly be better but it never struck me as particularly bad. It's not a great show (entertaining but not great) so I wouldn't expect an amazing soundtrack.
Sing On!,"The whole show is a soap opera. It's gonna be cheesy at time. 

I'm a big fan of the show, the music is part of that. "
Sing On!,"It was on point with John the Revelator closing season one. After that, almost every music video montage has been terrible. "
Sing On!,"Yeah it's all pseudo countrified music, trying to appeal to what they want their target market to be."
Sing On!,I second that. Over-the-top in an attempt at earnestness‚Ä¶
Sing On!,"I feel the music fits the show very well. I really enjoyed Yelawolfs ""Till It's Gone"" on the 7th season. I still listen to it daily on the way to work."
Sing On!,"Since I would say that almost everything about this show is wretched I would tentatively agree with you despite not remembering the music at all (which is actually a good sign, TV show or movie music is of category of a _background_ music)."
Sing On!,"When used sparingly and executed well, it makes for a transcendent viewing experience (see ""The Devil's Share"" opening for *Person of Interest*). If overused or inappropriately used, it's just shit and makes the scene worse for it."
Sing On!,"Same. Also loved: Day is gone, Come Join The Murders, Till its gone and the cover of House of The Rising Sun(though the original is much better."
Sing On!,"Yeah I liked that, and I think they did Gimme Shelter (or another Stones's song) that was pretty cool....but then they just started doing it every. damn. episode. and I think it got kinda tiring/lost its impact. "

Ratched,"Say what you want man, Ryan Murphy pulls in the numbers. I've been a fan for a long time and I thought the pilot for Ratched was at least compelling (my understanding is it falls apart as the season goes on)."
Ratched,"Everyone I've talked to who's a casual TV/streaming viewer (not a critic type) has universally loved it, yet whenever I hear critics or critic type viewers mention anything about it they eviscerate it. I haven't seen it yet, but having this level of polarity between different audience types (from my own personal witness at least) has certainly piqued my interest."
Ratched,"People have weird tastes. I tried it. It's stunningly beautiful. But there's absolutely no way to redeem one of the most vile literary characters of all time, and no reason to try. 

Anti-heores are one thing, but Nurse Ratched is basically an anime villain. She's like Dolores Umbridge, if Umbridge's goal was to abuse and lobotomize mentally ill people. I don't really understand why so many people would be interested in watching that."
Ratched,I loved this show. Can‚Äôt wait for a second season.
Ratched,it seems that this millionaire contract Netflix made with Ryan Murphy is really worthwhile
Ratched,"It's alright, I enjoyed it for what it was.  It's just your typical AHS season; a mildly interesting period setting with a few relatively macabre moments and Sarah Paulson turns out a decent performance."
Ratched,So is this about the nurse from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? Because that's a dumb fucking idea.
Ratched,"People shit on Ratched, and while it does have its flaws, it's a solid Netflix original. 

It's not going to blow people away or win awards, but it's a good B series. And if *this* is the type of quality we get on Netflix, I'm A okay with it. Not looking for the ""next"" big thing every series that comes out."
Ratched,It‚Äôs cause Sarah Paulson is pure gold!
Ratched,"I just want to say...no one can replace Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched. 

I watched the series, but I didn't like it. Probably would not watch another season- according to Netflix- I am one of the few."
Ratched,I thought it was decent until the very end. no spoiler: it ends like a cheesy soap opera
Ratched,"If you're looking for a sincere embellishment of the familiar title character, this series isn't it. If you're looking for another garbage ass season of American Horror Story, which just exploits the name recognition of an iconic character, this *is* it."
Ratched,Is it Ratch-edd or Ratch'd?
Ratched,"I made it through 1.5 episodes. The only thing it has to offer is beautiful visuals. As others have said, it feels exactly like another boring season of AHS. Same unoriginal schlock from Ryan Murphy. I think his well of creativity ran dry long ago."
Ratched,"Really dumb concept. Who wants a fleshed out view
 Of this character‚Äôs background? It almost defeats the purpose of her in the original film - a simple cog in a wheel in a system of oppression. Giving her nuance makes the character less effective imo"
Ratched,[deleted]
Ratched,"I am a fan and watch all of  Ryan's stuff so I will give Ratched a looksy.    He puts out a lot of content and they can't all be Nip/Tucks sometimes they are , alas AHS Roanokes.  Put Dylan McDermott in Everything  problem solvedüòçüòò"
Ratched,Watched the whole season and wished I hadn't. It really was just a shitty season of American Horror Story
Ratched,"If they had said 51M, would we know though?"
Ratched,TOO SLOW
Ratched,"It was pretty to look at and so I liked watching it in the background while doing other things. Not everything needs to be a prestige drama, which the critics were expecting this to be."
Ratched,"For me, I don't know. People are raving about this. I watched 2 episodes. It isn't grabbing me. The ice pick part was cool in a gross way (or is it gross in a cool way?), but I dropped off after. I find it boring and I can't seem to get interested in any of the characters. 

Good news for fans, though. I'm guessing this guarantees an S2."
Ratched,I couldn‚Äôt make it past the first episode...
Ratched,"The Witcher had 73 million viewers.

Umbrella Academy had 64 million viewers in the first season.

48 million is a big step down from those numbers.  I would have thought we would have had more viewers due to lock down, but then again it still has two more months to pick up views."
Ratched,"It's bad, but you, the viewer, have no power to dictate quality. you're going to watch it anyway."
Ratched,[deleted]
Ratched,So we get stuck with 5-6 years of this shitty show instead of GLOW and Teenage Bounty Hunters.
Ratched,Episode 1 has some really bad acting. I couldn't watch any more.
Ratched,Shame it‚Äôs fucking crap
Ratched,What's this show even about?
Ratched,I don't know about anyone else but I'm extremely hesitant to get into Netflix shows nowadays with how they cancel them after the second season.
Ratched,"""Who is literature's most hated character?""

""Um.. Nurse Ratched?""

""Lets make a show about her.""

""Brilliant!"""
Ratched,That will be very comforting for the fans when it gets surprise cancelled.
Ratched,Too bad it sucked.
Ratched,Enjoy the two remaining seasons!
Ratched,But is it any good though? The trailer looked pretty bad.
Ratched,People are simple they see Sarah Paulson and just watch it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Ratched,"I think this could have done as well (if not better, actually) as an original character. 

It feels like they shoehorned it into Nurse Ratched because of the name recognition and I kinda hate it for that. 

I enjoyed what I saw of it (my wife watched the series), but it was a shitty retcon of a character that didn‚Äôt need a backstory, and the one offered by the show seems contrived and at times incongruous with the ‚Äòknown‚Äô Ratched."
Ratched,This was just another season of american horror story.
Ratched,"Ryan Murphy really is a flash in the pan. Same stories, different environments. Highly overrated."
Ratched,"That is a little silly way to judge viewership, but as long as it's the same for every show it's still interesting bro see what their most popular shows are."
Ratched,Reminder: Reddit always brings this up when they try to explain why something is popular that they don't like lol
Ratched,"How many people would turn off after 2 minutes though?


People always bring up this factoid as if millions would just stop watching after two minutes"
Ratched,That‚Äôs about spot on how long I watched Ratched.
Ratched,"Watching this was a torture, I stopped after what? I think 20 minutes? 

Ryan Murphy should just go away."
Ratched,Reminder: OP probably doesn‚Äôt understand how any of this works
Ratched,That‚Äôs about as far as I got
Ratched,"> my understanding is it falls apart as the season goes on

You just described every Ryan Murphy show ever."
Ratched,"> Ryan Murphy pulls in the numbers

I loved the first couple of seasons of Glee and The People vs OJ was amazing. I'm not a huge horror guy so I've never seen AHS or Ratched but I can see why people would love them too."
Ratched,"Basically the real horror of OFOTCN was that Nurse Ratched was an entirely normal product of society. She's just an average, run of the mill, entirely polite, well dressed person who society has told her that treating the mentally ill like vermin is entirely acceptable and good. It doesn't matter if you 'beat' nurse Ratched, there are a million more waiting to take her place. Several lines in the film and the book directly compare her to the the system itself. 

Turning her into some kind of lunatic psycho is basically just removing everything interesting about the story in the first place. Ryan Murphy is only interested in the theatre of horror, the spectacle. He doesn't really care about the depth of it.

Why did the 10.000 torture porn films from 2000 make bank at the box office despite the critical mauling they nearly all got?"
Ratched,"A lot of reviews I saw seemed to hate it as an origin story for Nurse Ratched, and I'd actually agree.  Having watched it, the character seems to have little in common with the character Louise Fletcher portrayed beyond the name and occupation.  She actually *starts* with a personality closer to the book and the depiction in the movie and becomes *less* like it as the show goes on, which you wouldn't expect since the whole premise is supposed to be showing how she became the character we know.  It really fails at delivering on being any sort of exploration of why Mildred Ratchet is as horrible as she is and instead opts to make her sympathetic and heroic.

That said, I actually found the show to be decent.  The characters are fairly compelling and enjoyably campy, and the story and twists are interesting enough.  I also really liked the cinematography which felt very Hitchcockian. In typical Ryan Murphy fashion, the plot doesn't always make complete sense and characters can be a little inconsistent in their motivations, but overall I enjoyed the show.

In other words, if you go in expecting a show that expands on an iconic character (like *Hannibal*), it's terrible.  If you go in ignoring any connections to its source material, it's not a bad show if you're looking for something to watch."
Ratched,"I'm a regular viewer. I gave it an honest shot, watched 1.5 episodes yesterday. The best way I can describe it is pretty but trite. 

There's no honesty to the characters or the impact of mental illness and trauma.

Everything is for shock value. But nothing is genuinely shocking because it's all so hackneyed. 

Ratched has the exact same feel as Murphy's show Hollywood. In other words, striking visuals in a highly fantasized version of the past, with characters lacking any real depth, authenticity, or relatability. 

I could forgive everything if there were *something* fresh or original about the story or characters. But there's just not. It's banal pastiche. 

My one coworker who loved it is also a huge fan of Big Brother, so I guess that's the kind of viewer they are targeting."
Ratched,[deleted]
Ratched,This was so well-written
Ratched,"I‚Äôm a casual viewer. Overall I don‚Äôt dislike the suspense genre so, I‚Äôm not a hater right out of the gate. I watched an episode and half. The pace felt a little slow. The aesthetic and visuals are fun but, it‚Äôs not doing it for me. I dumped it for some other stuff. I might come back because  of all the hype and I gotta bunch of time in doors"
Ratched,It seems like it could be enjoyable if you never read the book. So I can see that divide haha.
Ratched,It's at 60% with critics on Rotten Tomatoes and 68% on the audience score. Not a big difference.
Ratched,"I'll be honest, as someone who watched the series, I didn't get most of that.

She's vile, but I don't feel like they portrayed her as some complete menace."
Ratched,Did you like the ending?
Ratched,Victory
Ratched,[removed]
Ratched,It's by name only
Ratched,That is what it is about and it is stupid fucking drivel. But if you have never read the book you might enjoy it since you don‚Äôt have to think about how this shows curb stomps all the themes from the book.
Ratched,well good thing you aren't a show runner
Ratched,[deleted]
Ratched,Sounds more like a C (okay) series than a B (good) series.
Ratched,"I misread that as Louise Belcher and was trying to remember what episode of Bobs burgers that was,  but knew that it was probably great because Louise belcher would make a great nurse ratched parody."
Ratched,"The same as it usually is, if it‚Äôs not for the reddit demographic, it‚Äôs not a good show."
Ratched,I may not have the power to dictate quality but I can dictate what I watch. And I still haven‚Äôt watched it. Lol.
Ratched,it's amazing how people can't comprehend that art is subjective and what they think is bad can be good to other people
Ratched,"Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean everyone in the world has to agree."
Ratched,Because Fargo and Hannibal were made in good faith. Ratched explicitly shits on the themes from One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. This show is fucking trash.
Ratched,Nurse Ratchet from One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest. Except what if she were more generically evil and it was a horror.
Ratched,"Yeah it is the same for each shows and internally they have other metrics they commonly follow like how long to finish, average episode watched up to in the first binge, and if users ever come back.

This metric is more for advertising/appeal purposes for if a show's premise and cast is enough to get people at least click on it and see if it is interesting to them.

That said it should still be set as an example to people on reddit of what actually does well on Netflix and where various bars are set."
Ratched,It‚Äôs a metric that‚Äôs especially sensitive to marketing. And Netflix pushed Ratched hard.
Ratched,To know the real numbers just look which series get a second season
Ratched,That‚Äôs Silicon Valley. Establish dominance by the  bare minimum metric. Networks have to be accountable to advertisers.
Ratched,"Also, it should be noted that this is obviously not the *only* metric Netflix uses to gauge popularity. They have teams of people and a host of algorithms to crunch all the analytics when it comes to deciding what shows are successful and what are not."
Ratched,"Yup, you will never see this posted when they reveal viewer numbers for a show they like. 

Ryan Murphy shows with Sarah Paulson are very, very popular."
Ratched,I bet it‚Äôs always posted but only gets upvoted if the show isn‚Äôt liked
Ratched,[deleted]
Ratched,"Only when Netflix claims a show with almost no buzz or word-of-mouth is apparently the most popular thing on the planet.

I'd expect to have at least heard of something if it was doing this well."
Ratched,Maybe more than you think. I probably do this to way more things than I actually watch in their entirety.
Ratched,I stopped the pilot of this one about halfway through because I realised it wasn‚Äôt holding my attention.
Ratched,"People's attention spans are getting lower and lower, partly due to the rise of smartphones

If a show got millions of views, there were millions more that turned it off the first second they were bored"
Ratched,I made it to 30 minutes
Ratched,"I don‚Äôt know man, both American Crime Story‚Äôs are damn near perfect to me."
Ratched,Ofotcn??
Ratched,"She's not just some lunatic psycho in Ratched, though. 

But I think her characterization IS the show's biggest flaw. Her intention's just ebb and flow with wherever the plot needs to go. She's fine with boiling people alive until the plot finds it inconvenient."
Ratched,What the fuck is a lfotcbcntlccn
Ratched,"Hannibal was theatrical and stylish, but it didn't stray from who Hannibal was in all the previous iterations. It is how Ratched should have been done, since it is the same character (unless it is a wild reimagining, but ehh whatever then)."
Ratched,What did you think of ‚ÄòJoker‚Äô? Your description for ‚ÄòRatchet‚Äô sums up a lot of thoughts I had when I saw the movie. It was pretty but the movie had nothing to say.
Ratched,Netflix commissioned 2 seasons.
Ratched,Have you seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo‚Äôs Nest? Her depiction in that is what I think the comment was going for.
Ratched,Oh heck yes I did
Ratched,"No, that's Lovecraft Country"
Ratched,Guess so.
Ratched,Or some of us only want to watch content that's really good given that there's so many movies and shows out there. Why would I watch something that's just okay given there are more really good movies and shows out there than I could ever watch?
Ratched,K
The Last Word,"I'm barely two episodes in and I'm already hooked. It's gripping yet disgusting in a way that only ""Making a Murderer"" was. I watched the second episode with a horrified look on my face the entire way through, and I heard it only gets worse.
"
The Last Word,I'm one episode from finishing this and it blew me away. Can't wait to see how it ends.
The Last Word,I'm catholic from Italy born and raised and it made me so enraged what the Catholic Church allowed and covered. I wonder if they have shown this to the current pope... very well made and resilient victims
The Last Word,Shit is dark AF. 
The Last Word,"Ahhhh, don't set yourself up for a big ending like The Jinx. It's more about the journey and just learning about what happened. It's a very well produced doc though."
The Last Word,"You took me by the hand, made me a man..."
The Last Word,*That one night*
The Last Word,I honestly sort of like the song.
The Last Word,I like how I can‚Äôt understand the punchline because of how the audio is layered
The Last Word,"Honest take: I like Trevor Noah‚Äôs standup. I don‚Äôt think we was the right fit to host the Daily Show, but this is one hell of a good meta joke"
The Last Word,"The real joke here being his audience keeps reliving him telling the same joke every groundhog day like bill murray trapped reliving the same day over and over again in the movie.

On a side note, DL Hughley guest hosting The Daily Show this week is doing a better job than the previous 2 guest hosts IMO, but I think they should have learned from Jeopardy and not done this guest host thing and just chosen one of the correspondents to replace Trevor."
The Last Word,"The only joke there is the editing in that clip. It's jumping halfway through words in some points and then the final line, *the punch line of the actual joke*, is impossible to make out because its 7 different audio tracks playing on top of each other with slightly different timings on each one because he said it 7 different times over 7 years.

I thought this was some fan edit and then looked down and saw this was the *Official* Daily Show youtube channel."
The Last Word,Seven misses and counting.
The Last Word,I think we'll be OK
The Last Word,He also told unfunny jokes for the last seven years every night.
The Last Word,"tbf, glad he's out. looking forward to what's next."
The Last Word,Glad he is gone.  Couldn‚Äôt stand his standup or the show.
The Last Word,"Trevor Noah told jokes?!

Edit: lol the same people downvoting me are probably the same people fuming at Seth Rogan for saying Marvel movies aren't really for him. Gasp, someone with a different opinion! Time to be personally offended!

It's OK that you like Trever Noah and its OK that I don't. This shouldn't illicit an emotional reaction from you!"
The Last Word,With Trevor Noah I genuinely don't know if it wasn't deliberate and he was that clueless. He's always so painfully unfunny.
The Last Word,Maybe Jon Stewart can come back
The Last Word,A comedian that isn't funny. I still haven't figured that one out.
The Last Word,"hey I remember the Daily Show

Stopped watched a few episodes into his era‚Ä¶those covid era promos were sooo bad it made me seethe

edit: why dont yall go fick yourselves"
The Last Word,Good riddance to him
The Last Word,On the positive side maybe they'll find someone funny to do the Daily Show again.
The Last Word,No
The Last Word,I don‚Äôt dislike Trevor but I do dislike him as host. I can do clips but I never could sit through a whole episode.
The Last Word,TDS is dead and I just have to accept that. It was on life support with Noah and will die with him. Fuck I miss Jon
The Last Word,"He's always been aweful on any of the UK panel shows when he was younger. Literally never said anything, and I don't think he ever said anything incitful or funny on his show. Called everyone in England racist for not liking the conservative leader Rishi Sunnak... Shows how much he actually thinks about what he's saying. We hate him cause he's a rich arsehole, trying to make his rich firends even richer! Totally disconnected from the normal views of people."
The Last Word,"I don‚Äôt think I could ever get past a few sentences. It‚Äôs like snl, typical propaganda and not funny."
The Last Word,He did jokes that didn't feature Trump?
The Last Word,Non-US Mirror?
The Last Word,"""...but why not use the satellite data?"""
The Last Word,It is written on the screen.
The Last Word,"I grew up around a lot of South Africans so that‚Äôs how I initially came to like Trevor. His stand up was hilarious to me because it hit on all of the idiosyncrasies of South African culture I could relate to, or at least recognise.

I was really happy when he got the Daily Show gig. I don‚Äôt watch it and never have, I was more so just happy he ‚Äòmade it big,‚Äô but from the clips I‚Äôve seen I don‚Äôt find him funny or entertaining as a host at all.

I often see people on Reddit saying his stand up sucks. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs his new material or what but his old material is some of my favourite stuff out there. I constantly quote his bits about ordering a Subway in German, making fun of nurses, and the PA systems in airports."
The Last Word,"I have similar opinion. 

I always have feeling, that when he was host, that somehow his delivery was wooden/forced(and joke timing was always somehow off) and that he himself is not comfortable as host. Maybe it was caused by repeating takes on show, while on standup he is more free to improvise and doesn't have to do sveral repeats in a row."
The Last Word,One thing I don't think he gets enough credit for is a better grasp of international news than Stewart had no doubt because he came from outside of America.
The Last Word,"I‚Äôve seen a couple of his standup specials and I‚Äôve liked them too, also really enjoyed him on Daily Show. But he hosted for a long time, I‚Äôm not surprised he wanted to branch out.

I read his book (*Born a Crime*) last month and it was incredible."
The Last Word,Same
The Last Word,Reddit is the only place where this is a brave opinion. He's very well-liked.
The Last Word,"Respectfully disagree on D.L.

He's *funnier* than the other two guests so far, but he is painfully ungood at hosting. He's devastatingly clumsy at throwing between segments and his transitions feel like he forgot they were coming and someone off camera is wildly cueing him. His interviews feel like very connected conversations between him and the guest, but a good host makes themselves the avatar for the audience to be a part of the flow of conversation and he is not inviting the public into these exchanges. 

He's very funny, but he's clashing with sharing the spotlight with the show and I'm personally ready for the next guest."
The Last Word,"I work for Paramount. Not high enough to know anything but just from word of mouth here my understanding is that no one was expecting Trevor to leave. You either have to know immediately (like literally immediately) who you want to replace him when the show comes back or just go the rotating host route until the summer. My guess would be one of Roy Woods or Jordan Klepper are your hosts to start next year. But again, I know almost nothing."
The Last Word,I don't think the rotating guest hosts is meant to be permanent. Probably just for the rest of the season until they can line up a full-time permanent host.
The Last Word,"A downvote is just a downvote not an emotional reaction. You editing your comment in reaction to downvotes, however..."
The Last Word,I had no idea he had so many fans‚Ä¶
The Last Word,He was actually a comedian (like doing sets at clubs and things like that) prior to becoming the host and I think he still did it off and on when he wasn't hosting.
The Last Word,"He‚Äôs too tired and bitter from fighting real fights and watching real friends get trampled and die. It comes through in his voice now.

Good men don‚Äôt make good sarcastic irreverent hosts."
The Last Word,I don't disagree with your comment. I wonder how much the producers and writers of the show have to do with this compared to Noah though? Iirc Stewart wrote a lot of his material and i personally thought he was spot on most of the time. Ever since Noah became the host i felt it didn't speak to me and never watched
The Last Word,"I'm old enough to remember when people said this when Craig Kilborn left and Jon Stewart took over.  Ah, the circle of life."
The Last Word,"> Called everyone in England racist for not liking the conservative leader Rishi Sunnak...

Haha thats hilariously uninformed.

Then again this is a guy who was doing stand up attacking striking mine workers before he left SA so its pretty clear where his sympathies actually lie."
The Last Word,Straight out of the Mailonline comments section lol.
The Last Word,That Trump impersonation voice he does is fucking cringe. Like if your going to do it every show for years. Spend some time to practice it. Just awful
The Last Word,"He's just off and maybe it's a South African thing? Idk, just weird they picked him when it's primarily American news and frankly... A black American probably has more to say about us politics"
The Last Word,His between the scene did where he answer audience question was good
The Last Word,"I also think it‚Äôs because he was stuck behind a desk. When he does standup he‚Äôs very mobile, which probably let him feel looser and more natural. It can be hard to perform well when you can‚Äôt really use half your body"
The Last Word,I've been on the taping of the daily show and there was no retake at all and very minimum editing.
The Last Word,"His bit about ""Trump is the first African president"" was too true."
The Last Word,"I don't fault Stewart for that specifically -- if you're in the US and you want _good_ international news that doesn't involve America, you really need to seek it out."
The Last Word,Is he? His show wasn't.
The Last Word,hope roy wood takes over. wouldn't be mad at dl though.
The Last Word,"> he is painfully ungood at hosting

That in itself is why I hate the weekly rotation of guest hosts. Trevor Noah was pretty bad at hosting the first few weeks he took over the show, but after a few weeks he became way more comfortable in the role and made the show his own. DL is the first of the 3 guests hosts I have found funny, but there is going to be an adjustment period for any new host stepping into the role and a few days isn't enough to overcome that. So each week we are just gonna get some new awkward host that isn't really comfortable and won't be given the time to adjust into it"
The Last Word,"Yeah I know it‚Äôs hard to jump into a new system but it‚Äôs surprising how clunky he is when doing show-y stuff. 

I miss Trevor."
The Last Word,"...""ungood""?

Don't you mean ""degood""?"
The Last Word,It's not like they replacing Alex Trebek here
The Last Word,Why did Trevor Noah leave?
The Last Word,">until they can line up a full-time permanent host.

CC management hasn't said what their plan is. They might choose co-hosts, long-term rotating hosts, or a single host.

I think the best move for viewers is for CC to choose one of the current correspondents. Any one of the past or future rotating hosts is going to have their own fanbase (that might migrate to the show if they get the gig), but the current crew have all been there a while, and I have trouble seeing how bringing in an outsider would help employee morale (whether in front of or behind the camera). Also, businesses that have an ""employee first"" policy tend to produce better products.

If I was Roy, and I wasn't chosen in favor of someone from the outside, I'd have to think about leaving."
The Last Word,I saw his standup live. To call him a comedian is a bit of a stretch.
The Last Word,But he has a sarcastic irreverent show on Apple
The Last Word,Could be for sure. Although I saw Noah's standup prior to taking over as host in NYC And it was abysmal.
The Last Word,"The difference of course being that by the end of Jon Stewart's run he was the new definitive face of the show. Ratings have only dropped with Noah.

Ironically, you referring to him as if he is a new host shows how little he has done to cement himself as someone with a unique personality.

The guy is okay but he lacks the amazing energy Jon Stewart had and it's just undeniable. Even today the attachment and earnestness Stewart expresses when he discusses these events makes it unlike listening to anyone else. Trevor Noah feels like he is just making generic late night jokes written by a team of writers. He simply can't seem to care about many of these topics beyond twitter dialogue."
The Last Word,Except it picked up with Jon and is now on a death spiral with Noah.
The Last Word,Im that old too. Literally no one said that. Craig Kilborns Daily Show had almost no fan base and it was very much a take it or leave it show.
The Last Word,"Being an outsider was his strength. As one (US passport, but living most of life abroad), Noah reflected and spoke to a more global view of the most important country in the world. The best of the other correspondents (and hosts) were also non-Americans imo-- Oliver, Bee, Jones, Chiang.

Unrelated, Roy Wood Jr and Dulce Sloan are my favs of the current correspondents, and I'd be happy if either succeeded."
The Last Word,"That's very typical of shows like this -- they write throughout the day, shoot in the evening, and then it needs to be ready to air a few hours later.  They don't really have time to do reshoots (unless something goes catastrophically wrong) or edit anything beyond fade-in and fade-outs.  It's as close to live-to-tape as you can get without being live-to-tape."
The Last Word,"People faulted Noah for not having as good a handle on domestic American issues, though."
The Last Word,"On reddit, no. Everywhere else, yes."
The Last Word,"I wish Hasan Minhaj would get the gig. I think he's the only name I see in the list that approaches the level of integrity Jon Stewart has.  His track record is really good:

- holding Trudeau to task on [arms deals with Saudi's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMa48O6cd-4) and [climate change promises](https://youtu.be/cDPeXoQUrbI?t=1157)

- calling out [Saudi Arabia on a massive platform like Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUhbZdvtzcw) when nobody else will

- calling out [Prime Minister Modi and Hindu Nationalists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqZ_SH9N3Xo) 

- Not pulling punches at the [White House Correspondence Dinner during Trumps Administration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDmSZX_zVuQ)

To me, that's the job requirement and I don't think any of the other hosts have shown they can do that. The guy reminds me of Jon Stewart with more venom.  

Also, would really recommend his latest comedy special ""The King's Jester"".  He goes into depth on literal death threats he would get and how his wife had to practically reign him in because he was doing shit that was just super fucking dangerous in terms of taunting world super powers."
The Last Word,"I agree about the adjustment period, I just don't see D.L. working with the team as well as the other two, and getting comfortable will help the awkward parts but isn't going to make a person less self-focused. 

I'm also not championing the other two, to be clear. I don't think we have a winner among the current guest hosts, provided these are indeed auditions."
The Last Word,"It's definitely not. You're 100% right. But the problem is $$. If you're Wood or Klepper, there's no way that you're taking the job without a pay raise. And I seriously doubt that anyone would be willing to do that."
The Last Word,I think burnout? He really loves touring and doing stand up and the daily show wasn't that. I don't really know anything other than what's been released by his PR team.
The Last Word,Jon Stewart is too busy walking through the blood and bone of his comrades to be hosting a show on Apple TV. /s
The Last Word,"Yes, he does but it‚Äôs not enjoyable. 

https://youtu.be/PWmxRzYlR7U

https://youtu.be/Ufwu68pOWBg

The Daily Show is on Comedy Central and it‚Äôs entertainment.

Where Jon Stewart is in his development now isn‚Äôt about entertainment."
The Last Word,Exactly. To compare the change from Kilborn to Stewart to the move to Noah is moronic. The 2 aren't comparable at all. Stewart took the show in his own direction and made it what it is. Noah tried to do Stewarts thing and failed miserably. Acting like its a generational thing like SNL casts or something is just very try hard and lacks any actual thought.
The Last Word,Who did i refer to as a new host?
The Last Word,"Definitive voice of the show? A sizable population of young people genuinely wanted him to run for President. I‚Äôm not kidding.

Weird times."
The Last Word,"Yes, thats kind of my point.  When kilborn left, the show wasnt killing it in the ratings. They brought in a new host who saved it.   

Now the show is struggling again, they are bringing in a new host, and everyone is claiming the show os dead because of it."
The Last Word,"Nah, gotta rewrite history so that we can use the new history to support our current opinions."
The Last Word,"I had people in my life who refused to watch after kilborn left.   So there were people. Obviously wasnt as big a fan base as stewart had during his run, but people always are against change"
The Last Word,"You are downvoted but this is spot on. People like to say ""oh I remember when it happened before and it was exactly the same"" about everything. Its just one of those things people rattle off without engaging their brain."
The Last Word,"Agreed. His ""Patriot Act"" show on Netflix was also really biting, well-researched, funny and thought-provoking."
The Last Word,">approaches the level of integrity Jon Stewart has

You're just gonna sleep on Sam Bee? She did 12 years as a correspondent!"
The Last Word,my main thing there is he already has a canceled show?
The Last Word,oh facts
The Last Word,https://youtu.be/r2kRxnYSce8
The Last Word,"You are comparing Jon's reputation when he first appeared on the show to Trevor Noah's when he left. I think that's funny, that he is seemingly still treated like the new young host. Trevor Noah's run feels short and non-existence despite the fact it isn't because nobody watched or was impacted by it."
The Last Word,What in the world are you talking about. Do you honestly think people were upset that Craig Kilborn was leaving TDS? It wasnt popular even in the slightest when he was hosting
The Last Word,"From his comedy special, it sounds like Netflix didn't cancel him but instead he stepped away from the show.

Previous to his standup special, I think most people thought Netflix cancelled the show because he was pissing off a lot of powerful people but in his standup special, he describes an event that sounds pretty horrific and it ultimately lead to him choosing the safety of his family over continuing to do the show.  I think he has also mentioned that since not doing the show, he's been able to return to doing standup.

He expressed interest in doing The Daily Show, which is probably smaller scale than his Netflix show and perhaps more safe."
The Last Word,"I  was commenting on the fact that the commenter said 'the show is dead now that trevor is leaving ', meaning a new host will kill the show, similar to how when kilborn left, it could have been described as on life support and there were people against the Stewart hiring. 

Not comparing the transition from stewart to noah to this."
The Last Word,"Im agreeing with you, champ."
The Last Word,lol it was vague enough to go either way and with everyone piling on I thought the worst. My bad  b
The Last Word,No worries
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,They'd better get their asses back to Isla Nublar and rescue Bumpy before the volcano destroys the island or I'll riot.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I honestly wouldn't mind more seasons of this, such as one where they make it home between Fallen Kingdom and Dominion. This show really grew to be its own thing that I think is a great addition to the Jurassic franchise."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Might be for the best. The first three seasons were excellent (Season 1 might be the best Jurassic Park sequel ever!) but the last one was a struggle to get through. There was still a lot to love, but I think the writers really overestimated how exciting it would be to see the kids try to save dinosaurs from the most stereotypical evil nerd ever, instead of trying to finally get home again."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Oh god oh no..WHY?!?
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I feel like when they added the high tec place it lost the magic that made it Jurassic park but still pretty good
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,My opinion is they should straight up have one of the kids finally eaten by a dinosaur and teach the children viewers about loss.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I also really liked it
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Last one was so bad. I can't get myself to finish it.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,My kids are in shambles
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Being eaten is such a brutal way to die in a kids show. But it's weird. I've seen kids shows where people die: they get crushed by debris, get run over, get stabbed, blown up, all different kinds of suicide, vaporized, turned to dust... but getting eaten? And not in a cartoon haha way where dudes get swallowed whole in one bite... but mauled by an animal and taken apart by fangs and claws? That feels so grotesque."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Oh, you should. Not because it gets better but because the final four seconds are utterly absurd."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I only finished it because it was so bad it was hilarious. Finally, it has sunk down to the quality of the movies."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,It happens in Clone Wars
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,ahah I will. half way already!
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Shows been out 8 months and has 3 seasons.  Seems unusual.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I was watching s1 with a nephew.  Got hooked at ep 4. Total expectation changer.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"It‚Äôs actually a generally solid show and sort of dark too. Working through the latest season currently. If you‚Äôre wondering about the releases, Netflix and Dreamsworks usually pump out these types of series really fast. Like Spy Racers or She-Ra for example."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Is this show canon? I've never watched it yet.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,We have binged it this weekend. Didn't really like it at first but now I'm super invested. And crazy curious that none of their parents are concerned when their kids have been missing for six months and last seen on an island being emergency evacuated because of dinosaur rampages.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,The easter egg about John Hammond's death in the book was brilliant.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,i just watched all three seasons last week... a fun show that was surprisingly dark at times...
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I won't lie the damn Scorpius Rex was pretty freaky... Damn Dr Wu and his need to push the boundaries of nature and science.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,The homies and I put this on as a joke once but we ended up watching 5 episodes
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Best Jurassic Park media at the moment
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Bring us Dragon Prince s4
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Exciting! Season three was great, I expect four to be at least as good!"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Gotta say it's one of the rare kid's show I can watch with my kids.... And not scream into a pillow wishing it was over.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Love this show. My kids love it and its a staple in my household. Cant wait for season 4!
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I low-key want to start watching this so badly.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I just finished this show and it was surprisingly entertaining. I thought it was just a kids cartoon and for the most part, it is but it's an easy watch. Some nice Jurassic World/Fallen Kingdom easter eggs in there, too. 

Also, Bumpy is best gurl."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,This show is legit. And didn‚Äôt season 3 just drop??
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I've been meaning to check this out when I have more free time!

(Edit, 24 days later): Wow ... I have no memory of posting this but I just watched S1 last night? On S2E2 right now."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Watched all 3 seasons with my 4 year old. Season 2 was the strongest one for me. I just want the kids to get home at this point.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Is it any good? Ive been putting it off but im tempted because dinosaurs
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I'm in season 3 and still don't understand why their parents haven't organized a search for them
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I watched a couple of these but it was too kiddy, not sure if they were targeting  just kids or not"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"It's actually a quite decent show. You would expect that 3+ seasons of a bunch of kids narrowly escaping being eaten by dinossaurs again and again would quickly get tiresome but somehow they manage to keep the encounters tense enough even if you are not really expecting any of them to die because kids show (plus it is neat to see how the plot ties to the movies). I'm found enough of it to wish the upcoming JW: Dominion movie gives these series a nod, maybe even feature a couple of these characters."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I'm sorry, season 4?

I was not aware there was a season 1."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,It's a kids show?!...?
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"This show just showed how badly designed Jurassic World as a park was.
Why was there a rafting rider where the river led to the mososaurus lagoon?
Why can the hatchs the lead to dino habits be opened by anyone.
And why do several of the exhibits have doors that lead right to the main park.
Soany other things, like how the camp was smack dab in the middle of herbivore grazing paths with no fences."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"So remember that island full of dinosaurs that people always end up being killed and eaten by dinosaurs?

Yeah yeah...what about it?

Let‚Äôs send kids there ya know?! What could go wrong?"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Now hold up..... season 4? I didn‚Äôt even know there was a season 1
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Apparently there‚Äôs a season 1-3?
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,My toddler loves this show lol and i‚Äôm not going to lie I get invested in it too sometimesü§£
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Wow this shit has 4 seasons?
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Camp Cretaceous might be the cheapest looking tv show airing right now.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I‚Äôm sorry but seriously who cares
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,[deleted]
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Never thought I‚Äôd be so disinterested in Jurassic Park
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,good god why.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Yes...but let's cancel every other show after 1 season smh
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Like the new movies aren't dumbed down enough? I was watching Tremors at four. This show is a waste of talent.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Just finished watching season 3 today. I thought S3 was even better than 2. But only just barely.

Edit: Forgot which season I was on with what show. It was a late night reply. I just finished watching Season 4 of Castlevania, which is where I got this mixed up."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,[deleted]
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,We really need a full out animated remake of the first movie but with all the stuff missing from the book it will happen I bet when the franchise stops making money or an insane executive will green light it either way
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,How do they make seasons so fast? Are the actors signed on for multiple seasons? Does greenlighting or renewing future seasons mean anything? Are animators over worked? Is there software that makes it easier to animate a show like this? Is it cheap? Is it expensive? Would love to know it
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,My three year old is obsessed with dinosaurs and this show. I end up sitting to watch with him because it's so fun. I don't know how he doesn't get scared watching.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,What even is camp Cretaceous?
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Never even heard of this show.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,My children and I love to watch this show!
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Jurassic World: Camp Funtime
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Started watching it recently. Honestly pretty good
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,This show is my jam
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Boardwalk Empire presents: Woodstock road trip
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Way better than I ever expected and I love watching it now. I finished the newest season yesterday
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Me and my daughters fav guilty pleasure. On season 2 right now. üòä
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Season 3 was by far the best season yet.  A lot darker than the previous 2, hope we get a season 4!  Can‚Äôt wait!!!"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Wait they didn‚Äôt even hype up the third season
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"How much does this cover and why is it 4 seasons? If it takes place within the movie, It shouldnt cover that much?"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,That's Netflix for you. There are 8 seasons of Voltron in the span of two years. It's how they break things up just like all their other shows. Break them in half chunks and count them as separate seasons.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I had no idea there was a Jurassic Park show
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,All three seasons of Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts came out in 2020.  Netflix sometimes churns through content at a breakneck pace.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,">Shows been out 8 months and has 3 seasons. Seems unusual.

Yup. Seasons aren't what they used to be. Damn climate change."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Most of the time for their Dreamworks animated series, Netflix orders episodes, and not seasons. They ordered 78 episodes of Voltron that got split into 8 seasons and 52 episodes of She-Ra that got split into 5 seasons. I imagine the same is the case with Camp Cretaceous."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I feel like Camp Cretaceous is establishing a lot of major context for Jurassic World Dominion, so it's only relevant to release seasons before Dominion is released."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Wait this is on netflix

Did not realize it was a [Dreamworks](https://youtu.be/CRTIrK3Kku8) animation"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Meanwhile Dragon Prince fans be like...
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I didn‚Äôt even know this show existed till now and I consider myself pretty up to date.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,They're not long seasons. The show is being broken up into story arcs.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Netflix commissions full seasons of their animated shows and then breaks them into several much smaller seasons to appear more content-rich and keep things spread out at the same time. it‚Äôs weird. Source: I just wrapped working on a Netflix show.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Damn, and here's Transformers, another billion dollar franchise, getting treated like crap with the poorly managed Seige mini series.

They were too cheap to even hire union talent. The writing and voice actors are horrendous."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,There‚Äôs a Jurassic park tv show????
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Didn‚Äôt even know it existed
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I‚Äôm not complaining.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"The minute the show demonstrated it was willing to kill off characters, I knew it wasn‚Äôt your normal kids show"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I had no fucking clue this show existed until thirty seconds ago, and it's in season four"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,My wife and I keep watching this going ‚Äúthis is a kids show???‚Äù Like we love it but goodness there are some strong suggestions if people think about some things too hard
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I read this and thought I‚Äôd give it a try. I binged watched a few seasons and now love this show.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"I see why, I always warn people that the first three episodes kinda suck, but it picks up at episode 4"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,aren't the characters flat and children's cartoon like?
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I think I dropped off at episode 3.  I might go back and watch the rest of the season since this thread is showing positive reception.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,She-Ra was surprisingly good.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Yes I believe so, season 1 takes place during JW1, and 2-4 in between the gap of 1 and fallen kingdom"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Yup! It‚Äôs pretty good too! (Once you get past the first three episodes)
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"Yeah, it has been confirmed as canon. It's quite good too."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"As others have pointed out, yes!

Something I particularly like are the subtle Easter eggs for references from the actual books too!
I recently read Jurassic park, which is very different from the original movie, including several character deaths. 
In one of these Camp Cretaceous episodes, the kids are taking about a place being haunted by the ghost of the character who died in the books but not the movie AND that they died in the way detailed in the book! which I thought was an excellent nod from one cannon to the other."
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Boom
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,I believe they are assumed dead. Many people died on the island.
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,"On Season 1, episode 4.. but did you say... Scorpius Rex?"
Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous,Me and the homies watched all 3 seasons üòé
Dragons Dogma,I hope this does well so we get another Dragon's Dogma game
Dragons Dogma,Strike when true arisen.
Dragons Dogma,My god was I obsessed with the game. Magic Archer but not until level 200 as a sorc? Please make me lead.
Dragons Dogma,"Well this came out of nowhere. I was hoping we hear more about the supposed Diablo anime adaptation, or even Devil May Cry. I love Dragon's Dogma the game so I'll take this."
Dragons Dogma,God I wish they would stop with the cgi animation
Dragons Dogma,Masterworks all!
Dragons Dogma,"Finished Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen not too long ago and I'm excited to see what the show's going to be like. I'm a bit disappointed that it's CGI but the characters don't look bad. If it's CGI on the level of Beastars then I'd have absolutely no problem with it, but that's something of an outlier (as is Land of the Lustrous)."
Dragons Dogma,"I'm a huge fan of Dragon's Dogma and I wasn't even aware of an anime coming. Excited but confused!

I originally bought the game day one because it came with a demo for resident evil and was blown away that this gem of a game never got the traction it deserved. It took the Dark Arisen expansion and a ton of releases/ports to finally make some good sales. Now I think I might return to it and see what ratings my pawn has...."
Dragons Dogma,"I've tried the game many times but couldn't like it.

Anyway, Netflix's animated series are really good so far (what I've watched anyway). So, I'm interested."
Dragons Dogma,I hope the anime includes the 2 most important characters in the series: [Randyjohnson and Panpan](https://youtu.be/WbKrlJgwI4A)
Dragons Dogma,"Someone needs to put a restraining order on the US, to stop butchering anime and Japanese video game IPs...

Castlevania is already a huge disaster, made by someone who admittedly only read CVs wikipedia page, and is crammed with nonsensical characterisations and gore en masse for a dumb audience, who in 2020, still thinks gore is ""mature"", and who doesn't get CV at all."
Dragons Dogma,[deleted]
Dragons Dogma,"It's guaranteed.It was the director's baby and Capcom has been giving him whatever he wanted. He just made the highest grossing Devil May Cry game after the series was dead. DMC5 was at the top of his list of demands for Capcom, if they gave him that, a sequel to a dormant series that they weren't happy with and couldn't fix then Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely his next project."
Dragons Dogma,"*""Even in numbers, a weakling is a weakling still!""*"
Dragons Dogma,"Dunno why you got downvoted, it's an awesome game :) Though I'm not really sure how they're going to spin it into an exciting TV series. As much as I loved the gameplay, I did feel like the story could have been better, and I'm not a big fan of the ending (I will avoid spoilers for people who've never played it in case the series decides to stick with the same overall plot)"
Dragons Dogma,costs way to much otherwise
Dragons Dogma,"I used to think the same thing, then I watched Beastars on Netflix. It CAN be done well, it's just a lot of anime seem to half ass it and it looks like shit. But Beastars genuinely shocked me with how good the cgi animation was. 
Also watch Beastars, it's so fucking good lol."
Dragons Dogma,The CV anime is incredibly successful and pretty well received all round
Dragons Dogma,They need to stop giving IP's especially good ones to shitty cgi hack houses.
Dragons Dogma,"I don't know what to tell you but plenty of creative writers use wikis of their own works or whatever they're working on for consistency with past work.  The CV games have  very little lore in them to begin with, a lot of it is through supplemental material."
Dragons Dogma,Last season was good too
Dragons Dogma,"Dunno, I think S3 was easily the best."
Dragons Dogma,Season 2 was the worst one IMO.
Dragons Dogma,Itsuno was given a choice between DMC5 and Dragon's Dogma 2 and he chose DMC because he felt obligated to give fans a true sequel.
Dragons Dogma,I loved the faux ending
Dragons Dogma,"The official synopsis is as follows: ‚ÄúEthan sets out to vanquish the Dragon that took his heart, but with every demon be battles, the more he loses his humanity. Follow Ethan, along with his pawn Hannah, in his journey to reclaim his heart.‚Äù

It sounds like it‚Äôll just be some action scenes in succession. So not sure if it will actually be good. More so because I assume they will force a relationship between the protagonist and his pawn... But pawns are just lifeless shells more or less."
Dragons Dogma,Wish they wouldn't bother making it then. Now I can't get a decent Berserk or Ajin that doesn't look like absolute cancer. Better to not do it then do it in the worst way possible. But I guess that's not the Netflix moto.
Dragons Dogma,"You have Berserk on the one end and Beastars on the other - CGI Anime can be good, but way too often it's shit."
Dragons Dogma,"It's not that I think it can't be done well(hell, look at land of the lustrous), it's that it's rarely done in a way that justifies it not being 2d, other than cost."
Dragons Dogma,Seriously it made go back and rewatch from the beginning again. Castlevania anime hasn't had a low point yet
Dragons Dogma,It was good but fuck it felt like you were dragged through a shit storm of crazy.
Dragons Dogma,As good as season 2 in the sense that both were bad.
Dragons Dogma,The actor for Dante said in an interview Itsuno was going to leave capcom and he had list of demands to keep him and DMC5 was a priority. He always seemed like he wanted to do right by the franchise with how much budget and time cuts screwed the games he worked on for the franchise
Dragons Dogma,"All I care about is that Capcom thinks the IP is worth building, meaning that I bet we see a sequel future. That‚Äôs all that matters."
Dragons Dogma,They thrive on weeb tears
Dragons Dogma,"Either way, you don't get the fludity and dyanimic characters that tradiational animation gets. Everything looks so static with cgi."
Dragons Dogma,"Ahh gotcha, that's fair and I agree. Also I'd never heard of Land of the Lustrous but that premise is super weird and now I'm very interested so thanks for the new show lol."
Dragons Dogma,Disagree. Only season one was good. S2 and 3 had good action but the story bordered on pointless.
Dragons Dogma,This show has had no bad seasons so far
Dragons Dogma,Voice actors have no say in whether a game is made or not.
Dragons Dogma,They thrive on making low effort garbage to pad their bleeding catalogue.
Dragons Dogma,I worded it wrong by he I meant itsuno the director
Dragons Dogma,"The story for the game was absolutely boring, generic drivel *until* the very end, when it became one of the most bonkers and mind blowing narrative turns I'd ever seen.

I don't know how they're going to incorporate the same here"
Dragons Dogma,"I'm 100% sure Daredevil intro was an inspiration for this hahaha


From the side Grigori looks the same, but I can't shake off the uncanny valley. Somehow I know it's Dragon's Dogma, and at the same time it doesn't look like it. I'll have to wait and see an episode for myself."
Dragons Dogma,"But the story of Dragon's Dogma was the worst part...

Are we getting 13 episodes of climbing on monsters and ""They are weak to ice and fire both!""?"
Dragons Dogma,RIP the dream of having the same intro music as the game did. Nothing tops the surprise of booting up the game to generic fantasy piano music that suddenly explodes into loud rock music
Dragons Dogma,"holy shit though. the worst thing to ever come out of game of thrones is this stupid as fuck cgi bullshit animated intro with the fucking orchestral music over it. 

netflix has done that shit for so many originals ever since they saw it in season 1 of got and its just so fucking lame. 

just stop. nobody needs a 5 minute shitty cgi music video with an orchestra... they just don't."
Dragons Dogma,"I did not finish it because i got bored. Always considered the game extremely good for it's gameplay, not story"
Dragons Dogma,"a LOT of intros are doing this ""close-up inanimate object rotating"" type of intro... Westworld, the Crown also come to mind"
Dragons Dogma,"Feels more like Black Sails, but yea, it's a common aesthetic these days."
Dragons Dogma,"The ending of the game is ridiculous and awesome. It gets a million times less boring. It takes forever to get to that point, but it's so good when you do."
Dragons Dogma,"A lot of that is down to Elastic being the ‚Äúin‚Äù title design studio right now, and they‚Äôre popular for Emmy nominations. Their work includes:

Westworld, The Crown, Game of Thrones, Doom Patrol, Hunters, His Dark Materials, The Morning Show, American Gods, Altered Carbon, Daredevil, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Man in the High Castle, Carnival Row, True Detective, The Americans, Halt and Catch Fire, Ant-Man and The Wasp, The Punisher, The Alienist, The Night Manager, Making a Murderer, Masters of Sex, Carnivale, Deadwood, Justified. 

They tend to go for one of two looks - photo montage or CG object studies."
Dragons Dogma,Looks like I'm out of the loop...
Dragons Dogma,I feel like Star Trek Discovery's intro counts too.
Dragons Dogma,"the 3-5 minute cgi animation with an orchestra played over it. 

[gee I wonder what kicked off that trend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZE9gVF1QbA) 

litterally ever since s1 of got that garbage has been everywhere. and its so dumb. like it was cool when 1 show did it. that was their thing. but not when every show tries to imitate it."
Dragons Dogma,I wonder if this could pump some life into a sequel. Still one of my favorite games.
Dragons Dogma,Instant watch! I love this game.
Dragons Dogma,"Seriously cool game, I would watch that. For anyone that isn't familiar with it, it's basically a medieval fantasy and should be accessible by anyone that likes that sort of thing."
Dragons Dogma,**FRYING INTO FREE**
Dragons Dogma,"Oh my goooooooooooooooooood kid.gif!

&#x200B;"
Dragons Dogma,I love Dragons Dogma.  It was an amazing game that had an amazing vibe to it.  I'm definitely going to watch this.
Dragons Dogma,Spoilers: All heroes die after being drenched in water.
Dragons Dogma,I wonder if they'll stick with the cheesy ye olde English. I hope they do.
Dragons Dogma,"It's going to be that cgi shit, though, isn't it? üòí"
Dragons Dogma,best part of that game was yeeting people off cliffs
Dragons Dogma,Aww yeah is this the good Berserk anime we should've gotten?
Dragons Dogma,"K.. How about we get someone to start making the sequel game sometime??

I can't understand why they just seemingly refuse to make Dragons Dogma 2.. :("
Dragons Dogma,Heard its going to be in 3DCGI... may still watch but not so excited.
Dragons Dogma,I'd be more interested if they got Adi Shankar behind this since he seems to be the best at adapting video games to animated series.
Dragons Dogma,The world of Dragons Dogma isnt to bad but Netflix doesnt have a good track record with its self produced animes so I will wait for a trailer. I expect shitty CGI.
Dragons Dogma,"Netflix's animated shows and anime have been pretty good so far, looking forward to this Altered Carbon and more Ghost in the Shell. "
Dragons Dogma,"Dragons Dogma :)

anime :("
Dragons Dogma,I think now that the director released Devil May Cry 5 he might leave the series and pump new life into this series.
Dragons Dogma,I would pre-order a DD2 without thinking.
Dragons Dogma,The game was sort of like a medieval fantasy anime in the first place. *The wind is pushing me~~*
Dragons Dogma,"Itsuno wanted to do DMC5 first, Capcom gave him the choice he's said and he apparently had so many ideas for so long about continuing from DMC4 that he wanted to work on that first."
Dragons Dogma,It was choice between dd2 and dmc5.
Dragons Dogma,"> I can't understand why they just seemingly refuse to make Dragons Dogma 2

Maybe waiting on next-gen consoles so they can make it more epic? I doubt we'll never get a sequel. It's just such a great structure of a game and just begs for another installment.

Then again... I guess that might depend on sales... how well did the game do?"
Dragons Dogma,"They definitely haven't hit on every one but there are a good amount I've enjoyed:

* Castlevania  
* Children of the Whales  
* Fate/Apocrypha  
* Kakegurui  
* Sword Gai  
* Violet Evergarden  

Given I haven't watched all of their originals but for the most part I've really enjoyed them."
Dragons Dogma,Apparently it is made by a studio famous for CGI anime. 
Dragons Dogma,"Yeah, he was given the budget and choice to do DMC5 or DD2 and he chose DMC5 first. I think Capcom is just gonna throw money at him again now, because of how well DMC5 is doing and is being received."
Dragons Dogma,"What made that game so damn good? Dark Souls is the only thing that comes close, but even then, Dark Souls definitely has its fair share of differences.

Dragon's Dogma is something special."
Dragons Dogma,"Did you know that wolves hunt in packs, Arisen?"
Dragons Dogma,"To be fair, they didn't produce half that list. They only picked up the streaming rights."
Dragons Dogma,Only Castlevania is a netflix production and that is not a japanese one.
Dragons Dogma,"Ah okay. So it will be shitty, most likely."
Dragons Dogma,"Itusno is 100% a guy that deserves money thrown at him for pretty much anything he wants to make, he has had his hands in some truly amazing games and is clearly very passionate about his work. Guy gave us DD, DMC3, 4, and the goddamn glorious beyond words DMC5 (Expectations were way more than exceeded, they were Max-Acted). Honestly the only games he's been involved with I *didn't* love were DmC and DMC2 and that's just because there was no saving those two, the latter even more so.

At this point I'll check out literally anything he works on and I'm guessing DD2 is next between the Switch version of 1 and now an anime. Though I *really* would have liked to see Rival Schools first."
Dragons Dogma,"It felt like a swan song for him, like it was fan service back to back I think now Dante wont be the mascot and it'll be nero with a new director probably. He tried to leave after 3 and 4 so i think with this game he's ready to leave, it's the best in the series right now."
Dragons Dogma,Climbing monster bodies.
Dragons Dogma,"Ah I wasn't aware, I just went off of the wiki list of original netflix animes. I guess they really do slap that title on just about anything."
Dragons Dogma,"I don't know why somebody downvoted you. Is there a good anime that exists with CGI that I'm missing out on? Every anime I've seen with CGI usually looks like shit, even if they go easy on it and still do a decent job."
Dragons Dogma,"Land of the Lustrious had good animation. Parts of Attack on Titan were CGI and was decent. Also, I think who knows what impact Spider-verse has to CGI animation moving forward. That movie is like proof of concept on how to translate 2D action animation into 3D."
Dragons Dogma,Ajin was alright but not helped by the use of CGI. A lot of people said Land of the Lustrous looked good but I thought it was hideous. 
Dragons Dogma,"Spider-Verse actually used Land of the Lustrous for inspiration in creating the animation style Spider-Verse utilised. 

>Parts of Attack on Titan were CGI and was decent.

Parts of all anime nowadays are CGI, it's a necessary tool that's utilised throughout the industry. "
Dragons Dogma,Love interest at the end better be a random shopkeep in town to keep it faithful to the game.
Dragons Dogma,Is the ending you getting with the shopkeeper because that‚Äôs who you talked with the most.
Dragons Dogma,Looks... OK. Hopefully it has good writing
Dragons Dogma,"I see they went with the shitty 3D animation look. When will these animation studios learn that it does not look good like that.

Maybe it's a budget thing but why go against the tried and true method of animation?

I'm sure it's a vocal minority complaint and it gets the job done but man do they ruin stuff like this.

Example:

Berserk = https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/2/15726674/berserk-anime-2017-animation"
Dragons Dogma,"So Olivia is basically Quina?

They got the same voice actor for the Dragon back, which is great!"
Dragons Dogma,Trash
Challenger,"Fox was really weird around then about green lighting these interesting, unusual, atypical types of shows and then doing everything in their power to kill them upon launch. I always got the impression that either there was a regime change where a bunch of people approved the shows and then left, or there was just a ton of tension between the execs who approved projects, the schedulers, and the people in charge of marketing.

Remember when *Family Guy* came back, and Peter led off with this long list of shows, saying something like ""We can only come back if all of these were cancelled?"" There were some real gems in that list."
Challenger,"> Years later, the actor pitched a new live-action take on the character, which Amazon debuted in 2016 but with Peter Serafinowicz as the lead. (This version lasted two seasons.) ‚ÄúI really did wish we got to do it,‚Äù laments Warburton of not reprising the role.

I wish the [2016 version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tick_\(2016_TV_series\)) lasted a few more seasons. It was great. Amazon dropped it after two seasons and while the creator was shopping it around the actor's contracts all expired"
Challenger,Never before in the history of everything was there a better casting choice than the pairing of Patrick Warburton as The Tick.
Challenger,I really loved this show. Sad it‚Äôs gone.
Challenger,We need Batmanuel now more than ever.
Challenger,The Tick was absolutely BRILLIANT! I was so gutted when it got cancelled!
Challenger,Then Amazon did it again.
Challenger,[deleted]
Challenger,"Don‚Äôt fight like a girl, Janet, fight like a *wo*man!"
Challenger,"Fox? Murdered a show?

INCONCEIVABLE!"
Challenger,"
Loved the 2016 amazon version, didnt even know it was rebooted."
Challenger,**SPOOOOOON!**
Challenger,Patrick warburton was the perfect tick. This was a great show and ahead of its time.
Challenger,To think the animated series had more seasons than the live-action shows.
Challenger,"Sonnenfeld has put up some amazing TV. The Tick, Pushing Daisies, etc. It's hard to grasp how easily something like a live action The Tick could have gone horribly wrong and disappointed everyone. It's a bummer it wasn't able to have the run it deserved, but at least everyone involved can be proud as hell.

*Spoooooooooooon!*

**Edit:** As a side note, lookup the film *An Honest Liar* which he produced about one of my personal heroes -- The Amazing Randi who used his knowledge as a magician to out charlatans and frauds. Fantastic documentary."
Challenger,"It's hard not to love this show, but we can also objectively see why network executives could have a problem with it as it was definitely some great fringe television. Sad, isn't it?"
Challenger,Who puts gum on a roof?!?
Challenger,The only thing I liked about Nolan's Batman movies was that the mayor was BatManuel.
Challenger,This was such a good show with so much promise.
Challenger,"One of my favorites. Me and my wife watch it every now and then, I really wish it went on at least 6 more episodes. Patrick Warburton will always be the best Tick to me."
Challenger,"""No dude, I'm telling you, Falco died! 'Amadeus, Amadeus?' He is a dead person!"""
Challenger,"I have yet to give the reboot a chance, I‚Äôve mourned the original series for so long."
Challenger,I loved this show! Fox let a lot of good series die that had so much more potential
Challenger,Any show where you can have Patrick warburton verses a toilet for an episode is gold
Challenger,"This show had the perfect tone & production design, really felt like a live action comic book/cartoon. Didn‚Äôt really get that from the newer show."
Challenger,"I really loved the cartoon, but was disappointed by the live action show.  Maybe it was just a matter of expectations, because I wasn't expecting it to be a sitcom."
Challenger,"Ah, the casualties of Big Bismuth chum!"
Challenger,"I‚Äôve never seen this show. Between The Tick and the lady on the right, I would‚Äôve SWORN this was the cast of the Big Bang Theory in costumes at first glance. It looked exactly like Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco. Then the guy in between them looks like Johnny Galecki with the glasses on lmao"
Challenger,"They forgot that the best way to deal with Fox is to do what you want, let them cancel you, get super popular offline, sign a better deal with them, bad mouth them in your first episode back. Rinse and repeat if you're a legend"
Challenger,Newer Tick was great at least.
Challenger,"I was a huge fan of the animated series and was really looking forward to this version when it premiered back in 2001. I last two episodes before I stopped watching. Other than the casting of Patrick Warburton, ""The Tick"" just fell totally flat for me. It had little of the fun or energy of the animated series. I still don't get what this version of the show was going for."
Challenger,"From what I remember, the team fucking blew all of their money on mundane shit like entirely cgi'ing out the suit's seams among other things.  I think Fox realized this was going downhill and put a cork in the leak."
Challenger,Every Sci-Fi show ever made by FOX: join the club...
Challenger,Why don't they just revive the animated show? It would be perfect for Adult Swim or a streaming service
Challenger,Fox murdered a lot of good shows.  They cancelled family guy and firefly.
Challenger,The newer Tick with Serafinowicz was much better. And cooler. Got mad when it got cancelled.
Challenger,"This is one of the biggest tragedies in tv history. The show was phenomenal, and was only getting better. Amazon screwed us all."
Challenger,If they would have done the villians it might have lasted.  I guess they didn't have the money for it.
Challenger,I loved the Tick cartoon.  Hated this show.
Challenger,Isn‚Äôt Fox‚Äôs MO to cancel anything that is popular?
Challenger,"Keep in mind that Fox programming is also a reflection of the political environment and what subtext Fox wants to push.  Bill Clinton wins presidency in 1992 election.  Better make people not trust their government!!  X-Files premieres in September of 1993.  The government is lying to you!!  The government is conspiring with aliens!!  And they ALWAYS make sure to show Bill Clinton's portrait in Skinner's office.  

Bush ""wins"" in 2000.  Time to use any means necessary to fight terrorism and prevent attacks.  Oh and an added bonus: Jack Baurer would've fixed everything in the first hour if weren't for those pesky regulations and government bureaucracy.  Also, torture is totally cool.

The health care debate roars back to life.  Better start a show showing how the American Healthcare system is the best in the world.  On the show House the best and brightest minds solve medical mysteries, conduct expensive tests at the drop of a hat because every instrument is available all the time with no waiting!  In one hour the patient goes from dying to cured and no mention of the hospital bills.  Oh, except for the **hospital's** bills.  It can't make enough money to stay afloat!  American health care is just *too cheap to make a profit*!  Added bonus: painkillers are an awesome super-pill that let's House save lives!  

Now, I used to watch and enjoy these shows.  But as the FOX mask slipped and the conglomerate became more brazen with pushing ideology I started to notice that it wasn't only Fox News that was doing this.

Edit: corrected a year"
Challenger,They have been trying to make that damn show live action since the 90‚Äôs and it doesn‚Äôt work. Go back to animated!
Challenger,"It would have been hard to outdo the cartoon when the budget doesnt really constrain creativity in a cartoon.  Maybe drawing something more complex would take a little longer, but not totally impractical to do in live action. It would have been better if they continued the cartoon with these actors doing the voice work."
Challenger,"But they are really great at spreading misinformation, or is it disinformation, or maybe it‚Äôs just bad information‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say Fox is pure garbage and call it a day."
Challenger,Who cares about the tick? I just want to see the [flea](https://muchalucha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flea) !
Challenger,What ever happened to the Amazon show? I heard they were doing a season 3 then nothing.
Challenger,I've enjoyed every iteration of The Tick and look forward to the next series when the copyright is up and someone needs to put out a new show or lose it.
Challenger,"I loved this show at the time! Nestor Carbonell carried it with his Bat Manuel, imo. üòÇ"
Challenger,"I‚Äôd watch the Tick if they had to get mundane office jobs, like ‚Äúthe incredibles‚Äù meets ‚Äúthe office‚Äù but live action. With a few implied superhero action sequences that are met with eye rolls by other office workers who are over all of it."
Challenger,"I thought ""Batmanuel"" was an improvement on Die Fladermaus which is a pretty esoteric joke"
Challenger,"So they had a ‚Äúkids‚Äù cartoon animated like the comic book that was really good and fun to watch. I remember being a kid during the cartoon show airing and then being a teenager when the live action show was being promoted, if I recall they even had a super bowl ad for the show, the live action show debuted and I lost all interest after the first episode. I was young and just moved on to something else."
Challenger,I watched cartoon  the tick back in the day ‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt tell you just by looking at this one picture I soundly watch this. Just saying
Challenger,Another great show sees an early demise due to people's inability to let the creative juices flow and push a couple envelopes. I enjoyed this show very thoroughly and laughed more while watching it than while watching any other show in probably 5 to 6 years at least.
Challenger,Still the best version of the Tick.
Challenger,SPOON !!!!!!!!!
Challenger,It‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs fault
Challenger,"This is my favorite version of The Tick and I think about it often, such a great show. Larry Charles + Patrick Warburton is all you need."
Challenger,I loved this version to me he was the true tick!
Challenger,That Tick costume is almost perfect
Challenger,still wanting that Danger Boat spin-off
Challenger,"Ah, another treat from the orient! Mmm! A secret message, from my teeth!"
Challenger,[Relevant clip](https://youtu.be/0oMTmtN7lHI)
Challenger,"I always got the feeling that the people in charge of greenlighting new shows and the people in charge of setting the schedule had VERY different ideas of what kind of network they were running.  It couldn't have just been a regime change, because it happened over and over again for years.

Then it turned into a self-fulfilling cycle.  An interesting new show would be announced and people would get really excited until they realized it was on Fox and decided not to watch it because it would just get canceled halfway through the first season. And then it would get canceled halfway through the first season, citing low viewership."
Challenger,"I spoke with Nestor Carbonel (Batmanuel) right after the cancellation, and he said that the Tick was killed by a regime change at Fox. The leadership during the development and pilot phase had been incredibly supportive, and then there was an executive shuffle and the new programming head killed everything that his predecessor had developed. He said the show had been incredibly fun to shoot, and really found it's rhythm before the end."
Challenger,I feel like once X-Files took off they decided that scifi stuff would be their niche. So they just kept greenlighting high concept scifi shows hoping another would take off.  If it wasn't the next big international hit by the end of the season it was canned. And nothing really made it.
Challenger,"There's also a huge number of shows that get greenlit, have one season, and are totally forgotten by everyone. I mean, at one point they made That 80s Show and a show about the Geico Cavemen. 

Tosh.0 did it as a weekly gag (""we'll be back with more [cancelled show here]""), and finally ran out of cancelled Comedy Central shows near the end of their run."
Challenger,Greg the Bunny was the SHIT! I still laugh at many of the episodes. Favorite is still the pot brownie one
Challenger,"Yeah, Fox is famous for green lighting, then destroying a lot of shows with great concepts. Poor marketing, constant time slot changes, direct meddling. It almost has to be a Murdoch considering how long it has been going on."
Challenger,"I heard the original draft for that list that Peter goes through was much longer but they had to cut it, like, in half for time. I think it's mentioned in the DVD commentary."
Challenger,"One thing that is different with Fox is they have less prime time programming than other broadcast channels. The local news starts earlier on Fox. This came about when Fox was just starting out and it incentivized stations to broadcast the new channel (nationwide programming is less profitable than local programming). They have never changed course on this as it would be very unpopular with the affiliates even though they are one of the big channels now. 

So with less prime time slots, there‚Äôs less room for error and less room to give a show multiple seasons time to grow and gain an audience.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, still a lot of mismanagement and opportunities (and not just fox) but I would guess Fox is faster to make a change because of fewer prime time slots."
Challenger,"The people green lighting the shows aren't the same people scheduling the shows, so unfortunately that often plays a part of it."
Challenger,"Either Fox‚Äôs process was broken, or it was hellish by design.  It‚Äôs like big corporate sales. The sale rep gets you in the door and then hands off to the rest of the company who finds out how shitty and/or complex a sale it was.

Fox was an upstart in the late 80s and 90s and I‚Äôm sure they had a group greenlighting everything and then after that it was just a meat grinder to find out if anything would stick. Even then, their incessant meddling in schedules and constantly changing time slots was incomprehensible but could be just to see if a screenwriter could take the abuse. Honestly I think the Fox TV organization is just like the Fox News corporation; basically just dis functionally functional, filled with whack jobs and egos who somehow make the company profit.

Telling that the entire network is now sold off to Disney minus the two areas that still make Rupert money."
Challenger,"The thing is that *all* networks do this, not just Fox. 

It's just that Fox was more willing to take bigger risks, so when they cancel it gets more of a reaction.

The reality is all these ""interesting, unusual, atypical"" shows tend to be *a lot* more expensive to produce than your standard reality show or sitcom, so the expectation for viewership is higher...which means the chance of it getting cancelled is *also* higher since that threshold is different."
Challenger,Ah Greg the Bunny came to mind before I even finished reading this post lol
Challenger,"Shame we'll never get those shows and casts back. And for all those still hoping...

http://i.imgur.com/2u3CSRC.gifv ^(by /u/EditingAndLayout)"
Challenger,">Remember when Family Guy came back, and Peter led off with this long list of shows, saying something like ""We can only come back if all of these were cancelled?"" There were some real gems in that list.

Such a great and depressing bit."
Challenger,"Fox has always been about giving people a chance but refusing to pay for it. Thats why they were always successful because bombs dont hurt them and hits do way better. Its good business but it also leads to lots of bad decisions that affected entertainment like Family Guy, Firefly, Futurama, Brooklyn 99, Arrested Development, and many more critical darlings."
Challenger,They always wanted to play it safe.  In order to get Logan made Hugh Jackman had to take an enormous pay cut.  They simply didn't believe an R-rated superhero film would work.
Challenger,">green lighting these interesting, unusual, atypical types of shows and then doing everything in their power to kill them upon launch

Too soon. #firefly"
Challenger,Family Guy was brought back and then cancelled again in season 3. Still going strong now.
Challenger,Son of Zorn was so good.  Philistines
Challenger,"It‚Äôs almost like‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. **they do it for a tax write off.**

üòÆ"
Challenger,"Apparently it was super expensive to make? Production team did not do a good job of keeping filming costs down

Edit: my one minute google search said the reported cost was 5 million per episode so ouch

Edit 2: okay a slightly longer google search shows that an executive co-producer tweeted out a denial that the show had a budget that high"
Challenger,"The lead of the show (Arthur, not the actor playing the tick) is phenomenal on the podcast Blank Check"
Challenger,"I loved it as well. Definitely a different vibe from the first show, but still great in its own way.

Midnight best doggo. ""I realized, there is no God. There is only... Dog."""
Challenger,Patrick Warburton was absolutely perfect as The Tick.  I appreciated the Amazon reboot but I just could not get past missing Warburton.
Challenger,"I was so annoyed when Superion was on the moon he didn't start carving his name into it for a variation of the 'CHA' joke from the cartoon.

""Arthur, oh my god, the moon is saying hello!""

*moon has 'SUP' carved into it*"
Challenger,"Ok, hear me out. Venture Brothers is over. Do a revival as an animated series, with the same cast and plot, and bring in Publick and Hammer to do some work on it too."
Challenger,"The 2016 show walked so that The Boys could run. Honestly, they both filled a similar niche, but people didn't give the Tick a chance. It was honestly really dark, especially early on when you find out how Arthur's family was murdered."
Challenger,"Personally I thought it was‚Ä¶.fine. 

I really wasn‚Äôt shocked it got cancelled. If anything I was more surprised it got two seasons. I can‚Äôt believe how much money they spent on it."
Challenger,Neither of them were as good as the animated series
Challenger,"Show was great, wish we could have gotten more. Tired of shows that obviously are building towards something and then dies:("
Challenger,Patrick Warburton as Brock Samson.
Challenger,"Peter Serafinowicz was a great choice for the Amazon version. Obviously no one else is Patrick Warburton, but he was stellar."
Challenger,The Amazon version was really good also
Challenger,How long until we can feed a show and its script into an Ai and get a next season?
Challenger,"Captain Liberty: Manuel, we're not lonely, are we?

Batmanuel: We? No. No, no, no, no. We're too attractive to be lonely.

Capt. Liberty: Yeah, but we are alone.

Batmanuel: I'm not alone. Uh, spinsters, shut-ins, toll booth attendants ‚Äî these are alone people. Batmanuel is *lone* ‚Äî as in Lone Ranger, or, uh, lone wolf. Alone is an unfortunate predicament. *Lone* is an aesthetic choice."
Challenger,Someone light the Bat Signuel.
Challenger,"""Are you...Bat...Manual?""

""Never heard of him."""
Challenger,"I have been a willing participant in every televised version of this show. Each is it‚Äôs own valid, very well done creation with a fantastic ensemble cast.
Nestor Carbonel as Batmanuel is still the best character variation in any of them, with some of the best lines bar none.
And while I loved Jackie Earle Haley‚Äôs performance as a slightly more fleshed-out Terror (the drums!) Armin Shimerman‚Äôs performance and delivery was also amazing in the 2001 show.
‚Äú I‚Äôm gonna fold ya into my wallet and spend ya on a whore!‚Äù"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"The only thing that puzzles me about this is... They wear the same darn outfits every episode, it's pretty weird. Like cartoon characters irl. Uncanny. But i agree, it's wholesome, the contestants all have great personality and i was genuinely moved both times they supported Ashley when he was having a breakdown."
The American Barbecue Showdown,I loved it and have watches it probably 4 times!
The American Barbecue Showdown,"We're pescetarian, but my fiance still loves this show. And I thought it was good. It's essentially carnivore Bake Off."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Agreed, I really enjoyed it as well! Another positive is the cross section of people they get; different ages, backgrounds, levels of cooking experience, etc. It really makes for a more interesting show, and like you said, heartwarming because the contestants all learn from and help each other."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I wanted to give you shit for being a shill to get people to watch another cooking show, but then I saw your history is full of cool cooking shit and now a I feel bad.

Rock on, dude."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Watched this not too long ago and yeah it was pretty good. Very positive and everyone got along.
The American Barbecue Showdown,Glad you liked it! ü§ó
The American Barbecue Showdown,I loved watching it too! Watched it multiple times! You were great on there and have an awesome spirit! I'm very happy to find you randomly on reddit!  Hell yeah brother bbq on! üî•üî•üî•
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Just about to finish.liked it overall, learned a few things. Seemed like in the final episode that a ton of time went by before they even thought about putting meat on the fire."
The American Barbecue Showdown,*Great British Bake Off/Baking Show* and *Masterchef Australia* should be your next watches.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Ashley explains [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBQ/comments/j3jeg4/this_is_rasheed_from_american_barbecue_showdown/g7s9jt3/) that the wardrobe dept. maintained several sets of the same clothes for them - easier to edit, etc."
The American Barbecue Showdown,What does religion have to do with the show?
The American Barbecue Showdown,"You're right. And that makes it even cuter to see them all get along so well. They seem to have really carefully crafted the male/female and even more so black/white ratios, to the point that it kinda sticks out. But on the whole that's not a bad thing, I think."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Glad my recent obsession with taking pictures of my food finally paid off.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I've tried The Great British Bake Off, but tbh the open tent in a rainy British field wasn't a pleasant setting to me. And I'm not as interested in baking as I am in cooking. Should maybe give it another try though, cause I keep hearing good things."
The American Barbecue Showdown,A joke? Or actual confusion?
The American Barbecue Showdown,It's worth watching. I don't bake much but still enjoy it and have still learned some things that I can use in the limited baking I do.
The American Barbecue Showdown,Bad joke
The American Barbecue Showdown,I initially laughed. Then worried that you may actually be confused!
The American Barbecue Showdown,"When The Circle first popped up I was hoping they went more down the angle of competitive reality shows like Big Brother/Survivor/The Challenge and things of that nature but everything they've premiered since has sort of gone in the exact opposite direction.

Go buy the rights to The Genius or some of the South Korean reality shows!"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"James Hong still acting at 93, amazing."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"> Hong is not the only new addition to the Disney+ miniseries adaptation of Gene Luen Yang‚Äôs graphic novel. Ronny Chieng (The Daily Show), Jimmy O. Yang (80 For Brady), Leonard Wu (Alita: Battle Angel), Lisa Lu (Crazy Rich Asians), and Rosalie Chiang (Turning Red) have also been announced as additional guest stars, joining Poppy Liu (Hacks).

Wow, this is stacked."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Somebody get this man a Lifetime Achievement Award!
The American Barbecue Showdown,"""Cartright?   Cartright?!!""

Legend"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"James Hong is just the best.


No one else could ever even think about playing Lo ~~0am~~Pan."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Oh god that cast!!!! Everything I could ever dream of, fuuuuck"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Amazing! James has been old my entire life, and is still acting."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I looked up James Hong career on IMDB and was in awe of his history. Could he be the longest-working actor? I had thought he was someone who started acting later in life and that was not the case at all!

Edit: adding a link incase anyone else wants to check it out! https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0393222/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"
The American Barbecue Showdown,So thrilled for the author/illustrator Gene Luen Yang. What a dream to see this cast come together for this project. He also wrote the fabulous Dragon Hoops as well as several Marvel comics.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"He‚Äôs one of those actors that I get excited about when he unexpectedly pops up in something im watching. Might not sound like much but those are my favorite actors, much more than any leading people.

Those ‚Äúholy shit they‚Äôre in this too?‚Äù moments are always so good."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"James Hong is a national treasure! Talented, humble, sincere and kind."
The American Barbecue Showdown,I want James Hong to live forever and be in every movie and tv show!
The American Barbecue Showdown,"‚ÄúCartwright?

Cartwright?‚Äù"
The American Barbecue Showdown,What is this casual gigantic hand in front of him??
The American Barbecue Showdown,The comic? That is going to be a hard adaptation
The American Barbecue Showdown,"My life can always use more Stephanie Hsu.  She was so good in EEAAO  

Bonus: Monkey King is always chaotic fun"
The American Barbecue Showdown,They did so well together that the whole cast got hired for another film lol
The American Barbecue Showdown,I want to know who is playing the racist kid with the Justin Timberlake hair
The American Barbecue Showdown,"just to clear up a small doubt. 

has everything everywhere all at once been out for enough time to justify the use of the term ""reunion"" ?

the movie has only been out for a few months."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Shit movie
The American Barbecue Showdown,Doesn‚Äôt that title need a hyphen?
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Can we get Robert Downey Jr. to play Chin-Kee please?

Tropic Thunder was not enough"
The American Barbecue Showdown,James deserves it. The man has given DECADES of his life to this job.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Goodbye, Mr. Burton."
The American Barbecue Showdown,And he's till good is the crazy part.
The American Barbecue Showdown,the fuck else is he supposed to do? hahahaha. he and chriis walken are gonna be rockin til they dead
The American Barbecue Showdown,Holy shit. Daniel Wu is also in the main cast.
The American Barbecue Showdown,Can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt cast MrZeral. Smh what is even the point of watching then
The American Barbecue Showdown,Damn they did Jimmy dirty by calling him out for 80 for Brady
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Everyone else is great, but not a fan of Ronny after his set on Indian people no being Asian."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I dont know a single of those names -,-'"
The American Barbecue Showdown,Seinfeld. Four!
The American Barbecue Showdown,She called. He yelled ‚ÄúCartwright‚Äù.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Oh it‚Äôll be five, ten minutes."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Lo 0am? Which Lo 0am?!?
The American Barbecue Showdown,[deleted]
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I think he has to be the most prolific actor that is both alive and active in the industry, he's an absolute legend"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I started watching watching White Lotus this week, and had this reaction to Steve Zahn.

Tons of people who I like in movies even if/especially if, they aren't the main character."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Go watch Everything Everywhere All At Once.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Saw an interview of him recently, and he literally got up and started jovially dancing. And he's still very sharp mentally. Like he's at least as sharp as the average person half his age."
The American Barbecue Showdown,It‚Äôs shocking he‚Äôs coherent enough and capable enough to keep doing it.  I‚Äôm impressed!
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I've never heard of him, is there something I should check him out in?"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I remember when he first started working in China and had terrible Chinese. Proper ABC and proper hot. Stuck in traffic? At least there's an ad with Daniel Wu on a building to look at!

[Unfortunately like many shit celebrities who participate in Chinese entertainment he's also anti-HK/pro-Beijing.](https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/3/133368/Actor-Daniel-Wu-denies-rumors-of-supporting-independence)"
The American Barbecue Showdown,Asia is the biggest most populous continent yet so many similar last names wtf
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I'm Indian and it was funny. It was mostly humour about East Asians, it wasn't negative against Indians."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"This opinion isn't uncommon in Chinese and Chinese diaspora communities throughout East/Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, where Chiang is from, Indians are the next largest ethnic minority group after Chinese, but don't hold nearly the economic power that the Chinese community does, though there's definitely an Indian elite/professional class. Usually this comes with a dollop of Han-centricism (the only cultures which matter are touched culturally or politically by the various dynasties of the Middle Kingdom [minus the non-Han ones, save when they Hanified]). 

Not excusing it, just saying that it's consistent with where he's from, as well as really disappointing if that's an indication of his beliefs rather than something put on for a joke."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"You don't know Hong?

Bullshit. Check IMDb."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Nobody gives a shit
The American Barbecue Showdown,Who‚Äôs Cartwright?
The American Barbecue Showdown,The little old basket case on wheels or the ten foot tall roadblock?
The American Barbecue Showdown,Call the President.
The American Barbecue Showdown,Crazier: He has acting credits for every year since he began working.
The American Barbecue Showdown,And he‚Äôs absolutely beloved.
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Right, but, let‚Äôs say I haven‚Äôt seen it. What is it?"
The American Barbecue Showdown,Badlands but I think the series got worse after season 1 or 2
The American Barbecue Showdown,[deleted]
The American Barbecue Showdown,He had some small parts recently in the last season of Westworld..not saying to watch it all but just pointing out where I  saw him
The American Barbecue Showdown,"The general populace in China is called [""100 family names"" for a reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baixing)."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Even if it's consistent with where he's from, that doesn't mean it's not closed to being criticized. People can have a lot of closeminded views back where they're from, but that doesn't mean it should be acceptable here.

You brought more context to the issue so thank you for that."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Every time we hear his voice or see him in something my gf and I do the DiCaprio pointing meme lol it‚Äôs crazy how prolific of an actor he is
The American Barbecue Showdown,The man only has 451 acting credits on IMDb. /s
The American Barbecue Showdown,not familiar
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Somebody had too salty soup today, sad, sad, brain dead idiot boy"
The American Barbecue Showdown,I‚Äôm Cartwright!!!
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Side note: try this fun drinking game- every time Jack Burton asks a question, take a swig of your drink."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"One in the same, Jack"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I watched Turning Red last week and was reminded how great of a voice actor he is as well. He's great in Kung Fu Panda and Mulan of course, but apparently he has uncredited voice work in the first american dub of the original Godzilla! What a career!"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"The movie will answer your question, I‚Äôm not going to spoil it. Just go watch it, it amazing"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"Obviously spoilers for EEAAO:

They travel the multiverse into many ""wacky"" and ""zany"" universes and get to a *hilarious* universe where, get this, people have HOT DOGS for FINGERS ü§™"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"There's only 3 seasons. I really liked it despite its faults. The first main bad's storyline finished at the end of s2 instead of dragging on, the most annoying character in the show got offed at the end of s3, Nick Frost joined the cast and did a lot of big guy Sammo Hung esque Kung Fu and they were gearing up to introduce gun fu it seemed in S4 before it got cancelled.

I'm also really into that ruins of the old world vibe like in Fallout, and Horizon."
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I don't think Badlands was ever good, the first episode was just almost good to me. I think it was just slightly too far past the silly line."
The American Barbecue Showdown,Incorrect that's Donny yen
The American Barbecue Showdown,">About 87% of the population shares 100 surnames.

Fascinating!"
The American Barbecue Showdown,"I'll plug __Totally Awesome__ here again.

80s movies spoof movie... made in early 00's with SNL people. Day, Katan, and more.

I believe Hong plays the spoof of Mr. Miyagi."
The American Barbecue Showdown,big nobody‚Ä¶
The American Barbecue Showdown,You‚Äôre not Cartwright
The American Barbecue Showdown,My favorite supercut of [Jack Burton asking questions ](https://youtu.be/98ioAA8yNyY) for those playing hard mode.

Gogglebox,"He always said on the show he wanted to go before she did as he would not cope, shame to die just before Christmas."
Gogglebox,This guy was one of the reasons I'd always stray back to Gogglebox if it was on.  He and his wife were conveyors of exquisite banter.
Gogglebox,[deleted]
Gogglebox,"The show won't quite feel the same without his sneaking snacks and getting yelled at for it, his anger at social injustice, his charitable nature, and his constant reminders to his wife over the years that she and their family are the best thing that ever happened to him."
Gogglebox,"Such a great character. Whether he was giving his hilarious political commentary, finding secret snacks in the kitchen, or quietly shedding a few tears when he watched something emotional, he always came across as completely genuine
RIP Leon "
Gogglebox,"Such terrible news, and right before Christmas too..

Watching Gogglebox always felt like spending a cozy evening with your oddball family and making fun of everything on TV together, and Leon was everyone's favorite grandad. Won't be the same without him.

That said, [here's a classic Leon clip](https://twitter.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/944626027669655559) to brighten this crappy evening a little bit."
Gogglebox,One of the best people on the show. Not a bad bone in his body - always says it like it is. <3
Gogglebox,Sad times.
Gogglebox,"[This clip](https://twitter.com/rob_simm/status/944632096164806656) of him responding to the end of Gladiator already got me misty-eyed when it first aired. But now with the news of his passing, watching it again because of Twitter it made me burst into tears.

He seemed like a lovely man, and my heart goes out to June and the family."
Gogglebox,Bless you Leon for the memories. We'll miss you. The show won't be the same without you. </3
Gogglebox,"It's already in the can, right? Surely they won't show June sitting alone or impose on her at such a tough time. From their twitter it looked like they were just finishing preparing for the family to come round, but certainly not for this reason. My grandmother passed away 2 weeks short of Christmas when I was 12. Having a funeral and wake 5 days before what was meant to be the big family get together really knocked everyone and honestly my family's not ever been quite the same since. I can very much empathise with how awful this is and just hope having the family together means they can all support each other as best they can. "
Gogglebox,.
Gogglebox,"My first dog Holly died the day before the Millennium. She was 15 and I loved her very much but my ma wouldn't let me take her when I moved in with my dad because of her increasingly wacky ways which I guess were a result of her inability to handle losing the yoke of my grandma's commanding influence, Of course, my mum didn't think to tell me until the 2nd of January after she'd decided to bury her in the woods rather than tell me so I could have got her a better send off than likely being fox food. So, seems we both had shitty time ringing in that event. 

I appreciate the sympathy but honestly my family are all pretty awful and sociopathic, I think the only thing that kept them in check was my grandmother was incredibly controlling and kept them all on relative short leashes. Then when she died, everyone just kind of decided to try do the right thing and ended up just making wrong ones, hoping mum would come through and bail them out or fix things again... unfortunately she was dead, so, not really possible. 

Everything since 2007 or so has been increasingly tough and borderline unbelievable, just glad I got the help I needed to have a better understanding of why my kinfolk all went off the rails and expected me, the youngest of the clan, to pick up the slack when I was only 22 and studying while they had houses, cars, pensions and antiques they just let get taken away by the house clearance people once the houses were sold because they didn't want to keep paying the mortgages and even trying to be responsible adults. "
Gogglebox,"Don't care what people say, Gogglebox is fantastic. It's like watching an hour of TV with friends and family, even if you live alone."
Gogglebox,That's quite a sad statement...
Gogglebox,"Hah, I didn't mean to make it quite that sad.

The show just reminds me of the days when I still lived at home and watched TV with my family every evening. Nostalgia, I guess."
Gogglebox,"Is this in the UK, US, Canada or Australia?"
Gogglebox,"Watching Australian TV other than the footy or ABC/iview.

Big mistake."
Gogglebox,What the fuck are you on about.
Gogglebox,yes
Gogglebox,It had turned into complete shit a while before an American company had to buy them out
Gogglebox,Australia.
Gogglebox,"The UK has no such thing as Channel 10.

BBC1, BBC2, ITV/STV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 are our terrestrial channels."
Gogglebox,"He‚Äôs talking to us Australians so this may be confusing to you.

Because you know, this sub isn‚Äôt strictly full of Americans."
Gogglebox,Bummer
Gogglebox,Thank you good sir
Gogglebox,"I mean, it pretty much is if we‚Äôre being honest"
Gogglebox,"Yeah I know, but then when an Aussie posts something about Australian TV, you guys always seem to have a hard time wrapping your head around that just maybe there are internationals on this sub too."
Gogglebox,There are plenty of Aussies as well
Close Enough,I'm really surprised it was canceled. I thought it had a pretty decent following. Really liked the show. Sad to see it go.
Close Enough,"This sucks. I thought it was pretty fun.

Edit: To be honest I think it‚Äôs because the writers wanted WGA coverage but the studio refused to give it to them so they cancelled it instead. Hopefully JG Quintel‚Äôs next animated project will be WGA covered."
Close Enough,Oh fucky. This show was legit great
Close Enough,I need a tally of all the shows Zaslav has cancelled. Hell this guy cancelled a show that was fully completed and ready to air. Ruthless.
Close Enough,This Discovery merger has just been wreaking havoc on HBO Max‚Äôs original programming and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more bloodshed to come. Fuckin sucks
Close Enough,Damn. I loved Close Enough. So funny and inventive
Close Enough,[deleted]
Close Enough,"Weak.

I loved Regular show and this one was pretty funny.

I didn't know there was a season 3 though."
Close Enough,"Fuck‚Ä¶

I was about to start watching it soon‚Ä¶

I hope JG gets to make another show soon."
Close Enough,"All of the streaming companies are trying to cut costs and start turning some profit. 

Going to see a lot of shows getting canceled because they were green lighting everything under the sun in a race for content, and you're going to see subscription fees increase pretty much across the board.

They've been eating losses from content production and licensing content since the pandemic started and offering sweetheart prices in a race for market share and now that the landscape is leveling out the honeymoon is over."
Close Enough,"As an elder millennial who recently had kids, this show spoke to me on a personal level.  The third season was a little uneven, but the first was good and the second was even better.

Discovery seems hellbent on ruining HBOMax, which will probably lead to me to cancel once I‚Äôm satisfied with my multiple rewatches of the pending *Venture Bros.* movie."
Close Enough,"FUCK NO

this show was so damn good!!! Last season was a delight and funny as shit

Fuck you new HBOMAX management"
Close Enough,"That's too bad. I'm a big fan of JG Quintel. Close Enough was never on Regular Show's level but it was fun. 3 seasons is a decent run but I was hoping it would at least last for 5 or 6.

Wonder what Quintel will do next."
Close Enough,"THe boston Dynamics robots saying ""go sox"" is one of my favorite jokes of all time."
Close Enough,Aww man. As a 32 y/o I loved this show I could definitely relate to a lot of its content lol. Sad to see it go :(
Close Enough,FUCK! This show was hilarious and the season 3 finale was perfect to build upon more character development for season 4. I hope Adult Swim or Netflix picks it up.
Close Enough,"I loved this show, it's on Netflix here in the UK so hopefully they might be able to pick it up."
Close Enough,"HBO Max is owned by Warner Bros, and Warner Bros was recently bought by Discovery. The head of Discovery is OBSESSED with cutting costs and making everything for as cheaply as possible; a HUGE slate of HBO Max shows have been cancelled and new shows will have strict budgets. It's a real shame. Obviously their money isn't limitless, but I hate when a film company is owned by someone who doesn't give two shits about making good stuff and only cares about making stuff cheaply."
Close Enough,WHAT ELSE WILL THIS PANDEMIC TAKE FROM ME
Close Enough,Another Mantoukas character bits the dust. I guess I'll just have to listen to him in Dunkin Donuts commercials...
Close Enough,"That's unfortunate,  it was really good and a fun watch.

Hopefully they don't cancel ""Insid Job""."
Close Enough,WHY DOES EVERYTHING I LOVE GET CANCELLED
Close Enough,"Showrunners: ""We will try to have at least 4 seasons of this show!""

*Gets canceled after 3 seasons*

Showrunners: ""Close enough!!"""
Close Enough,Part of it's problem may be that this is literally the first time I've ever heard of it.  And I have HBOmax
Close Enough,Nooo
Close Enough,FUCK DAMMIT
Close Enough,Bruh faith in humanity lost ...fuck hbo...and everyone who made its decision to cancel this show
Close Enough,yea its kinda just whatever felt like the last season was running out of steam
Close Enough,Not surprised given the parent company (Warner Bros. Discovery) has been on a canceling frenzy of both yet to air and airing stuff.
Close Enough,The creator tweeted that it was only made for 3 seasons and had no plans for a fourth
Close Enough,Fuck you hbo
Close Enough,Maybe if they made any effort to advertise this show more people would have watched it.
Close Enough,"Actually gutted. I love this show so much, I really hope someone else picks it up."
Close Enough,"HBO Min is more like it since Discovery bought them and shat the bed! 

Another day and another WBD cancellation‚Ä¶"
Close Enough,"Guess it wasn‚Äôt.    
<sunglasses>    
Close enough."
Close Enough,"Shit I didn't even know this show existed and it had Jason Mantzoukas? How do things like this sneak past me?


Life and Times of Tim all over again. I hear about that one late, fell in love with it, binged it, and they cancelled it like right after I did that."
Close Enough,And I am still not watching Westworld...
Close Enough,Aw fuck that.
Close Enough,Ugh that‚Äôs frustrating. Loved this show!
Close Enough,Wasn't a big fan but still a shame
Close Enough,Damn this is really sad news
Close Enough,"Well, that's a chunk of why I subbed to HBO Max gone. Gonna have to re-evaluate my subs and see what is actually worth keeping at this point."
Close Enough,Is that Jubilee?
Close Enough,Wait.. I've never seen this show but is that Jubilee from X Men??
Close Enough,Not close enough.
Close Enough,Can we get Hulu to pick it up or some other stream service? This show doesn‚Äôt deserve to end.
Close Enough,"Oh What!

Was a good show, and season 3 was the best yet!!"
Close Enough,NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Close Enough,"WHAT, WHY?"
Close Enough,That‚Äôs sad
Close Enough,Same network that cancelled infinity train :( not too surprised but very disappointed
Close Enough,"It didn‚Äôt have that long of a shelf-life to it really. It was good, but three or four seasons was going to be as far as it went."
Close Enough,Who‚Äôs idea was it to make Jason Mantzoukas the center of s3? Cause that ruined the show for me.
Close Enough,I thought only Netflix cancelled shows early. At least that's what this sub would have you believe
Close Enough,"The worst part is I knew this was coming when the dipshits at Discovery decided to neuter everything HBO Max was building. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the just ax all animation outside of Harley Quinn. And even then that‚Äôs feeling less safe by the minute.

I loved it. It was Regular Show through the lens of people in their 30‚Äôs and it was as sweet as it was hilariously absurd. Here‚Äôs hoping Quintel‚Äôs next project gets treated better."
Close Enough,The show was meh to me. How bout they bring the freaking Venture Brothers back?
Close Enough,Twas bad
Close Enough,Damn this is so sad. I love this show
Close Enough,FUUUUUCK YOU HBO I HATE YOU PLUS IM DRUNK AND I LOVE CLOSE ENOUGH
Close Enough,"I really didn‚Äôt like the show, I watched season 1."
Close Enough,HBO cancels Close Enough? Guess I have to cancel HBO.
Close Enough,Noooo! I loved this show!
Close Enough,Never even heard of this show.. they have a character dressed like jubilee from X-men
Close Enough,"Didn't even know it came from HBO, thought it was a Netflix original as that's where I watched it.  Sad to hear about the cancellation, looking forward to the third season at least"
Close Enough,"terrible choice, that show was great"
Close Enough,WHAT?! Oh no!!
Close Enough,Fucks sake.
Close Enough,Wanted to like this show but I GD hate that art style. This shit and that CalTech bean mouth nonsense are ruining animation.
Close Enough,Wish they bring back regular show
Close Enough,At this point I‚Äôd only sign up for Max if they do end up getting Hazbin Hotel.
Close Enough,It should‚Äôve been 22 minutes
Close Enough,I thought this show was going to be better but it was kinda meh
Close Enough,"What a shitload of fuck!!! I‚Äôve never seen an episode of this show, but it looked good. Should‚Äôve kept going."
Close Enough,Is this about the show Regular Show? I dont get the title
Close Enough,[removed]
Close Enough,I have HBO max and I've never heard of this.
Close Enough,Close enough doesn‚Äôt count when it comes to horseshoes and cancellations.
Close Enough,It didn‚Äôt get ‚ÄòClose Enough‚Äô to making a 4th season
Close Enough,Stupid show. Tried to get into but when you compare it to something like Harley Quinn which is also on HBO you realize how crappy it is.
Close Enough,Fucking hell‚Ä¶
Close Enough,Was a pretty good show. I liked it. Wish it had at least one more season.
Close Enough,What a shame. Loved this show üò≠
Close Enough,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!?!?!?
Close Enough,"- I was hyped for the show when it was announced by TBS because I love Regular Show.
- It was delayed and shopped around for years until HBOmax picked it up.
- After S2 I didn't even see any promos for S3 and now it's over."
Close Enough,"It's my fault, I have hbo max and didn't know it existed and therefore have yet to watch a single episode. I know...I'm sorry for getting it cancelled by my ignorance."
Close Enough,"I pray it can find a home on another platform, but probably not :("
Close Enough,I thought it was a bit bland but liked it all the same. It‚Äôs weird their cancelling since it since it seemed like it was getting seasons pretty fast. Usually when that happens isn‚Äôt it companies trying to push shows to viewers.
Close Enough,no i loved that show. every episode was 'take an ordinary premise then go down into a wierd spiral into some place only a wierd comedian can take us'
Close Enough,"Lame , it was unbelievably funny"
Close Enough,Boo.
Close Enough,Damn I was gonna start watching it too.
Close Enough,But my GAINS!
Close Enough,"I didn't know there was a season 3, shame because I really enjoyed this show.. what's going on?"
Close Enough,Show was great. RIP duuuude
Close Enough,"They were hoping to get four seasons out of the project, but then they got to three and thought eh‚Ä¶

*Close Enough*"
Close Enough,Laaaaaaame.
Close Enough,Nooooooo!
Close Enough,Zooks!
Close Enough,FUCKING ASSHOLES
Close Enough,"Booooooooooo!!!

Paging [as] to pick it up!"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"When I read ""the tablecloth,"" I knew exactly what scene it was.  So cool!"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"This is very cool, but I‚Äôm confused as to how Graham Yost shot his segments in what appears to be 1995?"
My Absolute Boyfriend,It's crazy that the editor says he had 2 hours of printed material for this one scene.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Lol, the ""attention to detail"" shows right when Graham Yost explains the setup with the earlier clip at 0:50 - Fletcher Nix stabs the guy with the ice pick and we see him shoot the gun while holding it with both hands. Scene immediately cuts to 180¬∞ and we see him holding the gun in his right hand only. Don't get me wrong, great show, I loved every minute of it, but that made me chuckle."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Cool, enjoy your weekend!"
My Absolute Boyfriend,[removed]
My Absolute Boyfriend,"very cool, thanks for sharing. I really got to get around to watching this show"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"When I first watched it, I remember pausing and rewinding to watch it over and over. Such an iconic scene."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Lol. I had to carefully examine the flat screen to determine it was not in fact a VGA CRT from the late 80's early 90's.
My Absolute Boyfriend,That show is still going?
My Absolute Boyfriend,They've oddly copied a comment from the YouTube video thats now 4 years old...
My Absolute Boyfriend,Not the Lucy Liu one.  That ended in 2019.  Don't know which one u/atticaz means.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Did it have upvotes?

It might be some sort of bot that auto copies top comments on pinned videos"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Imdb says Desmond Harrington was in Elementary, 7 episodes in 2017."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I don't think it needed a powerful ending like Act 1, since this act seemed to be mostly to build the tension for the final payoff in Act 3. Often when shows have this lull state of building up to something, it gets a bit boring, but this was engaging through and through. I also can't believe how precise the script is. If someone told me this much content would be covered in less than 4 hours of runtime, and be done so well, I would've thought it's impossible. Outside the Imagine Dragons cameo, I think it was near perfect. Even the cameo wasn't that bad, just took me out of it a bit, it's also just me nitpicking looking for something to criticize."
My Absolute Boyfriend,I utterly enjoyed it Best animation of the year so far imo. And I know nothing about League of Legends apart that is a moba game.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I was worried near the start of episode 4 since I felt the writing and even the VA (Cait had some weird reads near the start) was a downgrade from the first act, but episodes 5 and 6 pulled me back in. It's clearly designed to be the slowest act, but it still keeps the tension high and sets up the next part excellently.

Also, Jayce having sex while Viktor is literally dying is one of the most morbidly funny things I've ever seen after how Twitter has been for the past week."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Is this show good if you have zero interest in league? Or is it all league players saying how amazing it is?
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Show continues to be great. Viktor's probably my favorite character, the man's a revolutionary scientist who's gotten nothing but shit handed to him."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Heimer :(
My Absolute Boyfriend,I read so much praise for this show! I have to give it a look now.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I‚Äôd recommend staying away from /r/arcane , they have a bunch of spoilers from game knowledge in the discussions. But I agree, this and Succession running together have been great!

We‚Äôll see if Act 3 tops midnight mass as a whole for me."
My Absolute Boyfriend,[deleted]
My Absolute Boyfriend,Seeing Mylo and Clagger again is heartbreaking.
My Absolute Boyfriend,Is it out? My Netflix still shows only 3 episodes
My Absolute Boyfriend,I really like how they seemlessly intersect so many characters and story lines together in just 6 episodes. It really feels like each frame in the series so far has a purpose.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I JUST completed watching Act 2. There is a reason they are not releasing them all together. You need a break to take it all in after each Act. 
Insane. Intense. Absolutely unreal."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Arcane has absolutely no business being as good as it is, and yet it is. And it's must-watch."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"The Imagine Dragons music video was the only real head scratcher. The transitions between scenes was a lot more jarring in Act 2 as well ‚Äì a lot of black screen transitions.

All in all, I'd say it was absolutely fantastic, but not quite as polished as the first 3 episodes."
My Absolute Boyfriend,I want a show with Caitlyn just solving crimes
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Netflix and Riot spared no expense just to get me to sit through an entire Imagine Dragons song.

But seriously this show keeps kicking my butt with how good and emotionally investing it is. I can't wait for next Saturday, but I also won't want the season to end. I'll have to re-watch it a few times.

A+++ show"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"It's a wet dream if you've played some games over the years.

Dishonored, Bioshock, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura and some Shadowrun made into one show."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"One cameo aside this act 2 is a masterpiece.

Btw to everyone who doesnt like the council plot: at least in some regards you are supposed to get annoyed."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Agreed. Episode 6 is not as strong finisher as episode 3, but the whole act 2 together is more even in world building and character development."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I'm thinking again about Riot's desire to make more shows, and I worry they blew all their creativity and care on this and more seasons or separate stories won't come close. A labor of love versus going through the motions with knowledge of what ""works""."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Act 2 was way better than act 1 imo. Jinx is officially my favorite character.
My Absolute Boyfriend,I wonder how much more they can unravel regarding piltover/undercity lore in just 3 more episodes. Seems like a tight squeeze to conclude most of this. Can't wait for the next act.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"It had less of a heart tearing in your face ending like Act 1, but I felt emotionally ground down from all the powerful moments throughout it."
My Absolute Boyfriend,People who go to the game after this are gonna be pretty disappointed.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"This show is so good it makes me want to play League of Legends again, even knowing it would be detrimental to my health."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Act 2 is so good.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Just finished episode 3, and holy shit. It's *amazing*."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Oh they giving us three episodes at a time. I like that
My Absolute Boyfriend,i would say Act 1 is stronger then Act 2 (act 2 isnt as tightly paced and has some questionable moments * cough imagine dragons cough *) but its still really good. Arcane is far exceeding expectations for a videogame animated show
My Absolute Boyfriend,"There was some things I didn‚Äôt like about act 2. The imagine dragons scene took me out completely. As well as Vi getting kidnapped again at the end is repetitive of the first act. But if the masked guys that took her turn out to be interesting, I‚Äôll probably forgive them for that. Other than that act 2 was great. So much sexual tension lol."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I want a Heimerdinger in my lap, one on each shoulder, and on my head as well. You know what, just dump a truckload of Heimers on me, so I can be smothered in cuteness.

I love this character so much. The humans don't deserve him."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I'm shocked by how good the writing is. I've never played League and have no interest in the game, but it doesn't even matter. This show stands on it's own with how well it's written. I'm sure there are things people familiar with the lore might understand better than me but I'm loving it on it's own.

Also can we talk about how amazingly good this show looks in 4k HDR? The use of HDR specifically is done so tastefully and executed perfectly. I don't think I've seen an animated show using this before now and it *really* enhances it. This shows animation is the future. A mild complaint, or not really complaint but just observation, with Anime is they typically use such a washed out color pallet. In this show the colors are so rich and the contrast with HDR just looks phenomenal.

Edit: Just realized the show isn't in 4k, it just says HD which I assume is 1080p, but it does have Dolby Vision even though it's not 4k. I assumed when I saw the DV logo on my tv that it was 4k. Even still, 1080p that looks so good I assumed it was 4k says even more about its animation quality imo"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"So I know absolutely nothing about League, other than its toxicity (at the time, I've no idea about today) put me off even trying it (lady gamer, not putting myself through that crap for a game I wasn't super excited for). 

Does the series rely on prior knowledge to get all the references/comments/humour?"
My Absolute Boyfriend,This is what Warcraft and Witcher should have been...
My Absolute Boyfriend,"This show surprised me so much. For a show about a game i never played, it showed the world and character is such a good way, and i love most of the characters. Super pumped for act 3.

This show might become my show of the year if Hawkeye isn‚Äôt going to be better."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Arcane is surprisingly very good. I never had any interest at all in playing the game, but Arcane is one of the best animated shows I've seen."
My Absolute Boyfriend,acto 3 3 freezeeeeee!
My Absolute Boyfriend,Honestly I thought it was way better than Act 1. Don‚Äôt get me wrong act 1 was a fine setup but now it feels like big things are happening and I love all these characters!
My Absolute Boyfriend,My gamer husband made me watch this and I am so glad. I hope it takes off with non-gamers.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I really thought there would be a drop off in quality now that the setup and world building were out of the way last week, but it was still engaging.

My biggest endorsement is that I *always* use my laptop/phone while watching things because I need to keep my brain distracted, but I did nothing but watch the latest three episodes in a row. No Rimworld or Candy Crush off to the side, just watched."
My Absolute Boyfriend,God damn I teared up that last episode
My Absolute Boyfriend,"They better keep it going after part 3. It's so good, my god."
My Absolute Boyfriend,I‚Äôm personally more interested in the unbiased viewpoint of somebody who is not a fan of league already.
My Absolute Boyfriend,it would be robbery if it not an emmy winner somewhere
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Should I watch this series if I have never played, and have 0 intention of ever playing League? The animation looks really good. I also like their original animated music videos. 

The world looks really interesting, just the actual thought of playing the game makes me feel a bit sick."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Overwatch and dishonored should got treatment like arcane.

I really love arcane animation and its really remained me to dishonored game, the art and style are very close.

Wish that dishonored get animation series like this.

And overwatch have a solid plot, it will be great to making show about it."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Yea its so good
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I wonder if Arcane season 2 will focus on a different region and story altogether. From the looks of it, it seems season 1 Act 3 will finish the story of Piltover and Zaun. 

What if we see another tale that related to the Arcane in another region? That would be sick."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I don‚Äôt like animations that much. Once in a blue moon I‚Äôll watch Rattouile or some other decent animation film. Obviously Lion King. That Sturgill Simpson album release on Netflix. I watched two seasons of Castlevania and kind of stopped watching. But it was the only one I can say I would get into.

However, I just completely was blown away by this show. The whole package of it. The animation is mind blowing, the story is compelling, the characters are hard not to love and the voice actors are just incredible.

As a grown ass man, I felt emotions and goosebumps. This is an incredible show. I‚Äôll recommend to my friends who gonna question  why I like ‚Äúanime‚Äù."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I'm really intrigued by the art and animation,  and I'm hearing a lot of good things,  but I have no knowledge of League. Would it still be worth checking out?"
My Absolute Boyfriend,"So do you need any knowledge about LoL to get the most out of this show? Because I know literally nothing apart from some character names and what they look like, but the critical reception and the little bits I saw have me intrigued. Animation looks beautiful."
My Absolute Boyfriend,the only negative thing I have are the few jarring cuts. everything else? I fucking loved it!
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I think the show is honestly just fucking overhyped and overrated. Basically we are at a point in time where everyone is going to watch the most popular show and basically say its the show of the year.

&#x200B;

Not saying the show is bad, but jesus christ the way people talk about it is like its the next fucking must watch show."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I thought it was bad, but that's just my opinion."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I do not understand the gushing over this flick. Sure it is a good show, but you guys are pissing yourself over it like it is the second coming of Christ. Its like you've never watched anything good in the last 10 years. ""Show of the Year""? ""Insane""? ""Must watch""? It is none of those things.

The show is good. I would specifically mention  an interesting animation style and the choice of the music. But the story and many dialogs are just very basic and beaten to death  tropes. Struggle for power? secret magic? Betrayal, misunderstanding and revenge? Give me a break."
My Absolute Boyfriend,Can't trust since there's a huge LoL bias on reddit
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I‚Äôll watch it but it better not be another The Expanse, which according to Reddit is a GOAT status TV show that turned out to be just ok to me."
My Absolute Boyfriend,[deleted]
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Just out of curiousity.

Would this show be fun/interesting as someone who‚Äôs not played the game and has no knowledge about it or the world/lore ?"
My Absolute Boyfriend,Waiting for the big finale!!!! HYPE!
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I absolutely hate league of legends, is it worth watching for someone like me?

Also is there blood? I love blood especially in animation"
My Absolute Boyfriend,Where are you guys watching it cause I'm on Netflix and it's releasing one episode per week.
My Absolute Boyfriend,[Act 5 spoilers](#s That scene where they vote out Heimerdinger legit made me sad. The council really did him dirty. Hopefully he still has a presence in the show)
My Absolute Boyfriend,[deleted]
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I getting kind of tired of how much people are pushing this show. It's starting to not look very authentic, to be honest."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Question that I'm sure has been answered 50 times already. Do I need to know LoL lore to understand this show? I've heard nothing but good things about it, but I'm not sure if I'll understand anything."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Cliffhanger in act 2 rivals that of act 1. Tf u smoking. Singed is viktors fucking dad, we are getting an introduction into the embodiment of broken mage assassin, and all these other stories we have to wait a week to finish. And I Vi‚Äôs fighting is top notch. I hope to god we see Sett in arcane at least once."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Band of misfits steals a priceless new technology and an evil corporation is after them. Unpopular opinion here but I think that the Arcane story is generic and boring and it‚Äôs only redeeming quality is the animation. Forget it Jake, this is Reddit, here three weeks ago someone compared Squid Game to The Sopranos"
My Absolute Boyfriend,Loved it. Only main gripe I have is with the sex scene. Like does every Netflix need to have some forced sexual content to get people‚Äôs boners rising?
My Absolute Boyfriend,Oh damnit...I thought it was also being released at 6pm pacific time on Saturday like the first act.  Damn!
My Absolute Boyfriend,Looks like I need to give this a go. I've been put off as anything I've ever seen of League of legends culture is a bit toxic.
My Absolute Boyfriend,It already is my show of the year but I want to see the ending to see if it truly deserves to be called show of the year generally outside of my personal preferences.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Act 2 was about a 7/10 for me.  The creators don't seem to know how to reach story beats organically.  Characters do things because they have to in order to advance the story.  This is ok if you do it once or twice, but literally every single character did something out of the blue to advance their own plot line.

I'll still watch Act 3, but I am disappointed with Act 2.  Also, fuck Imagine Dragons.  Good lord stop shoe-horning them in all over the place."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"Although I think the sex scene along with what Viktor was going through was weird, it had some of the prettiest art I think I have seen."
My Absolute Boyfriend,"..... it's Out!??

Are they releasing all the acts a week apart from one another!?"
My Absolute Boyfriend,Is it good if you‚Äôve never heard a thing about it?
My Absolute Boyfriend,I have never played the game. Can I watch the show?
My Absolute Boyfriend,Argh just give me the rest now so I can finish it.
My Absolute Boyfriend,watch more shows.
My Absolute Boyfriend,Has anyone watched DOTA. Haven't heard much about it.
My Absolute Boyfriend,"I haven't watched act 2 yet, but I liked act 1.

I do need to comment on the ending of act 1 though. It was all so well set up, and then it dissapoints terribly. 
They were really bold to have important characters die as a result of Powder fucking up. That was impressive. Very often in these types of shows everything bad that happens is no-one's fault, just randomness, which is lazy writing; so when Powder is actually fully at fault for her mistake, that was powerful.

They then have Vi have an outburst, even hitting her out of anger. It is wonderful, these characters are actually flawed!!! Except nah, Vi is right there and never abandons her, she just gets kidnapped but never actually leaves Powder. The main conflict of the show and their relationship is now set in stone, and the source is a fucking misunderstanding.
That is very unsatisfying. They should have had Vi actually abandon her, and come to regret it later; not have her be kidnapped and therefore faultless for what happens."
My Absolute Boyfriend,[deleted]
My Absolute Boyfriend,"If i havent played LoL or dont know anything about it, is this worth watching? Sorry if its a dumb question"
My Absolute Boyfriend,How is it for someone who has never played LoL?
My Absolute Boyfriend,Do I need to watch Act 1 first to get Act 2? My spouse already did A1 and I want to join them for 2.
