TV Show,Comment
Lets Fight Ghost,"We have run out of time but want to thank everybody who has watched and enjoyed the show from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for your questions, sorry we couldn't answer them all and we sincerely hope we'll see you back at Portland Row before too long. 

Joe, Ruby, Cameron and Ali. x"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
Lets Fight Ghost,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
Lets Fight Ghost,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It’s been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
Lets Fight Ghost,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you’ve done trapeze! (I’m an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons 👀)"
Lets Fight Ghost,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood’s usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn’t be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
Lets Fight Ghost,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
Lets Fight Ghost,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
Lets Fight Ghost,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
Lets Fight Ghost,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
Lets Fight Ghost,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?
Lets Fight Ghost,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing 😂

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about 😂) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? 😂👀"
Lets Fight Ghost,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
Lets Fight Ghost,[deleted]
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Not show related, but for Ali: being that you're a lit student, do you have a favorite book and/or author?!?!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a “show for kids”.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
Lets Fight Ghost,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ❤️"
Lets Fight Ghost,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
Lets Fight Ghost,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
Lets Fight Ghost,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‘locklyle’ shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It’d make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character’s past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren’t having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they’d be doing?"
Lets Fight Ghost,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
Lets Fight Ghost,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
Lets Fight Ghost,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
Lets Fight Ghost,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it’s one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here’s my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it’s based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
Lets Fight Ghost,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
Lets Fight Ghost,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
Lets Fight Ghost,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
Lets Fight Ghost,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
Lets Fight Ghost,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
Lets Fight Ghost,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
Lets Fight Ghost,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
Lets Fight Ghost,what were first and last shootings?
Lets Fight Ghost,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
Lets Fight Ghost,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
Lets Fight Ghost,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Lets Fight Ghost,what was your favourite location to film?
Lets Fight Ghost,"The netflix adaption of Lockwood & Co was so visually stunning and still did the book series justice! 

What scene was most fun to film? Because of the scene itself, or on-set antics?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: what talent would you prefer to have? Touch, Sight or Listening?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Thank you to everyone involved in this project! It is a pitch perfect adaptation of one of my favorite series of books. Love the cast, the settings, and the whole vibe of the show! Hoping for more seasons as I would love to see Aickmere’s Department Store and the Fittes’ headquarters scenes on screen. 

Question for the cast: what was the most challenging scene to film?"
Lets Fight Ghost,choose my lockwood and co themed tattoo PLEASE
Lets Fight Ghost,"For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What is your favorite song from the soundtrack? 

I love the show so much! I had never read the books, but after one watch, I was inspired to read the books! That's how great the show was! Perfect adaptation! After reading the books, i can appreciate the work that everyone put into the show that much more to bring Jonathon Stroud's masterpiece to life. Best show I've seen in years! And the acting was on point! I'm super impressed with Lockwood's character! He was literally copied and pasted from the books to TV lol. Lucy is a badass and George is hilarious and so lovable. Y'all are awesome! :)"
Lets Fight Ghost,"To all four of you - 

The show's had a chokehold on me ever since I watched it (as soon as it came out) and I haven't been able to eat/sleep/watch anything else because it's always on my mind! I'm not even exaggerating 

So first of all, thank you so so so so so much for this opportunity, my brain is finally at peace.

As for the question, how does it feel to be a part of something as big as this? You guys have put in your absolute 100% and trust me it shows! Not only have you catalysed the spreading of this fandom, but every single person who has watched the show has only had positive stuff to say about it!"
Lets Fight Ghost,Why does Lockwood wear pink socks? And are they the same ones or does he have multiple pairs lol?
Lets Fight Ghost,Is Lockwood jealous of Lucy initially that she can speak to type threes?
Lets Fight Ghost,"What was it like filming the scene when Lucy is ""possessed"" by Annabelle?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Greetings from Ukraine! Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question! After watching the adaptation, I really wanted to read the books, so I have a lot of respect for the painstaking work on the series.  
Before I ask the question, I just want to express my endless love to the actors who played their roles incredibly. This is the best adaptation from netflix in the last year, if not two :ʼD  
Questions for Ruby: did you prepare in any way for the role, I mean maybe read books to soak up the atmosphere, or maybe listen to some playlists like Ali. Maybe you were looking for something on tiktok or aesthetics on pinterest? and did you enjoy the fencing lessons before filming?  
Questions for Ali: (George is my favorite character and the way you played him is just amazing). Do you like George as a character? Do you have any similarities? maybe you found some minuses or pluses in your character?  
Questions for Cameron: When I found out that this was your debut role, it was a pleasant surprise for me, because you completely got into the character of Lockwood and his charisma. Did you read the books or maybe some excerpts? Plus you are very good at using a rapier. If you had the chance, would fencing become your hobby? Is it possible that fencing is already one of the hobbies?  
And a question for all three of you: if you had the opportunity to take a vacation as characters from the show, where would you go/fly and what would you do there?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE! The show is incredible! I love it! Everyday I’m watching it twice! 
Q to Joe: Did you saved all sets, costumes and stuff for maybe a second season or has everything been dismantled?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"For Joe: Any deleted scenes that had to be cut due to time that could be shared?

And also, could you by chance go into detail on how the red room scene was done with the blood dripping from the walls? What had to be done to get that specific effect? 

For Cameron: What's a specific character dynamic between Lockwood and any other character that you wish we got to see more of? 

For Ruby: What was your favorite part about playing Lucy? She's such a developed character with a pretty big depth of emotions as we saw. Was it difficult to get that range of emotions without it seeming forced at all?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Thank you for doing this! I have a lot of questions but I'll try to keep it to a minimum

For Joe:  Why did you decide to have Norrie get ghostlocked instead of ghosttouched?

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: What do you think your character's favorite movie is?

For Ruby: What was the transition like going from something like ""Bridgerton"" to a show like ""Lockwood & Co?""

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: In what way do you think you are similar from and different from your characters?

For Joe: Who was your favorite character outside of the main trio to write and why?

For all of you: Do you like to watch fan edits or read fanfiction? If so, what's been your favorite edit or fanfic?

For Ali: What do you think George's favorite dish to cook is?

For Joe: What made you want to adapt these books specifically into a TV show?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"For anyone: Which scene was the most difficult and/or took the longest to film? 

Bonus random question: what’s your favorite ghost movie?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"Question for everyone: what’s something that you could see the characters doing together that we don’t see in the books or on screen? Ex: dance parties to relieve stress, everyone piling into the library for a book club, etc"
Lets Fight Ghost,"To Ruby and Cameron,

Q: How would you guys describe Lucy and Lockwood's relationship?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"How do I audition for your show? They say to be bold and ask, so I'm trying!"
Lets Fight Ghost,For Cameron and Ali: Can you guys confirm your birthdays? The internet is going crazy trying to find them out haha
Lets Fight Ghost,"Hey Joe and the others!!!!
Season 1 was amazing. Can't wait for more.
So do you guys have an idea about how many seasons you want to do to wrap up the story? 
Also, episode 7 was amazing!!! Bit shoutout to the cast and crew. Loved the show."
Lets Fight Ghost,Favorite book in the series?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Thank you guys for making the PERFECT adaptation of my favourite books. I can’t believe how lucky we are to have received such an incredible adaptation 🥰❤️

I’d like to ask Cameron, Ruby and Ali- what is your favourite book in the series?
And is there a particular moment across the five books that stood out to you? 

Thank you guys for doing such an incredible job!! You honestly feel like the characters jumped from the books! 🥹❤️"
Lets Fight Ghost,What did you all do to get yourself into your character?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Loved the show so much! It felt so natural and you can definitely tell a lot of hard work and talent went into this from all aspects, wonderful actors, wonderful script, editing, everything!

Aside from the obvious haunting question of when can we expect season 2… my question for the cast is if they had to pick an ability from the show which would it be? 
For Joe, can you share what some favorite moments from the books you are/were most excited to translate/adapt into the show?"
Lets Fight Ghost,"(To Cameron, Ruby, and Ali) 
If you could have taken anything from the set as a keepsake, what would it have been? And why?"
Lets Fight Ghost,For Cameron and Ruby: Ali's mentioned in interviews that he made and listened to specific playlists to help get into character - were there songs (or other media) that helped you prepare for Lockwood and Lucy as well?
Lets Fight Ghost,For everyone: what is your favorite haunting in the book series?
Lets Fight Ghost,"Thank you so much for giving us such an awesome show! The books and the show both depict a variety of different ghost types, from Changers to Cold Maidens to Spectres. What's everyone's favourites?"
Lets Fight Ghost,Any fun stories from downtimes on set? How was filming on all the amazing sets + at the different locations? <33
ANNE+,"Not sure if Reddit cares at all about this show but it’s damn aces as far as modern adaptations go. 

Book came out about 40 years ago and they updated it brilliantly. 

Acting is fantastic, sets and costumes, all tops. 

I hear the connected witches show is meh but I never read those and don’t care. 

AMC has a solid show with this one."
ANNE+,"Daniels is extraordinarily charismatic. Even when he’s out of his depths in Jesus Christ Superstar Live, he commands every scene he’s in."
ANNE+,Awesome. I have loved every performance I’ve seen of this actor. He stole the show on NBC’s live version of JC Superstar.
ANNE+,"I loved him in The Exorcist show on Fox. He was great as the intense, creepy priest. That show was surprisingly really good, and he'll be a perfect fit for Interview With The Vampire."
ANNE+,"Ben Daniels in House of Cards was incredible. Played someone used to bring the main character of his universe with both charisma and humanity, only to become extremely vulnerable after feeling manipulated. Excellent."
ANNE+,"Ben Daniels is always great. Not interested in the show but if you want more of him, check the movie Conspiracy or Law & Order UK, which is surprisingly great"
ANNE+,"YES he's the perfect Santiago.

Ben Daniels is also phenomenal in The Exorcist."
ANNE+,I loved him in The Exorcist!  This is great news
ANNE+,"Not a fan of the show. I’m a big fan of the books, but the show just doesn’t compare to what Anne did with her stories. Maybe I’d have liked the show had I never read the books."
ANNE+,"I don't understand how Interview Season 1 was so well written and executed, but Mayfair Witches was such a steaming pile of turd.

Happy for Ben Daniels, however.  He was criminally underrated in the Exorcist."
ANNE+,It's in my top 3 from last year. Hoping for season 2 late this year but it's probably wishful thinking..
ANNE+,Gay me about died from how hard I binged this show. I need more
ANNE+,"Making Louis black adds a lot to the power imbalance that Lestat has over him. Also makes for a much more interesting period drama with the organized crime aspect. I am also really loving this portrayal of Lestat, especially when compared with the movie. Funny thing is Louis seems to be emulating Brad Pitt's speech pattern and mannerisms (from the film) during the interview segments."
ANNE+,This show is great but Mayfair is terrible.  I gave up on it.
ANNE+,It's fantastic. Blew me out of the water.
ANNE+,"Fantastic acting? The main character is awful. She can't do any emotional scenes.

Edit: nvm I'm stupid thought it was about the Mayfair Witches show."
ANNE+,"Pilate is a role written with such a bizarrely large vocal range that most of the time you don’t get an actor who can sing the whole part well “as written.” This has led to frequently casting actors over singers, who speak sing huge portions of the role. 

So all things considered, Daniels was one of the best acted Pilates I’ve seen, even though (like many) he couldn’t really sing it well."
ANNE+,"I read the books and actually really like all the changes here. Making Louis black adds a lot of interesting avenues for exploring the past, and adds to the power imbalance that comes naturally with an elder Vampire like Lestat. Aging Claudia up was also the right choice, as well as not having her be a romantic interest for Louis (gross, she's like 8 in the books). Lestat here also seems to be very close to the books, maybe a bit more effeminate, but he is french.

What did you not like about it?"
ANNE+,"The biggest flaws i could see was the casting,acting and writing,all important factors for the success of a show.
Rowan and Lasher had no chemistry at all. Lasher is supposed to be this seductive and mysterious entity that Rowan keeps coming back too but instead he gave me 'used car salesman' vibe and Daddario's acting was monotonous, the dialogue delivery flat and it doesn't help that the dialogue itself is dull af


On the other hand Sam Reid and Jacob Anderson's chemistry and acting was INSANE!!! they are the heart of this show and Sam is literally posessed by Lestat,he is that good"
ANNE+,Yep. They really fucked up Mayfair. Combining Rowan’s mentor and love interest was one of the bigger mistakes.
ANNE+,"I don't think they share any writers or showrunners, do they? Basically separate shows, loosely connected by the books."
ANNE+,Dear God Mayfair Witches is terrible.
ANNE+,They're talking about interview with the vampire
ANNE+,"Honestly, my opinion of Alexandra Daddario as an actor plummeted after watching this show and I did watch the whole thing. I wouldn’t say I was a fan but I guess her other projects concealed her limitations. This was a lot to work with and she didn’t deliver much at all."
ANNE+,"Her acting is brutal. The Lasher character is horrendous.  The chemistry is lousy.  The writing is sub-par.    It probably comes down to money, but to put out a great product in Interview, and then shit all over Mayfair (the first book is terrific) is mind-numbing."
ANNE+,I only watched the first two episodes of the Witches before giving it a rest. I truly don’t understand how they managed to make it look so lifeless and like a mash up of the blandest ‘prestige’ dramas of 2013
ANNE+,Uhh i guess I'm just dumb. My excuse is I had just woken up.
ANNE+,"Exactly! The other projects of hers that i've watched is True detective and the white lotus and both the characters she played weren't that deep or didnt demand a strong presence in the show

Rowan is supposed to be this immensely powerful witch and a woman who is discovering her sexual appetite, instead they made her this whiny damsel in distress,monotonous shell of a person. Being the 13th witch is a big deal but I was more invested in Dierdre Mayfair's story than Rowan's

It's such a sad thing coz the book readers kept saying the source material was amazing and abundant and they butchered it mercilessly. I watched it for the sake of the crossover which never happened lmao and now they are pushing that show for an Emmy? Good luck Esta and Michelle.

I feel along with the acting and plot as such,the showrunners themselves are so disconnected from the source material and aren't as passionate unlike their IWTV counterparts where Sam Reid and Rolin Jones have been long time Anne Rice fans and even with the changes managed to keep the emotional arcs of the characters intact. Sam was described by one of the producers on set as 'the most knowledgeable person about TVC out of everyone on set' and Mayfair lacked someone like this. Daddario was the only one of the mains who read the first book"
ANNE+,"I thought her weird halting line delivery came from being traumatised at the start of the season. But no, she was doing it until the very end. Very weird acting choice."
ANNE+,"I never read the source material. I gave it so much grace because IWTV was one of the best things I’ve seen in years. I stuck with it for that and because the side characters are actually pretty good.

But god, Daddario just feels like a dead fish the whole time while her character goes through so much. The arc is major but she just seems like a person who has things happen to her and never does anything herself. Even though I think the Lasher actor is miscast and the chemistry is non-existent, he’s at least performing at a high level acting-wise.

I’m probably still going to watch season 2 in the hopes of a turnaround because it’s not out of the realm of possibilities. But I don’t think I’ll stick through another entire season if it doesn’t make some hits early."
ANNE+,[deleted]
ANNE+,"I loved the interview with the vampire, but Mayfair witches seemed more like a ""person discovers he is a descendant of witches and now must discover his powers and fight the villain of the week""

Does this show strike me as something I've seen countless times, or am I wrong?"
ANNE+,"I thought Interview with the Vampire was great. It's a top 4 show from 2022 for me together with Severance, House of the Dragon and Andor. 

The acting, costumes and locations are just phenomenal. Really good writing too (haven't read the book though so don't know how it relates to that).

As for Mayfair Witches I'm waiting for the entire season before I give it a go."
ANNE+,"I read *Interview* back in the '90s when the movie came out, and two or three more of the Lestat books, then gave up; never read *Mayfair Witches.* I'm watching both of the AMC shows and enjoying them both, though *Interview* may be easier to love than *Mayfair Witches.* 

The showrunner on *Interview With the Vampire* is [Rolin Jones](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289754/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1), who co-created and co-ran HBO's *Perry Mason* S1. So if you like that, you'll probably like *Interview.* I would also put it up against other vampire dramas like, say, *True Blood.* A bit camp, a whole lot bloody, and good fun. And for anyone who read the book or saw the movie, ***really*** well updated and translated to something easier on current sensibilities by making the implied-in-the-'70s gay content explicit, and moving from 18th century New Orleans with a white protagonist to early 20th-century New Orleans with a black protagonist. 

The showrunners/creators on *Mayfair Witches* are [Esta Spaulding](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1123381/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) and [Michelle Ashford](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038933/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1). Ashford was the creator/showrunner of *Masters of Sex,* and Spaulding was one of the EP/writers on that show. She was also EP/showrunner (but not creator) on *On Becoming a God in Central Florida.* The book they're working with is, I gather, more of a slow burn, and the show is following suit, so it won't grab you by the throat immediately. But it's working for me, and is pretty solid. But YMMV, especially if you expect an identical show to *Interview.* 

I did crack up listening to the franchise's official podcast (which is apparently changing titles depending on which show is current), where Spaulding said that after *Masters of Sex* (which was a dramatization of Masters and Johnson pursuing their landmark study on human sexuality)*,* she and Ashford had thought they'd written every possible kind of sex scene there was, but *Mayfair Witches* proved them wrong. :D  I'd probably put this show more on a level with something like *Evil*, than *True Blood.*"
ANNE+,"haven't read the books either. i thought interview with the vampire was great and mayfair witches is a bit slow, not sure about that one."
ANNE+,"Yeah we loved Interview and so far I'd say it's the better show, but we like Mayfair Witches ok."
ANNE+,I'd like to but neither show is available in the UK yet.
ANNE+,Interview is a good show but if you're a fan of the book and that's what you want to see you might be disappointed.
ANNE+,"Never bothered watching interview, story line changes and other things made me skip it altogether.

Witches, its basically a video fan fic with Anne Rice's name on it. The only reason i am still watching it is Daddario. If you have never read the source material, the above might not matter to you, but if your a fan of the books, this adaptation is simply cultural vandalism."
ANNE+,Nope.
ANNE+,Interview with the Vampire is pretty great tbh. Actor who plays Lestat is awesome
ANNE+,"Mayfair Witches is slightly better than CW quality. Too boring, bad CGI. Not for me."
ANNE+,Yes. They both are excellent!
ANNE+,"Neither of them is in Brazil, unfortunately. AMC said AMC+ will debut here this fall. I really don't know why, as there is no future with this streaming. AMC shows used to come on Prime Video."
ANNE+,"Interview with the Vampire had a great first season. There are changes to the books but the showrunner was really thoughtful in making those changes integral to the show so there's actual impact vs making changes just for the sake of it.

The acting is incredible! Great production, relatively fast-paced, and great writing.

Mayfair, I'm trying to watch the pilot, and it's a bit rough. I'm hoping it improves, but it's a bit expository in the dialogue. I'm a little concerned that it doesn't trust the audience enough to understand the story without a character giving us backstory"
ANNE+,No
ANNE+,"I love the IWTV series. But, yeah, it is a bad adaptation if you are  looking for a series that is faithful to the book. Now with that said, as a series alone, it's campy, dramatic, messy fun. The leads have so much chemistry. The costumes are gorgeous. The camera work is fantastic. People clearly put their blood, sweat and tears in this. I, too, would recommend it. But don't go into it expecting it to be *just* like the books. This Louis is not book Louis outside some moping. He is not afraid to bite back."
ANNE+,I agree. I think they improved on the books because they say outright what Anne Rice hinted at in subtext.
ANNE+,Ok thanks. AMC must have the rights to these books if two series. Going to search about that now lol
ANNE+,Yeah seen that tons of times. It seems majority of ppl love the interview with vampire but are hoping Mayfair witches gets better
ANNE+,I believe this discussion may exist more-so due to [the upcoming crossover](https://collider.com/mayfair-witches-interview-with-the-vampire-crossover).
ANNE+,"Mayfair is definitely not a ""monster of the week"" story. I think the biggest problem with it is honestly the casting of Rowan. Daddario's interpretation of the character is off-putting. She is whiny and spastic. She is being out acted by every other person on the show. I feel like the casting for both her and Lasher are a miss."
ANNE+,Oh wow awesome. I finished house of dragon a little while ago. Thought it was amazing as well. What others shows have u watched from 2022? I never seen any of the Star Wars movies so I’m assuming I wouldn’t understand Andor
ANNE+,I would like to see a vampire show that’s not a teen show. I miss true blood
ANNE+,Yeah I just read some reviews on another forum. Seemed lots loved interviews with the vampire but mixed opinions on Mayfair witches
ANNE+,Ok thanks seems lots of ppl are thinking the same as I checked out another sub earlier
ANNE+,"Couldn't stand Mayfair, *strongly* recommend Interview"
ANNE+,Thank you
ANNE+,Oh wow that’s strange. Brazil would be a big market
ANNE+,Me either
ANNE+,"If you are referring to the romantic relationship, in her defense she does make it pretty clear in the books after Interview with the Vampire. >!They kiss, say ""I love you,"" dance, etc.!< The show is certainly more concrete and straightforward about their relationship, which I very much enjoy as an adaptation choice, but she did make the relationship textually canon as well."
ANNE+,"vampire interview improved the movie and books in an incredible way!

I must say it's the best vampire thing I've come across in years"
ANNE+,"Mayfair looks like the plot of a cw teen series from the trailers, something like the witch part in vampire diaries"
ANNE+,"The Sandman. The first half was really good, the second kinda average. I understand the comics consist of several shorter story arcs so next season will likely be similar. 

The new White Lotus season is worth watching. Reacher on Amazon Prime was surprisingly enjoyable. Looking forward to season two. 

The new seasons for The Boys and For All Mankind are a good watch. Highly recommend those shows if you haven't seen them. 

You can probably watch Andor without knowing anything about Star Wars. The downside is that it's the best Star Wars content out there so if you get hooked and want more, nothing will be as good."
ANNE+,"Andor is great. And you don't really need to know much of the Star Wars background in order to get into it. The only information you need is that there is a 1939 NAZI-like bureaucratic fascist empire that is steamrolling through the galaxy and they are facing grumbling rumors about an underground rebellion gaining traction. The show follows both sides. That's it. That's all you need to know. You don't need to know anything about Jedis or any of the Skywalker clan or bounty hunters. Just that there is a fascist empire and there are people who want to stop them. Simple. Basic. And go.
If you like political thrillers, you'll like this show. If you like war movies, you'll like this show."
ANNE+,">I would like to see a vampire show that’s not a teen show.

You should definitely try this then."
ANNE+,Cool
ANNE+,I’m going to have to start it tomorrow then. Would you say it’s slow pace starting off?
ANNE+,Ok Msybe trying to fill that void of audience
ANNE+,"Thanks for all details. I love marvel and dc movies/shows. 

I have never seen the white lotus. I keep hearing good things about that show and succession on hbo. Succession is family business . What show would you compare white lotus to?

I actually just watched the recap of season 1 of the boys. Going to watch recap of season 2 then began season 3. Heard it’s vet good"
ANNE+,Never seen for all mankind yet
ANNE+,Awesome! Going to take your word
ANNE+,"I recommend watching the first three episodes at once, they act as an arc that kicks off the story very well."
ANNE+,really i hope the show gets better in season 2
ANNE+,"I honestly don't know what to compare it too. Haven't seen anything like it.

Each season has a new set of characters at a location and it's just them interacting with each other. It's really fun.

Btw if you like Marvel/DC stuff I think you should give Star Wars a try."
ANNE+,"The IWATV series is definitely super dope, well constructed on both sides of the camera, and (as someone who hasn’t read the books) a refreshing taste of vampire lore clearly geared toward adults. Scratched an itch I’ve had since Netflix wrongfully killed Hemlock Grove many moons ago. 


But it is not anywhere near True Blood. But I absolutely fucking love True Blood.  
That said, it’s very much worth the watch.  

The Mayfair Witches, however, seems to be verrrrrryyyyyyyy slllllloooooowwwwwwlllllyyyyyyyyyyy crrrrrraaawwwwwwllllliiiiinnnnnggggg toward character development and an eventual arch which could become a lovely plateau. But it also is ridiculously confusing, sloppily written (methinks), and not nearly as gripping as IWTV. Cinematography is tight; visually stunning, even. But if it doesn’t hit a stride soon…. It won’t have anyone left to watch it. Mayfair does quite masterfully depict some tripping scenes though. I give them massive props for that. They don’t make it necessarily known what substance the character was given even, but it seems to be some crazy GHB-like effect mixed with LSD visuals. 

Apparently, there is a “companion podcast” to listen to for Mayfair Witches. But 1. I’m just not really a podcast person. Idgaf, I’m weird like that. 2. The point of a fucking show is to SHOW a story. To convey it; translate it harmoniously visually & audibly. Sorry [show creators], but I just really don’t care to be forced into listening to some stupid podcast solely because of your lazily sloppy ass writing and failed attempt at conveying the story you wanna show… on the actual SHOW…   

But hey, I’m also an asshole. So, there’s that. 
Still, watch Interview. It’s tight. Go into Mayfair at your own risk. Or maybe to fall asleep to. Lmao"
ANNE+,Hopefully. As amc has a desk for all the content for Anne rice novels
ANNE+,Ok so it’s a completely different story the next season then
ANNE+,Yeah I’m not getting much positive vibes about Mayfair lol
ANNE+,Interview is way better than I thought it would be.
ANNE+,Interview with a Vampire is way better than I thought it would be. The trailer was not good.
ANNE+,Interview with the Vampire is up there with the best shows in 2022. I have really high hopes for this next series as well.
ANNE+,"Knowing Anne Rice played a part in the major story changes in Interview made me enjoy it a whole lot more. I really enjoyed the deeper themes brought to the forefront, otherwise ignored in the movie and glossed over in the original book."
ANNE+,I saw the commercial for the new Mayfair Witches show the other day and got excited about something on TV for the first time in a long time. Been hoping for this since I read the books ages ago.
ANNE+,"Interview With The Vampire is excellent. Really excellent. It's odd in the sense that I have been taking breaks for multiple weeks between episodes and not been desperate to keep watching, but when I do, I love it. I never have that, I'm usually all in or all out and don't let episodes build up if I'm enjoying something. But yes, it's great. Sam Reid and Jacob Anderson are both outstanding. Reid had some hefty shoes to fill because Tom Cruise made that role so iconic and so fun, and he gives Lestat so much depth and nuance between his fits of range and funny unhinged moments. 

And I loved the pilot for Mayfair Witches. Alexandra Daddario nails the part, to no surprise. I can't say I was excited for it, but I checked it out and really enjoyed myself.

That said, AMC REALLY needs to work on their trailers. Both of these shows are not being done justice with their trailers. Mayfair Witches was advertised with a Halsey pop song, which is not an indicator for the tone of it at all."
ANNE+,Exciting to see all the new adaptations! Does anyone know when Interview becomes available to watch at an EU streaming service? I'm hoping to catch up with the series soon
ANNE+,"interview is way better than I thought, mayfair witches however completely lost all my interest in 20 min"
ANNE+,I really hope this franchise is successful
ANNE+,"I’m a massive Anne Rice fan (I have collected first edition hardcovers of 90% of her books so far) and The Witching Hour is my favorite of hers. The article points out why - her descriptions of New Orleans are so immersive, you feel like you belong there. She’s an interesting author because she writes within the horror genre, but her style is far more literary than most, the plot develops slowly, and she’s very descriptive. There’s a lot of eroticism , which probably turns off a lot of readers as well. But I think all of these things make her works particularly suited to television, and all of these developments are thrilling for fans. I’m so excited to see how his plays out."
ANNE+,"Interview with the Vampire had one of the best pilots i've seen in recent memory. The rest of the season wavers between ""pretty good"" to ""okay"" but it's just interesting enough that i'd like to keep watching."
ANNE+,Now do the Wolf Gift and you got your werewolves too
ANNE+,", Rolin Jones, and more about 2 very different shows that I really enjoy"
ANNE+,They really aren't. Interview is trash. They had the characters literally insult the original book and author at length on screen in the first episode. They also utterly mangled Claudia and gave her a sex scene. The child vampire. Got a sex scene.
ANNE+,"Eh.  I really enjoyed the vampire books (like, 30 years ago...) the previous movie adaptations less so, and won't be bothering with the series.

I've just been burned too many times by book adaptations that make wholesale changes to the original work, even before the current system where said changes are made for ideological reasons."
ANNE+,[deleted]
ANNE+,Nobody cares about this garbage.
ANNE+,No
ANNE+,The Anne rice TV universe or the artvu
ANNE+,You must have set your expectations extremely low. It was so bad.
ANNE+,Jacob Anderson showing crazy range between Grey Worm in GoT and this.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It’s annoying they don’t mention how many viewers, only that it was certain percentages higher than other shows. 

But we have no solid numbers."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,The Sex Lives of College Girls really surprised me. All those tropes I normally hate I don't mind here. I like every main character. Side characters are delightful. Had good laughs throughout all episodes. Really solid comedy.

Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I honestly can’t wait for season two of College Girls. How’s Kimberly gonna find money for tuition for her semesters? Her mom had to sell their piano for her to even attend the first year and she was on a scholarship. 

I’m so concerned. (No sarcasm. I just love all the characters already. Ten episodes just flew by in a second)."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Sex And The City is too legendary for any of its byproducts to fail, evidently."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Mindy Kaling is a money printer for studios..
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"My wife looked at the screen after *that happened* on ‘And Just Like That…’ and angrily said… 

“WTF did they just do?! I am never watching again. Bad enough they badmouthed Samantha. Now, decades of caring about this show, and they do that! THAT!?! I am DONE.” 

And she said ‘sorry, I asked you to watch that’, gave me a kiss, got up and walked out to the kitchen and poured a half glass of Rosé. 🍷

I like my wife. 😁"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,This triggers the television connoisseurs and intellects of r/television
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Really enjoyed the show. Shout out to Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Proven IP and creators will always draw people in. We can't get anyone new to produce things because of shit like this lol
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"The guy who wanted to pee on her in the shower never would have died from a heart attack using a Peloton. Hell, get rid of most of the letters and you're stuck with Pe ---- On. Right?"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,If they give numbers it makes it a lot harder to lie over and over about something having more and more and more since eventually the human population is less.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,You’re absolutely right.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I liked it a lot because the girls are enjoyable and the comedy is pretty good, but I'm also really confused by the storytelling choices. There are so many things that get brought up and then dropped completely during the show that no girl's storyline really felt that cohesive to me?"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It’s true. It does remind me of Sex and The City. Just a complete different era, and a completely different setting. But there’s some overlap of vibe."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Should have been called Sex in the College
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Yeah honestly that’s exactly why I passed on it, I feel like it has the birds of prey effect lol, marketing as a one note girlboss thing. Glad to hear it isn’t as bad as it sounded"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"What are some of the funniest lines/scenes?  

Because I watched it and didn't note anything that would qualify as funny.  It's more of a YA soap opera with cursing and sexual themes."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Is it anything like the tv show Girls? I didn't like that show because I didn't like the characters.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Thanks for this, I had already passed on it."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It really is!!!
Where’s the sub Reddit devoted to just that show???

Where are the reaction videos on YouTube? Also I wanna see reaction videos to And Just Like That…"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,I like it except for the two tokens that they cast for the four main characters. Making it half was too much.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,My bet is she’s gonna go down a camgirl/OnlyFans route. The money you can make from that is crazyyy and it would be a pretty fitting plot point for the content of the show
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Well there was that CW prequel, starring AnnaSophie Robb as young Carrie back in the 80s"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,[deleted]
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I realise that with Cattrall refusing to return they have to find a way to write Sam out, but I hate the reason they chose. It feels more like a dig at Kim Cattrall than anything that makes sense for Samantha a a character. 

I'd have preferred it if they just had Carrie and Samantha still in touch via texts and (offscreen) Zoom calls. You could even have the classic SATC narration be Carrie's emails to Samantha this time instead of her column."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"While it hurt, they absolutely had to do that.  There was nothing else that could be done with that storyline.

It’s a tricky part of any “revival” show.  You want your favorite characters to be happy, but that can’t be a show (there’s no conflict).  Gilmore Girls had a similar struggle (mostly between Luke and Lorelei).  It’s why the Friends creators won’t touch a revival."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,There’s a lot of problematic cringe writing going on it.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,They gave Samantha a redemption in the second episode.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Mr.Big died..the guy she loved since 1998.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,That's just tv shows in 2021
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Show writers from game of thrones maybe?
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"There was this throwaway line that Kimberly says when she doesn’t want to go to a party, something like, “I’m watching this really sad Brazilian documentary about a snake that ate a child.” That just caught me off guard and I thought it was funny. I also think the actress who plays Lila is a real scene stealer and she’s had some really funny lines."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It's more the events and actions that are funny than lines specifically. But that whole frat bro shouting at the girls to be on their best behavior was pretty funny imo. And ""I don't eat for enjoyment"""
Girls und Panzer das Finale,I just keep hoping the annoying one from small town America shows her jugs.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,It’s a lot less serious than girls. The characters are also more likeable. I’d say it’s fluffier for sure. The only thing they have in common is that it’s an all-female lead cast. Girls is about women out of college navigating life. This show is more of a light-hearted romp about the excitement of freshman year of college and newly found freedom. I’d recommend it. It’s cute and funny in parts. The girls also have good chemistry together.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I didn't watch that one, but these girls are very likable! I could pick a favorite one honestly."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Mindy Kaling is a far more accomplished writer/showrunner than Lena Dunham
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It has an ugly main character that reminds me a lot of the main one from Girls, but other than that, it is much better than girls.

They did have an Indian girl peep on a seventeen year-old boy in the shower while she was holding a camera, so that was pretty creepy."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"You're welcome, I hope you'll like it!"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"What i'm thinking is next season they'll be a timeskip to next semester and hand wave it as Leighton, Whitney, Nico and maybe Bela (not quite sure how rich her parents are) having helped fund Kimberly's semester but could only do this one. So Kimberly's main plot would be figuring out how to get the money"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"> back in the 80’s

Dang, AnnaSophia Robb has aged remarkably well."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,I really liked that they introduced young Samantha for season 2 Lindsay Gort looked just like her .
Girls und Panzer das Finale,So your wife still tuned in.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I thought it was a nice setup and then payoff at the end with the flowers, I thought it was a great way to say there is a problem but the door's open.  As a guy over 50, I enjoyed the two episodes so far."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I really enjoyed the Gilmore Girls reboot, it was much darker but still very funny and great acting."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Instead of downvoting you, people should explain why they disagree. I don't know whether or not you're right, but it's a reasonable conclusion."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Why not? I would love to watch a show for once where everyone is happy.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,The writing is TOUGH
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Hmmm. 

We/she didn’t make it that far.

I’ll let her know. Thank you. :)"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It reminds me of Sex and the City, except it has semi believable characters and it doesn’t completely suck."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Is Lila the Sips coffee colleague?  If so then yes, she had good delivery.

I vaguely recall a couple lines in the last 2-3 episodes that I said ""that could possibly be regarded as funny"", but honestly I can't even remember what they were.  

Compare with something like Succession, which is heavily funny inside of dour.  

Or Search Party.  Or Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Or Seinfeld.  Or even Scream Queens.  

These are series where viewers see it once, and the funny lines and scenes are instantly memorable for life.  Where someone could ask you what's funny, and you could rattle off scenes, and characters, and situations... with ease.  

Every time I've asked a fan of the show for one example of something funny, they're stuck.  That's not the mark of a good comedy."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Well, I actually respect someone honestly saying that's why they're watching, unlike those claiming it's ""funny"".  Your objectification will be rewarded, I guess."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"The writer joked about her doing sex work the next season to pay for tuition, so that might happen.

I just hope they don't show the boobs of the two ugly token main characters."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I can see Leighton wanting to help, as she already did with the credit card thing at the fancy dinner. But I'm sure the writers will make it a lot more dramatic and have something go wrong, or some other calamity arise from that."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Ahh my 2nd biggest childhood celebrity crush.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Such is the nature of Reddit unfortunately.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"They're currently at a positive score. Instead of complaining about downvotes, people should ignore that ever changing vote count and let things fall where they do."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I mean I know they need to come up with some dues ex to keep her there, but I’m pretty sure she’s just going to end up getting some ridiculous scholarship or be fucked by student loans. Maybe she’ll join ROTC for a while. Maybe Whitney’s mom pulls some shit for her. The creators joked she was going to do sex work.

The least funny or even believe able plot would be the rich roommates just pay for her."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Sex work would be an interesting plot development. I’m not sure they were joking.

Girls und Panzer das Finale,Excited for this one. Was wondering how long they could realistically keep going on. The actress playing Claire is 35. Even for TV the ages are starting to get a bit ridiculous.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Watch Derry Girls if only for the soundtrack. It is a blast with so many memorable 90s songs. The show itself is pretty funny too.

Girls und Panzer das Finale,I love this show.  Hope they show the final season in Aus.

Girls und Panzer das Finale,Watching Season 3 right now. It's amazing!! I didn't think this should could get any better.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,It was good but that finale felt super rushed though.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"It was horrible. Like a caricature of their own show. 
Craaaazy overacting, lazy stories, primitive comedy. First two seasons were brilliant! But the third season almost ruined it all. 
Final episode was somewhat good though, so that saved it."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,and the wee donkey
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"There will be one eventually.  I find it very hard to be leave the writer can just ditch these characters, who are so fully realised, forever. There's a couple of open threads in the story as well."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Sweet suffering Jesus... 35?!?!
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Well it’s not, so now you can watch it"
Girls und Panzer das Finale,Don’t believe everything you’re told
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"Yeah one of the girls was staring in Bridgerton as well, so she was unfortunately absent for a lot of the season. Shame they couldn’t make the timings work."
Girls und Panzer das Finale,[deleted]
Girls und Panzer das Finale,That was some damn good TV.
Girls und Panzer das Finale,What? There are only two seasons for me. 12 episodes total. Is there a third season?
Girls und Panzer das Finale,"I'm watching ep1 of the 3rd season and I fully agree, it's like watching the new Thor movie in Derry, awful."
The Coroner,The third season will air on  CBC this winter according to the commercials I saw.
The Coroner,"Saw the first season. Suffers from feeling like a Canadian knockoff of American shows.  

She is a gorgeous woman. A bit ridiculous that she has an adult son."
The Coroner,Love it. This is one of those cases I wish there were more episodes. Considering we got it when it was done with both seasons already. So we could watch them back to back. Now we'll have to wait a bit. Same goes with Transplant & now Nurses.
The Coroner,I'm torn on it. I like the cast but the weekly stories seem really uneven. The weekly stuff just seems to solve itself without much actual work from the characters.
The Coroner,"Oh yeah, I stumbled onto this show just over a year ago, and have been hooked ever since.

I can't wait to see the third season."
The Coroner,Yay! Thank you--that made my day!
The Coroner,"That's an interesting observation. What American shows in particular are you thinking about?

Agreed, she is gorgeous. And young--I just looked her up, she was born in 1984. So she's 36. Her son just started college, I think, so he'd be 18 or 19. It's possible she had him when she was in her teens, but I don't remember them ever mentioning that in the story line. And now that you mention that, I'm surprised I never noticed it."
The Coroner,Transplant is good? I somehow missed the first few episodes and wondered if it was worth catching up on. I usually like doctor/hospital shows. I'll have to check out nurses top. Thanks for the suggestions!
The Coroner,"Feels like they're using the procedural structure as just a way to highlight how all the main characters have some sort of stability issues. (Granddad is senile, Mom has childhood issues and is borderline drug dependent now, Mom's boyfriend has PTSD, son can't seem to get his college shit together.) Those personal issues are my favorite part, so it doesn't bother me when the procedural stuff is treated as almost an afterthought."
The Coroner,I loved that the CW played season 2 right after season 1. But now I'm spoiled and don't want to have to wait for season 3.
The Coroner,No problem!
The Coroner,"There was a show called Crossing Jordan. And we all know about the CSIs.

But yeah. One character had to say she got pregnant at 19. Its feasible. But really they cast a young TV star but also wanted her to have a college aged son. They should've made her character older.  Forty, for instance."
The Coroner,"I think it is. Plus it has John Hannah in it, whom I love."
The Coroner,"Yeah I know exactly what you mean. Its the one downside of binge watching, afterwards the wait feels so much longer."
The Coroner,"Swan is 36, easily could have an 18yr old.  They did mention once how she was young when she had him."
The Coroner,[deleted]
The Coroner,...That is what this is a link to.
The Coroner,I was 2 years old when she became Queen. I’m sure the majority of the UK have only known her as their Queen. From a mechanic in WW2 to a Parachutist with James Bond she lived an extraordinary life.
The Coroner,She was great in naked gun
The Coroner,I do not understand the Churchill worship.
The Coroner,How can I escape this old hag
The Coroner,[removed]
The Coroner,Fucking finally
The Coroner,A remember a tv special a few years back that basically broke down how and why Jon Bennet Ramsey was killed by her brother.
The Coroner,To be canceled before airing
The Coroner,"Epstein on 60 minutes, R Kelly special on lifetime... bad weekend to be a rapist."
The Coroner,"RIP the producers, directors, staff, and host of 60 minutes. We never even saw their group suicide coming. Gone but not forgotten"
The Coroner,"Alright Reddit, **please stop** this bullshit narrative that with Epstein's death, we will never know what happened and who was involved.

At least two of his houses ([NYC](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-maria-farmer-says-his-house-under-constant-tv-surveillance/) and [the island](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7357357/Jeffrey-Epstein-surveillance-cameras-room-NYC-Little-St-James-properties.html)) were full of cameras (in bedrooms!), presumably for blackmail. Authorities have seized the computers, why is nobody asking about that? If there's a cover-up, *this is it*. The ""suicide"" is a distraction, and everybody seems to be falling for it. It's a dead end, and everybody's like ""well, now we will never know.""

Also, there are plenty of people who know what happened, and who was involved. They're called **the victims**, and they've been [talking](https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/how-many-jeffrey-epstein-victims-are-there.html) and [naming names](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/09/epstein-mar-a-lago-trump-1456221). We want names, don't we? Yet I never see them mentioned on Reddit.

You can talk about Epstein's death, of course it's suspicious. But don't let that be the *only* thing you talk about. Inform yourself. This is child abuse and rape, it's important. Don't let them get away with it."
The Coroner,"CBC is doing a show called “the prince and the pedophile” as well coming up here.... today I think actually. 

Looking forward to that as well."
The Coroner,That coroner is a pretty sketchy dude though and known for saying what he needs to if the money is right. He's been doing the job for a while so has experience but I wouldn't let his word be the final one. There's a bunch of weird shit around Epstein but it's possible he was suicided and it's also possible he was treated as a regular prisoner and suffered the same fate as a bunch of other regular prisoners. Still suspicious as hell
The Coroner,"My prediction:

Epstein bad

People around him bad

Prince Andrew gets talked about a lot, Clinton a little, many other bigwigs not mentioned at all

Will talk about how evidence shows it's a suicide

Will get accused of being part of the coverup to protect important people"
The Coroner,Not like it matters they dropped the whole case because the guy died just like with the other rapist except he is alive and his victims are dropping like flys
The Coroner,Hopefully they cover Maxine and why she is hiding in Israel.
The Coroner,"Fun fact, coroners can be just some dumb dumb with a job handed to them:


From NPR: 

Coroners can be elected or appointed. Some are also sheriffs or funeral home directors. But many coroners aren't doctors. There are also medical examiners, who usually are medical doctors but may not be forensic pathologists trained in death investigation.Feb 2, 2011"
The Coroner,(Carefully) Made for TV version after 6 months....  How sanitized is this going to be?  I’ll bet there’s no mention of Israel whatsoever.
The Coroner,They better fucking mention all the connections to our DOJ
The Coroner,"If they are going this far, I hope they at least toy with the idea that Epstein wasnt even in that prison and is still alive."
The Coroner,Welp this special isn't going to watch itself.
The Coroner,Crap..! I guess i missed it... Epstein didn't kill himself
The Coroner,"Lol, yeah that wont be biased at all. I'm sure they will dig real deep and mention all the political figures that were at kid rape island..."
The Coroner,"They aren’t going to say anything that we don’t already know.

And seeing as how it took those fuckers so long to do an episode on the guy, it’ll probably be sanitized so nobody gets murdered."
The Coroner,Let me save you the time. He didn't kill himself but no one knows what happened and nothing will ever come of the investigation.
The Coroner,I'd actually be more interested in seeing a documentary on how it would have been possible for Epstein to kill himself.
The Coroner,"I expect it to be a ""maybe possible we consider that he didn't kill himself"", and that will be that.  
I doubt they will bring anything really solid evidence for that way or the other. Most likely they will gather everything we know, add a bit more, and make a story out of it."
The Coroner,It doesn't matter if he killed himself or was killed; the fact remains that the information he had died with him.
The Coroner,"Link to trailer:


https://youtu.be/SWMP5j3M6GE"
The Coroner,"I'm guessing some good information, a little bs, and a few giant lies

With no other names or new useful information given,"
The Coroner,Spoiler : he didn't kill himself
The Coroner,Conclusion: both China and Russia may have been behind Epstein's mysterious death
The Coroner,It will be full of red herrings I guarantee it.  The truth about Epstein is that he provided children for the elite.  These networks never even went after Weinstein there is no chance we get an actual big network investigation into Epstein's child trafficking to the rich and powerful.
The Coroner,So many upcoming suicides...
The Coroner,Might be worth doing an analysis on how the [story](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/06/abc-news-leak-raises-questions-about-unaired-interview-with-epstein-accuser) was buried
The Coroner,Oh boy! Here comes the misinformation train!
The Coroner,[deleted]
The Coroner,"Wait, hold the phone—Are they saying Epstein DIDN’T kill himself!? /s"
The Coroner,"Axiom:


If a 60 Minutes news crew shows up looking to interview, decline."
The Coroner,"Yeah, I'm gonna say, it only half covers the story so that they can't be blamed for burying it. There is plenty of journalists already covering this story in depth. If you are ready to lose respect for 60 minutes. Look up Whitney Webb, and the work she has done, then watch the 60 minutes episode and pay attention to what they *don't* say."
The Coroner,Would be stunned if they really went for the truth.
The Coroner,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-jeffrey-epstein-cell-sunday-on-60-minutes/
The Coroner,I'll save you guys some time. They dont know what happened.
The Coroner,I watch 60minutes every week- 1 of my favorite shows- looking fwd to this
The Coroner,"“In your opinion, was there foul play?”

*cut to 60 minutes clock ticking*

I’m a sucker for TV promos"
The Coroner,Might be interesting to hear more cover up and spin
The Coroner,And shakira
The Coroner,I feel like someone is going to commit suicide before this airs.
The Coroner,This is out already??
The Coroner,SHUT IT DOWN.
The Coroner,going the oppiste way. the pork story was good and watching the rep lady get own by Barbra walters was nice.
The Coroner,"I used to be a huge 60 Minutes fan. That visual magazine just does such lousy reporting now. It is a shame too, the show tackles great stories and then butchers them."
The Coroner,Let me guess. Their going to tease about the questions surrounding his suicide but will end up saying the evidence is inconclusive and sticking with the suicide theory. Can't let the truth come out
The Coroner,"Lets see....

60 min gave youtube a giant Blowjob, Gave the NSA a Giant Blow job....

Really don't have a whole lot of confidence in their reporting."
The Coroner,SPOILER ALERT: Epstein didn't kill himself.
The Coroner,I'm sorry to hear that all of the 60 minutes staff has now all had different but simultaneous and terrible accidents.
The Coroner,"this is cool and all but it won't go anywhere,  seeing as whoever owns this particular media conglomerate is likely raping a child as we speak"
The Coroner,Why would consumers trust production from an entertainment source?
The Coroner,"Only the Bureau of Prisons, US Department of Justice, had access to him.  Only someone with power over DoJ could have murdered him."
The Coroner,60 minutes has rolled over for their corporate overlords for the past 15-20 years. Expect very little from this.
The Coroner,It will be fraught with lies I'm sure.
The Coroner,"[Authentic Image of Jeffrey Epstein, 2 Weeks Before his Death](https://m.imgur.com/t/frank_reynolds/CyV2ztc)"
The Coroner,"Who cares

All that really matters is who he was working for

Coincidentally there’s a front page news post about him and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell being Israeli intelligence assets

When the mass media tells us that he worked for Israel and that’s why he got away with crime for so long then I’ll care about some 60 Minutes report for naive Boomers to watch before they go to bed at 9."
The Coroner,"It still won’t be honest, there’s too much corruption in the US"
The Coroner,[deleted]
The Coroner,Waiting for the update post that says everyone from 60mins committed suicide
The Coroner,I'm surprised a mainstream media program is doing some honest to God reporting investigation for once.
The Coroner,Conclusion: Epstein didn't kill himself.
The Coroner,"Are they going to talk about how other coroner's disagree with that guy who said his neck wouldn't break like that? 

I don't care if he killed himself or not, that parts just a distraction. We ALREADY know who has been on the plane, get em instead of just saying ""EPISTEENY DIDNT KILL HIMSELF UWU"""
The Coroner,I'm sure this will be unbiased and accurate.
The Coroner,"“For our last five minutes, we are going to speak to a special guest.... you can come out now, Jeff”"
The Coroner,People will finally know that he didn’t kill himself.
The Coroner,"In other words...... 


Epstein didnt kill himself"
The Coroner,Steven Crowder already tried to recreate the dudes suicide and the results are just about what you expect lol
The Coroner,Isnt it funny how everyone assume everything is true about prince Andrew but the fact a credible witness accuses Donald trump (accused by 26 other women of sexual assault) is innocent? Reminder: Donald trump is a child rapist. The whole reason Epstein in the news is because of the very credible and corroborating testimony of the trump/Epstein accuser. Everything matches. This was before the 2016 election. It was played off as usual as a “Democrat hoax.” Also reminder that the prosecutor who gave that sweet deal to Epstein was appointed by trump. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/acosta-resigns-trump.html She dropped her lawsuit against trump after death threats. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YWnUzvlqpB0
The Coroner,60 minutes lost all relevancy by 1981
The Coroner,Don't hold your breath
The Coroner,So is this going to be an investigation or is it going to be CBS conspiracy fuel?
The Coroner,Up against the Golden Globes
The Coroner,Why dont they have the position that the body was in??? Who wouldn't record that.
The Coroner,The special on Epstein will be Epstein'd.
The Coroner,Can't wait to see how 60 minutes manages to suicide a tv show
The Coroner,This is only a monetization of corruption. No revelations will come about.
Brave New World,"I'm okay since S1 seemed to be complete. I would like to see more but I am glad they didn't end at a cliffhanger. Sure, some character lines were open ended but that is different from cliffhangers or teasing a huge twist for an S2 that never happens."
Brave New World,"Between this and Happy!, Grant Morrison's move to television really isn't working out too well.  Which sucks, because I really enjoyed both of these shows."
Brave New World,"Shame, I thought this was brilliant.  It left me feeling almost hollow and empty, it really made think. Is it better to be free or happy?

At least it ended in a way that tied most of it up. You sort of get an idea of where all the characters ended up"
Brave New World,"this is part of a growing attitude in today's content producers... if it isn't the number one show across all platforms....it's gone. no second place, no building an audience, no second chances. instant success or instant failure.

not everything can be ""the best"" ."
Brave New World,"Damn, definitely had its problems but I enjoyed it for what it was.

Getting real sick of 90% of streaming shows getting cancelled because they're not instant, mega hits."
Brave New World,Did they consider cancelling Peacock and keeping the show?
Brave New World,"Man, this show really just failed right at the end. The themes, motifs and character arcs right at the end made no sense and went out with a whimper. Was pretty disappointed in this show, so it makes sense it won't be given another season."
Brave New World,There’s a Brave New World TV Adaptation???? Brave New World? **THE** Brave New World???
Brave New World,That’s a shame. Poor Alden Erenreich can’t catch a break
Brave New World,More like Brave No World amirite
Brave New World,Who tf even has Peacock
Brave New World,"So Peacock have cancelled their only scripted original show already? Not a promising sign of things to come. I guess the only saving grace is the fact that whoever is in charge of Peacock likely did not want this show on the network to begin with. It was intended for SyFy originally before being moved to USA and then eventually booted to Peacock to pad the launch of the service. 

I think streamers are far to quick to pull the plug on their TV shows. I wonder if it is because they have the accurate data on how many people watched a show and how many lasted through to the very end of the show? I’ve never really trusted the Neilson data and now that streaming provides accurate data to the likes of NBCU perhaps they are being shocked by what they are seeing in the data!"
Brave New World,"I read BNW years ago and really enjoyed it but - no matter how hard I try - I cannot see how it would make a good TV series. Thus, without ever having watched it, I'm not surprised it's cancelled."
Brave New World,i loved it so much this is very sad for me :(
Brave New World,"Peacock is such trash honestly. Immediately cancel their one show, ads ***for fucking Peacock*** every five minutes even when you’re literally paying for their highest no commercials tier, there’s like barely any content. This cancelation doesn’t bode well for the *one* thing they’ve got coming that anyone will be excited about too; Battlestar Galactica. Why would I even waste my time if it’ll probably get canceled after a season?"
Brave New World,I actually loved this show and thought it was a terrific adaptation. It touched on all the elements of the book that I thought worked and reworked or ditched the ones that didn't. It expanded and added on it in ways I thought were pretty interesting and I was really looking forward to see where they were going with it. This sucks. I feel like almost every show I like lately has been cancelled.
Brave New World,Damn I didn’t even know they made it. There marketing team should be canned. All they do is spam my email saying they exist never saying what they have on offer.
Brave New World,"TIL there was a season of Brave New World on Peacock. Considering NBC/Comcast's marketing budget for Peacock, can't believe I didn't see this...But with that being said, can Peacock get cancelled already, or do we have to wait five years for all these shows to come to Hulu?"
Brave New World,"They kind of zipped through the entire plot of the book in the first half and kept a lingering Lenina plot line going. I enjoyed the first few episodes but after that it switched to ""everyone put your contacts in"" and ""this unseeable yet anthropomorphic algorithm controls us"", and I feel like in the book, that wasn't necessary because the society was so perfectly conditioned. I prefer the book to the super computer, secret society thing."
Brave New World,[deleted]
Brave New World,Cowards.
Brave New World,"I got through two episodes before I gave up on it. It's so dry and so boring. And I was fascinated by the source material when I read it. 

It won't be missed by me, that's for sure."
Brave New World,"I don't understand how you could do a series of Brave New World tbh. It should have been a mini series instead they wanted to milk it, which is ironic because Brave New World is literally /hailcorporate."
Brave New World,I didn’t expect a second season at the end. It was open ended a little yes but they’d told the story of Brave New World. Personally I think it’s the best adaptation yet.
Brave New World,"I never even heard about this until now. And seeing that screenshot made me go ""It can't be *that* book.""

Learning that it is seems even more surprising. That picture does not embody what I imagine that book translating into."
Brave New World,"Did not even know this had been made into a show, so I can't say I'm surprised it didn't get renewed."
Brave New World,"I haven't even gotten around to watching this yet. As long as they completed the storyline of the book, that may be enough. *The Handmaid's Tale* completed the storyline based on the book in one season, and the second season didn't interest me as much as the first. However, *The Man in the High Castle* did a great job of extending the story beyond the book. Without seeing the series yet, there is no telling which way a second season would have gone."
Brave New World,Didn't an exec of Peacock say they have shows people actually want to watch compared to Quibi?
Brave New World,Can a network show actually do this justice?
Brave New World,"I thought it was a bit of a wasted opportunity to flesh out some of the characters. 

Instead of making Bernard a jealous loser, they should have humanized him as someone genetically inferior (due to tampering at birth) forced to work at the same level as his superiors as an experiment (as elaborated on in the 1980's BBC version).

I felt they made Lenina too perfect, her character wasn't great in the original material, but they went too far the other way.

I'm not sure where they were going with the AI and revolution, in the original the lowest levels were mentally subnormal and wouldn't be able to understand the concept of rebellion."
Brave New World,Well hopefully it gets picked up elsewhere. One of the few new shows that was slightly interesting.
Brave New World,"Peacock is trash. I tried watching BSG on it, and it kept buffering then freezing. Such horrible software."
Brave New World,Wasn't Breaking Bad in danger of being canned after the second season?
Brave New World,"picked up peacock streaming service because of harry potter series on it then i saw brave new world, watch episode, then they wanted me to pay, no thanks"
Brave New World,"Like somebody else said, they wanted this to be a flagship. They sunk $100M into the first season, which is significantly more expensive than most shows. 

The cheaper the show is to produce, the more likely it gets additional seasons. That’s the great thing about streaming, you are not constrained to a certain number of time slots & primetime, you can make as many different shows as you have the money and demand to justify."
Brave New World,That series felt like someone was looking for a reason to show lots of naked people.  We get it they have orgies.
Brave New World,They haven’t canceled the show yet. Peacock decided to not go forward with season 2. Amblin is shopping it to other networks. It was never a peacock original. It was originally going to be on USA network.
Brave New World,"As long as it ended well

I haven’t watched the show yet, because I want to read the book first. I got a couple new copies for $3.50 each 

It may be a while though"
Brave New World,That's a shame. The end definitely felt like they left it open for a second season.
Brave New World,What an interesting cover photo.  I wonder why they chose it?
Brave New World,"I really liked it, but as others pointed out it didn't really need a second season."
Brave New World,I had no idea this even existed. Where can I stream it? One of my favorite books!
Brave New World,Did this have anything to do with Huxley’s Brave New World? Judging by the image here I don’t think it was
Brave New World,"I just read the book and I didn't even know this existed.

So apparently their marketing was shit. Could explain why it's been cancelled."
Brave New World,That Alden Ehrenreich guy can't catch a break.
Brave New World,"I thought it was kind of bad, but at the same time I'm sad to see it cancelled. I'm a big fan of the source material and science fiction in general. A lot of shows take time to grow into themselves, as it were, and I would have liked to see them continue to try to improve."
Brave New World,"that's a shame, I thought this show was really good"
Brave New World,"Wait, bikini girl, nice."
Brave New World,Who's the chick? Asking for a friend...
Brave New World,I’m surprised they didn’t wait out a bit before announcing the cancellation considering this was a flagship show.
Brave New World,"Whilst it set up things to potentially explore in subsequent seasons, it works pretty well as a self contained season. 
ending diverges from the book but all and all it follows similar beats"
Brave New World,is there any way to communicate to the production company my sadness and that i hope the find another home for it?
Brave New World,"Not only did I not know this show existed, I watch Peacock somewhat regularly since I can't get NBC and never once saw it recommended it anything. This still looks cheesy. Was it any good?"
Brave New World,"The really wish they’d change the damn name of that streaming service. I mean like, seriously."
Brave New World,"I didn't even know this was already out. Of course not having a fire TV app makes it kind of hard for me to watch their shows without jumping through extra hoops that I had no reason to jump through because I didn't know that this was out.

NBC dropped the ball on this one. I'm here on this subreddit a few times a week and I didn't know that this was out. The fact that they canceled it so soon makes me hesitant to try any of their shows if they will be canceled this quickly."
Brave New World,Could be the advertising. This is the first time I'm hearing about this show and I definitely would have been interested in it.
Brave New World,dang
Brave New World,I found this series to be very cheap and bad
Brave New World,Cancel PeaCOCK
Brave New World,"I guess just too expensive, and not enough viewers.

Anyway, I liked it at least."
Brave New World,"Fun show, but really doesn't need a second season."
Brave New World,I didn’t even know that this was made into a tv show. Loved the book when I read it years ago.
Brave New World,Jesus. Why would they cancel it? Surely they need their library built up?
Brave New World,"It was a heap of fun but it was fairly obvious, and not in a terribly exciting way, where s2 would have gone.

&#x200B;

Im kinda glad, I like Alden too much to see him get stuck in TV Land unless its something major and this felt...small."
Brave New World,Damn I loved it
Brave New World,What scene from the book is that picture from? I've read the book several times and don't recall it.
Brave New World,Another casualty of the fucking awful drive to make everything subscriptions these days. Haven't used any of these services in years.
Brave New World,Honestly it hasn’t had enough time to find an audience. I have it marked for watching and will get there at some point.
Brave New World,Cool? I guess? Didn’t even know this show existed or what it’s about
Brave New World,"I was hoping I misread that as ""Peacock Canceled After One Season"""
Brave New World,Yawn.
Brave New World,NOOOO
Brave New World,"This show was fabulous, the characters are well acted. I'm devastated. Why would Peacock market it so poorly and then immediately cancel when it's not received? You have to advertise shows..."
Brave New World,"Tbh I liked it, could have been better but it was still enjoyable"
Brave New World,Did they finish the story?
Brave New World,"sad news

not the best, not the worst show

but still fun to watch"
Brave New World,I really wanted to like this show and understand that other people do. But I just couldn’t get into it. There was just something incomplete about it that I can’t put my finger on. There’s something missing.
Brave New World,Makes sense really.  Why spebd money making this show when the news is basically the same thing?
Brave New World,"I really enjoyed it. Would have loved to see S2.  Also I know a lot of people just now finding out about it.  

Netflix showed somewhere that the most views a S1 of a show ever gets is not when it debuts, but right before S2. 

Guess they’ll never know."
Brave New World,Good. That series completely ruined the original book.
Brave New World,what the fuck is peacock? there's too many streaming services
Brave New World,The very reason I didn’t sign up for peacock. Totally in character with NBC.
Brave New World,Just throwing my hat in to say NBC had the best possible show for Peacock back in 2009. It was called Kings. it was promoted  with the grace of a drunk gorilla and canceled after 1 season despite being honestly one of the best shows I've ever seen.
Brave New World,I watched the first episode.  I really wanted to like it.  And I did like some parts of it.  I'll probably pick it up again sometime... but I will say that I didn't like any of the storyline in America.
Brave New World,"Are there multiple books for 'Brave New World'?  Altered Carbon was different books and had some overlap or nostalgia from the previous book.  The series was cancelled after season 2 since the second season was a bit confusing at the start, quickly introduced new plots, and didn't slide into the season as the first season did.  Season 3 probably would have been the same as season 2."
Brave New World,Book was great! Only weird thing was kids being encouraged to have sex with each other in elementary school. I really hope they left that part out of the show.
Brave New World,Wow - I actually thought this would get picked up. I liked it a lot
Brave New World,"That's a shame.  I really enjoyed this show, and would love to see more."
Brave New World,That looked like Antonio Brown in the back for a sec ha
Brave New World,Never heard of either.
Brave New World,The only Peacock original I liked.
Brave New World,Needed more orgies.
Brave New World,Hey studios- we don't need more streaming services.
Brave New World,It’s so odd with streaming companies. They show was interesting and could have expanded on the world. Seems like if they made it 3 seasons to create a full series it would make more money in the long run
Brave New World,I had no idea this series existed. Now I am sad.
Brave New World,Oh wow. I didn't even know this existed. Dug the book when I read it as a teen. Will have to check this out.
Brave New World,"Stop wasting good show on streaming platforms that won't take off, that boat has left. We have enough streaming platforms, just create content."
Brave New World,First I heard of it - is it worth checking out?
Brave New World,Hope Grant Morrison gets work on a New show. Seems like he’s moved on from superheroes.
Brave New World,First time I’ve heard of this
Years and Years,"It is an amazing mix of dystopian sci-fi, family drama and political thriller.

Years and Years feels like a 6-hour long episode of Black Mirror, but it is even better than Black Mirror imo.

9.5/10"
Years and Years,I love that scene where the matriarch of the family tells everyone that it was there fault about what is happening.  It was a great scene and really enjoyed that show!
Years and Years,"I usually like Russell's shows, Cucumber was good. 

Years and Years missed the mark for me. Just felt like he was out of his depth on most of the topics he tried to cover, every take felt half baked and cheesy.

Charlie Brooker touched on similar subjects with Black Mirror and does a much better job."
Years and Years,"Amazing show, and uncomfortably real because they took the events just just far enough that they were the worst case scenario's but still believable."
Years and Years,"I don't know, the subject is obviously very interesting and relevant but I felt like the writers were completely out of their depth. Outside of a few very poignant scenes, it felt very cheesy and incoherent."
Years and Years,It was absolutely a cheesy black mirror with a truly crap ending
Years and Years,Isn’t there a pandemic in the show as well?
Years and Years,This show is amazing and what happened today made me want to watch it for a third time.
Years and Years,If you haven't seen it It's a Sin is amazing.
Years and Years,"Agreed. I think the pilot is genuinely incredible, and if watched as a standalone piece - it's a gut-churning work of speculative fiction.

The problem is that immediately afterward, RTD showed he didn't know where to take it from there. His attempts at trans allegories are absolutely buffoonish, the economic predictions are detached from reality, and huge ideas get tossed into the air with no attempt at payoff. It's a show that just goes for the darkest choice at every turn, right up until the end - when suddenly it all comes around. Very frustrating experience."
Years and Years,"I´d say Years and Years had more of a connection to Children of Men, than Black Mirror."
Years and Years,"I agree. I think RTD has a unique voice and I love Queer as Folk and It's a Sin, but Years and Years seemed a bit on the nose. The family were well written but the storyline was bobbins."
Years and Years,yes toward the end. they were sending them to the camps
Years and Years,Yeah it's a sin was lovely. I didn't like years and years either. It's just a very boring show with a lot of ham fisted commentary and a really weak ending.
Years and Years,"Years and Years was so fantastic, it was like what if Black Mirror was a mini series rather than episodical anthology."
Years and Years,Kind of mad to think that someone with a hit rate like his would find it difficult to have a series picked up.
Years and Years,"Really went downhill towards the end though, it had the potential to be one of my fav shows but I felt last two eps dropped the ball hard"
Years and Years,"Hit shows, but quite niche for the UK audience. Especially, when compared to the top viewed shows."
Years and Years,That is the classic Russell T Davies Way. Glad It’s a sin didn’t go that way
Years and Years,This show was fantastic for me right up until the end. I won’t give spoilers but I thought the climactic ending was super schmaltzy to the point of ridiculousness. Super let down after nothing but darkly funny and biting satire leading up to it
Years and Years,HBO required.
Years and Years,Man. I've been trying to convince people of this for ages. Such. A. Great. Show.
Years and Years,"Other shows similar to Black Mirror: Electric Dreams (Prime) & Tales from the Loop (Prime). 

Electric Dream episodes are stand alone. Loop episodes are mostly stand alone, but all take place in the same town and there is some crossover."
Years and Years,"It's a good premise that puts itself in a corner - it aptly diagnoses a bunch of diseases of the present day (as indeed all speculative fiction does) but then it has no better idea what the cure is than any of the rest of us do these days.

It's a betrayal of its own premise of widespread cynicism and fake news that the answer to and reversal of the degradation of society is just getting some real news out there and public outrage does the rest, magically. There's a reason the show rushes through that denouement - it's actually impossible for it to work that way in the world as they've set it up."
Years and Years,"I enjoyed watching it, but the final two or so episodes were not quite as good as the start. Some of the future-y stuff is a bit ridiculous, and the way some problems are solved in the end seem a bit fantastical considering the bleak nature of the early part of the series. I still recommend watching it."
Years and Years,Great soundtrack
Years and Years,Rapidly noting down
Years and Years,Mostly good to very good but the ending is very hokey.
Years and Years,"So I watched the whole thing over the last two days. And without spoiler, I'd say if you like The Host, the Korea movie about a quirky family facing a monster crises, you would love this show. Because it is really about a family vs the future."
Years and Years,"Loved this show. Its take on immigration, tech, government, and loss of rights was very intriguing. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_and_Years_(TV_series)"
Years and Years,"I loved this show, but thank god the ""Donald Trump elected to second term"" didn't happen!"
Years and Years,Does anybody know if they'll make more of this show or was it a one-off?
Years and Years,Highly recommended but heartbreaking
Years and Years,"""Years and years"" was too close to reality for me..."
Years and Years,"My main problem with Years and Years was that pretty much every character sucked. Loved the story, music, everything else. But I hated pretty much every character. And I'm sure someone will reply saying ""Well just like real life people have good parts and bad parts"", but no. Celeste had no positive qualities. Her husband had no positive qualities, same with the grandmother."
Years and Years,"I have a love, hate relationship with Black Mirror, we're not talking right now, but maybe I'll give her a chance again sometime.

Maybe I'll give yours a chance, but if I see any pig fucking, I'm done."
Years and Years,Soulmates was good in my opinion.
Years and Years,Anyone see naughts and crosses?
Years and Years,Lol your username is so apt for this show
Years and Years,Here's the link on [Crave](https://www.crave.ca/en/tv-shows/years-and-years) if any other Canadian wants to give it a watch!
Years and Years,"Love death and robots is a good animated series. Similar anthology episodes like black mirror and a good mix of vibes ; some nice/heartwarming , some cheesy, others are more dark /fucked up."
Years and Years,I loved this show.
Years and Years,One of my favorite first episodes of any series. And it just gets worse from there :(
Years and Years,Loved this
Years and Years,Metacritic score is 78. The show is very good indeed.
Years and Years,It was pretty good.  It definitely goes places.
Years and Years,Awesome show! I wish it had more than six episodes!
Years and Years,"\#\*#\*#\*#\*#\*#\*#\*# SPOILER ALERT, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET #\*#\*#\*#\*#\*#\*

Honestly, I think this is one of the best series I've seen in a while.  The characters develop over time, the series jumps through several years without feeling disjointed, events seem somewhat realistic considering current events, the technology is somewhat imaginative, the scene with Muriel when she accuses everyone for being responsible for the state of the world kind of hit me hard, the sex scene with Daniel and Viktor was hot, the cautionary tale theme seems awfully relevant.  The only thing I didn't like was that Daniel's first husband didn't get his comeuppance in the end for ratting out Viktor and causing Daniel to drown.  Really, thoroughly, enjoyed and binge watched."
Years and Years,MAN it feels like propaganda. after reading this i went and watch the first two.
Years and Years,"Completely agree. I still recommend it, especially for how much of a punch the first half of the season is. But it didn't stick the landing at all."
Years and Years,"Yeah ending was show-destroyingly bad, what a shame"
Years and Years,Direct HBO link: https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXN7h3A1UBMIpYAEAAAPE
Years and Years,"It really was.  I don't get the Black Mirror comparisons personally, aside from touching on some similar themes, but I still think it's worth a watch.  I've heard Inside No. 9 is a good, Black Mirror-like show, I haven't watched it myself though."
Years and Years,"Add ""Love Death and Robots"" to your list."
Years and Years,"Both of these were excellent, Loop really surprised me with its depth."
Years and Years,"That's pretty standard RTD content, mind, for better and for worse. If you're aware of what kind of writer he is, then going in to expect something along those lines shouldn't leave you too surprised."
Years and Years,"I don't think the ending is meant to be understood as some sort of a happily ever after, as in, ""it's over for good and it's never gonna happen again""."
Years and Years,Not so much if you’re in the UK...
Years and Years,Its*
Years and Years,Whoa. A horror genre show. Interesting.
Years and Years,"I was starting to think 'wow it got the future totally wrong, things are looking up' then the capitol riots happened."
Years and Years,They won't.
Years and Years,"Eh, they were all very flawed, but apart from maybe Rory Kinnear's character I tended to empathise with most of them. I actually liked Celeste (though like everyone else she had her flaws)."
Years and Years,"I knew that was coming and zapped accordingly. It had a nice run of eps, then got tedious. Anthology is hard."
Years and Years,Electric Dreams was atrocious
Years and Years,Agreed.  It felt very amateurish.
Years and Years,Was literally just thinking about this show today.  Fantastic limited series.
Years and Years,I remember watching this thinking it was a bit over the top. Turns out if anything it was understated.
Years and Years,"Putting the responsibility on individuals instead of corporations is a tactic that BP uses to avoid responsibility as the 6th largest polluter in the world. ""Calculate your carbon footprint and look away from the damage we've done. Please don't tax us""

Hard pass on this bullshit."
Years and Years,"If I boycotted everything I thought was wrong in the world I don't think I could survive. 

I don't mind the sentiment here, but there is an established system in place and powerful people making decisions that people simply don't get a choice over."
Years and Years,"""Don't but into the system. Don't buy that product."" Yeah, okay. There's no other system to choose from so I guess I'm homeless and starving now? lol."
Years and Years,"Fuck this upper-class fake-woke bullshit.  Checking out someone's groceries is dumb labor.  And with technology what it is, you the customer don't need someone to hold your hand for it.  Being upset on behalf of the workers is like being upset over live circus bans because then the tigers won't have jobs."
Years and Years,First 4 episodes of this was some of the best tv I have ever seen. The ending broke all the rules it had established and didn't seem interested in giving any answers to the questions it presented though.
Years and Years,"That it was (granted some of the choices were a bit on the nose, and the ending stretched believability) still I'm hoping that with the coming future will be remembered a quaint possible dystopia, rather than an optimistic speculation."
Years and Years,"I think it's still over the top. It's written from the perspective of a well-off person trying to make other well-off people feel good by acknowledging there's a problem and that they should have done something. It doesn't help anything, but acknowledging it makes them feel like they're in solidarity with the less fortunate and feel better about themselves. I personally think it still paints the workers as being below them, as in if the underpaid cashier clerk still had their jobs then all would be well again and the status quo of severe wealth inequality is back to normal."
Years and Years,"To a degree though it is on us to hold the corporations accountable, and we aren’t doing that when we buy into their shit."
Years and Years,We all have voting rights.
Years and Years,"I agree the groceries thing is a dumb argument, but the sentiment in general is still relevant."
Years and Years,"It's a TV show, it's not an elected politician. And sometimes, making people acknowledge something has positive results."
Years and Years,"The issue is you might care, but others don't. And there's nothing you can do about that, which is why this whole concept of personal responsibility is BS. Because it's not enough and pretending like it is is just a giant grift.

It's the same as putting the responsibility of controlling the pandemic on individuals rather than government or corporations. You can be a good, responsible citizen and wear your mask and practice social distancing. But there will always be a bunch of assholes that refuse to do that. And if nothing is done about them (say, by government imposing movement restrictions and lockdowns, or by corporations refusing their services to those people), the virus will continue to spread."
Years and Years,"Oh, sweet summer child."
Years and Years,"...and I do use them, but often the choice I am presented with is voting for the lesser of two evils with no real change as an option. 

Money in politics and immoral media owned by people who benefit from this system prevent any sense of an effective representative democracy."
Years and Years,What happened in 2016 is that most people voted against Trump and then he became President anyway.
Years and Years,"My vote's never counted, I've never won an election, and things have got progressively more shit."
Years and Years,">It's a TV show, it's not an elected politician.

How does that make sense? This thread exists specifically because at least one person considers this clip from that ""tv show"" an accurate commentary of our current society. It wouldn't have otherwise been posted. Yet when I criticize it for having that intent, it suddenly becomes just ""a TV show, not politics""? Seems to me like a double standard.

Your comment also is hilarious because in your first sentence you're saying it's just a tv show don't take it seriously, and then in your second sentence you're validating it as a legitimate message, which is oxymoronic.

And to clarify, I didn't consider my comment as being meant for a politician. My comment is targeting the writers of this show. They project their own anxiety into their writing and it shows because they're well-off people writing well-off characters from a warped, well-off perspective."
Years and Years,"It would be enough if the majority took responsibility, just like it is an absolutely necessity for individuals to be responsible in the fight against covid.

It’s not one or the other, we need appropriate government and corporate action *and* individual accountability, especially in the form of voting and spending your money in the right places."
Years and Years,"Yea agreed, many political systems are broken by having only two major parties.

The entire US political system seems like it needs a reform, although admittedly I don’t know heaps about it."
Years and Years,"I hear ya.  To think that just two years ago, I was so pumped to vote in a mid-term election.  But now, even with everything going on, I'm feeling so defeated when it comes to electoral politics, like what's the point of it all?  I was behind a candidate that I'd have been so ecstatic to vote for in the general, but we got Biden.  I know I'm not alone, in a recent poll, close to 60 percent of people said that they were voting for Biden just to get rid of Trump.  

Anyway, sorry to go off on that somewhat unrelated tangent.  I really enjoyed Years and Years, it was very well done."
Years and Years,"Elected politicians don't have the monopoly over politics. It's hard to make a point when if you twist everything I say. There's absolutely nothing oxymoronic about sending a message and what said above. 

The series shows how both hate and passiveness allows hungry politicians to push the limits further and further. 

You don't have to attack the writers and undermine their story and their project because they are well off. This is such a stupid take on the tv show. Nobody who actually watched would even consider what you say. It's not a documentary, it's fiction and it takes liberties"
Years and Years,The country this is set in has more than two political parties.
Years and Years,"What did I twist? You said two sentences where the second one directly contradicts the first.

And speaking of twisting words, in no way am I attacking the writers. I'm simply stating their mindset. It is a statement of fact that the writing in this clip is a reflection of their own personal experience and perspective. That's not an attack. Because I consider their perspective to be a misrepresentation of reality does not constitute me as an aggressor or attacker, nor does it make them victims.

Again, this entire thread and clip was only posted because people consider it ""TRUUUUUE"". How do you consider that as not being equally as bad as me considering it false? How do you not understand the double standard here?"
Years and Years,Keyword being *major*.
Years and Years,"How many countries have more than 2 major parties? Japan has like 15 parties and only 2 are relevant at any given time (and mostly only 1).

Voting against the bad guy seems to be a feature of most democracy."
Years and Years,"The problem is often not the number of parties, but the voting system.

Eg. In NZ we use MMP, which is a proportional system, and doesn’t just give all power to whomever gets the most votes.

Eg. If Green party gets 10% then they will have 10% of all seats in parliament.

Tis system allows for smaller parties to have a fairer influence in government.

But I still think there is an issue around still only having two major parties. Meaning that either one of them is bound to be leading government, perhaps just alongside another party."
Years and Years,"I really enjoyed it. This was RTD at his purest, writing a family drama about exploring their humanity. The evolving technology and changing political landscape is simply the backdrop as we see how these particular people react and change. People probably know his Doctor Who best, so I’d liken it to the dark timeline of Turn Left if the aliens are stripped away. So it can be dark and depressing. 

Loved the cast. In particular it made me happy to see Anne Reid and Jessica Hynes given these great leading roles. Pegg, Frost and Wright blew up after Spaced but she didn’t and that’s a great shame, she was crucial to that show succeeding. Anne Reid is a great presence, she was fantastic in the Doctor Who episode she was a villain in."
Years and Years,"didn't expect to cry at the end but i did. ugh, what a rollercoaster of emotions this show was. very relevant to present day."
Years and Years,"Overall, I quite liked it and it helped that there was a number of incredibly strong performers on the cast to make the clunker moments work as well as they did.  Felt like it was very much a standard RTD piece of work, with moments of brilliance, cheese, hand-waving, and exposition.

RTD always knocks it out of the park during quieter character moments which really delivered in Years and Years.  It'll probably get more comparisons to Dark Mirror, which I feel is slightly unfair since Y&Y has more slightly soapy aspects of it and other than a few superficial similarities they are very different animals. 

Read an interview before the first episode where RTD stated he'd been planning the show for a number of years.  After watching it, I believe him.  Anyone familiar with his work on Doctor Who and has seen Turn Left will probably recognise a number of themes that get expanded on.

It's worth a watch, but probably best enjoyed with no expectations."
Years and Years,"Just seen the final episode, truly a phenomenal series. I urge anyone and everyone to give this a watch. It's just gripping the entire way through and you can never be sure you've figured it out, as plot twist after plot twist just drops onto you and the season concludes itself wonderfully.

This is a must-watch and one of the best shows I've seen in years (and years)."
Years and Years,Senors change in voice at the end is significant yeah?
Years and Years,Thanks I’ll check it out.
The New Pope,This and the Young pope are so fucking good.
The New Pope,Sorrentino & Bigazzi are the best team.
The New Pope,Is this still a going enterprise?
The New Pope,I loved The Young Pope but couldn't get into this one at all.... quit halfway through. maybe it's time to try again
The New Pope,"I loved The Young Pope, liked The New Pope - these title credits are hall-of-fame worthy though."
The New Pope,I thought for a second they announced a new season or something and you had me so excited. I’d be so down for a season of Voiello as “The Old Pope”.
The New Pope,"The title and credit sequences of that series were extraordinary. Just super compelling. 

Up there with Peacemaker"
The New Pope,Thought this was a trailer for a new season.  Sad now.
The New Pope,"Amen.  They were both good, but The Young Pope was *sooo* good."
The New Pope,"I loved The Young Pope, but to my surprise I mostly just found The New Pope a bit boring. I watched till the end, but it wasn't the same. It was okay, I guess."
The New Pope,"Too European for most redditors. But it's an amazing show, the best, most interesting and most cinematic of the last years."
The New Pope,"No, The Young Pope was a lot better.

The was a parody in comparison."
The New Pope,"Both this and the young pope before it were limited series.  I swore I heard somewhere that the creators intended for the story to be a trilogy of series but I can’t remember where I found that and I can’t find a good source to speak to that so, in short, maybe?"
The New Pope,"The last two or three episodes are much better and I felt like they made up for the previous episodes, but it still wasn't as good as the first season."
The New Pope,"Same. Malkovich’s character wasn’t nearly as compelling as Law, so the season mostly felt like it didn’t really get good until the latter was fully back.

Edit: Felt like it was sorely missing Diane Keaton and James Cromwell’s characters, too."
The New Pope,I felt like nothing really happened in the New Pope. Plus Jude Law was so incredible in Young Pope it was hard to compete.
The New Pope,">Too European for most redditors.

*Not American enough for most redditors."
The New Pope,[deleted]
The New Pope,"Sorrentino has said he has an idea for a third season, but from what I know it was not initially intended as a three season show."
The New Pope,Not weird. Season 2 was awful.
The New Pope,"The first season was still my favourite. Not for the dialogue or the story but just the feel and the aesthetics and the soundtrack 

It made you feel something"
The New Pope,I would not be against The Next Pope.
The New Pope,Soundtrack is unmatched
The New Pope,"This show absolutely blew my mind. 

It reminded me (taught me, actually) the extent to which cinema can be a pure art form.

Edit: I meant the Young Pope. 

The New Pope was still great, but the Young Pope was unparalleled, IMO"
The New Pope,Sorrentino is a god
The New Pope,"I felt The New Pope (TNP) was such a letdown after The Young Pope (TYP).

The first season (TYP) was this quirky drama, with a strong central performance from Jude Law and elements of dark subversive humour. Ultimately it felt like quite a sophisticated character study.

Then the second season (TNP) was just a bizarre comedy that felt overly salacious. All the characters, who felt balanced and grounded in reality in the first season, became exaggerated comedic versions of themselves. It seemed that everything was played for cheap laughs.

I really disliked TNP and was surprised more fans didn't feel letdown by it."
The New Pope,Most underrated show of all time.
The New Pope,"I started watching it, got to episode 3 I think, and then forgot about it. I think one of the reasons I never got around to finishing is because I could never pin what it was about. With the Young Pope, I could figure it out. Could you help me get a better sense of how it was different from the Young Pope?"
The New Pope,"I liked The Young Pope way more, but The New Pope is still very good.  And those opening credits with “Good Time Girl” are iconic."
The New Pope,"I'm three episodes in, and wow, it is incredible. Voiello is my my favourite! I think I'm liking The New Pope even more than The Young Pope, which is quite shocking to me, because honestly, I could watch Jude Law read a phone book - I love his acting so much. I think both TYP and TNP are fabulous!"
The New Pope,"Sorrentino is just an awesome writer/director, I highly recommend people watch his new movie ""The Hand of God"" on Netflix.

It's a really unique and intimate movie about his life."
The New Pope,Eh.  I liked the Young Pope better.  I freaking love the opening videos to the New Pope though.
The New Pope,"I'm not sure if I watched the new pope, or the young pope, whichever one it was Jude law became acting Pope while the other Pope was in a coma. If that's the one you're talking about, it was absolutely awesome."
The New Pope,I still listen to Levo by Recondite sometimes.
The New Pope,"Oh man, the vibe it gives, the music, the scenery, the costumes, the acting, the writing. Everything is perfect. It was so unique and different from all the TV shows that was released that year."
The New Pope,I was always intrigued by the ads but never knew what it was about or what o was heading into so I never committed to it.
The New Pope,"From what I gathered at the time, Sorrentino had it in the pipeline. Don’t know if it’s still happening, but there were plans for it."
The New Pope,"The payoff is too satisfying to outright hate it in any light you look at it. Yes, it’s not the perfect work of art TYP is, but it’s a great follow up and the ending is way too emotional and wonderful to hate it."
The New Pope,"I was. I was expecting more Jude Law. Then I tied to get into the show, but yeah, the tone and feel was just off."
The New Pope,Couldn’t disagree more.
The New Pope,"I actually felt the complete opposite. I thought The New Pope had a much clearer and well defined storyline/narrative arc. I thought the Young Pope had a cool vibe, but The New Pope had a better story (actually I think it had a cooler “vibe” too). Definitely worth watching all the way through, the more I watched the more I wanted to see what happened next."
The New Pope,Both have Jude Law. The Young Pope came first. The New Pope is continuation of The Young Pope.
The New Pope,Amazing piece of music.  Especially loved it’s use when Lenny is threatening the Italian Prime Minister over the election.
The New Pope,"I guess what I'm trying to ask is what is the story in the New Pope exactly? I feel like if I have a grounding with that, then I'll have a better lens to watch it with since I'll need to restart it. Does that make sense? With the Young Pope, I could tell it was about a Pope that the Cardinals had an issue with. The pope was also an atheist so I was watching it to see what would happen with that plot thread. Along the way, we got some background on the young pope's history."
The New Pope,"The Young Pope was an offbeat modern story depiction of the Catholic hierarchy and its struggle with modernity.  I didn't see the New Pope as providing any great insights, and it bugs me a little that the previous Pope just comes to life, or the point of making Esther(?) a terrorist."
The New Pope,Which one do you think was better?
The New Pope,[This](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt7157248/plotsummary#summary-ps4976653) is a good minor spoilers summary I found on IMDB
The New Pope,"I would say The Young Pope, but I liked The New Pope too."
The New Pope,Thanks!
The New Pope,"Just FYi, Paolo Sorrentino (the showrunner/director of *The Young Pope/The New Pope)*'s latest feature film, [*The Hand of God*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_1VW_0i6vo)*,* is up on Netflix, along with an 8-minute BtS. I'd also recommend [*Youth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxwqrRmRbYk) if you can find it."
The New Pope,"every scene was worth it just for the framing. And cardinal Voiello was the best, his funeral speech for the poor Gerolamo moved me to tears"
The New Pope,I liked their intros.
The New Pope,sorrentino is a genius
The New Pope,"Yea The Young Pope is really good. It's really unlike anything else. The style, music, and themes really hooked me. I did enjoy the New Pope as well but not as much. Remember hearing something about it being planned as a three-season series but not sure if a third season will ever happen."
The New Pope,January 13th.
The New Pope,"The Young Pope was absolutely outstanding and one of the weirdest, best pieces of TV I have ever seen."
The New Pope,[deleted]
The New Pope,Sick beat
The New Pope,Is this a continuation of the series with Jude Law as the pope or a spin off or what?
The New Pope,I'm so glad they're continuing this batshit-crazy nonsense.  I loved the first series.
The New Pope,HBO has been on fire this year and will be on fire next year too
The New Pope,"Always been bit intrigued by this but I've never seen it, can someone who has seen it give me overview whether it is worth it?"
The New Pope,"Man I can't wait for this show. I enjoyed the first season WAY more than I thought I would, and this looks even better."
The New Pope,the tracksuit is back!
The New Pope,Any idea about the trailer soundtrack?
The New Pope,I am not a religious as all despite being raised Roman Catholic. My brother is very religious and yet we both agreed season one was absolutely wonderful and beautiful. I love “the letters” scene.
The New Pope,"HBO is just killing it with their shows at the moment. Watchmen, Succession, Chernobyl, Barry, this thing...amazing shows altogether."
The New Pope,"I gotta be honest with you... I don't think the second season was needed. The ending of the first season was almost perfect.

And I'm kinda afraid the second season might not live up to the glorious first season."
The New Pope,"The song is Paténipat by Charlotte Adigéry for those interested.
Zandoli - EP by Charlotte Adigéry https://music.apple.com/us/album/zandoli-ep/1441861486"
The New Pope,"As Tyra Banks once said: “Pope, but then make it fashion”"
The New Pope,Interesting that there's multiple astroturfers in this thread using the same 3 shows from HBO as their ad spiel.
The New Pope,"Damn. So HBO has this, The Outsider, Avenue 5, and a new season of Curb all dropping in January. Looking like a strong start to 2020, following up on what has been one of their best years ever with 2019. 

Most excited for this one, though. It took a little bit to warm up to The New Pope, but by the end I was completely on board."
The New Pope,SIRUS THE DAYM VIRUS
The New Pope,So that’s what Grigor becomes after Axelrod kicks him out of the US.
The New Pope,Anybody know what song that is?
The New Pope,I really never understood why John Malkovich is so popular.
The New Pope,I watched the Young Pope...all of it..and I still can't tell you whether I liked it or not.
The New Pope,Is this a Johnny English sequel?
The New Pope,"Two problems: This is a dick show with dick mentality. Needs women. And, I'm sad bc George Carlin was born to play this role and they didn't make it fast enough."
The New Pope,"HBO has The Young Pope, The Outsider, Avenue 5, and Curb Your Enthusiasm next month. What a damn start to the year."
The New Pope,When he’s getting into his vestments and “I’m sexy and I know” starts playing lol
The New Pope,"One Pope, Two Popes, Young Pope, New Pope"
The New Pope,Paolo Sorrentino's movies are like that. I highly recommend The Great Beauty and Youth.
The New Pope,Is this a continuation of the young pope? I was watching the trailer today and was confused by the differing titles.
The New Pope,"did you say weird, let me shamelessly plug /r/LegionFX to show you maximum weirdness."
The New Pope,You can't win!  I have the moral high ground!
The New Pope,Too Many Popes!
The New Pope,The Holy Spirit is strong in this one.
The New Pope,"Pope Wars, Part 2: Electric Boogaloo"
The New Pope,"Very good, Holy Fodder"
The New Pope,"It's a sequel.

Made by the same guy, too."
The New Pope,guess this is why GoT crashed and burned
The New Pope,"It's a beautifully shot art-house fever dream of a show. It's quite slow, but the intrigue of the Vatican and the relgious and philosophical questions of being the spokesperson of God are very interestingly explored."
The New Pope,"I thought it was going to be “House of Cards” at the Vatican. It started off that way, but turned into something totally different. I thought it was a very good show, and would definitely recommend it."
The New Pope,"> can someone who has seen it give me overview whether it is worth it?

It's one of the greatest shows from the golden age of TV series. It's up there with The Leftovers, The Americans, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, True Detective, Fargo, Legion, The Knick, Mad Men, Westworld, etc."
The New Pope,"Tried the premiere with my ex a few years ago out of boredom. Binge the series regularly. 

Such a masterpiece (to me)"
The New Pope,"IMO, the show tries to argue whether God is reachable or not.  God should stay sacred and distant from the people or mainstream like a pop star."
The New Pope,From the sound I would say [SebastiAn - Pleasures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lp-rUnoJH3w).
The New Pope,Or maybe it will be even better than the first season
The New Pope,"It has malkovich, it'll be good"
The Bold Type,"Hey, its the weekly spam and marketing SEO website posting that just takes everything that came out and tries to capture site traffic by slapping a fake award on top. This is the worst of the regular market spam that gets posted here, while the mods choke out real discussion to support bunk like this."
The Bold Type,"I loved the first season. I was a bit worried for season 2 when I heard they got a new showrunner, but it seems everything's all good. "
The Bold Type,"> ...inevitably been compared to [*Sex and the City*](http://www.vulture.com/2018/06/every-episode-of-sex-and-the-city-ranked.html) and [*Younger*](http://www.vulture.com/tv/younger/), to name just two shows built around New York single women; not only does *The Bold Type* merit those comparisons, it courts them with intelligence and feeling, never shying away from cathartic montages scored with You Go Girl needle drops. But nestled within the formula is a surprisingly granular drama about workplace politics and journalistic ethics in the age of digital media. "
The Bold Type,[deleted]
The Bold Type,I really liked this season. I liked the various plot twists and how the finale came together. I just wish that a season was more than 10 episodes.
The Bold Type,"Ditto, creators exiting is rarely a good sign, but thrilled it doesn't seem to have adversely affected TBT :)"
The Bold Type,"*The Bold Type* and *Younger* define summer TV for me right now. I love them.

I'm glad Matt Zoller Seitz continues to write about *The Bold Type*, and I'm glad it's still humming after the showrunner change."
The Bold Type,"This, exactly. The trio genuinely seem like they could be real-life best friends, like Abbi and Ilana on Broad City, or Sam and Tim on Detroiters. Something about chemistry like that just pops onscreen, and it engenders warmth and relatability."
The Bold Type,So Younger does get better than that first episode?
The Bold Type,Yes.
The Bold Type,Cool.
The Bold Type,Awesome!
The Bold Type,[deleted]
The Bold Type,Cool.
The Bold Type,"You took me by the hand, made me a man..."
The Bold Type,*That one night*
The Bold Type,I honestly sort of like the song.
The Bold Type,fuck yea! best thing freeform has ever done. 
The Bold Type,"Wow this is surprising!!! They took so long with renewing I thought they were for certain canceled! But two new seasons!?

Super interested as to why Sarah Watson isn't involved..."
The Bold Type,I’m excited it got renewed. I wonder why there’s a new showeunner (and nervous about if that’ll change the show). 
The Bold Type,"Showrunner thing is weird though. I really want to know the story behind that. Renewed for two seasons yet you're booting your creator and showrunner? But yeah, great news overall. I like this show!"
The Bold Type,"> (and nervous about if that’ll change the show)

Yes. I enjoyed *Sweet/Vicious*, so that's at least somewhat encouraging, but I can't help but be worried. This doesn't make much sense. Is Freeform notoriously tough to deal with?"
The Bold Type,"I’ve never heard of them being tough to deal with or having issues with showrunners, producers, anyone like that. "
The Bold Type,"Young-Adult TV is stronger than ever.

The CW proves that"
The Bold Type,This show looks like absolute trash based on the previews
The Bold Type,"Netflix saw something and made a big push recently into the genre as well with *13 Reasons Why*, *Stranger Things*, *On My Block* and *Everything Sucks!*, etc..."
The Bold Type,"I'm hoping for a second season as well. I watched the first episode thinking it was going to be horrible--a ""so bad it's good"" kind of show. I was really surprised when it turned out to be really good.

I think what sold it for me was the way they handled the editor's role. Rather than being a demanding, obnoxious bitch, they made her so likable, fair, and encouraging. It was so refreshing.

The article talks about the show's ""modest"" ratings. Here's to hoping it gets more word of mouth attention and lots of people check it out on Hulu before they make a decision."
The Bold Type, I hope it's a season ending. show was pretty good. 
The Bold Type,I hope it's a season finale. It's so refreshing to see a show (especially on Freeform) where everyone is so mature and communicates their feelings. It's a welcome change after 6 years of Pretty Little Liars.
The Bold Type,"Watch this show y'all, it's good! I'd hate to see it cancelled. All the episodes are available on Hulu"
The Bold Type,Three episodes have aired now. I'm just getting wind of it. Anyone watching? How do you like it?
The Bold Type,"I just saw this, but I really like it, and I'm picky about TV. I don't think trailers can do it justice because the plots have nuance. "
The Bold Type,"it is a great show. I googled it just to see if people were talking about it lol. i just finished the 3rd episode, the one with the nude pic incident. I was just wondering do you know where the trolls got the nude pic? she says something about how she took a topless photo in France and that they invaded her privacy. But I don't get it, how exactly did they get it ? hacking an account? that freaks me out.."
The Bold Type,"I'm enjoying it as well. It's a nice feel-good joint for me. And it is smart enough, as I think you're alluding to...The only real criticism I'd have -- and maybe this is me not being used to this show's type -- but the music cues are a bit too heavy for my tastes. Other than that it's quite fun. I need shows like this."
The Bold Type,"When you said ""the only criticism I have"" I thought ""music?"" Twins! Yes, tonight's episode was moving, good-awkward in parts, and fun. Vague for spoilers, but I loved seeing the house with the dog. "
The Bold Type,"So happy that S2 is holding up with a new showrunner. I expected the show to be, at best, a guilty pleasure but it is a genuine joy to watch. "
The Bold Type,I just finished the two part premiere and loved it. The first season was fun and enjoyable but this felt like it had more meat to it. 
The Bold Type,"Make the subreddit yourself. There are hundreds of guides to show you if you don't know how to create one. Google ""how to make a subreddit"" or consult the FAQ at the bottom of this page."
The Bold Type,"Oh, sorry for not checking, I was convinced I had to be important or something. Thank you!"
The Bold Type,"No problem. No, you don't have to be special, just have an account over 30 days old that has positive karma."
The Bold Type,Thank you so much! I diiiiid: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoldTypeTV/
The Bold Type,"> reasonably realistic

say wut? how is this ""reasonably realistic"" at all? anyways, I agree it should get renewed. The more you watch the better it gets. "
The Bold Type,We got too many seasons of Pretty Little Liars. We need more of The Bold Type.
The Bold Type,"I really, really wanted to like this because it sounded like a show that would empower women, discuss relevant gender inequality issues, etc...

Then, I think 3 episodes in, they try to push a narrative that VR is sexist. What?!? I honestly couldn't continue after that. I might continue it if someone can convince me otherwise, but I think Younger does a much better job touching on women's issues without being on the nose and in your face.

That being said, if people enjoy it and it got good viewership, then it should be renewed. Freeform definitely promoted it!"
The Bold Type,All of this was new and confusing.
The Bold Type,[deleted]
The Bold Type,"but also, it's good!"
The Bold Type,flip the genders and it's an entirely different show. i'm not sure i agree with that. i don't think i would want to watch this show if it was all dudes
The Bold Type,[deleted]
The Bold Type,"The world treats men and women very differently. Swapping them in a story is changing a giant variable, and predicting the outcome of that is far from simple. Some shows you could do this cleaner than others, I imagine, with smaller ramifications. *The Bold Type* isn't one of those. Maybe *Breaking Bad* would be, I'm not sure. But I think that rule of yours far too facile. And ultimately not very useful."
The Bold Type,"I like it. 

I like that it can be all about Girl Power and feminism without being ""preachy"" about it. They have discussions about things that are supposed to be normalized on TV but aren't. "
The Bold Type,"Yeah I've seen it and was pleasantly surprised! I thought it was going to be some cringey, preachy soap opera, but it's actually quite good. "
The Bold Type,"I'm loving it. I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I've been pleasantly surprised each week."
The Bold Type,Weird. It only has a 56 on metacritic.
The Bold Type,">and other than ""creative differences"" I don't think anything has leaked out about why this surprising breakup went down.

Honestly a show creator splitting with the network over ""their show"" vs ""the net work's"" show isn't that uncommon.  We might not ever know why but it happens."
The Bold Type,Is it that common after the first season of a successful show (creatively and business-wise) though?
The Bold Type,"I loved the first season! I read that they changed showrunners, though. Interested to see if it'll make a difference or not. "
The Bold Type,"I love this show! So intelligent, career-wise and fun show. I#m so glad that it was renewed. "
The Bold Type,"So in summary, fictional show on a network known for over-dramatized content is fictional and over-dramatized."
The Bold Type,Terrific description of the show. Bummed to hear Andrew’s screen time increases season four.

The Bold Type,"I loved how they upscaled B5 and corrected the aspect ratio to the 4:3 version instead of my blurred shit DVDs (which i still loved with all my heart despite the problems).

I hope this doesn't mean it'll disappear from my iTunes library because i paid for that with money."
The Bold Type,"I am so glad I did a Bab 5 rewatch in the last year... the Streaming version of Bab 5 is actually the best possible way to watch the show (it restored some aspect ratio shenanigans that they did on the DVD and syndicated versions of the show)... its a real sting to see it leave the platform.  


It bugs me so much that the're are people who actually applaud what Zaslav has been doing at WB. He has always been bad for consumers and entertainment, and he is once again using his brown thumb to crash what was once a very promising streamer, and destabilizing the whole streaming industry."
The Bold Type,This is so confusing. Wasn't Babylon 5's remaster done by HBO? Why would they completely remaster it only to take it down?
The Bold Type,"The rumor, IIRC, is that some of the DC stuff will be licensed to whatever service (probably Amazon) gets the Batman: Caped Crusader animated series being done by Bruce Timm and JJ Abrams. 

The others? Who the fuck knows. Probably will be put exclusively on some free-but-there-are-ads service so that they can get some money from them (the ability to totally write stuff off for tax purposes in exchange for never showing it only applies to projects done in the last X years and the decision can only be made in the first X months after an acquisition, so Zaslav can't go and ditch Person of Interest and Babylon 5 forever like he did Batgirl) until somebody decides otherwise sometime in the future.


Still, fuck Zaslav."
The Bold Type,They’re trying to build a new DC universe and at the same time remove one of the best things DC has ever done.. so dumb
The Bold Type,"James Gunn: Y'know, I think we'll take some inspiration for future DC films from the DCAU, which is almost universally beloved.

Zaslav: And YOINK!"
The Bold Type,Person of Interest is such a good show and I’m sad to see it go.
The Bold Type,So honestly what IS on HBO at this stage??
The Bold Type,"Person of Interest is on Amazon Freevee. You can watch with ads already.

Source: watched Leverage: Redemption and it was recommended to watch next. Way too few people know that Leverage is back with new episodes."
The Bold Type,Goodbye hbo. I kept it around for DC stuff.
The Bold Type,Brave and the Bold is my favorite cartoon ever
The Bold Type,What a shitload of fuck.
The Bold Type,I could have been watching Babylon 5 this whole time!?
The Bold Type,I’m just canceling HBO Max.
The Bold Type,Babylon 5 is literally the reason I did a year of HBO in November this irks me.
The Bold Type,HBOMax going from a high end mall store to Dollar Tree level in a year. What's funny is the right wing culture warriors who think Zaslav is doing all this to fight woke Hollywood instead of just being an incompetent cheapskate.
The Bold Type,"Zaslav is such a typical fucking suit. He doesn’t understand that A LOT OF ADULTS really enjoy animation, and that DC Animation is one of the few things keeping the properties relevant after the recent live-action films have been/are so divisive. HBO Max was a great, centralized place to watch all things DC, but apparently animation is “just for kiddos” and REAL adults watch reality TV on repeat. Needless to say, I will NOT be picking up a subscription once I stop getting it for free from AT&T."
The Bold Type,This is like the Sci Fi channel all over again.
The Bold Type,That’s it AppleTV+ is going to be the new HBO.
The Bold Type,Zaslav should just go ahead and change the name to HBO Min!
The Bold Type,What the fuck
The Bold Type,Babylon 5 is my favorite show growing up. I still have the dvds at least.
The Bold Type,"For anyone who runs out of time to rewatch B5, I can recommend this pair of videos:

[Part 1](https://youtu.be/-FfKOubWE14)

[Part 2](https://youtu.be/bI5Vy1t6EM8)

It’s a thorough recap / review with the key behind the scenes info, and includes Crusade and the one-offs.  I stumbled across it last night and watched it straight through for the 3+ hours.   Felt like I had done another full rewatch in a single evening!"
The Bold Type,"We happened to watch Bab5 and PoI and are now trying to get through Fringe before they try to dump that too. These shows should be feathers in their caps, not disposable.

Also, to hell with Freevee. If it's not on Prime, it's dead to me."
The Bold Type,If it wasn’t for doom patrol I would drop hbo max
The Bold Type,"
It was the year of fire,
The year of destruction,

The Bold Type,I fucking hate this company.
The Bold Type,Babylon 5 is allegedly getting a reboot on The CW.
The Bold Type,I don't know why everyone and their mothers aren't dropping HBO Max...
The Bold Type,Yo ho ho it is then.
The Bold Type,"damn, where is POI moving to?"
The Bold Type,Going to rewatch Babylon 5 and quit HBO Max after Jan 25. Until next season of HOD in 2024
The Bold Type,"Since DCAU and other DC related shows were my main reason for keeping the HBO Max service, I guess Zaslev just saved me a couple bucks per month. Its strange to see a streaming big go from really decent to not that great in a year."
The Bold Type,"Man, it feels odd that they are targeting 3 shows I was litterally in the middle of watching"
The Bold Type,I don’t even have HBO Max but I don’t understand the point of removing things you own and have exclusive rights to.
The Bold Type,"What in the everloving fuck?  Stop it Zaslav, it's not funny or cute, stop it."
The Bold Type,I genuinely don't get how JL is leaving. They own the rights to the show right?
The Bold Type,Fuck zaslav. Taking away dcau is just low.
The Bold Type,Justice league cartoon or the live action movie?

Alice,"Might be cause Squid game feels more real in a way. In Alice in Borderland the games are really over the top while in Squid game it's ""If you lose at this children's game I will shoot you in the head"". Idk though. That's just something I thought of a bit ago"
Alice,"I think because most of the characters in Squid Game were adults. My 60 year old mother loved Squid Game. AIB, she would most likely think was a teen series."
Alice,"It was hard to relate to the characters in Alice in Borderland. It was still enjoyable, but as a 30 year old with debt and having made some very stupid financial decisions myself, it was much easier to see myself in the squid game characters. I really liked the escapism of AiB, and it felt similar to a good sci-fi book, but Squid game felt so much more real to me, as if it were actually happening in our world of elite wealth and extreme debt."
Alice,"Squid game is ""closer"" to reality & plays on social themes"
Alice,I personally enjoy Alice in borderline more than squid game.
Alice,"It's how far the slider is moved between fantasy and reality.

Alice in Borderland is a great action fantasy with larger than life characters dropped in the middle of a game against their will and they have to use their wits to survive against some unknown, perhaps otherworldly foe.

Squid Game starts off the first episode with everyone choosing to participate, because the realities of life  have crippled them financially in a variety of real world scenarios, starring characters old enough to have those financial troubles be believable, and performing for rich people's entertainment.

Alice in Borderland is a well executed fantasy adventure. Spotting literary in names and character concepts to Alice in Wonderland is fun. 

Squid Game part a commentary on today's world dressed in story, using real world childhood games that many of us have played as the inspiration for the games of death.

I like both, but Alice in Borderland is something I've seen numerous times. Giving everyone an opportunity to leave and most choose to comeback meant I had to throw out my expectations and was seeing something different.

Edit: Costume and set design and color scheme is also quite memorable while also being simple enough to easily replicate."
Alice,Squid Game is social commentary and people see themselves in the allegorical death games of debt and capitalism.
Alice,"Alice is way more anime like, with cringy dialog and characters and dragged out deathscenes, especially in season 2. However I still enjoyed it more, but I think squid game fits the general public better, better characters and dialog. That’s what I think."
Alice,"Squid game is more relatable since it is a an allegory to the detriments of late capitalism. 


Alice in borderland has a powerful message but you don't get to know what it is till the literal last chapter of the manga, nothing makes sense till then. Highly recommend it tho."
Alice,"I enjoy Alice in Borderland a lot, but I find it to be too anime at times. Like the guy who always has his hands in his pockets and posing in a circle and all that stuff. I can see why it wouldn't be as popular as squid games, along with what the others have said about the characters."
Alice,"The games were far better and scarier in Alice in Borderland, but the characters were much better in Squid Game. Squid game also has a catchier name and A+ visual branding that made you want to watch it just from seeing the banner in Netflix. But I liked them both"
Alice,"I think Alice in borderland is the best manga in the survival game genre, but the tv show suffer the same thing all Japanese drama had, very dramatic and over the top acting, plus the major thing is they don’t have as much money to put in marketing and  visual."
Alice,"I started Alice in Borderland and Squid Game around the same time and dropped Alice because I really didn’t feel like watching the complicated games where  the main character had to monologue the puzzles and solutions to the audience. Where SG was about children’s games I was either already familiar with or were easy to understand the rules of. 

I also didn’t like the characters in Alice as much especially the main character. 

Squid Game is also just fun to look at. It has an eye catching color palette, unique set design that incorporates childhood whimsy, satisfying cinematography. AiB just didn’t catch me in those regards."
Alice,"Feel like the difference between squid game and Alice is the difference between hunger games and divergent.


Alice just has a discounted feel to it in characters, dialogue, and pace. It's choppy and the characters don't seem to draw you into it. There's an unnecessary over the top feel which could be reigned in and made better by focus on individual aspects rather than broad stroke action sequences."
Alice,"The magic of Squid Game is encapsulated in episode 2. Every character is given a chance to walk away and they all choose to return. Watching why gives the characters actual weight and raises the stakes all that much more.

AiB is just a show about people escaping puzzles. At least for 3 episodes, i turned it off after that"
Alice,"I have watched the first 10 minutes and the tone is completely different. So far it’s a bit happy and out of touch with reality. 

Anime in most cases does not transfer well to live action."
Alice,The dialogue in Alice is pretty terrible.
Alice,Alice in borderlands is a lot more edgy/cringey. Still good but yeah.
Alice,Mainstream appeal. Squid Game is a regular survival thriller with a mostly adult cast. Alice in Borderland is a sci-fi show with a mostly YA cast and a higher focus on horny sex appeal. All that makes Alice in Borderland more niche and Squid Game more mainstream by comparison.
Alice," these 2 are not even close in execution, borderland is fun but so shallow it hurts."
Alice,I can't agree on anything you've said. Obviously it's all subjective but beyond what you've mentioned I also thought Alice looked cheap and dull where Squid Game is colorful and shot well.
Alice,"I mean is it not fucking obvious? Squid Game has 10x better marketing and key visuals. Those key visuals have better costume design and better set design, which makes them more memorable from a trailer viewing. Then the people who watched found better characters, writing, and performances. So they tell their friends, screencap on social media, cosplay, etc. On top of that Alice has a corny name and is far too anime for your average viewer."
Alice,Never even heard of Alice squid game was impossible not to hear about
Alice,Because it's Genuinely not as good as squid game. The characters are better in squid game and so is the writing. Alice is too anime and the characters don't feel fully fleshed out like in squid game. I love the games in Alice though.
Alice,"I was recommended Alice in Borderlands because of Squid Game. The two aren't at all related. AiB seems to have the premise of some guy who isn't good at anything but video games being put into a situation where, coincidentally, his skill at video games is really important. Not a premise I really give a shit about."
Alice,"I think it is because Netflix hasn't  pushed it as much as Squid Game. I have not seen nearly a tenth of the push for Alice on their page that Squid Game got. 

When I recommend the show to my friends they have never heard of it and compare it to Squid Game. It's frustrating because in some ways Alice is a better show."
Alice,"Because the anime tropes are so apparent, it’s unbelievable."
Alice,"The game is too complex. It distracts from the more important element, the human emotion. 

Squid Game’s game is practically children’s game with very simple rule. The “strategy” in squid game is just a made-up plot device that you don’t have to think too much if it will actually work. 

AiBL made the game too complicate, it overloads the audience."
Alice,"Squid Game has fantastic performances.. all of the actors were just fucking captivating.

Alice In Borderland.. oh the main guy's so brilliant he just blurts out the solutions to each trap they find themselves in. I'm supposed to be ""OH HE'S SO SMART"" but it's like Sherlock where the main character solves puzzles the audience doesn't have the information for making it feel like a writer is just stroking themselves"
Alice,"I loved Squid Game, but saw one episode of AIB...

* Part of the fun of Squid Game was thinking about how you would play the games if you were in them. They were simple and you can imagine how you could beat them. Meanwhile, the challenges in AIB are convoluted and require genius intellect to beat (deducing the measurements of the rooms by previously seeing the outside of the building...come on, that's impossible)
* Might get some heat for this, but Alice in Borderland felt a bit like a live action anime. The trope of genius gamer who can solve impossible puzzles made my eyes roll. The mysterious girl standing heroically with the backdrop of the city skyline and the epic music...that's an anime. Squid Game felt like a drama and more real."
Alice,"Squid game was better shot, directed, acted and produced compared to Alice in borderland. 

I loved the [manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/33031/Imawa_no_Kuni_no_Alice), and many people do. Which may explain why you might like this one more than the squid game. Also Aso Haro's story/plot is probably better."
Alice,"Honestly Squid Game is a much deeper show with genuine society critique. Not to mention that acting is far better. And this comes from me as westerner that neither speaks Korean or has any connection with their culture.

Alice in Borderlands , is really fun gonzo Manga adaptation. Nothing bad about it. But its simply not in same league.

By the way, talking about Manga adaptations , you should see Rourin Kenshin. Now that is a genuinely good one."
Alice,Alice in Borderland is a great show
Alice,"Considering this is the first time I've heard of this show, that might be your answer.... marketing."
Alice,"Probably shitty marketing cause I literally thought you were shitposting and didn't know there was a show called ""Alice in Borderland."""
Alice,"I like Alice in Borderlands just fine but it just isn't as good as Squid Game, not even close. The characters aren't as compelling, the direction is heavy-handed (there are a lot of slow-developing scenes of the characters realizing they have to keep going that are just plain unnecessary), the stakes don't seem as big as there are many games where you really don't fear the main characters dying, and there isn't as clear of an allegory to real-world issues."
Alice,"Squid Games is more realistic, has relatable social subtext, is shot in a way that feels more cinematic, and the writing doesn’t have any overdone anime tropes. I like both but it’s not surprising that Squid Games is more popular."
Alice,One is written for Younf Adults while the other is a commentary on modern day capitalism.
Alice,"As someone who enjoyed AIB much much more, I gotta say Squid Game feels more relatable because of its themes regarding family, classism, etc. hence having a broader appeal. AIB is pretty much a live-action anime with its anime tropes, which turns off people who are not into the genre. Anyone can easily understand Squid Game.

Characters in AIB are teens/20s and a lot of older adults prefer watching protagonists in their age range (Squid Game). Squid Game had visual and auditory elements that were **made** for marketing (the pink outfits, the giant robot, the tracksuits, the theme instrumentals)."
Alice,"They are both good but as others have mentioned, check out Kaiji. It is an anime with thinky death games (or fates as bad as death)."
Alice,"I didn't enjoy it as much. I found the cinematography worse, the acting to be cheesier, the games a bit convoluted, and the premise less realistic.

Squid Game is not an original idea, but it does execute it very well."
Alice,"As a lot of people have mentioned on here, Alice is very anime-like whereas Squid Game is more grounded in reality. I also reckon that the aesthetic and production design of Squid had a lot to do with its popularity. The costumes were bold and colourful, the masks were memorable and relatable to the real world. Outside of the violence, Squid Game is a very attractive show. 

Alice is a great show though. The fight choreography this season was amazing and the finale was very satisfying (it actually reminded me of Lost). It has a lot of anime tropes that are bound to piss off western audiences but I think it delivers in the end."
Alice,I love them both but Alice in borderland has an awesome story
Alice,I think it’s because Alice in Borderland is way more sci-fi than Squid Game.
Alice,"I don't think the characterisation was there as much in AIB. Squid Game had a bunch of 'grey' characters, good people who do bad, bad people who do good, and everything in between. These were far more appealing to me than the characters in AIB - the most appealing part for me was the friendship between Arisu, Chota and Karube. Outside of those 3, I don't recall the names of anyone.

Also, the style is different, as you mentioned. The anime style isn't for everyone and I found the later episodes far less watchable than the beginning, because it started getting further into the realms of the fantastic. Squid Game stayed consistently dark and realistic.

Edit: Also, actors. SG had some phenomenal actors working on it, most notably Lee Jung-jae. I don't remember being blown away by anyone's performance in AIB, apart from maybe Arisu in the wolf/sheep game."
Alice,"I liked Alice, but for me personally, Squid Game was just more relatable. I'm not in serious debt myself but playing a game for financial reasons is truly relatable"
Alice,"AiB was written as a graphic novel first, as it feels very manga to me. Ill never understand the constant yelling and running. Can someone explain that to me please?

Squid Games is written as an insight and exploration of our current economic systems with compelling characters. It also had better overall production and originality.

It is interesting how now and then we get the same basic movie released at the same time like this. I loved both shows but find SQ more relatable and realistic."
Alice,"Squid game is a character drama with some death game skin, it's got pretty universal themes like wealth inequality everybody can understand

Alice in borderland is an irl anime"
Alice,"It has no where near the same mainstream appeal as Squid.

As you said, at its core is basically a live action shounen show. Its *too* anime for most people"
Alice,Tried to get a friend into alice after he liked squid. He complained about it feeling cartoonish an it being a teen show. I quite enjoy it though to each there own
Alice,Idk man.. alice is definitely more fun IMHO
Alice,"Alice in Borderland = characters act like anime characters

Squid Games = characters act like normal people (for the most part)"
Alice,"It's simple, Squid Game excelled in every area AiB didn't, they had stronger characters, they had a solid team for marketing, and a lot of people who don't even watch asian shows tuned in for it bc they felt drawn to the premise; all of these people drowned in debt show us how far they'll go for money, even if it means killing another person. In AiB, although the games are definitely superior, there's no reason why they're playing, the games are even deadlier and they don't even know how they got there, yes it's not crucial to know, but all of this effort for what? They don't know if they'll get a reward, if they'll just get to live until they finish, there's nothing they know for sure they could gain from risking their lives while playing, not only that, they have to keep playing every three days bc if they don't they also die, which is (in their position) pretty frustrating, squid game did an amazing job by introducing their characters in a way in which while we saw their flaws, we also saw their strength's (Gihun, the main character, is a gambling addict and he's not a present father, but while in the games we saw him in another light, he stood beside the people who were marked as 'useless' or 'not worth the trouble', he also stood for what he believed was right, all of this made him an interesting character) not to mention, squid game's side characters where so good bc we saw how shitty their lives were before the games, but they all had a thing in common: they wanted to comeback to someone/something (Ali to his family, Sangwoo to his mother, Saebyeok to his brother, and so on), AiB side characters although likeable, lacked a proper storyline, we saw glimpses of their past lives but nothing else, the actors of certain characters (Chishiya, Karube, Kuina and others) did an amazing job making their characters likable and gave them life, but I didn't care that much for the main characters, Arisu was a great character but he wasn't all of that as they made him to be, and Usagi although she had a great story the actress didn't do a great job with her character, and to finish off the marketing: once Netflix saw that squid game was getting popular, they made sure to promote it EVERYWHERE, I couldn't escape a Squid game promo even if I tried, whilst I found out about AiB bc people were recommending it ""if you enjoyed squid game"", I agree that AiB first season was strong and really binge worthy, but Squid Game in terms of storyline, characters and overall production was worth the hype they got in Hollywood"
Alice,"Squid Game became popular because of the hype. It was chance that it got a little hype and that little hype prompted huge marketing investment.

Squid Game became huge because people thought it already was huge so they had to watch it."
Alice,I honestly don’t think it has anything to do with the quality of the shows. Some of it is just luck but I think the main reason is that Netflix started promoting Squid Game on their front page big time once it started to get popular. Then it became a snowball effect.
Alice,"This might just be a personal take, but the opening of Alice in borderland was very cringey to me. When a manga/anime is adapted, the interactions, emotions, reactions, etc translate into live action just terribly. 

I almost dropped the show at the beginning but I'm so glad I didn't because I think the show is really, really goos"
Alice,AiB is 100% superior.
Alice,Mainstream US audiences like Korean stuff more than Japanese. AiB is based off of a manga and has a bunch of manga tropes that don't translate well to live action.
Alice,"It's simply not as good in my opinion, and it doesn't have that unique and high budget look that Squid Game has. But it's mostly in the characters and just overall writing that Squid Game is much better. I'm actually a bit baffled there's so many people wondering why AiB isn't as popular."
Alice,"They aren't the same. Korean media in general is just way more dark. Old boy, i saw the devil,  man from nowhere, squid game, shoot even the monster one. Character development from kdramas is some of the best. As a lot of stuff just ends up being bitter sweet and the struggle characters face feels more real.  So you marriage the two and you have something great, something people can easily relate too despite it being commentary on korean society, and you are drawn into the world. Alice in borderlands just feels like an anime in live action,  and they never compare well enough to the actual anime. Japanese actors just have that over the top acting that just takes you out of it... because anime expressions can't be translated to life. What we like in anime ends up looking really fucking dumb in real life. Its still a great cheesy live action and imho is one of the better representations. But like they are very,  very different when you actually compare them."
Alice,"Squid game is realistic and Alice in Borderlands is fantasy simple as that.

Also Japanese media that's not anime is no where near the quality and production of kdrama. I find their acting quite bad tbh. Almost comes off amateurish to me."
Alice,"Cause it's just not as good. I like the show but cinemetography, direction, and acting is just not on the same level as Squid Games. It got me to cry once at the end, but there is just sooooo much melodramatic cheese in alice. I also feel like they shouldve strayed from the manga and kept the characters at least paired up in the second season.  The catch up montages didnt work for me. Also Needed more Aguni. He was unquestionably the best actor on the show.

I did like the ending though. The idea that they were in limbo worked for me.

&#x200B;

P.S.: The fight between Aguni and King of Spades in the woods was brief but soo damn good. The action the rest of the way was pretty disappoting after this scene because it showed they were capable of doing a great fight scene, but then you have the trans chracter fights which were all really badly choregraphed."
Alice,Because it's kind of bad and doesn't have a good directing and aesthetic as Squid Game.
Alice,Squid game has better characters. You become a lot more invested in them and their stories.
Alice,Never heard of Alice. Guessing marketing sucked.
Alice,"Everyone basically has said the main points but just gotta say AiB has so many more plotholes in it. Lots of things just don't make much sense. Lots of games can be beaten in various ways that you'd think the supposedly smart protagonists could figure out but don't. It's a bit more formulaic in just making the outcome that makes the most drama. It's definitely fine. But I think that contributes to the YA feel people have mentioned.   


The squid game, games are just simple kids games for the most part so not as much to work through."
Alice,"I just finished AiB and here are my problems with it:

1) ending was too head fucky. I won’t go into it so I don’t spoil it for anyone but the last 2 episodes were just “really? Way to M Night Shamylan it.” 

2) romantic subplots felt very forced and not genuine 

3) main characters had **pristine** plot armor. Literally impenetrable until it’s their turn to die in the plot

4) huge “they’ll live cuz they’re the main characters” energy 

5) all the semi-main characters existed solely to support Arisu, which supports the ending they were going for but makes it less relatable.

6) some of the side characters are just not that interesting, like the bow and arrow chick who seems like she’s only there to fit the “precocious Japanese school girl who kicks ass” stereotype. 

7) this is more of a personal observation but the female characters feels like they mainly served as foils to the male characters. Kuina’s “slim but good at martial arts” thing just doesn’t work when she’s so slim and has no muscles but this seems to be a Japanese fantasy trope anyway. Ann’s “stealthy and deadly” thing isn’t very relatable. Usagi’s “survive and fight until your last breath” thing gets annoying. These might be more personal annoyances tho.

8) it feels like Arisu only tried his best because of his drive to protect Usagi. I know the survivors’ guilt thing is there but it just kinda feels not very genuine. 

I mainly enjoyed the games they played and learning how they worked and how the characters would resolve them, but outside of the games honestly imo the plot is weak."
Alice,"Its because AIB is written more as an anime than a standard TV series (which is the cause of the choppy writing), I think this throws people off. I do have to say the games are much much better in AIB (its not even close). The characters in the squid game  are a lot less interesting but more grounded and more ""relatable.""

In the end I think its the anime feel. It also wasn't promoted very well in comparison to Squid game. Squid game was front page day 1 while AIB I only found because it was in my suggested from watching anime."
Alice,"I liked both a lot, but AoB just delivers way heavier psychological punches to me, and that’s the entire reason I love the death game genre."
Alice,I started watching season 2 and man… it’s slow going.  I don’t remember if season 1 was this slow
Alice,"As is sadly the case with many shows from my country, Alice in Borderland is terribly acted and almost as poorly written. I don’t know how it comes across to subtitle readers/dub watchers but as a Japanese person it’s hard not to watch it and think I’ve already seen it done but better. Squid game isn’t ground breaking but the reason for the name being obvious right away and what the metaphor is, succinct storytelling and technically proficient acting/cinematography just made it consumer gold."
Alice,I tried watching this show right after squid game. Wasn’t remotely as captivating. WS really hard to stay tuned in.
Alice,"Squid Game has incredible visuals and great characters. AiB is pretty good all around but it lacks those sets, costumes, creativity, and characters that make Squid Game stand out. Having seen both I also think Squid Game is a lot better in pretty much every area as well. AiB is still good though but it’s not hard to imagine why it doesn’t rival SG imo.    

SG is also has adult characters with relatable situations and character arcs, whereas AiB feels very YA at times, and has a main character that doesn’t know how to act around women 80% of the time, which I think has very limited appeal. AiB anime allusions don’t do it any favors either.    

Not shitting on AiB, I like that show too but I don’t think it’s even close to SQ. It’s coming at a similar time to SQ also makes it look like it’s trying to cash in on the kid game survival show appeal"
Alice,"Korean live-action shows inherently these days are more popular around the world compared to Japanese live action shows, and Vice versa. If both of these shows were anime, i can almost guarantee that Alice would be the more popular show since Japanese animation is much more popular worldwide compared to Korean webtoons/anime."
Alice,"I think this easily comes down to Squid Game being realistic - you could imagine this happening.
Alice is very much on the supernatural side, which makes it automatically unappealing for some viewers."
Alice,"I think the show has an incredible amount of plot holes. I found myself getting furious at the characters for their actions or inactions. Tons of cliches, complete lack of rational thinking in many situations... I still enjoy the show but more for shock value than well written scenes."
Alice,To me it just comes down to style more than anything else. Squid Game has this surreal quality that reminds me of A Clockwork Orange; I found the plot nonsensical but kept watching because the characters were compelling and the visual style pretty amazing.
Alice,"While Alice in Borderland has caught my attention I haven’t watched it yet mostly because I’ve already watched Squid Games and the similar premise makes it less appealing. 

So I would blame Netflix advertising or algorithms as Squid Games was being pushed every time I opened Netflix and made it impossible to miss, while I just saw a promo for Alice in Borderland for the first time recently. Had I seen it before watching Squid Games I definitely would have watched it first and been uninterested in watching SG after."
Alice,"The dialog, acting, and voice acting in Alice is sooooo bad. I tried to finish the first episode twice."
Alice,"It's not as good and it's not as effectively told. It is fun, for sure, but I'm in no way surprised that it's not as popular."
Alice,"For those who liked squid games, give Alice a chance, it's pretty good.

My only issue with it is that, because it's based on manga, some of the scenes are ridiculous. Like you can imagine the panels drawn in the manga, but it doesn't work when you do it in live action it just looks ridiculous. Also the manga physics. But all in all great show"
Alice,"Every time I see it recommended on Netflix, I think ""maybe"" and then don't. Couldn't really provide a more detailed explanation. Just nothing about it piques my curiosity enough to give it a try. Maybe I've seen enough dystopian themed content to feel like there's nothing new to be explored with the genre."
Alice,Just started watching it yesterday and was wondering the same thing! It's really good
Alice,I tuned out once they got to the beach. Really enjoyed it up until then.
Alice,My colleague told me that the 2nd season is out? Thanks for the reminder. I liked it a lot more than squid game
Alice,"I'm not sure how they're all that comparable. Korean-made dystopian, I guess? Their conceits are kinda similar, but the execution and direction are really dissimilar. The emotional levels of Squid Game are on another echelon, and Squid Game has a lot more to say about politics and modern capital ethics. Seeing evil face to face, learning its motivations, and feeling its apathy and contempt are other big differences.  

Alice in Borderlands seemed more like entertainment to me, whereas Squid Game had a message, a moral. If anything AiB seems like a CW adaptation, and I know I got bored of it."
Alice,I love both
Alice,"Squid Games was like Attack on Titan in the sense that both did extremely well in grabbing a western audiences attention. 

The story telling & how it’s shot, the characters, the themes—it’s something someone who doesn’t even like or normally watch kdramas or anime can watch. 

Something like Alice in Borderland requires ^(not “require”, but makes it easier for) you to be familiar with the exaggerations of a Korean show of that style. 

It’s like someone who’s able to watch a telanovella, Chinese drama, or Bollywood film somewhat seriously without always making fun of all the classic exaggerations. The flying-leap fight scenes & terrible wigs in Chinese dramas makes me snort & cringe while my mom is super into the plot & isn’t even dazed."
Alice,Squid game is budget Alice in Borderland
Alice,"Because the current trend is to thirst after korean people and culture, alice in borderland is Japanese so despite being better in every sense, it doesn't hit the same numbers"
Alice,Popularity depends on a lot more. The when it came out and how coordinated the social media campaign was will affect it greatly
Alice,"I think its just initial first impression people get. They also might not like the idea of teens in that type of situation.  
I liked alice in borderlands more but I loved the manga and was curious on this adaptation."
Alice,Even though squid game is also based on an anime/manga. Kaiji.
Alice,It's so much better than it too!
Alice,"It doesn’t feel as real, but goddamn I love Alice In borderland"
Alice,"Squid Game had a marketing campaign that got ball rolling very fast and people had something to discuss. In this case social-commentary message and how ridiculous it is despite having realistic feeling.

Alice in Borderland comes off as isekai in this case, which is not very popular outside of anime. 

Thus, despite having cool games, etc it didnt make a splash to bring in people to watch who usually are not looking for that kind of series, which Squid Game did with social media buzz."
Alice,"Besides what other people said: it’s also the framing, camera angles, set design, set quality, use of color, lighting, hair, make-up, acting. All distinctly cliche live-action-anime instead of high budget or tv-style or creative."
Alice,"Imo its the social commentary of squid game. 

A lot of ppl can connect with someone down and out on their luck forced into a shit situation… whereas less can relate to finding themselves in an alternate dimension fighting for their life. 

I love both"
Alice,"I found the first season interesting at first, but it quickly degenerated into something I had to force myself to complete watching.

That guy with the sword, omg he was so laughably uncool and rediculously ugly in the way he tried to be cool and scary. Omg. I have zero hopes for the just arrived second season.

The girl protagonist is pretty, though."
Operation Buffalo,I’m in the US and don’t see this
Operation Buffalo,I guess its not a true netflix original since its not available globally
Operation Buffalo,"If you're disappointed you can't find this on Netflix, but wanna check out another show set in Australia with a somewhat similar presence (though, I suspect, a different tone/direction. I haven't seen operation buffalo), Pine Gap is pretty good."
Operation Buffalo,Yay for VPNs. Connected to an Australian server and I'm downloading it right now.
Operation Buffalo,This is on Netflix now? Sweet. Really enjoyed it.
Operation Buffalo,"As others have said, this was originally on ABC in Australia: https://iview.abc.net.au/show/operation-buffalo  

It was a really great combination of dark humor and slight mysticism to tell the story of a horrible incident. All the actors were great; James Cromwell was great as always."
Operation Buffalo,[removed]
Operation Buffalo,WHAT DOES CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED EVEN MEAN
Operation Buffalo,"Not available in NL either. 

I guess this explains the lack of buzz."
Operation Buffalo,"Don't see it in Canada either.  I also don't even see it on justwatch, which usually has pretty much everything in a search."
Operation Buffalo,no it's austrailian. abc i think. the last time i checked it was only available in uk and austrailia.
Operation Buffalo,Have you reviewed it?
Operation Buffalo,It's lack of distribution is tragic. If it finds it way onto Netflix worldwide then it would get the attention it deserves.
Operation Buffalo,You can use a VPN to connect to Australian server.
Operation Buffalo,well seems like the op has his answer
Operation Buffalo,"A short write-up I did a while back:

> Operation Buffalo is an Australian series based on, and to some extent a depiction of the British nuclear tests conducted at Maralinga, South Australia between 1956 and 1963. It's an interesting series because this is a fascinating part of history to do a series on, one that many may not know about, but it's also interesting because of how it's presented. Despite having dark subject matters such as rape, murder, racism, radiation poisoning etc. and even darker undertones if you know the history of the British's geocide of Aboriginal Australians, the series presents itself in quite a comical manner. It's a comedy-drama, constantly switching back and forth from cookie comedy to investigative thriller, but it doesn't take way from the seriousness of the issues at hand. The transitions are less than smooth, and the humor doesn't always hit (though that one scene where a character tries to commit suicide via atomic bomb is fucking hilarious), but the series is commendable for trying to do something different and not riding the coattails of its premise. 

> The morals of the main character and pretty much every other character along with him are questionable, and this is intentional as the series never eases up on telling its viewers that the world is a fuck up place and people are all out for themselves. All together, it's a very amusing and at the same time a very dark series, with some action scenes here and there, and if that's not enough to sell you there's an atomic explosion every other episode. Visually it isn't the most impressive, and in the earlier episodes scenes where '*old white men in charge*' pretty much sit around having conversations about nothing can seem to go on forever, but as I said before Operation Buffalo is interesting, and a pretty well put together series.

    rating: 7.7 out of 10

p.s. Watch it just for that scene where dude tries to commmit suicide via atomic bomb. 😂😂"
Operation Buffalo,This comment looks suspiciously like the poster replied to himself so he could show off his review.
Operation Buffalo,TY
Operation Buffalo,"I follow dude. He reviews lesser known American and foreign series. 

The shows that this sub never talks about. Like this one."

Operation Buffalo,The title of the thread says 2017-2019! I think you meant 2020-2021!
Operation Buffalo,Yea I realized right after posting but fuck it. lol.
The Last Bastion,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Last Bastion,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Last Bastion,[removed]
The Last Bastion,[removed]
The Last Bastion," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Last Bastion,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Last Bastion,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Last Bastion,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Last Bastion,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Last Bastion,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Last Bastion,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Last Bastion,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Last Bastion,Rat King is coming
The Last Bastion,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Last Bastion,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Last Bastion,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Last Bastion,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Last Bastion,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Last Bastion,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Last Bastion,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Last Bastion,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Last Bastion,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Last Bastion,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Last Bastion,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Last Bastion,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Last Bastion,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Last Bastion,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Last Bastion,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Last Bastion,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Last Bastion,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Last Bastion,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Last Bastion,[removed]
The Last Bastion,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Last Bastion,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Last Bastion,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Last Bastion,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Last Bastion,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Last Bastion,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Last Bastion,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Last Bastion,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Last Bastion,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Last Bastion,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Last Bastion,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Last Bastion,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Last Bastion,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Last Bastion,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Last Bastion,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Last Bastion,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Last Bastion,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Last Bastion,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Last Bastion,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Last Bastion,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Last Bastion,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Last Bastion,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Last Bastion,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Last Bastion,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Last Bastion,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Last Bastion,[deleted]
The Last Bastion,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Last Bastion,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Last Bastion,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Last Bastion,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Last Bastion,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Last Bastion,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Last Bastion,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Last Bastion,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Last Bastion,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Last Bastion,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Last Bastion,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Last Bastion,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Last Bastion,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Last Bastion,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Last Bastion,We gonna get the rat king.
The Last Bastion,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Last Bastion,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Last Bastion,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Last Bastion,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Last Bastion,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Last Bastion,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Last Bastion,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Last Bastion,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Last Bastion,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Last Bastion,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Last Bastion,[removed]
The Last Bastion,[removed]
The Last Bastion,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Last Bastion,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Last Bastion,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Last Bastion,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Last Bastion,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Last Bastion,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Last Bastion,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Last Bastion,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Last Bastion,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Last Bastion,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Last Bastion, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Last Bastion,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Last Bastion,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Last Bastion,And more golfing
The Last Bastion,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Princess Principal,If Carrie Coon & Justin Theroux each don't win an Emmy then I have lost faith in humanity.
Princess Principal,"I'm really worried The Leftovers isn't going to get any nominations. No nominations for season 1 is fair, but they got nothing last year despite how good the show got. The Emmys work on this weird one-year delay sometimes where highly praised yet underwatched shows eventually get catch-up noms, like The Americans did last year even though, arguably, the show isn't as strong as it once was. So hopefully this is the year for The Leftovers. They don't have to win, I recognize it's a weird show that not a lot of people watch, but Carrie Coon, Justin Theroux and the show all *need* to be in the conversation, as well as the writing and directing."
Princess Principal,I really hope Justin Theroux wins
Princess Principal,"I'd love to see Freddy Highmore get a nomination for his performance on this season of Bates Motel. He did incredible. 

Also, I'm sad that Orphan Black is missing the cut off for this years Emmy. I'd like to see Tatiana Maslany win back to back Emmy's."

"
Princess Principal,"I agree with you mostly, but would have to throw Preacher in there. At least for Cinematography/Directing. Regina King should be nominated for either The Leftovers or American Crime. I also think Legion episode 5 was the real standout. "
Princess Principal,How can you not put Winona Ryder in contention for best actress? 
Princess Principal,Bates Motel and Crazy Ex Girlfriend are mostly what I care about.
Princess Principal,I want to see Susan Sarandon nominated for her role as Bette Davis in Feud. She made the show for me and did a fantastic job.
Princess Principal,"Haven't finished s03 yet but they have to nominate The Leftovers and my boy Kevin Garvey aka Justin Theroux.

Just give it and him the top awards... its me favorite show."
Princess Principal,"Kathy Bates and Adina Porter deserve Supporting Actress in a Limited Series Nominations for ""American Horror Story: Roanoke.""  "
Princess Principal,Iain De Caestecker and Mallory Jansen over at Agents of Shield both needs nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress/Actor.
Princess Principal,"I'd really love to see Titus Burgess get at least a nomination, he was so good in the new season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"
Princess Principal,"As a TV pro, I just love looking at this list and seeing all this amazing stuff. I'll be sad to see half of these noms not win. This is really a golden age for content.

That said, with all the amazing shows, ***Legion*** is the one that really blew me away. I've never ever stopped a show in the middle of watching with people to rewind over and over to understand how they put some shots together. The visuals are just so astounding to me, from the shots to the grades to the cuts. There are a couple of cuts in E02 that are so beautiful, I honestly would put them into the hall of fame.

HoC and Mr Robot had some pretty spectacular first seasons, but Legion is a real landmark for me."
Princess Principal,Reddit probably won't like this but I'd still like Andrew Lincoln to get a nomination for his portrayal of Rick on The Walking Dead. The show sucks but Lincoln gives a great performance consistently. 
Princess Principal,Is Game of Thrones not eligible or do you just not like it? I'm not sure how all the Emmy deadlines and stuff work.
Princess Principal,Are Netflix or other streaming originals eligible for the Emmys?
Princess Principal,Nominations without Spacey in House of Cards are a joke
Princess Principal,I love seeing You're the Worst on your list OP. Well Done! 
Princess Principal,Maybe it's just me but it isn't really fair to nominate someone from Black Mirror for the acting categories considering they were only in a single episode. 
Princess Principal,Where is Titus Andromedon?
Princess Principal,"Why is South park nominated, its been shit for a while now"
Princess Principal,I would say Alex Lawther deserves a nod for his Black Mirror episode
Princess Principal,What were the start and end dates of shows airing in order to be nominated? 
Princess Principal,"I'd love to see Titus Welliver pick up a nomination for Bosch. The show itself isn't nomination-worthy in my opinion, but he's so damn good."
Princess Principal,"I'm pretty sure American Gods should be eligible. Iirc like 50% of the season needed to be released before the end of May. Also, I don't see Legion getting too much love."
Princess Principal,"Just some dream nominations for these people:
*Michael McKean - Better Call Saul (don't need Jonathan Banks to be nominated) and also for the writing in ""Chicanery""
*Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Wright, and Jon Nolan (writing) - Westworld
*Winona Ryder or Millie Bobby Brown - Stranger Things
*Black Mirror and Sherlock for Limited Series
*Benedict Cumberbatch - Sherlock "
Princess Principal,"Glad you included Quarry. It really deserves more attention, fantastic and contained story throughout the season."
Princess Principal,The young pope needs something for best comedy and best cinematography. Best screenplay and score while you're at it.
Princess Principal,"American horror story should because they really went a different direction this season which paid off, but I feel like it won't. And Kathy bates was incredible in her role, along with Asian Porter, Sarah Paulson, and Lily Rabe. "
Princess Principal,Fargo will get way more limited series noms then you're putting down. It'll probably have a nom in almost every limited series category especially best limited series which it's been in it's last two seasons and won in it's first. Ewan McGregor for lead actor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead for supporting actress. Michael Stuhlbarg and David Thewlis might also both get supporting actor noms. 
Princess Principal,Tatiana Maslany in Orphan Black
Princess Principal,"I swear to fucking everything if Emilia Clarke and her unimpressive acting is the only one nominated as best actress from GoT I will, well I'm not going to do anything.  Just going to roll my eyes real hard.  "
Princess Principal,"All I care about is Walton Goggins for Vice Principals and Michael Mando for Better Call Saul (specifically for 'Off Brand'). 

Once upon a time I would have wished for Kingdom (and Jonathan Tucker specifically) to get acknowledged, but that's a lost cause at this point.

Westworld needs to take the outstanding costumes in a fantasy series."
Princess Principal,Marton Csokas as Quinn from Into the Badlands for Best Supporting because he's just so damn good at playing a crazy post apocalyptic warlord who lives in a subway with a baby.
Princess Principal,I'd like to see Neil Patrick Harris and A Series of Unfortunate Events get a nomination for the comedy categories.
Princess Principal,Why is game of thrones not even listed? It's phenomenal 
Princess Principal,If Aubrey Plaza does not win for legion the emmys is rigged
Princess Principal,"Comedy: Superstore

Comedy Actress: Ellie Kemper

Comedy Actor: Aziz Ansari

Comedy Supp. Actress: Jane Krakowski

Comedy Supp. Actor: Mark McKinney

Drama: Stranger Things

Drama Actress: Elisabeth Moss

Drama Actor: Iain De Caestecker

Drama Supp. Actress: Alexis Bledel

Drama Supp. Actor: Tom Pelphrey"
Princess Principal,"This year has been pretty forgettable as far as TV goes to be honest. Stranger Things and the Leftovers have been the only things to have blown me away with quality. That being said, those are the two shows I'm genuinely terrified will be snubbed. I've heard The Crown and The Handmaiden's Tale are great but haven't seen them so can't judge. "
Princess Principal,"Archer: Dreamland deserves an Emmy for visuals alone. 

"
Princess Principal,Huh. Ironfist got nominated for the title card. That's interesting. 
Princess Principal,The Young Pope is coming back for season 2 though.
Princess Principal,"I know it's a long shot and I don't even know if it has been submitted, but Doctor Who really deserves a mention. Series 10 isn't over yet (ends in about 3 weeks), but it has been an amazing ride so far. It might not be as consistent as other shows, but episodes like Oxygen and Extremis are really something else. 

Pearl Mackie needs to be recognized as an Outstanding Lead Actress. She excels at portraying Bill, a wonderfully written and rounded character. Her performances in ""The Pilot"" and in ""Lie of the Land"" have been stellar.

"
Princess Principal,I don't usually care about the Emmys but I will be legitimately angry if Carrie Coon doesn't win.  She is incredible.
Princess Principal,Have you watched the other actors in the other shows or are you the type of guy to say something or someone deserves an award even though you haven't seen the competition?
Princess Principal,The Emmys are usually pretty good to shows in their last season.
Princess Principal,It's the 8th highest rated tv show of all time on Metacritic. It better get fucking nominated.
Princess Principal,No nominations for Season 1 is fine?? How about Best Actress for Carrie Coon or Best Writing for Two Bots and a Helicopter?
Princess Principal,"Critics love the show now, I'd be very surprised if Coon and the show itself don't get nominated. I hope Theroux gets a nom too but it will be tough."
Princess Principal,"Vera and Freddy Both performed incredibly. Vera did such a fantastic job with subtleties distinguishing Norma and ""mother""."
Princess Principal,I think it's because Orphan Black just started its season (it is late this year)
Princess Principal,"> Rhea Seehorn

Ugh she got passed over last year in the Game of Thrones tide. I'm afraid this year we'll have the WestWorld wave"
Princess Principal,"> Better Call Saul

This has been a pretty dire year for television overall, but Better Call Saul really stepped up its game.  Both Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean deserve supporting noms.

Someone also mentioned Vice Principals, and it, too, definitely deserves some recognition as a weird, fun little gem.  
"
Princess Principal,"> House of Cards

Really? I've heard the new season rather weak. I'm currently on Eps. 4, but already I'm questioning some decisions. "
Princess Principal,"If I recall correctly, this year's nominations will be in respect to season 4? In which case I would call for a nomination for the actress of Taystee, especially for the last two episodes"
Princess Principal,I think Rob should get one for Hero or Hate Crime too 
Princess Principal,"The Leftovers submitted 4 eps for directing but not the first one you mentioned. Westworld submitted the finale for Jon Nolan. Mr. Robot submitted the 2 part premiere. The Americans submitted ""The Soviet Division"" and Twin peaks isn't eligible :)"
Princess Principal,"> Patriot isn't going to get any nominations even though it's funnier than most comedies and handles character development much better than most dramas.

:(
"
Princess Principal,"Ok, this is a pretty fucking awesome list. But I do have to disagree with **I Love Dick**, especially the Kevin Bacon nom, I thought his performance in that was laughably bad. Otherwise though, good list. "
Princess Principal,Good list but you missed Master of None which i think is lock for nomination for best comedy series.
Princess Principal,Him and Coon need Emmy nods dammit
Princess Principal,Yes! I thought they were incredible this season even if the plot was odd.
Princess Principal,He's a lock.
Princess Principal,"bruh, I've watched the entire first season of Legion twice so far and I'm thinking about giving it another rewatch before the end of the year. Honestly nothing in the past 3 years tops Legion for me (except for maybe Black Mirror). I really want to see it get nominated and win some awards, but at times I feel like the emmys are so old fashion. Its like the people who vote on these things are old people who love politics and period dramas. Like...can we go a year without Homeland, Veep, Downton Abbey etc. getting all the noms? smh. "
Princess Principal,"Yes, so much so that I will now follow Noah Hawley in anything he does. I keep looking for a replacement ""experience"" type series to fill the void until season two, but I've found that I watch them all already, and there really is nothing else like it. Hopefully it inspired more creators to let loose their own imaginations and we can get more of this type of show. "
Princess Principal,What'd you think of Leftovers S3?
Princess Principal,It is not eligible this year
Princess Principal,"Yes, both Netflix and Amazon have been nominated and won before. "
Princess Principal,But I don't see them nominated the series in Best Drama this year. This season was off...
Princess Principal,"Acting categories (except for guest) are done off single episodes and not the seasons. for eg. Let's say Carrie Coon was gonna get nominated for The Leftovers. it would be:

* Carrie Coon - The Leftovers (episode: The Book of Nora)

They do this because sometimes lead and supporting roles switch depending on the episode. I didn't do it in my post because I didn't have much time to pick the episodes. "
Princess Principal,Maybe your opinions aren't the only ones that matter?
Princess Principal,Not eligible.
Princess Principal,"It's a shame she hasn't been nominated for every season of the show. In my opinion she's the best actress on television right now...And has been for 5 years. 

"
Princess Principal,"Yeah, I love GOT, but she's just meh. I've seen worse but she's no crown jewel. Considering all the great performances we got from the Evan Rachel Wood, Katherine Langford, Thandie Newton, Claire Foy, etc., it would be very insulting if one of them was knocked out of the slot for Clarke."
Princess Principal,not eligible.
Princess Principal,And this is us!! 
Princess Principal,If Audrey Plaza doesn't win for Legion I'm rioting. Who's with me?
Princess Principal,"> This year has been pretty forgettable as far as TV goes to be honest.

* Legion?
* American Gods?
* Twin Peaks: The Return?
* Big Little Lies?
* Master of None?

and that's just for 2017. I could add Westworld and You're the Worst to the lot. Bruh, I think this is the best year for television since 2014. What you watching? "
Princess Principal,"I don't know in what world do you live but this year has been phenomenal for TV. We've got Big Little Lies, The Leftovers, Silicon Valley, Twin Peaks, Legion, The Americans, American Gods, Master of None, The Good Place, This Is Us, House of Cards, Better Call Saul, Fargo and a lot more than that. This year has been competitive."
Princess Principal,last I checked it wasn't. Sorry. :(
Princess Principal,"I'm in the same boat. I don't even care if The Leftovers doesn't win best drama series, though it deserves to. Just give Carrie & Justin the recognition they deserve."
Princess Principal,I've seen most of the stuff OP listed. Their performances were just hands down the best.
Princess Principal,"I've seen almost all of the stuff on the list, and I totally agree. I would add Christopher Eccleston to the list as well."
Princess Principal,8th highest rated season and unrightfully so in my opinion. Season 3 was good but definitely didn't deserve a 98/100.
Princess Principal,"I loved season 1 but a lot of people were split on it, so I understand."
Princess Principal,"The TV Academy doesn't really care what critics think. Critics loved the first 3 seasons of The Americans, too, but they only nominated the 4th."
Princess Principal,only Thandie Newton has a chance for Westworld.
Chihayafuru,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Chihayafuru,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Chihayafuru,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Chihayafuru,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Chihayafuru,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Chihayafuru,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Chihayafuru,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Chihayafuru,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Chihayafuru,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Chihayafuru,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Chihayafuru,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Chihayafuru,Needs more Jojo
Chihayafuru,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Chihayafuru,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Chihayafuru,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Chihayafuru,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Chihayafuru,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Chihayafuru,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Chihayafuru,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Chihayafuru,Madoka magica ! 
Chihayafuru,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Chihayafuru,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Chihayafuru,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Chihayafuru,Awh no your lie about in April 
Chihayafuru,This is actually a really decent list
Chihayafuru,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

"
Chihayafuru,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Chihayafuru,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Chihayafuru,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Chihayafuru,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Chihayafuru,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Chihayafuru,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Chihayafuru,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Chihayafuru,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Chihayafuru,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Chihayafuru,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Chihayafuru,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Chihayafuru,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Chihayafuru,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Chihayafuru,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Chihayafuru,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Chihayafuru,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Chihayafuru,"Your lie in april.

Chihayafuru,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Chihayafuru,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Chihayafuru,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Chihayafuru,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Chihayafuru,Black Clover?
Chihayafuru,.
Chihayafuru,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Chihayafuru,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Chihayafuru,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Chihayafuru,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Chihayafuru,[deleted]
Chihayafuru,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Chihayafuru,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Chihayafuru,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Chihayafuru,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Chihayafuru,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Chihayafuru,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Chihayafuru,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Chihayafuru,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Chihayafuru,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Chihayafuru,[deleted]
Chihayafuru,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Chihayafuru,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Chihayafuru,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."
Chihayafuru,[deleted]
Chihayafuru,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Chihayafuru,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Chihayafuru,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Chihayafuru,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Chihayafuru,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Chihayafuru,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Chihayafuru,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Chihayafuru,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Chihayafuru,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Chihayafuru,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Chihayafuru,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Chihayafuru,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Chihayafuru,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Chihayafuru,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Chihayafuru,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Chihayafuru,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Chihayafuru,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Chihayafuru,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Chihayafuru,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Chihayafuru,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Chihayafuru,This show was hilarious
Chihayafuru,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Chihayafuru,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Chihayafuru,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Chihayafuru,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Chihayafuru,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Chihayafuru,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Chihayafuru,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Chihayafuru,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Chihayafuru,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Oh My JUMP!,"While it has all the fundamentals of Dark, i dont think this show quite captured the “spark” that Dark was so famous for. Too many one dimensional characters for my liking, so above average at best."
Oh My JUMP!,"Dark just copied that Ethan Hawke movie ""Predestination"""
Oh My JUMP!,"I’m a big fan of Dark, so I’ve started this but after watching 2 episodes I have to admit it hasn’t really grabbed me yet, I’ll give it one more episode, but tbh I’m just about ready to tap out."
Oh My JUMP!,"Would be interesting to see how it performs for people who have NOT seen Dark think that is likely the most important thing.       

Lot of Dark fans will likely watch it even if they dont think its good"
Oh My JUMP!,"This show has a much longer slow burn than Dark S1, because Dark’s premise started immediately (time travel). You don’t even get to anywhere near the premise until episode 5 or 6."
Oh My JUMP!,"It feels like they spent more time setting up the mysteries than actually creating intriguing characters, everything feels very storyboarded and stiff. But I’m also only on episode two so will watch at least four before I make a judgement. I like all the actors enough and the setting is fantastic. I just wish they could draw me into the atmosphere more, it feels like everything is just place to place with nice outside shots and then people meeting and having mysterious conversations."
Oh My JUMP!,"I didn't see Dark (though now I want to watch it). I LOVED the earlier 1899 eps, but the ending is falling flat for me (I'm in the middle of the final ep now... and as you can see I'm on Reddit on my second monitor). 

I really don't like the twists that came in the latter half (even though they're being explained in this final ep), I wish we knew a lot LOT LOT more about the characters, and the pacing just seems to be totally off. It feels almost as if the entire Lost, all the seasons, were packed into 8 eps."
Oh My JUMP!,"I suppose this isn't entirely surprising.  The way they wrote Axe out was open-ended enough for his return, and I imagine that was intentional since he left due to his wife dying.  Presumably, the writers were always hoping he'd come back, and now he's at a point where he wants to act again.

As someone who watched the show up until his departure, I'm glad to see he's wanting to work again as Damian Lewis is a fantastic actor, but I think my interest in the show ended when he left as the show was already on a steep decline and spinning its wheels anyways.  I don't think I'll be returning when he does.  Axe repeatedly outsmarting Chuck's legal maneuvers was already getting old a few seasons back."
Oh My JUMP!,Even having him back this show is well past it’s best before date.
Oh My JUMP!,"Confirmed on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*! Lewis will appear as Axe for 6 out of the 12 episodes of *Billions* season 7, which will premiere later this year."
Oh My JUMP!,"I think Showtime should give its stars a few seasons off in the middle to load manage, we know it's going 9-11, it keeps their legs fresh"
Oh My JUMP!,"How the hell did this show get 7 seasons.

In my opinion the max a show could go on for without running stale is 6 seasons depending on how good and engaging the story is."
Oh My JUMP!,"The show was over when Paul Giamatti lost all that weight, lol."
Oh My JUMP!,Yes. This might just save the show. Prince might be a subtle megalomaniac but he's not a protagonist and couldn't actually play a villain role.
Oh My JUMP!,"And now, I'll come back to watch Billions again."
Oh My JUMP!,"meh, show rapidly went to arse after season 4"
Oh My JUMP!,"For me he was the main reason that i watched. Guess i need to catch up on that latest season without him.

Just really enjoy Giamatti and him playing off eachother."
Oh My JUMP!,Oh man I thought Damian Lewis legally couldn't exist in a series past Season 2
Oh My JUMP!,"The showrunner of this show is an incredible douchebag, he is literally milking this one to eternity, amazed people still watch it."
Oh My JUMP!,This is still on?
Oh My JUMP!,Didn't this show end?
Oh My JUMP!,[deleted]
Oh My JUMP!,Lame.
Oh My JUMP!,and yet season 6 is nowhere available in Brazil
Oh My JUMP!,Of course he is.
Oh My JUMP!,Whose Damian Lewis this is a picture of captain winters
Oh My JUMP!,Probably because Soder quit The Bonfire. Damien was inspired by his dedication to Billions
Oh My JUMP!,What??!!!?? Time to jump back in!
Oh My JUMP!,Okay great… only on season 2 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Oh My JUMP!,well they announced a Millions and Trillions spin-off so I imagine they will end Billions and then send some of the characters off to those shows or at least some crossovers.
Oh My JUMP!,If you're a fan of Lewis you should watch A Spy Among Friends. I thought it was pretty good.
Oh My JUMP!,"Losing Axe was inevitable eventually, albeit the timing and *how* it eventually came about were infinitely more tragic with the death of Helen McCrory. Even though (much like another Damian Lewis series) I think *Billions* should've ended long ago, I'm glad he's coming back towards what will (hopefully) be its end. 

The introduction of Corey Stoll's Mike Prince was a solid enough remedy to losing Axe, although I think the season's overarching story and somewhat too-late criticism of billionaires left the series without a very clear sense of purpose or place; it spent too long painting its ***characters*** as flawed themselves, but doing nothing to criticize or otherwise caricature their ridiculously wealthy lives like, say, *Succession* does. More than that, it went the opposite direction, painting the Axe Capital cast of characters as universally ""cool"" (excepting 1-2 *Big Bang Theory*\-style ""nerd"" caricatures written in later); they like ""cool"" things, drive ""cool"" cars, and the entire cast speaks fluently in that *Billions*\-patented shorthand of ""cool"" references (to make you feel ""cool"" too whenever you recognize the reference), even though sometimes the dialogue feels like Sorkin's zippy *West Wing* walk-and-talk writing--but if Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, and Bradley Whitford were constantly trying to work references to Steve McQueen and Paul Newman movies into literally every exchange about foreign and domestic policy. 

I really enjoyed the Mike Prince arc of the most recent seasons, especially early on when we're as skeptical and in the dark about his goals and motives as everybody else in the cast; I wasn't a fan of the outcome, but I think at the beginning the idea of basically an anti-Axe who appears genuinely preoccupied with using his wealth and resources to improve the lives of others and his community was inspired. He couldn't replicate Lewis'/Axe's presence, so they didn't even bother trying, and somehow managed a delicate balance between slowly winning the cast (and audience, by extension) over to his character's seemingly utopian ""vision,"" while still acknowledging his god complex and major flaws as a person/husband/etc. 

That said, I think bringing Damian Lewis back has a lot of potential, but could just as easily topple things just as this new version of *Billions* had found its footing. At the very least, it will be good to see Wags' reaction. I still think the series should've ended with like, the second/third season (honestly, maybe even the first, if they'd left it a little less open-ended). Like with Lewis' time on *Homeland*, I think it could've been a phenomenal character study as a limited or even anthology series, but it's still been solidly entertaining and certainly doesn't wast such a talented cast."
Oh My JUMP!,"Truly.

Season 5 was already a complete re-tread.  Season 6 was just a complete waste of time.  I'm genuinely shocked they got a season 7."
Oh My JUMP!,It's going what sir?
Oh My JUMP!,Showtime will just keep milking and milking their shows until there’s literally nothing left but dust
Oh My JUMP!,"I don't know if you have heard but, in addition to Season 7, Showtime is launching FOUR spinoff shows: Billions: London, Billions: Miami, Millions, and Trillions."
Oh My JUMP!,Show ended for me after season 2. The writers just kinda lost it after that.
Oh My JUMP!,one word: Showtime
Oh My JUMP!,from what I recall they always planned to make 7 seasons
Oh My JUMP!,"you mean in season 2, widely considered one of the best seasons?"
Oh My JUMP!,it's the final season
Oh My JUMP!,"They are merging with Paramount+ so there is no strategy, they will cease to exist as an independent entity soon"
Oh My JUMP!,Showtime really knows how to beat a dead horse.
Oh My JUMP!,"And Life, Band of Brothers, maybe wolf hall."
Oh My JUMP!,"It might be something a casual fan wouldn't understand, but clearly u/RusevReigns is referring to the role 9/11 plays in Bobby Axelrod's backstory and the rich lore of the *Billions* universe. Understandable that this might go over your head, as to be fair, you have to have a pretty high IQ (or just a lot of spare time) to get all the references in such an intelligently written show as *Billions*.

/s"
Oh My JUMP!,"I think they’re saying “we know Showtime will run the show too long, 9-11 seasons, so why not give the actors a break in the middle of that?”

I enjoyed the first few seasons of Billions but it lost its mojo and I dropped Showtime"
Oh My JUMP!,9-11 seasons
Oh My JUMP!,"Showtime is the worst network outside of CBS when it comes to never letting their shows end gracefully. And they never do. They always keep going and going until Showtime just cancels them unceremoniously. 

Dexter was the closest, but that was shot in the foot because they were planning for the inevitable reboot and then the reboot was shot in the foot because they were planning for a spin-off (that now isn't going to happen.)"
Oh My JUMP!,I fucking burst out laughing when I saw the Yellowjackets creators touting a five season arc. They were running out of ideas at the end of *season one*
Oh My JUMP!,I can think of at least three showtime shows where they forced me the viewer to make the call and decide to stop watching a former favorite show of mine because it needed to be put out to pasture.
Oh My JUMP!,Cowardly not to do a spin off called hundreds and thousands.
Oh My JUMP!,Ew
Oh My JUMP!,Clancy Brown even said in an interview that to cut corners they fired the writers who made season 1 what it was.
Oh My JUMP!,Pretty much how I felt. Chuck motherfucking rhoades
Oh My JUMP!,I made it to season 6 but quit half way through. The writing is horrific.
Oh My JUMP!,In one of the seasons there was a writers strike. I don't remember which season but it was with the one of the storylines where they poison the chipotle .
Oh My JUMP!,People need to stop planning such long shows.
Oh My JUMP!,You sure about that? Thought it was last season after Lewis left.
Oh My JUMP!,Bummer. Can't wait for the send off then.
Oh My JUMP!,I think the idea is to just copy Marvel and the Sheridanverse. Whenever you strike something mildly popular keep giving people what they want.
Oh My JUMP!,his seasons of Homeland are good too.
Oh My JUMP!,"Of course, but I would assume a fan has seen these already. A Spy Among Friends is very recent."
Oh My JUMP!,"I enjoyed him in *Wolf Hall*, and had totally forgotten about *Life* until your comment (I think for a couple years I would either conflate or confuse *Life* with that David Duchovny series *Aquarius*, even though the premises are totally different). 

I'd also recommend *The Escapist* (plus you get Brian Cox planning a prison breakout). 

*Band of Brothers*, however, will always be peak Damian Lewis. Between that and *Billions*, I feel like he's even better when his character has a sort of partner or best friend-type to play off of."
Oh My JUMP!,*maybe* Wolf Hall? that show is a bomb
Oh My JUMP!,I thought you meant the Eddie Murphy/Martin Lawrence movie Life. I have seen that a ton of times and I couldn't picture who Damian Lewis played.
Oh My JUMP!,Is that like a terrorist Four Seasons?
Oh My JUMP!,Shameless went on wayyyy too long.
Oh My JUMP!,">Showtime is the worst network outside of CBS 

And now they will be one! Though I'm expecting a content purge as they consolidate."
Oh My JUMP!,They already made too many seasons of Shameless.
Oh My JUMP!,"Wow, yeah I loved season 1, and then 2 was still pretty good and it kept getting worse after that"
Oh My JUMP!,I didn't know that. What a bunch of muppets. Knowing showtime they are gonna keep this running for 5 more seasons till they eventually cancel it when the writing gets even more god awful
Oh My JUMP!,Very reminiscent of how AMC treated The Walking Dead following a hit first season.
Oh My JUMP!,"I mean, he lost a lot of weight from s1 to s2, Chuck starts dieting/bjj"
Oh My JUMP!,🎥 ⏰ 🥊 ☠️ 🐎
Oh My JUMP!,Good? He was Homeland. The second season interrogation episode with him and Claire Danes is the most brilliant two person scene acting among all time tv .
Oh My JUMP!,"The writer's room also went from a complex understanding of the worlds they were writing about to just using generic tropes about the rich. Tropes are awesome, but not when used as a replacement for knowing what you are doing."
Oh My JUMP!,">more seasons till they eventually cancel it when the writing gets even more god awful

you mean when viewership decreases below profitable levels, it's pretty clear at this point they don't care for quality at all"
Oh My JUMP!,"I meant last year, though he says he only lost 15 lbs. Maybe it was the beard change as well. Either way was trying to be funny, lol."
Oh My JUMP!,Would love some bloopers
Oh My JUMP!,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
Oh My JUMP!,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
Oh My JUMP!,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
Oh My JUMP!,If they don’t reenact the musical alternate ending I’m gonna be very disappointed.
Oh My JUMP!,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
Oh My JUMP!,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
Oh My JUMP!,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
Oh My JUMP!,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
Oh My JUMP!,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. 😭
Oh My JUMP!,Gotta get my fix!
Oh My JUMP!,Cool advert
Oh My JUMP!,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
Oh My JUMP!,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
Oh My JUMP!,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
Oh My JUMP!,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
Oh My JUMP!,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
Oh My JUMP!,[removed]
Oh My JUMP!,[removed]
Oh My JUMP!,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
Oh My JUMP!,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"

Sisyphus,Netflix has a stranglehold on korean or asian films for American streaming.  It's going to get nuts in a few years when others figure it out.

Behind Her Eyes, the biggest victim is Adam :(
Behind Her Eyes,"Now that I know that Rob was Adele, I'm surprised Adele wasn't funnier."
Behind Her Eyes,[deleted]
Behind Her Eyes,"Why would Rob be so in love or obsessed with David? Why wouldn't he just dump David as soon as he took over Adele's body and keep the fortune to himself, free to get high for the rest of his life without scrutiny?"
Behind Her Eyes,"The supernatural twist basically makes the show memorable, otherwise it's quite usual domestic thriller. In the book, the supernatural elements are kept pretty vague until the final chapters. Whereas the show does a better job in introducing them slowly but surely."
Behind Her Eyes,It was bad and I hated Louise. She got herself killed over some dick 😂like she got involved with some shit that didn’t concern her in the slightest and she was so stupid in the end I just didn’t care at all. It wasn’t believable at all.
Behind Her Eyes,[deleted]
Behind Her Eyes,Girl got herself killed over some dick 🤷🏻‍♀️
Behind Her Eyes,The ending was just...what the fuck was even the point of the journey?
Behind Her Eyes,[deleted]
Behind Her Eyes,"So how did David straighten things out with the police? I didn't understand that. Did he just go up to them and say: ""hey listen this woman from London sent you a letter telling you I dumped a body in a well but you shouldn't believe her cause it's all a misunderstanding!""? Why was he so relaxed with Louise sending that letter to the police in the first place? I really didn't get that. I would be livid if someone falsely accused me of murder."
Behind Her Eyes,"This series wasn’t perfect, but it delivered the best twist ending in a long time!
At first, I rolled my eyes when astral projection was first introduced - but then it all started to make sense. I couldn’t figure out how Louise was going to get into the house to save Adele, & it took me a minute to have it register when she blanked out & then knew where the spare key was hidden. I didn’t know astral projectors could switch bodies(admittedly my knowledge in that area is pretty limited!) so it just starting dawning on me when Louise got to Adele. Than it all made such perfect sense! Rob was a very troubled soul, & calling him a psychopath is not a stretch. Yes, he loved Adele, but he also envied her. She was kind to him, & certainly the only friend he ever had. But a psychopath doesn’t let things like that deter him. We were clued in that he was gay early on, which served the plot well, because it eliminated the pitfall of any sexual relationship between Rob & Adele. He had known only rejection & cruelty all his life, so the beautiful, kind, trusting young heiress Adele must have seemed like a fairy tale princess to him. We saw his attraction to David early on, as well as the fear that David would take Adele out of his life. Drug rehab was a joke to Rob - he liked taking drugs & never intended to quit. When he was able to escape his miserable life at his sister’s & actually go to Adele’s estate, it was a dream come true. He wanted to stay there, but knew it would never happen. David & Adele were in love. They were getting married. When David was there, she only had eyes for him. And Rob had his eyes on David, too. So, when He learned astral projection & found people might be able to switch, he went for it. As Rob, he had nothing. As Adele, he had money, an estate, instant position in society - and David. I don’t think David knew that Adele was really Rob. He was a doctor, & his scientific mind would not accept astral projection & body switching. All he knew was that his wife was changed, different, & he likely chalked it up to mental illness, hence all the meds. It sounded like he knew she had done drugs, but not that she was currently shooting up between her toes. But he sensed this was not really Adele, just as Adam quickly sensed that this Louise was not really his mother. Of course, at some point David will also realize that. 
The fascinating thing is, Rob could go on like this indefinitely, if he laid off the smack, learned some discretion & played his cards right. Who says only vampires can live forever?"
Behind Her Eyes,I binge watched it...the ending ruined it for me. If I wanted to watch The Skeleton Key again I would.
Behind Her Eyes,"Louise makes me want to stop watching the whole time, she makes several of the most dipshit decisions.."
Behind Her Eyes,Why did Louise go into Adeles body though? She could've just chilled and then any chance Adele/Rob came out of her body she could steal it back. That's a good plot for a season 2.......reveal that Louise's soul escaped and is floating around waiting for the chance to get her body back lol
Behind Her Eyes,"This whole thing was so aesthetically pleasing, I watched all episodes in one day.  Adele was mesmerizing to watch.  When Lo said she’s tired of bing a good person I felt that.  Adam took a lose."
Behind Her Eyes,"Louise was an idiot. I mean a PURE idiot. Girl what are you doing? You're doing too much as a side chick, you doing too much as a crime sleuth, you doing too much as a captain save a hoe. And why tf are you tryna save a hoe that you received multiple warnings to stay away from and you just found out that she threw someone down a well, threatened somebody else's cat, been astral spying on you, and manipulated the hell out or you. Why you sooooo dumb? And Rob, joke's on you. You dont know nothing about twist outs, wash and go's, the importance of sleeping in a scarf or on satin, or any of the other weight that comes with being a black lady. Also, how is it good to impersonate someone by immediately being an asshole? Get your life together, asshole. K I'm done, this show made me mad but I enjoyed it lol. Great acting all around."
Behind Her Eyes,"I get the sense this would have been much more effective if it was adapted as a film, rather than a six hour series. A lot of the unnecessary red herrings could be cut, and the resulting need to focus might have forced the David/Rob relationship to be telegraphed a bit more clearly."
Behind Her Eyes,i liked it honestly though i can understand why some people probably dont. overall i think that the show is saved by the incredible actors as well as some of the settings/sets of the show. i hope that there isnt a season 2 because as a stand alone mini series it really isnt too bad at all and its easy to finish binge watching.
Behind Her Eyes,"The ending pissed me off because it went for an ending where the villain ultimately wins after spending most of its time giving us reasons to love those characters. Rob isn’t really properly set up as anti-hero, so when he pulls off his diabolical plot you don’t exactly feel good about it at all. Idk I guess I thought it would feel more like Gone Girl where, yeah of course Amy is evil, but a part of you still sort of wants her to win? I ended up just regretting I watched this series. Louise, Adele, Adam, and David all deserved better or to at the very least eventually see Rob get what he deserved."
Behind Her Eyes,"I realized it was Rob inside of Adele when they show that scene of him telling Adele he’d found something new, “Adele” and Rob were too similar, the OG Adele didn’t want to try heroin, and rob knew how to cook well. Rob also displayed obvious symptoms of narcissism throughout the story, from stealing money from his sister to saying he didn’t even want to quit heroin, also displaying massive amounts of jealousy towards Adele’s lifestyle."
Behind Her Eyes,"Why does David give ""Adele"" that old crap phone and credit card in one of the earlier episode? Did they explain why he confiscated them or why exactly he rang her at the same time every day?"
Behind Her Eyes,I loved it. It could have been an episode or 2 shorter though
Behind Her Eyes,I didn’t really understand why Rob did what he did...was it because he was after Adele’s money or because he’s in love with David?
Behind Her Eyes,All im saying is the cops would have gotten to that house faster than i would have if i was louise. Like they had to have all been at lunch
Behind Her Eyes,"Is it really just a coincidence David was at Adele's house the night of the fire? Do we think David set fire to Adele's house while she was astral projecting elsewhere? 

They mentioned his family was not well off. He could've been looking for a way to access Adele's family fortune. I know the writers meant to make him look like a villain to throw us off, but I still find there to be something off about him, even after finishing the show."
Behind Her Eyes,"Can someone explain what were Louise’s night terrors about? She saw pills spilling on the floor and held someone’s hand as they seemed they were dying. At first I thought it was her Mom’s death :( but at the end of the show I am wondering if it has anything to do with Louise’s real death in Adele’s body. Louise’s death scene on the bed looked very similar to Louise’s nightmares, at least visually. Was Louise having a premonition?"
Behind Her Eyes,i thought that David Fucked ROBB in the House and adele found out about them :v well fuck me iwas wrong
Behind Her Eyes,"Lmao, I'm sorry but what was Louise planning to do when she astral projected into the house to save the supposed Adele, like we all know she was just going to witness a suicide. 

I guess in a way though it might make sense, since she may be trying to observe a way to get in the house, but no she just had to go watch her lay there."
Behind Her Eyes,I must have missed something that said Louise was definitely dead? Is she? Otherwise it would have been good to keep her in a coma or something so there was the possibility of her coming back for retribution in season 2.
Behind Her Eyes,"Okay just finished binging it from last night (loved it!) but a few questions ..

SPOILERS

1) I notice Adele wears white mostly ... kinda like how they did in the rehab/psych hospital ... this must be some kind of metaphor for being trapped. Anything think this too?

2) Adele says you can only astral project if you can visualize the place you’ve been to ... would this mean that I’d you’re blind you wouldn’t be able to?

3) why would Adele/rob want to take over Louise’s body anyway? Start over again with David? He’ll be sure to notice the second time that she’s not acting like Louise just like Adele wasn’t acting like Adele

4) Didnt rob/Adele love being rich , part of why he took over Adele’s body .. so he ditched all of that to be Louise ? Was it all just for David after all?

5) did rob ever actual care for the real Adele? His notebook/journal sounded sincere .."
Behind Her Eyes,"Not gonna lie the ending and last half of this show is so stupid. Out of nowhere they introduce this supernatural element, and then they use it to make a mindfuck ending that is actually super stupid and makes no sense. We literally know that all you can do when you are in that supernatural state is that you can observe and watch people. Wtf was Louisa thinking? She would go in that state and watch Adele burn? Like??? They literally made her so dumb at the end, just for a twist. They could have easily made Adele(Rob) manipulate her more to distrust David again and then trick her into doing that thing. Not to mention Adele killed an innocent man, why would she save Adele? What was the reason?"
Behind Her Eyes,so did adele set up the fire or was it truly an accident??! now that i know the rest wasn’t her i’m conflicted
Behind Her Eyes,"Great review. This series was in some ways something quite special and unique... And in others it missed the mark... It's not that I'm upset without a happy ending, it's that the plot/dialogue is at many points just really weird in a sort of mediocre kind of way... Something about the series felt special for sure, though."
Behind Her Eyes,The ending was way too similar to Us by Jordan Peele
Behind Her Eyes,"Why would louise set herself up for the Astral switch at the end ? Seemed too unreal to be true. She could have waited for the cops or simply broken in another way, Adele simply got lucky. 
Apart from that scene, pretty gripping."
Behind Her Eyes,This show was a total waste of my time. So dragged out and the acting gave me nothing. Script was so bad and unengaging as well.
Behind Her Eyes,"the show is little ridiculous to want us to believe that  that character would do all that for a man they just met I'd say it's homophobia but tbh it's just bad soapy writing, both from the show and orginal source. I wish the show /book had laid more groundwork where the motivation to be this committed to be with david abd wanting his love made sense. Otherwise it's just oh those unbalanced gay ppl they will do anything to get their object of obsession. And also does this mean the diary was also fake and only there to mislead and set a trap to lead to the final event. In that case why the missing pages at the end of the diary? I mean all in all half the ppl would be satisfy with the pet food otherwise laugh would just laugh their ass off at the ridiculousness of it all but I guess at least it's something out of the box lol"
Behind Her Eyes,[deleted]
Behind Her Eyes,"Just curious, is Louis(Adele's body) actually dead, or in a coma, or in prison?"
Behind Her Eyes,Man I hate it! I want my money back netflix.
Behind Her Eyes,"Can someone confirm why David was always giving Adele/Rob meds and checking in on her whereabouts etc? I’m confused as to why Rob as Adele acted so strangely all that time and just made David suspicious? In hindsight, wouldn’t it make more sense of Rob to put an act on as Adele and try super hard to be like her?"
Behind Her Eyes,"makes me think, if David wasn't such a good looking charming guy, Rob probably would have killed him so that he can stay with Adele forever."
Behind Her Eyes,Let’s not forget that Rob could also cook and that’s why he was constantly making meals as Adele trying to get David to be in love with him. Just a fun little detail I missed on my first watch!
Behind Her Eyes,"I’m surprised no one is talking about Adele (rob) calling louise and Louise telling Adele what David is going to do and that she told the police. None of this would of started if Adele didnt tell rob hoe to astral project. it freaked me out when Adele was smiling In Louise’s body I think that was the freakiest parts. Plus the part when adele was picking up Adam from the dads house in the last part and Adam knowing quickly that’s something up with his mom he didn’t even run to her like he usually does, plus Adele(Louise) didn’t even hug or have open arms with him. I’ve gotta say rob is pretty F’ed up honestly thinking about It I wondered why Adele was so happy and fun loving with David in the past and in the present she looked like dead in side. I knew something was off and realized that Adeles body soul is robs, I wish Adele never told rob about astral projecting. Rob was a vibrant character as well in the beginning and it’s interesting how in Adele’s body he’s very monotone. I congratulate the writers bc I’m still shocked it’s definitely expect the unexpected type of show . Poor David and Adam is what I gotta say. Honestly I wish Louise had stopped seeing him the minute they had sex but she continued to do it while being Friends did with Adele ughhh come on Louise I know your lonely but your ex literally did the same thing to you for another women. It’s also interesting that David waited 10 years to say anything?? And what happened to adeles body ? Is she dead ? Robs body probably died from the “overdose” and fall. Thinking back in the past David should of left Adele long time ago and call the police he literally just finished school and had to deal with a messed up life?? It’s also interesting that he told Louise everything in public ??? Like ok bud u trust her after everything ??? There were parts that were super confusing for example why did Adele give Louise Adams book that still baffles me cuz she new Louise was banging her man ?? Omg I just finished this show as u can tell!!"
Behind Her Eyes,"
What I was confused about was the fact that David would call home to see where Adele was if he wasn’t in love with her any more"
Behind Her Eyes,Ok wild thought: couldn’t Louise in Adele’s body astro-project out before Adele’s body died... and then just hang around Rob in Louise’s body and wait until rob astro-projected next and jump back in?
Behind Her Eyes,"Didn't know anything about the book or the show prior to watching it on Netflix. It's slow but I am a fan of those type of shows so it did well for me. For a few hours.

But the ending is such a shit-show that I am still pissed off that I spent 6 hours of my life watching that crap. 

The moment I saw some sparkling thing flying around I just could not believe what I was seeing. Up to that part it was a good, slow-building possibly shocking crime story which could turn really interesting.

Instead, we got a C-level half SF half mystery show with an embarassing ending. Louis lying by the door, falling asleep and trying to get into Adele's head to do what exactly? Tell her to get out? Just call the fucking fire brigade, jesus.

Besides for the show ending so hillarious, the characters were great, especially Adele with her crazy AF facial expressions etc. 

2/10"
Behind Her Eyes,**headache* uggggggggggggghhhh!!! 😩
Behind Her Eyes,Has anyone ever experienced astral projection IRL? Growing up my dad would claim he went to pay a visit to so and so or even me when I was in boarding school.. One day one of my mum's friends who can also do astral projection came over and asked my dad to stop visiting her and she is perfectly safe..I thought that was all BS as my hometown is a bit bonkers but after watching this show it made me realise maybe my dad was never lying
Behind Her Eyes,"Overall the show was trash, just finished it and I'm on my phone so I don't want to write a long review."
Behind Her Eyes,"So I love the plot twist but didn't like how it was delivered. When Rob body switched with Adele in the flashback, it was consensual, both knew what they were doing. I didn't really get how he was able to do it with Louise unwillingly. I get her body was vacant, and he could just slip right in. But how would she had known to enter Adele's body? The twist is a little similar to the bly manor dream plot, but at least they threw in the ""tucked in"" aspect. This felt way more forced."
Behind Her Eyes,Do you think David ever guessed the truth about her/Rob? If not why did he hate her so much?
Behind Her Eyes,"Rob's care for Adele was entirely rooted in the fact that he saw how kind she truly was as an individual. She signed her entire fortune away to a man , who could really have killed her parents. Rob desperately wanted David to be a nut-case and THEN plot on ways to convince Adele to leave him. He knew Adele really empathised with him as a drug addict from the unfortunate side of town, and capitalised on this knowledge. Ultimately, he did not like being the unfortunate drug addict, he wanted to be a fortunate drug addict. 

I think he was definitely a psychopath and was ready to do anything to keep his relationship with her (Adele). He quickly fell in love with David, like they literally showed him clutching his heart when David touched his shoulder , before going up to meet Adele. 
At some point, I believe he was suicidal because he saw how in love Adele was with David and him (David) with her and knew his proximity to her lifestyle would have to quickly end. So there was no way he could properly infiltrate her life with his physical presence without her ultimately becoming wary of him and remembering where they met and seeing the naivety of her acceptance of him(with David's help ofcourse). He said it so many times that she would soon forget him and the reality is she would have. They would probably have sold that estate , due to the fire that happened. the astral projection moment was his golden ticket. They both couldn't believe it worked but he quickly realised how he could use it to his advantage and trucked the deuces up to Adele. his decision was Adele as a friend or be Adele. His life was pretty miserable and quite frankly as a married woman, he would have had less access to Adele over-time and consequently the proximity to the lifestyle.

Louise and the original Adele were similar I believe. So Rob already had the experience required to manipulate her. I am so mad she didnt just stay her ass at home and let Robele burn to a crisp. I mean she knew the extent of her(his) madness , so why attend a gun fight with a broom? A frail broom at that?! She was a newbie acting like she knew ish and now look!

I was really spun by this series especially because I mostly just had it on in the background when it seemed like just another ""wife finds out her husband is cheating and befriends the mistress to convince her to leave said husband alone"" series. Loved it, definitely didnt see the plot-twist fully unfolding this way!"
Behind Her Eyes,The only thing that peeved me off was Louise’s decision to ASTRAL PROJECT when there’s a bloody fire going on with fake Adele obviously still inside! How useful did they she think she was gonna be whilst not in her body!? Could have avoided the entire body swap tbh. But whatever plot convenience yada yada
Behind Her Eyes,It's like what would happen if Stephen King wrote a Gillian Flynn story without capturing the magic of either.
Behind Her Eyes,"can someone explain to me all of the episodes where Rob talked about being in love with Adele and how he wrote about how in love with her he was? Why was he so obsessed with her in the rehab place, if he was actually obsessed with David? i am so confused"
Behind Her Eyes,Nobody going to talk about how Adele is clearly in the body of a pigeon?
Behind Her Eyes,"Do we ever find out what was on the torn out pages in the notebook?

Also, when Adele is watching David and Louise have their convo and you can tell the orb is in the room, it looks like pink/purple hue, not a blue one."
Behind Her Eyes,Double woman in a refrigerator.
Behind Her Eyes,"Was enjoyable but I hated the ending. The ""depraved homosexual"" trope is too overused. Further still, it would have been much better storytelling if they never explicitly told us that it was Rob all along and instead we were left to wonder."
Behind Her Eyes,"remember in the start when David had to stop traditionally fucking Adele/Rob, & switch to anal (heavily suggested in scene).  Rob can get off being fucked in his/her vag, but every so often he wants a bit of the old anal.  He switched w/Adele, & then Adele to Louise, because he liked the money = access to heroin = player status.  David very suspicious when Adele would cook because Real Adele inept & Rob a helluva cook.

    My Qs:  did David know Adele was Rob?  When & how? What wefe exact deets of Scotland fire & rescue.?

Perhaps the best bad series of the covid stay at home?  But Your Horror neck & neck."
Behind Her Eyes,"The problem with the show was that it dragged. I've read the book too, but found the show just kind of relies on the ending to make the rest of the episodes makes sense.
Plus don't get me started on the slightly homophobic overtones to it..."
Behind Her Eyes,"Need to come here as I really felt bad with the ending. I really felt sorry for the true Adele, her story was the most sad, she lost her parents, she trusted Rob so much yet he betrayed and killed her and she and Adam were so in love yet Rob ruined their chance of happinness.. Adele’s the real and biggest victim :("
Behind Her Eyes,"Rob got himself a free n-worf pass lmao. Rip Adam though, best case scenario is that Rob in Louise's body overdoses or something and social security allows him to go live with his dad and ""Lisa?"""
Behind Her Eyes,"I agree; the supernatural elements were some of the most interesting aspects of the show. I actually thought that Adam knew about Adele’s astral projecting at first because (I forget which scene) Adam tells Louise that she “shines.” If you pay attention, later in the series, “Adele” (really Rob, ew) tells Louise she was waiting to find someone who “shined” too. When Adele said that, Louise markedly pulls back, seeming to recall Adam’s earlier words to her. I thought maybe Adele, Adam, and Rob all “shined” and that’s what formed the basis of that seemingly unbreakable bond. All of the “shining” references instantly made me think of Stephen King and some of his creations—foremost, Castle Rock. Ultimately, the show didn’t go in that direction per se but that theme definitely piqued my interest."
Behind Her Eyes,My question - why the f did Louise go into astral form anyways at the end? It's not like she can physically carry her or wake her. She can only observe.. or am I missing something here?
Behind Her Eyes,"i didn't understand why ""Adele"" had heroin until the ending. super weird but a pretty good series"
Behind Her Eyes,That last look of dismay on his face breaks my heart😭
Behind Her Eyes,"I like to believe that the bird we see at the end hosts her soul. And she is flying around the world trying to find her son again and claim her body back. And once the honeymoon is over and the problems in the relationship with Rob start to surface again,  he starts to travel out of his body again, she will claim her life back."
Behind Her Eyes,"The ending pissed me off so much that when I knew where it was going, I turned it off. I have exactly 11 mins left. Then I went to google and confirmed it and then the whole Rob/Adele thing. Louise really should’ve stayed out of it but beyond that did they really need to kill her? Seriously as a mom, that hit wrenched me and I couldn’t anymore."
Behind Her Eyes,I feel for Adam so much as someone who had her mom die at age 10. The difference is he's never gonna know the truth
Behind Her Eyes,"Nah at least he isn't dead, his live is ruined but is say its Louise s she was a mother"
Behind Her Eyes,"Absolutely. Rob-Adele definitely seemed extra robotic. I know Rob was acting very awkward around David, but it was like RA had 0 personality around David which was super odd, especially if we are to buy the notion that Rob is a master manipulator who managed to have both Adele and Louise completely under his influence like that.

Also another petty but hilarious complaint is accents. I would imagine IRL RA would struggle to have to sound so posh all the time (imitating Adele's accent) and every time RA was alone they'd be all ""fookin ellll"" lol."
Behind Her Eyes,This.
Behind Her Eyes,"Same. But has been ten years since the body swap, so probably he lost his humour while the wedding was rotting"
Behind Her Eyes,Wasn't he receiving medications through Adele that kinda messed him up more?
Behind Her Eyes,"> RIP Lousie, all over some dick

bruh! 😂😂😂"
Behind Her Eyes,"It’s not Adele that’s insane, though—it’s Rob. Rob murdered Adele ten years ago."
Behind Her Eyes,"At first I really liked her, they introduced her as this charismatic funny warm person but she’s awful. They established love for her son and then she never thinks about him again. She uses everyone. She sucks."
Behind Her Eyes,"You mean *spoiler* 


Rob is insane lol. Sold out his friend in a second and turns out he loved David not Adele!"
Behind Her Eyes,Honestly I’d love to see a spin off where Adam finds out it’s her and has to convince David that it’s really Adele
Behind Her Eyes,My theory is that Louise is not dead. She's probably locked up in a psych-ward. That leaves some room for a story line in case they do a second season.
Behind Her Eyes,"😂😂😂 “rip Louise, all over some dick “"
Behind Her Eyes,That kid is 100% going to die
Behind Her Eyes,"I rewatched it and realized the director gave us so many clues. Remember Rob in the first scene about how he's into ""big fat throbbing cock""?"
Behind Her Eyes,Yeah but is it really Adele that’s insane or Rob in Adele’s body?
Behind Her Eyes,It's actually Rob did you watch the ending?
Behind Her Eyes,"You know that adele isn't adele, right? Adele is rob, and now louise is rob"
Behind Her Eyes,"How are so many people missing that all of this was Rob’s doing, not Adele’s?"
Behind Her Eyes,"This bothered me so much!! The ending works well as a mindfuck but it's so poorly executed imo. We're introduced to this guy who clearly has problems but is really sweet and loves his friend Adele, one of the best nicest characters of the show, and then in the last ten minutes  he murders his best friend over some dude that he met two days ago?? Like wtf"
Behind Her Eyes,"They should've introduced flashbacks with the 3 of them earlier, and built up the Rob/David interactions some more. That said, it could be explained away that David is just another fix for him, like heroin, which even after switching bodies, he didn't give up.

What's funny is it's almost as valid an explanation that because she tells him early on not to do heroin in the house, that he saw the path he took as the only possible way to have the 2 biggest things he wanted - wealth and heroin. Because he probably could've stayed with them and experienced the wealth, but without his heroin fix, and it's mentioned throughout the movie that junkies really don't want to quit."
Behind Her Eyes,"All Rob has ever wanted in life is to feel true love and to be loved. This is discussed early on in the show. He comes from a terrible family and craves love. When he meets Adele, and then David later on, he realizes that what they have is real and he is jealous of that more than he cares about the money and beauty. 

It's implied he's got a disorder from his heavily abusive childhood that makes him behave this was"
Behind Her Eyes,Am I the only one who caught him saying to the nurse at the pych ward that he was gay? And he liked dick only? It's not something a straight guy says even for jokes. He's in love with adam.
Behind Her Eyes,"I think there were reasons other than 'love', but there wasn't any build up or hints towards why he would ever do that (other than wanting the money she had? having a nice partner?), other than being a twisted person. But even then I came to that conclusion myself. Maybe not explaining it makes it even more twisted? They could have shown/written it in better though."
Behind Her Eyes,He's an obsessive person. He was obsessed with Adele then to David. It might also tie into his addictive personality. He also mentioned in both flashbacks and his journal that he's never been in love or been loved and loved someone. He thinks David is his first love (really romantic obsession) and will never let him go.
Behind Her Eyes,Every time she continued to get involved with this couple I was like you have a child
Behind Her Eyes,[deleted]
Behind Her Eyes,She was an annoying character but trust me when I say I have met a girl who is like her and gets really involved in other people's business even MORE than Louise.
Behind Her Eyes,"Definitely, I thoroughly enjoyed it but those episodes did not have to be that long."
The Crew,Mr. Roper was a swinger?
The Crew,"That was the known subtext of the show.  
That's what they wanted us to think about when we watched it."
The Crew,That was the whole point of the show?!
The Crew,"I'm shocked, I tell you...*shocked*!"
The Crew,THE swinger
The Crew,upside pineapple!!!!!
The Crew,That image has me wondering if this show takes place in Zuck’s metaverse.
The Crew,Is this like the writers strike that happened in 2007?
The Crew,I'm cool with my TV being disrupted for better working conditions.
The Crew,I really hope the studios get their heads out of their asses and give the crews what they are asking for. It’s ridiculous that it has come to a threat of a strike.
The Crew,Let them strike
The Crew,I’m curious what this means for out of country studios. I’m sure the unions will show support but the IATSE Canada site doesn’t seem to announce anything.  Can’t seem to find any news up here about it either.
The Crew,Love seeing a powerful union make waves. Ive seen a lot of anti union sentiment on Reddit and maybe something like this will get people to see how effective they can be for workers.
The Crew,"🚨🚨🚨🚨THE WORKING CONDITIONS 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨

&#x200B;

The conditions are reminiscent of the late 19th and early 20th century, 12 hour days are the norm, with 14, 16, or even 24 hour days not being uncommon. IATSE Stories (@IA\_Stories) is an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers (and growing by 10,000 daily) publishes anonymous grievances of crew, and has published many cases of over work.

&#x200B;

On Sept. 20, a user reported, “136 days straight. 12-14 hour days. One 24 hour day. All because the people in charge want a pat on the back.”

&#x200B;

And on Sept. 22, another user reported, “I’m working a show \[right now\] where yesterday one of our crew members literally died on set after working a 16 hour day. They were young (40s), had kids, been in the union for years and production barely acknowledged his passing and kept moving along with the show.” That user went on to say they are changing careers and leaving the film industry.

&#x200B;

On Sept 24, another wrote, “While filming overnight at a private residence, a crew member collapsed on the driveway…and an ambulance was called immediately. When a Producer made his way outside, the first thing he asked is if it was possible to move the person to the street. It was obvious the answer was no, so he pivoted and told me to go down the road and intercept the ambulance to make sure the lights and siren were off so as not to interrupt our shoot. Then he casually walked back inside as if nothing was wrong. We didn’t stop filming, and they even asked the EMTs to work quietly so we could keep rolling.”"
The Crew,"The title is somewhat selfish instead of helping a cause. You are asking people to support the crews so people can continue watching TV. I think the title should be more about supporting the crews because of their reasons for striking. This post should be one to gain support for the cause, not because someone will have their TV interrupted."
The Crew,"I am former nine year IA member. 

My current job supports you guys. It may hurt me in the short term if you strike. 

Go get them. Solidarity."
The Crew,"Good! Sometimes people talk about unionization like it’s some silver bullet. Problems don’t stop existing just because workers join unions. It takes continued action like this, right here, to keep workers from losing their ground. Good on the unions for not giving up the fight."
The Crew,"Tv is a gold mine right now, there's no reason for execs to not be paying crews what they deserve. TV in covid19 is like printing money.  They made fucking shows with skype."
The Crew,I ain't scared 💅
The Crew,"I'd pay a little more on streaming to better support crews for sure. 

Cable is another matter. Stop making us pay for all these channels we don't want. Maybe that is bad for content makers who make less viewed content but...cmon. Give us a la carte options and if there is a contraction in what choices are available so be it."
The Crew,"I 100% support this. No one should ever ever be subjected to these horrible conditions, people fought for this 100 years ago and I'm apalled that we still have to fight for this"
The Crew,"Good, the crowd will further go to youtube"
The Crew,More power to you folks. Good luck.
The Crew,lets gooooo
The Crew,"The 2007 strike led to reality TV, then to The Apprentice, then to Trump president

Dear God, what might another strike do?!"
The Crew,"Here is the thing , the entire industry needs changed from the ground up. That isn't going to change unless laws are put in places to make Financials of movies transparent and protections for workers."
The Crew,[removed]
The Crew,"read through these comments

OP is cray, posting the same thing over and over again

there might be some fire to this smoke, but he's cray"
The Crew,"Unless the union is demanding a 40-hour work week, then I don't really care.

I'll stand in solidarity for workers rights... but if it's just a cash grab, then you can stand on your own.

If members aren't demanding a 40-hour work week, then I can't really take their demands seriously."
The Crew,"Go on strike! destroy your industry and put a finale nail into the coffin of cable TV.

Then hope that Amazon and Apple notorious for how well they treat their employees (BWAHAHAHA) treat you better than old media."
The Crew,I support studios. There is nothing good comes out of this strike. Previous strike led to inferior television and ended the golden era of television
The Crew,"Tv is 70% advertisement and 30% entertainment.

It could die what do I care?"
The Crew,Theres nothing good on tv anyway
The Crew,We must have television. How else will we know what to think? Or what political agenda to support?
The Crew,"Honestly, zero fucks given if it is interrupted.
I don't watch terrestrial TV anymore, if I do get any TV time it's Netflix or amazon so I can pick up where I left off last time."
The Crew,"It is hard times right. So many important things to worry about. You know what I mean?

Edit: completely ambiguous statement, has earned me death theats? Why?"
The Crew,Will this also effect live tv like the news?
The Crew,Meanwhile Texas teachers are being forced to risk their lives every day with unmasked/unvaxxed children and cant strike because if they do they lose their pension they are literally not allowed to strike by their own union... My ex wife is a high risk for covid teacher who cant afford to lose her job and lose the decade of benefits shes built. She is literally gambling with her life just to make it through the school year. The teachers union in Texas is nothing more than the HR dept. For Texas education system.
The Crew,I'd strike too if I was apart of the trash movies that have come out over the last decade
The Crew,"Nope, dont care. If you cant be bothered to tell me what your issues are beyond making me click shit, you dont have my support. And you never will."
The Crew,WHAT THE F***** just great.
The Crew,In all reality newTV isn't all that important with everything we have available at the push of a button.
The Crew,Are we talking cable channels here? I have not had cable since 1998. Yes went for many years just watching VCRs then streaming came in. Honestly didn't even realize they still existed.
The Crew,[deleted]
The Crew,What about American crew members currently working in other countries?
The Crew,Disruption is life
The Crew,Wish the article could be read for free without having to sign in.
The Crew,"I really hope the studios listen, I'm not ready for another wave of ruined and cancelled shows."
The Crew,"It'll be MUCH worse for the studios. During the writers strike a good amount of content was still produced without the writers. With IATSE striking, they won't be able to shoot or edit anything. The whole industry will grind to a halt. 

With that said, I work in post production and fully support the strike."
The Crew,"Bigger. The 2007-2008 WGA strike was 12,000 writers. And that's one department. This is over a dozen departments totally 60,000 workers. From cinematographers, props, costumes, grips, editors. It will be a complete shutdown if it goes to strike.

The Crew,"Yes, in the sense several contracts are expiring and IATSE wants better terms in the new contracts that take into account Streaming (which didn’t really exist last time around) and their never ending push for improved working conditions. 

No, in the sense there are WAY more IASTE members, and they are all divided up into different locals (camera, stage mechanics, editors…) and they are below the line so their income is principally based on hours worked as opposed to above the line (WGA, DGA directors, and top billed actors SAG). When their deals are up for renewal they will be fighting over BIG money. Streaming kills home video, box office, and licensing, which are all ways that those guilds members earn their real money. Plus they All rely on residuals."
The Crew,Some horrible Tv happened from that.
The Crew,"No, it's gonna be a lot bigger. Shows could still shoot in 2007 because they had scripts written up to a certain point. If IATSE strikes, everything shuts down pretty much immediately because they represent everyone from editors and special effects people to camera crews, which means the every day crews are no longer working."
The Crew,"No, 5 times larger"
The Crew,"In my opinion, the 2007 writers strike is the reason why shows now usually do between 8-13 episodes per season. Writers wanted to be more valued by the industry that exploits them, and that industry responded by punishing them and moving to a new model that gives them less than half the work they originally got. And audiences cheer for it because ""it makes stories better"". People are so stupid."
The Crew,"Even better if it happens, they can still make (bad) shows without writing. But without us the crew nothing is going to be filmed. Support the strikes!"
The Crew,"I mean, in the sense that they got their streaming residuals. Sure."

The Crew,"The only difference is that back then people still watched television, not sure how effective a strike would be nowadays when (at least younger people) don't watch TV in the traditional way."
The Crew,"I would guess this has less interruption as these workers, while skilled, would be easier to replace.   At least for the bigger shows/networks"

The Crew,I’m cool with the Union demands being met without interruption too
The Crew,"Yeah, it's the era of peak TV. There's shit to catch up on. We'll be fine."
The Crew,"I am too, don't watch tv. Let the world burn."
The Crew,"Especially when they risk the *entire* industry grinding to a halt for who knows how long, it's not like the last strike where they still tried to get by without writers."
The Crew,I believe they have come out on solidarity though
The Crew,"In British Columbia, the Council of Film Unions (which includes 2 IATSE Locals) has a completely separate collective agreement with the AMPTP, and we are beholden to continue servicing their productions, even if our sisters and brothers stateside decide to pull the plug on their employers. I would assume a parallel situation exists in Ontario. 

However, because we are so deeply involved in generating content for US studios and networks, at the moment there are many American Heads of Department, editors, production and costume designers, etc. working here on permits. Should a strike be called, they will all have to withdraw their services and return home, which will likely create chaos for those individual productions that employ American IA staff in key positions. 

My understanding is that Cdn staff would be unable to step into their roles or fulfill their duties, as that would likely be considered strike breaking by the International Office. However, the Vanc. Local is consulting with our lawyers on the implications for us of a stateside strike vote succeeding."
The Crew,[deleted]
The Crew,"Sadly, selfish interests are how change is made. Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle* was written to expose how badly people in the meatpacking industry were treated, but instead the public was mad about the unsanitary conditions of their food. It still worked out for the better."
The Crew,"I reposted the same content to several subreddits. I tried to tailor the title to motivate each group. And you're right. This one played on their selfishness. And surprisingly in a subreddit called ""television"" a lot of people claim to hate television. Very confusing. unfortunately, I can't edit the title or original post."
The Crew,"I work in the industry and it's weird and a little disheartening reading stuff here on reddit after weeks of reading the stories on Instagram. No one mentions the content over there. My husband has been on a major series for close to two years, working on the same season (extended due to the pandemic). This is a series we both were big fans of when he first started working on the show. Now, he and his coworkers don't even care about the actual show anymore. They don't even know if they will watch it whenever it is released because their experience on the show has been so shitty. 

I have worked on many shows that I've never seen. Most of us take shows because it is a job and maybe the person who hired us is someone we've worked for before and they are nice and we liked working with them before.. We don't really choose shows because they have good actors, directors, or writers. We choose shows when we are offered a good rate/deal."
The Crew,Not everyone is motivated by altruism. I agree it would be better if people supported this movement because it’s railing against nasty business practices rather than cutting off their supply of entertainment. But I would rather someone support the cause for selfish reasons rather than not support it at all.
The Crew,"Agreed, I see nothing wrong with a living wage."

To be fair to cable, on streaming you probably also only watch 1% (or some small percentage) of what is actually offered."
The Crew,Then we unionize YouTube
The Crew,✊
The Crew,"Yeah, except The Apprentice preceeded the strike by years."
The Crew,"The 2007 strike was a writers strike. This is an industry strike. If this happens, even reality tv won't be on the table."
The Crew,"Come on, use your brain here. Reality TV existed long before the writer strike."
The Crew,"I get the joke you’re making, but The Apprentice first aired in 2004."
The Crew,Reality tv was ratings dynamite before the writer’s strike. American Idol was one of the last shows to garner 30 million viewers every week.
The Crew,No. It isn't going to change until the workers stand united and force change.
The Crew,"You don't understand. Its all production, movies, traditional tv, streaming, etc."
The Crew,"As I said to your other comment. Not cray. Fired up, motivated. The stories are real, just spend 10 minutes looking. You don't have to rely on me. Its out there for everyone to see."

Edit: a lot = A number of things"
The Crew,"They're (potentially) striking against Apple and Amazon too. 

Also, you don't understand how strikes work if you think it ""destroys the industry"""
The Crew,Oh fuck off. The last season of Game of Thrones saw multiple hundreds of crew members working 13+ hour days for *months*. Tell me how better working conditions would’ve made *that* season any worse than it already was.
The Crew,why are you browsing reddit dot com forward slash r forward slash television then
The Crew,This applies to crews working on both film and streaming content you ignorant asshat. Try actually reading the thing you're commenting on.
The Crew,Why are you even in this subreddit if you don't like television?
The Crew,"I’m going to paste my reply to another comment like this because I think it’s worth explaining to people what’s really behind this. 

Most of us don’t really care what the artistic quality of a production is because you don’t have a ton of choice over it. For most of it this is just the industry we make our living in. I know you’re trying to be funny but we’re actually talking about our ability to support our families without falling asleep behind the wheel after working a week of 14 hour days at night.
We’ve been working almost right through the pandemic (with the exception of about 4-5 months at the beginning) to make the stuff you watch when you’re home. And the companies that have produced them have made record profits over the pandemic."
The Crew,He says while watching wrestling weekly and posting about SNL all the time lmao.
The Crew,Yes. Yes there absolutely is.
The Crew,Shut up Trumpet
The Crew,Netflix and the rest will be affected as well
The Crew,Why did I read this as mob threat
The Crew,Nope. I don't. Support your fellow common man and woman. If for no other reason than because one day you may need their support.
The Crew,"The work of these people produced all those shows and movies that helped us binge-watch our way through lockdown. It doesn't cost you a thing, nor take away from other important issues, to support them in their quest for humane treatment."
The Crew,"Yes, depending on the station/network if they use IATSE labor or not."
New Amsterdam,"New Amsterdam is *so* stupid ... and yet I've managed to plow through almost 4 entire seasons in just a few weeks.  Same story with Manifest, actually.

Ryan Eggold is really fantastic in it.  The rest of the main cast is damn good too, but Eggold really steals every scene he's in from the opening shots of S1.  ""How can I help?"""
New Amsterdam,I never watched New Amsterdam during its original run but I enjoy watching the series. It's the kind of show you can put on while working or doing chores. It's a good show.
New Amsterdam,"Didn't knew Ginny and Georgia was this successful. I like the show and was afraid of it being cancelled, as usual..."
New Amsterdam,I want a Netflix medical series tbh.
New Amsterdam,Eggold is great and this show's netflix popularity is hopefully going to turn him into a star now that the show's over.
New Amsterdam,"When I first started it, I called him ""bargain bin Matthew Fox"".  My view on that has changed dramatically!  He's amazing in the role. He's even directed a handful of episodes now as well.

Unrelated to that, but man the first episode of S3 (the pandemic montage) was really fantastic.  I thought it really viscerally captured the toll things took on healthcare workers.

I'm always surprised too by how much social activism the show captures despite being a mainstream network drama."
New Amsterdam,Eggold is easily the best part of the show even when it falls apart in later seasons. Looking forward to seeing him in the Alex Cross series coming to Amazon.
New Amsterdam,"I felt like by the end the show kind of devolved into ""Max solves _____"" with increasing absurdity (like those episodes in London where he was trying to fix the British health care system lol) but occasionally they would still hit it out of the park."
New Amsterdam,"I haven't quite got there yet ... I'm somewhere in the middle of S4, they're just about to move to London I think."
New Amsterdam,Decreasing ratings and increasing costs I'd imagine
New Amsterdam,It lost it's heart.
New Amsterdam,We loved the show for the first couple of seasons - and then dropped off as it increasingly talked politics.
New Amsterdam,Props to Ryan Eggold for carrying this show the best he could. Looking forward to seeing him in the upcoming Alex Cross Amazon show.
New Amsterdam,Was the show bad? Never watched
New Amsterdam,"""How can I help?""

It is kinda funny that he's in an Alex Cross show ... my wife called him ""bargain-bin Matthew Fox"" when I put the first episode of *New Amsterdam* on."
New Amsterdam,Started out a promising medical drama but turned soap opera set in a hospital very quick.
New Amsterdam,"This show had one of the biggest fall’s from Grace I think I’ve ever seen in such a short period of time. First 3 seasons were good then everything seemed to fall apart. What happened?

Hope Ryan Eggold can get a new gig not on network television after this."
New Amsterdam,"The show hasn’t been good since the end of S2, and to top it off the showrunner pushed “More Joy” all season only for everyone to end up miserable. I’ve seen more competent fanfiction writers than whoever was running the writing room this season. They should’ve just left Max and Helen alone…don’t think I’ll watch the final season now except to find out why Helen wimped out on the wedding."
New Amsterdam,Not surprised. They fucked her character over tying  her to a love interested every season. She lost any work arc after S2 post covid without any cancer patients.
New Amsterdam,Well I guess that explains the weird and sudden ending to the season. They had been subtly teasing that her and Max weren't going to make it work but it still felt a bit outta nowhere. Also her character had been doing her own thing for the whole season.
New Amsterdam,"Well, that's gonna be a huge blow. They built up this relationship for years and it will not be retconned,  and for the final season no less. Kinda glad I stopped watching after Season 3, it's clearly not gonna have it's intended conclusion now."
New Amsterdam,"I agree, but I’d say just the first two seasons. The third was whack, and the 4th was painful to watch.

Someone told me that some of the key writers departed after Season 2 and that made so much sense. The whole vibe of the show shifted and the storylines were at times almost farcical.

Rewatching the first two seasons last summer further solidified my opinion. It was a whole other show, and a good one at that. Such a shame."
New Amsterdam,Hopefully not on NBC
New Amsterdam,I’m glad I stopped watching around season 3 then.
New Amsterdam,i thought this was about new amsterdam from 2008... i really liked that show
New Amsterdam," Not surprised quality has dipped since the first season.

I hope Ryan Eggold gets a new show he’s a good actor."
New Amsterdam,">New Amsterdam returned for four episodes in January before taking a monthlong break for the Winter Olympics. The drama then aired one original episode February 22 before going on another hiatus until April 19 to make room for the State of the Union and Renée Zellwegger’s true-crime limited series The Thing About Pam. The Season 4 finale is slated for May 24.

Shit like this pisses me off. I don't get how networks expect good ratings when they air episodes so randomly."
New Amsterdam,"Unlike everyone else here I guess, this show has grown on me.

Its not perfect but I really, really respect how much space it gives to the ugly, harsh economic/corporate  bottom line aspect of healthcare no other doctor show I've seen dares get into. The show should be applauded for that.

The cast of characters is kind of meh but for some reason it seems like they always step it up for the Psychiatrist character, his storylines are almost always pretty good."
New Amsterdam,Will NBC have anything left outside of the Dick Wolf shows?
New Amsterdam,"I gave up on this show after several episodes, the last one being when every main character, including the psychologist, met a helicopter on the roof for a single, unconscious patient."
New Amsterdam,"I can’t be that sad about this. I liked the first two seasons, and I enjoyed the Helen and Max relationship, but the show started to go downhill in season 3 and hasn’t come back at all this season. They’re still pushing stupid, nonsensical stories (like Floyd’s threesome plot and Max having a clinic in an alley) and I’ve read fanfic that is of higher quality at this point. Plus I don’t really need to see Lauren go out of control when I’ve already seen spiraling female characters over and over.

I have high standards for medical dramas since watching ER, and this one fit the bill for the first two seasons. Just not since."
New Amsterdam,"Is Freema Agyeman any good in this? Always been sort of curious because I liked her on Doctor Who, but never got around to checking it out properly"
New Amsterdam,"oh thank god


but wtf am I supposed to hate watch on Wednesdays (I watch it on Hulu the next day)?"
New Amsterdam,"I'm pretty surprised it got renewed. I have 10 out of the 15 episodes of season 4 still on my DVR. I just couldn't get through the show. At one point I started to root against some of the protagonists. It's not like HBO or Showtime where the protagonists are bad people. It's just that they are so annoying, unrealistic, and frustratingly flawed."
New Amsterdam,i am surprised it lasted past the pilot. never liked the actor who plays max. he be better at selling used cars than acting.
New Amsterdam,Oh damn…..💔💔💔💔
New Amsterdam,It's amazing how much these hospital shows last so long. Something about them really gets audience...
New Amsterdam,"Ho hum. I watch it when it's on. The current plot of Bad woman takes over hospital is the same plot as on The Good Doctor, which is worse. By far the worst is Good Sam."
New Amsterdam,that and Forever were both fun. time for a new procedural about a immortal that thats solves crimes which gets cancelled after just one season.
New Amsterdam,That was a good show.
New Amsterdam,"He's the reason I tuned in as much as I did, though I was pleasantly surprised to see Janet Montgomery and Tyler Labine, as well.

Still, the energy from the first season seemed to have vanished more recently. Seems like five seasons is the limit for a lot of shows anymore."
New Amsterdam,"Yes, he is very charming"
New Amsterdam,The one Chicago shows has also dipped in quality lately but I don't see them being cancelled anytime soon
New Amsterdam,"...what


Iggy is one of the worst doctors on the show"
New Amsterdam,Yeah but problem is in many episodes Max is trynna solve issues that have nothing to do with health care.
New Amsterdam,"It's a phallic lupine universe, you just live in it..."
New Amsterdam,The Blacklist keeps on kicking.
New Amsterdam,This WAS Us.
New Amsterdam,"I watch this show and don't know why. But I always think the same thing. Yes, every head of the department is going to see this one patient with a broken leg. Yes, this medical director is going to sit outside a patient's room. New Amsterdam hospital really knows how to use it's resources!"
New Amsterdam,Floyds Threesome is one of the worst TV plots in a while - it was amazing how quickly they dropped it
New Amsterdam,she is amazing
New Amsterdam,"New Amsterdam is just a bad show, her character is a pretty annoying one"
New Amsterdam,"> I watch it on Hulu the next day

Well your Wednesday is screwed either way then, since NBC is moving all their shows off Hulu. So you will need to hate watch it on Peacock next year. As for what to replace it with, maybe Bel-Air? Also on Peacock so hate-watch twofer?"
New Amsterdam,We have to have worst doctor of the series.
New Amsterdam,"okay, go back to watching it and go to Primetimer and read the topics about each episode - join us in the hatewatch"
New Amsterdam,"They gonna solve sexism, racism, and provide poor with free internet and top notch health care"
New Amsterdam,"yes


this time can it be an immortal pirate who solves crimes for the coast guard"
New Amsterdam,Easy solution. Revive Forever! :P
New Amsterdam,"> Tyler Labine

I started watching it a couple seasons in (roommate was a fan), and I think I probably watched almost an entire season before I realized that Iggy was Tyler Labine. As a big fan of *Reaper* and *Tucker & Dale*, completely blew my mind."
New Amsterdam,I think his cases are the most interesting.
New Amsterdam,And the remake The Endgame.
New Amsterdam,Max does it because he is Super Doctor who probably just throws a dart at a mental dartboard and focuses on that because Doctors Can't Just Be About Paperwork So How Can I Help You?
New Amsterdam,Not even the worst one in new amsterdam
New Amsterdam,Good to hear!
New Amsterdam,"Yeah, I saw that. I could always find sail the seven seas to find it.




my current hate watches are Good Doctor, New Amsterdam, and This Is Us. Hopefully the networks come out with some good ones next season (that last more than a season)"
New Amsterdam,"Yeah, I am going to have to figure out who the worst doctor of the season is, then worst doctor of the series when it ends (Maybe one that is a tally, one that is me looking back and picking who is the worst)"
New Amsterdam,"*Reaper* was great, and Tyler Labine made that show. We still wander around quoting, ""They call me Sock, 'cause I fit like a glove..."" at my house.

But damn, was it weird to be like, ""Sock!"" when we saw him on *New Amsterdam.* Like, ""Shit, Sock grew up. And we got old."""
New Amsterdam,I instantly recognized him as one of the students from Breaker High. And then suddenly I felt old. Very very old.
New Amsterdam,Isn't that still on season one?  Don't see it getting a season 2
New Amsterdam,Sophie Nélisse and Ella Purnell were great in that scene of Yellowjackets' season finale.
New Amsterdam,Was hoping Sheryl Lee was back on TV but I guess it’s someone else
New Amsterdam,Sandra Mae Frank is so good in *new amsterdam*
New Amsterdam,"Between this and Arcane, I had no idea Ella Purnell was English. Also just found out recently that Melanie Lynskey is kiwi and that blew my mind too considering how good her American accent is"
New Amsterdam,Sameeeee
New Amsterdam,I'm not finding a lot to disagree with in the acting categories.  Everybody in there did a hell of a job.
New Amsterdam,"If Lasso is over by then, he'd make a great Captain for that Galaxy Quest Spinoff show they've been talking about doing."
New Amsterdam,New Amsterdam? Really?
New Amsterdam,"> Best Streaming Series, Drama:  “The Mandalorian” (Disney Plus)

[Seriously?](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PossibleLazyEagle-size_restricted.gif)



It's a fun action show for sure, but nothing more. 

Here are the other shows that were nominated for the same category:
  
Bridgerton (Netflix), The Boys (Amazon Prime Video), The Crown (Netflix), The Handmaid's Tale (Hulu), and Servant (Apple TV+)"
New Amsterdam,"My brain immediately went to ""They brought back New Amsterdam from 2008?!""   

It was a detective show all about an immortal detective (400 y/o), which showed us some of his past lives to contextualize the crimes he was solving. It only got like half a season and was then cancelled. Pretty solid in my opinion.    

PS - Still not as disappointing as when they cancelled The Dresden Files after 12 episodes in 2007."
New Amsterdam,"If they bring back Tim Allen, it could be a hilarious way to have a Kirk vs Picard argument in-universe."
New Amsterdam,"I only watch New Amsterdam because it comes on after This is Us.

It's well-meaning and not bad, but its no ER."
New Amsterdam,That's a pretty miserable bunch of nominees all round tbh but Mandalorian taking it is absolutely ridiculous.
New Amsterdam,Nor House.
New Amsterdam,"Not a fan of House, sorry."
New Amsterdam,"I had no idea his wife was an MP in India, so makes sense he'd want to be back there with her.

Also didn't realize how controversial he is in certain circles, but not gonna try to wade into Indian politics."
New Amsterdam,weird exit
New Amsterdam,He is a Hindu nationalist extremist. Having him on a network tv show is like having someone from the KKK just playing a doctor.
New Amsterdam,"family over everything else. the older you get, the easier it is to understand."
New Amsterdam,"honestly, having kher is just like having a white supremacist in your starcast. the guy is as right wing as one can get in india's context."
New Amsterdam,He’s a complete cunt. He has ruined decades’ worth of goodwill in the last 4-5 years. Extremely bigoted and downright poisonous.
New Amsterdam,I went to India on vacation just before the pandemic. Political discussion is friggin' bananas over there. Their equivalent to cable news shows has people screaming at each other while the screen is overloaded with graphics and chyrons.
New Amsterdam,[removed]
New Amsterdam,"Dude is basically a sociopath.

https://twitter.com/AnupamPKher/status/1384724166482358275?s=19"
New Amsterdam,Is this shit on YouTube?
New Amsterdam,ah yea that would do it.Should have clarified I suppose. the actual exit in the show was done a bit weird.Makes sense now
New Amsterdam,[Behold!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0y05mkNe7k)
New Amsterdam,"Why do you think it was weird? He had Covid, was in a coma, almost died. He had been gone due to recovery. It made enough sense considering the actor was not returning."
New Amsterdam,"Shaun Cassidy tends to make really good shows. ""Cover Me"" was phenomenal as was ""American Gothic""."
New Amsterdam,"Its weird to me when 2 shows have the exact same name but are otherwise completely different. Like New Amsterdam, the medical show, and New Amsterdam, the fantasy police show."
New Amsterdam,"Well, I'm happy Tyler Labine is still working."
Wheel of Fortune,Vanna White has an estimated net worth of 85 million dollars. What a gig!
Wheel of Fortune,Did she start when she was BORN?
Wheel of Fortune,She still looks pretty damn good too!
Wheel of Fortune,The best person Myrtle Beach ever produced.
Wheel of Fortune,Back in the mid 1980’s when I was around 5 or so I honestly thought she was Barbie.
Wheel of Fortune,"Probably the easiest on-air job in television. I can't think of an easier TV job. Maybe Judge Judy's bailiff? But still, he reprimands people every once in awhile.

She definitely won the jackpot in life."
Wheel of Fortune,Did they spell anniversary wrong in the puzzle?
Wheel of Fortune,They gave her a ceramic Dalmatian.
Wheel of Fortune,It’s funny that she got the job because she was the last person to interview for the gig and the hiring team were exhausted and fine with the job she did. She also was on an episode of The Price is Right in the Bob Barker era but failed to make it out of Contestants’ Row
Wheel of Fortune,Can't be too any people that have been on the air for longer than that.
Wheel of Fortune,"I looked it up, and her net worth is greater than Pat Sajak. She’s got the better job."
Wheel of Fortune,She doesn't look a day over 39!
Wheel of Fortune,"I remember when they switched from spinning the letters, to touching the screens, and everyone just assumed that she'd retire then.  Don't really need somebody to touch the screens, so the rumor was that she'd do it for a bit and quietly move on to other things.

That was 25 years ago.

Fun fact, she's touched screens longer than she turned letters.  1982-1997, and now 1997-2022."
Wheel of Fortune,"The boredom of turning numbers for 40 years would have ended me long before this, congrats to her on not ending it."
Wheel of Fortune,This is the way.
Wheel of Fortune,She looks great but ... she doesn't look like Vanna White. ... I can't put my finger on it. It's like someone Berenstain bears'd her face.
Wheel of Fortune,Would
Wheel of Fortune,What are the odds Pat  hit that?
Wheel of Fortune,If something was glowing... could ya tell?
Wheel of Fortune,"First Episode was in December 13th 1982, I was 3 days old lol."
Wheel of Fortune,$84.5 million of that is definitely from the yarn.
Wheel of Fortune,"And she still goes to work. 

Granted, her job isn't that hard and has some perks, but if I had 85m, you would have a hard time getting me off my private island."
Wheel of Fortune,All the does for work is touch tiles and wear expensive outfits.
Wheel of Fortune,"65 years old, believe it or not."
Wheel of Fortune,"North Myrtle Beach, actually..."
Wheel of Fortune,My guess is most of the work is in staying good looking enough to stay on TV that long.  Especially as a woman.
Wheel of Fortune,"Something that you may be surprised to know, she actually impacts the game. She has to touch the screen at the right spot or it throws everything off. You'd think they'd just like, make it look like she's important and then have a producer offstage pressing the buttons, but nah, she actually causes the letters to appear. I think that does make it at least a little less cushy"
Wheel of Fortune,It says Happy 40th Vannaversery :)
Wheel of Fortune,Z…4…Q…another Q…a third Q…and a Batman symbol
Wheel of Fortune,Cal Worthington has her beat I’m pretty sure. Not too many others though.
Wheel of Fortune,"Not a good person, but vince mcmahon started commentating in 1971, and showing up periodically since then. 

Google said William Roache was Ken Barlow In Coronation Street from 1960 – Present, so 22 years longer than vanna, but as an acted role.

She is kind of a presenter. Google said the longest career as a TV presenter is 67 years 151 days, achieved by Sir David Attenborough (UK) between 2 September 1953 and 31 January 2021.  So he stopped last year, but still a ton of years.

But she is way up there.  Even Trebek only hosted jeopardy for 37 years.  Starting in 1984 when vanna was already on the air 2 years, since 1982.  Crazy."
Wheel of Fortune,[Plastic surgery](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/25/USAT/d9d9bee9-00ba-4225-809e-5a218796830d-AP_25th_Annual_Race_to_Erase_MS_Gala.JPG) is a helluva thing.
Wheel of Fortune,What are the odds Vanna hit that?
Wheel of Fortune,Not every woman you see has to be treated as a sexual object. Not even models.
Wheel of Fortune,"She works 2 weeks a 'season' and her and Pat get sloshed during filming all while getting paid. It's probably still do it, too, at that point."
Wheel of Fortune,I can't understand that. What's the point of not working? I'd go berserk. Life fucking sucks without a job.
Wheel of Fortune,She looks AMAZING for 65!
Wheel of Fortune,I love Cherry Grove. Used to go every summer as a kid.
Wheel of Fortune,"I remember passing the city welcome sign.  Welcome to North Myrtle Beach, SC, hometown of Vanna White."
Wheel of Fortune,"Parents live there now and it's a perfect retirement community.

Top tip: Go to the Myrtle Beach Mall nearby to see the saddest, most empty mall you'll see in your life."
Wheel of Fortune,"Ah, so *not* Analversary. Got it."
Wheel of Fortune,And his dog spot?
Wheel of Fortune,"To be fair, hers is quite well done"
Wheel of Fortune,Right. But what are the odds though
Wheel of Fortune,"Sure, but when you work with someone for 40 years the thought has to come to mind. I'm not even talking about it as if she's a woman. I'm talking about it as two rich people around the same age intimately working close to each other for 40 years."
Wheel of Fortune,"Some of us are able to get satisfaction and fullfillment from things other than a job. Everyone is different, and your stance isn't wrong, but assuming everyone has to be like you *is* wrong."
Wheel of Fortune,Ayup. It _really_ does.
Wheel of Fortune,Have you tried doing one of your hobbies all day?
Wheel of Fortune,"My parents used to have a condo in Cherry Grove, I would drive down from Ohio for a week or two each year, loved it."
Wheel of Fortune,"Pussy cow, pussy cow, pussy cow."
Wheel of Fortune,No argument from me
Wheel of Fortune,Odds of what?
Wheel of Fortune,I’d say it’s equally likely they despise each other but are both fully aware that they hit the career lottery and aren’t about to upset that.
Wheel of Fortune,No. No it doesn’t.
Wheel of Fortune,"What's the difference? Job or hobby, you want to outdo everyone else at it and live off the challenge."
Wheel of Fortune,As a kid I honestly thought that’s what they were saying. XD
Wheel of Fortune,Idiot
Wheel of Fortune,The difference is people generally enjoy one more than the other.
Wheel of Fortune,"> What's the difference?

Well, one pays. 

> you want to outdo everyone else at it and live off the challenge.

I go to work to get paid so I can pay for the things that require money. Can't say I care much about being challenged."
Wheel of Fortune,That guy IS an idiot.
Wheel of Fortune,"Such guys are just little boys who never got much in life, with absolutely no trophies nor victories that they have no choice but to turn to their appendages as a final means of feeling better about themselves. 

Comfort yourself with that knowledge.

Edit : I bet some didn’t even understand that I was criticising the guy. Redditors are absolutely horrible at reading and comprehension. Makes me wonder how many of you actually had an education."
Wheel of Fortune,Big mad
Wheel of Fortune,You are? Silly thing to be mad about. You’ll get over it.
Wheel of Fortune,Objectifying women is not a laughing matter. How could you be so callous and joke about such a thing?
Wheel of Fortune,[removed]
Wheel of Fortune,[removed]
Wheel of Fortune,Pat Sajak is so over hosting it’s not even subtle. His remarks to the contestants have become increasingly backhanded over the years
Wheel of Fortune,The fact that Ken Jennings isn’t the permanent host still baffles me. It was literally on a silver platter and the people over there still somehow messed it up
Wheel of Fortune,"Can we increase the average dollar value on the wheel.   600 is not enough,  you know the person who wins the prize puzzle is going to win"
Wheel of Fortune,Good. I hardly miss either. One because it's the best game show in history and the other because I like seeing people try for one more spin and hit bankrupt.
Wheel of Fortune,I wish I could watch episodes of Jeopardy on Hulu.
Wheel of Fortune,MID-AMERICAN BLUE HAIRS: STRAIGHT TO MAH VEINS!!!!
Wheel of Fortune,"I was on Wheel years ago, I feel like Pat was just chill to be there. Knew his place in life. Like the type of dude who knew this show was easy and light and made him bank and gave people some light and low-key entertainment every night. So may as well appreciate what he has and be in the moment. Had a little light banter with the contestants. Filmed a bunch of episodes, went home, ate dinner with the family, went to bed. And I gotta say he was pretty supportive and genuine to us off camera."
Wheel of Fortune,Pat and Vanna have really benefited from the backlash against 'ageism' in recent years. If this were the 1970s or 80s they'd have been turfed by now for younger people.
Wheel of Fortune,"So true.  He’s always been that way.  Never liked him.  Another one who is batshit in real life but was the far better host was Chuck Woolery, back when no one spoke about their politics.  PS seems like he can barely tolerate being there, and then there are the pictures of him and his political alliances. Thought he’d be “retiring” after that came out, but looks like not."
Wheel of Fortune,He made a comment about tv executives recently that made me do a double take 😂.
Wheel of Fortune,"The execs want Mayim. It's a strong possibility the only reason they've been split this long is because she cannot commit full-time due to being the lead and an exec on her Call Me Kat sitcom for Fox. It's not doing amazing but is apparently a solid performer for Fox, not to mention she has a strong relationship with the studio, Warner, from the Big Bang days. Parsons from Big Bang is also an exec on the sitcom and it's in the Warner lot where Big Bang was and Young Sheldon is still going too. 

Warner's also involved with NBC Night Court reboot next week; starring Melissa Raunch from Big Bang, also an exec there along with her real-life husband."
Wheel of Fortune,"He's the daily competition host, so I'm okay with it. Mayim has only hosted the Celebrity Jeopardy Championship so far, right? Those are fun, but I watch the daily games more often and still get to see Ken, my choice for the job."
Wheel of Fortune,"Ken is the permanent host, alongside Mayim.  They even recently changed his intro from “And now, hosting Jeopardy!…” to “And now, here is the host of Jeopardy!…”"
Wheel of Fortune,"I don't watch Wheel but I have the same issue with Jeopardy.  They haven't raised the dollar value in forever and they are so cheap in many ways.  Contestants have to fly themselves out and pay for their lodging, and I wish the losers could keep the full value of what they won.  It must suck getting twenty thousand dollars in questions correct, coming up short, and only coming home with two thousand.  Based on articles like this, they make out like bandits."
Wheel of Fortune,That’s great to hear. Glad you had a positive experience
Wheel of Fortune,"lets hope it stays on for 10 more seasons, then"
Wheel of Fortune,"It was said when it was announced that they'd split hosting duties that she would start hosting the daily ones sometime after the new year.  IMO, she can take all the time she needs, Ken is such a great host."
Wheel of Fortune,"I very much dislike Mayim as a host for the competition show, but she’s great for Celebrity Jeopardy. On that version of the show, the pace doesn’t matter and people are encouraged to quip + bullshit. She’s having fun, the celebs are having fun, and it’s all good. 

Ken would do just fine in that role, but this is a fair compromise if they both need to be hosting."
Wheel of Fortune,"Jeopardy doesn’t pay for flights? That seems crazy. 

I think instead of (or in addition to) raising the payouts for each clue, they should let the second and third place finishers keep the money they earned. It would make final jeopardy a lot more interesting."
Wheel of Fortune,"Oh, I hadn't heard that. I thought Mayim would only handle special presentations and Ken would do the day-to-day."
Wheel of Fortune,Feb 20 is when Mayim is coming back :(
Wheel of Fortune,"Come to think of it, I'm not 100 percent certain, but I am fairly certain they don't do that.  Sony must make so much bank off these syndication deals, on top of merchandising and all the other stuff I'm not thinking about.  I'm sure it wouldn't even be a drop in the bucket to let the non-winners keep the money they made."
Wheel of Fortune,"That was the original plan when they announced Mike Richards as host - Richards would host the standard episodes and Mayim Bialik would host tournaments. That got thrown out when Richards was ousted and Ken Jennings was called in - Jennings wasn't available for the full *Jeopardy!* taping schedule due to his existing obligation to film *The Chase,* so the regular season was split between Bialik and Jennings."
Wheel of Fortune,"That was actually the original plan when Mike Richards was named the host; he was going to do the daily shows and Mayim would do the primetime stuff.  I thought an arrangement like that would have been the case, especially when Call Me Kat was picked up for another season, but Sony really wants Mayim as Jeopardy host."
Wheel of Fortune,"Yeah, I found that out by listening to the Inside Jeopardy podcast.  I don't remember Feb 20 being a specific date, just that Ken was going to be hosting Jeopardy through the month of January, but that probably tracks.  I've become resigned to the fact that this is the best it's going to get.  I'm pretty sure the EP said the hosting arrangement was here to stay, so hopefully there'll be no shenanigans if or when Kat gets cancelled and they try to put her in full time.  Hopefully."
Wheel of Fortune,It’s shown on the score board. They give second place $2000 and 3rd place $1000. Wheel of fortune let’s the losers keep their money so idk why jeopardy can’t.
Wheel of Fortune,"I'm aware of what the 2nd and 3rd place winners get.  When I said that I was fairly certain they don't do that, I was speaking of not paying for their airfare.  I have not watched Wheel in many years.  Can I ask how much money a non-winner would typically walk away on Wheel?"
Wheel of Fortune,"Sometimes they can make what the 1st place player makes but like $100 less. Often over $10,000."
Wheel of Fortune,"That's incredible.  And for a game, IMO, that takes a lot less intelligence and skill to be good at.  No offense to Wheel viewers, LOL.  I've seen Jeopardy contestants try for years to get on the show, between taking the test and auditioning in person.  Knowing what I now know about the pay disparities of contestants, what a slap in the face to them."
Wheel of Fortune,"I agree. Wheel of fortune is almost all luck. And the dynamics of jeopardy are made worse by not letting them keep the money they earn. At the end these players aren’t risking the money they earned from the game, but will either win or get a very small consolation prize."
Wheel of Fortune,"Yes, and it's not like most contestants can parlay their performances and possible successes into other avenues, unless you're a Ken Jennings or a Buzzy Cohen.  At least let them keep the money they earned legitimately on the show."
Wheel of Fortune,I always knew Pat Sajak would be the purveyor of the endtimes.
Wheel of Fortune,oh god which horseman of the apocalypse is Sajak?
Wheel of Fortune,"You shrug, but Sajak only lacks the final piece of the Algorithm."

The Big Day,Monsters at Work too (note the thumbnail Disney Channel gave it) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpf8YnqfqGc
The Big Day,"This show slaps, I really hope they produce another season."
The Big Day,"Nobody:

Disney: hey how about our classic characters, but in Calart style?"
The Big Day,"I saw a few episodes. I love the old cartoons. The new abstract artwork is terrible. Will avoid watching this new show. My kids watch the old cartoons, they're much more fun in their opinion. Not all new things are better things."
The Big Day,Every network but Discovery/WB&HBO will probably push for this.
The Big Day,It's inevitable as viewership keeps falling. At some point it'll make sense to just air the streaming shows on network and cable TV to keep the people entertained who still don't give up the old ways.
The Big Day,I believe a second season is arriving sometime in 2023.
The Big Day,Netflix - DID I HEAR A NEW ORIGINAL SERIES???
The Big Day,Actually it's in the art style as Oogy and the Cockroaches and even made by the same people.
The Big Day,It's from the same animation studio behind Oogy and the Cockroaches. Which explains the familiar art style and the gibberish dialogue.
The Big Day,"They did it a couple years ago with The Flight Attendant on TBS, but now they probably won’t do that again"
The Big Day,I don't even know what you're talking about
The Big Day,Jean Smart HAS to win that comedy actress award. Her performance in Hacks is far and away the best TV I've watched in a while.
The Big Day,"TV Winners:

* DRAMA ENSEMBLE - **The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTRESS - **Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTOR - **Jason Bateman, Ozark**
* COMEDY ENSEMBLE - **Abbott Elementary**
* COMEDY ACTRESS - **Jean Smart, Hacks**
* COMEDY ACTOR - **Jeremy Allen White, The Bear**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — FEMALE ACTOR - **Jessica Chastain, George & Tammy**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — MALE ACTOR - **Sam Elliott, 1883**
* STUNT ENSEMBLE - **Stranger Things**"
The Big Day,The Bear is a Comedy???
The Big Day,"How did the cast of Game of Thrones never win Drama Ensemble at the SAG Awards? Forget the writing of S8 (well S7 too), the show had a phenomenal cast."
The Big Day,I hope Jeremy Allen White wins the Emmy. He is such a good actor and The Bear is so good
The Big Day,"I’ve seen White Lotus. I’ve seen Better Call Saul. 

Rhea Seehorn not even being nominated in favor of Jennifer Coolidge, and Coolidge winning, kind of boggles my mind."
The Big Day,Redditors seething at yet another BCS snub in favor of Ozark.
The Big Day,"I cannot believe Sam Elliot won over Paul Walter Hauser, Evan Peters, Taron Egerton and Steve Carrell in the ""Male Actor in Miniseries or TV Movie"". He was, IMO, the worst choice in the whole category. I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but the other nominees were far, far better."
The Big Day,Really enjoyed this season of Abbott Elementary. Glad to see others did as well.
The Big Day,The bear is the most stressful comedy I’ve ever watched.   Wait no i take that back. Space jam
The Big Day,I can tell by these comments that the Abbott elementary backlash is about to start.
The Big Day,I still haven't gotten around to *The Bear* but Jeremy Allen White must have been incredible to beat out Bill Hader for *Barry*.
The Big Day,"In terms of best acting in a Comedy, hands down Abbott Elementary delivered great comedy acting. In terms of the best acting in that category though, it’s Barry without question. It just wasn’t really “comedy” this season 🤷🏼‍♂️

Same could be said for The Bear."
The Big Day,The White Lotus and Bear were phenomenal
The Big Day,The awards need to get their shit together when it comes to comedy categories
The Big Day,I didn't know anything about Abbott Elementary until I heard about all their golden globe sweeps and I gave it a go and now it's one of my current fav shows and my main comfort happy place watch.
The Big Day,"Abbott Elementary is perfectly *enjoyable*, but I'm still very surprised when they *win the big categories especially over the other shows listed."
The Big Day,I dont get the love for white lotus.  I tried to watch it and it's just a show about shitty hotel guests?  Why not just watch reality tv?
The Big Day,"Great to see Abbot winning ! It’s an amazing show and one of the few that I can sit and watch with my parents and we all enjoy together . 
More such shows please… please 🙏"
The Big Day,"Ugh, Severance deserves better."
The Big Day,The Bear was phenomenal
The Big Day,"The show bear makes you realize what a shitty career a chef is, extremely hard stressful job with little pay"
The Big Day,As they should.
The Big Day,[deleted]
The Big Day,"What am I missing with Abbott Elementary?  I watched the first few episodes and they were just, not good at all.  What is the charm I'm missing on this?"
The Big Day,"Unpopular opinion here:  I watched The Bear and don’t really get what all the hype was about.  I mean I thought it was OK but nothing really above and beyond anything else I’ve seen the past year.  And before anyone says anything, yes I’ve worked in a restaurant before"
The Big Day,"Why do people give a shit about Hollywood giving Hollywood bullshit awards as one massive circle-jerk?

I don't watch any of them, but the only that would mean anything to me at all would be Viewers' Choice Awards."
The Big Day,"Sam Elliot's performance in 1883 winning over Paul Walter Hauser's performance in Black Bird is absolutely criminal. Sam Elliot just acted like Sam Elliot, Paul Walter Hauser became a cold-blooded killer."
The Big Day,Crazy I've never even heard about all three shows
The Big Day,Now there’s an award for sag?
The Big Day,"My aging badge of honor is that I have never heard of these shows.  Ahhh, I remember fondly when I cared about TV, and wish I had the time."
The Big Day,"Abbott Elementary is so overrated. It’s ok. If it came out in the 80s or 90s, it wouldn’t even be a blip on the radar."
The Big Day,Looks like they rounded up 4 of the ugliest women in the audience and said do your worst smile
The Big Day,"Really happy for Jessica Chastain, she was phenomenal as Tammy Wynette."
The Big Day,I haven’t seen White Lotus yet but I have seen the other two shows and they are what I would quantify as “good watchable television” which is a standard that’s getting higher and higher with how much is being shown. I’m going to watch White Lotus.
The Big Day,I really like Abbott Elementary.
The Big Day,"She is fantastic, but the show isn’t going to hold up as she is all they have."
The Big Day,"Wait, The Bear was a comedy? I must have been watching it wrong."
The Big Day,"Not surprised *Stranger Things* won the Stunt award - it got the Stunt Coordination Emmy last year. Of particular note would be ""Dear Billy"", which included a one continuous shot gun battle and an impressive drop from height."
The Big Day,That BCS lost to WL is a joke
The Big Day,All great shows with a lot of variety. I would have gave Zendaya the win over Jennifer or BCS over WL ensemble
The Big Day,"Jennifer Coolidge won as a dramatic actress? 

I'm so confused"
The Big Day,Obvious for a drama ensemble. White lotus season 2 was a riot.
The Big Day,I’m getting orange is the new black flashbacks after reading your comment
The Big Day,It’s especially odd considering White Lotus was placed as a drama.
The Big Day,"Yeah, every time I see The Bear listed as a comedy, I kind of do a double take. I guess there's some funny stuff, but even if it's a dark comedy, it's much more of a ***DARK*** (comedy), it seems to me."
The Big Day,"And the award for best heavy metal album goes to...


...Jethro Tull

SAG awards are kinda like that."
The Big Day,Dark comedy to me
The Big Day,And the White Lotus in the drama category...
The Big Day,C’mon cousin
The Big Day,I downloaded it having heard nothing except that it was labelled as a “comedy” show with great reviews. Was confused and exhausted as fuck by the end of the first episode. Was expecting a relaxing laugh.
The Big Day,"Historically, like from the Greeks, comedy just means it’s going to have a happy ending and is the opposite of tragedy"
The Big Day,"In one episode they accidentally drugged a birthday party full of kids. That’s IASIP-type humor.

Yes, its a comedy."
The Big Day,SAG didn't seem to like GOT at any point.
The Big Day,[deleted]
The Big Day,"Because many of the top billed actors in GoT were mediocre at best.

Kit Harrington,
Emilia Clarke,
Sophie Turner,
Maisie Williams,
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau

They were doing fine in some scene or another maybe; but nothing memorable about their performances overall. Actually with Jon and Sansa it was as wooden acting as it gets all through. The show was a lot of fun but in terms of acting it was meh."
The Big Day,It’s not an ensemble. composed of multiple PRINCIPLE actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly EQUAL AMOUNTS OF SCREEN TIME.
The Big Day,"Oh damn. He was good in shameless, and the bear is at 100% on rotten tomatoes. I need to check that out. No Hulu though"
The Big Day,"HEARD, CHEF"
The Big Day,Hulu better not fuck up and bring it back for season 2. They already canceled Reboot 😒
The Big Day,Its beyond parody.
The Big Day,"It really does feel weird to me that it’s being pushed so hard as a drama. Both seasons to me feel like 90% comedy with the last episode trying to go full dramatic tilt. 

It would be like trying to push the Righteous Gemstones as a drama or thriller instead of comedy purely because there are a few dramatic elements to it."
The Big Day,And Jason Bateman winning for Ozark. SAGs are worse than the Golden Globes
The Big Day,"Kudos to The White Lotus which has successfully jumped categories and is winning every guild award possible.  I don’t see it losing the Emmy for Best Drama later this year, and I thought the first season was better than the second lol.  Jennifer Coolidge and Mike White have a lot of voters everywhere rooting for them it seems.  HBO will have a hard time choosing which of its series to promote as Best Drama."
The Big Day,It’s some sort of sick joke
The Big Day,I like Coolidge but she didn't do anything we haven't seen her do 100 times before so I really don't see why she was even nominated
The Big Day,"Yeah. I enjoyed White Lotus, but pretty much every other actor in that show was better than Jennifer Coolidge. She was fine, but she doesn't deserve an Emmy."
The Big Day,I don't get the love for White Lotus. It was bland.
The Big Day,I swear people around here only pay attention to award shows for validation of their own opinions. Any time something they want to win doesn’t win or get nominated the put on an Olympic level mental gymnastics performance of why instead of just accepting that not everyone thinks the same way as them. It’s sad really.

The Big Day,"I have to agree, and I was a big fan of 1883 but Sam Elliot - played himself - again - the others played and transformed themselves into their characters. All these awards are a scam."
The Big Day,"It's a nice accurate representation of the school systems in black and brown communities. May not be the freshest directing style, but you don't see many comedies actually highlight this stuff."
The Big Day,"I get that it highlights some big issues, but I just don’t find it funny at all. Lame jokes, writing that is too obvious and set ups that fall flat."
The Big Day,"I haven’t liked it. It’s fine but not award-winning. Too many mediocre actors and too few surprising, original moments. To each their own though! At least it’s not a formulaic horseshit show like Big Bang Theory or 2.5 Men."
The Big Day,Understandable. The stakes were high in Space Jam. Anyone who has ever balled out to defeat an evil cadre of basketball playing aliens probably had some flashbacks
The Big Day,I legit couldn’t make it past the 2nd episode of The Bear because my heart rate was going through the roof and it felt like I was having war flashbacks to working in kitchens
The Big Day,Network shows and comfort food shows eill always do poorly on the internet.
The Big Day,Start? I feel like it’s been ongoing. Almost every day I see a low effort “DAE think Abbot Elementary is overrated?” post in this sub.
The Big Day,"Jeremy Allen White is reallllllly good in the Bear. He crushes a devastating monologue in the final episode of the season. But all season long he does a lot of small stuff so well and a weaker actor would've over acted when he went for subtleties. And when he does explode it feels so much more impactful.

Hader has been incredible, but he has gotten two Emmys for his acting in Barry. Would be a-ok if Jeremy Allen White got it."
The Big Day,I think half the shows in the comedy categories are way more dramatic than comedy and are lucky they aren’t clocked as such … it’s kind of unfair to have two half jokes an episode and then super serious scenes that allow for range and dramatics the rest of the season and then get called a comedy.  Abbott is one of the only true intentional comedies this season and so I think their wins make complete sense.
The Big Day,you don't have high quality writing and high end gays on reality tv
The Big Day,Some of the acting wins were surprises.  Amanda Seyfried and Zendaya were rolling until now.
The Big Day,And they wonder why ratings are dipping
The Big Day,"I haven’t seen it yet, but I’ve only heard good things about it from people I know. Not everyone is going like the same things though."
The Big Day,"For me, the show is enjoyable but not excellent in any way."
The Big Day,"I quite like Abbott elementary, I think the relationships between characters is awesome and the show is warm and fun. Principal Ava is the best part of the whole thing though lol"

White House Farm,"At work yesterday I had a guy come in wearing some weird Trump hat (god bless Donald trump or something, I think) and he REALLY wanted me to ask about it or something because he kept worming little comments into the conversation like “oh man can you believe what’s happening in this country” and “people are so offensive towards the real president” and “old Joe is washed up”. I kept not engaging, but man was it weird.

White House Farm,"As President, Trump literally spent more tweets condemning the Golden Globes and late night talk show hosts than he did Neo-Nazis/White Supremacists. Go ahead and count the tweets.

And the only two times he condemned his Neo-Nazis base was because his handlers forced him, because he previously said something so stupid. Piece of shit loves the racists & Nazis and their votes."

Note I am not defending this. It is absolutely disposable with no qualifications. The correct answer is to condemn both."
White House Farm,What a snowflake. Everyone should make fun of him as much as possible until all of his genetic material is gone.
White House Farm,So it is like all politicians on both sides are garbage. K.
White House Farm,"It's funny when we laugh at this, but not when the FBI is paying twitter to censor people. We, meaning Reddit, tends to ignore the elephant in the room. Almost all censorship is bad. Especially when the government is involved somehow."

White House Farm,Disney would replace him with a black dude
White House Farm,"Kimmel has jokes? This is news to me. Making jokes about the president has always been a staple for late night, you make a joke or two, then you move on, Not spend every monologue for years on end. It was kinda funny in the beginning, but after about a month it was insane."
White House Farm,I hate Trump as much as the next person with two brain cells to rub together. Kimmel is such a hack though. I used to like his monologue. Then Trump came along and it was half his monologue every fricking night.

White House Farm,ok
White House Farm,"If I recall correctly, there was an interview with George W Bush after he was president that asked him who his favorite late night show was while he was in office.

Naturally they double down and ridicule her even worse. At the time I thought it was bad writing. Nobody that high up in politics could be so stupid and thin-skinned as to not realise that getting wound up by comedians is exactly what fuels the comedians. And then along came Trump..."

White House Farm,"For such a thick guy, Trump has comically thin skin."
White House Farm,"If you were president, you’d probably be too busy working to watch tv, unlike a certain other guy who refused to work passed 5:00 so he could eat McDonald’s and watch tv all evening."
White House Farm,Facts.

You're allowed to shit on people but if they shit on you then it's the greatest affront one can commit."

White House Farm,"There are a lot of nihilistic trolls that wanted and were happy with trump being elected because he's a buffoon and he gives everybody enough ammunition to point out what a fool he is, and he always does it to himself.

Then there are the earnest people like the guy you mentioned who see themselves in trump, but lack self awareness and nuance. Whenever trump is rightfully attacked, they feel attacked because they put so much of their identity into what he represents.

Mental Healthcare in this country definitely needs to be revamped."
White House Farm,"It's like a cult thing.

I personally find it weird and tacky to wear memorabilia of any president (Democrat or Republican), aside from a rally or campaigning.

I've seen people wear shirts where Trump is depicted next to an eagle and he's in a Rambo outfit."

Dont be the First one,They did that here in Germany back in 2020 when Disney+ became available here. Put the first episode on free tv without ads.
Dont be the First one,"Expect a lot of this later in the year when the writers strike really sets in and they have to pull full series of stuff to Broadcast to fill the slots. 

Right now this is just advertising for this third season of The Mandalorian."
Dont be the First one,"I actually finally watched Boba Fett last week and what a strange journey it was. Some of the first few episodes were literal hot dog water and it felt like halfway through the writers were like, “Fuck it, we don’t know what else to do” so they just made Mandalorian season 2.5."
Dont be the First one,You know what else would boost viewership? A physical release. God Disney I’m begging you. Just let me complete my Star Wars and Marvel physical collections
Dont be the First one,"Finally I can watch it, but please when Doctor Who premieres, put it on ABC or Freeform or something"
Dont be the First one,Back in my days we’d call this re-runs…
Dont be the First one,"INteresting that they are putting this on TV, but that nice so that you dont necessarily have to have Disney Plus."
Dont be the First one,That’s my birthday! And then anniversary of the start of the Ukraine war😔
Dont be the First one,"Streaming exclusivity might have been a good move initially, but it may make more sense to release shows on both tv and streaming. That's part of what makes HBO's business model strong. A lot of people have HBO on cable or various other places. You can still watch premiers if you have those avenues. While those that don't can get access for it through the direct to consumer option which has been fleshed out into a netflix competitor. So you can keep watching it after the premier."
Dont be the First one,This is the way
Dont be the First one,Trying that Paramount+ method of flooding the show out there to get support. They did that recently with 1923 and maybe Mayor of Kingstown too.
Dont be the First one,Cool. Now Peacock needs to do this with Poker Face too.
Dont be the First one,This is the way
Dont be the First one,"That's cool.  I've been interested but didn't really want to sign up for another service I never watch. Which reminds me, I need to cancel that Netflix thing...."

Dont be the First one,"“I can bring you in warm, or I can you in cold”"
Dont be the First one,I hate dumb journalism like this. Call it what it is…..  “Disney Corp is airing an hour-long commercial for their streaming service across three of their owned broadcast and cable networks instead of giving those viewers original programming.”
Dont be the First one,"Honestly they should have done it sooner.  It's like really long commercials, hook people in with early seasons of shows right as a new season is coming out on the streaming platform to try to get a couple months of service out of them and hopefully convert them to a customer..lol"
Dont be the First one,Simulcast? You mean tv but aired online no rewinds and a lot of ads?
Dont be the First one,Disney must be worried about their earnings call.
Dont be the First one,I love this and I love we're seeing more of this with streaming. Give me the shared experience of a premiere more often. Now do it with the season premiere. Put it on FX Thursday night and then Disney+ right after. HBO shows obviously are high quality shows but there's no doubt that the fact that the Sunday night prestigious HBO show spot still exists is why there's so much more engagement on these HBO shows than almost everything else. Everyone is watching together again.

Dont be the First one,Disney doesn't want the last of us and HBO getting all the good ratings attention so they gotta show Mando as many places as possible
Dont be the First one,I wonder if Pedro and crew will get residuals of any kind from this? Knowing how shifty streaming services are with their contracts and payouts (looking at you Disney+ and Black Widow) probably little to nothing

Nice."
Dont be the First one,"honestly surprised it hasn't been done earlier by streaming channels. I get they want exclusivity, but running it on regular cable networks seems like a logical set up for 3rd+ runs of the show. And Disney is using their TV networks too, so costs should be minimal to them. But you'd think selling some older streaming shows to places like ION TV or something for the perpetual reruns would be worth something."
Dont be the First one,How many eps are they releasing?
Dont be the First one,"A large portion of broadcast TV is unscripted now anyway. They can just double down on sports, reality shows (the ones that don't have union writers), etc. But I could definitely see them filling slots with older streaming shows too."
Dont be the First one,Nobody cares
Dont be the First one,Robotic cyber-teens on space mopeds!
Dont be the First one,"I truly felt like they had no idea what to do like you said. They wanted to make a Boba show because of the name recognition but, at the end of the day, Mando is basically what a Boba show should be. They couldn’t have two shows be the same thing so they wrote the mess that was the first four episodes of that show. Then they just gave up and went back to Mando"
Dont be the First one,It's funny one of the best episodes of Mandalorian isn't in Mandalorian.
Dont be the First one,The best part of Boba Fett the series without Mando was the scene when they first hinted he was coming back.
Dont be the First one,Dont forget the slowest speederchase on in star wars history. ALso they are far to shiney for a desert.
Dont be the First one,"I liked episode 2? of Boba Fett, or whichever episode had the train heist.

Really liked it actually. In my opinion the best episodes of the Mandalorian were always the steady burn action-western ones and that episode basically nailed it."
Dont be the First one,I think Pascal was booked already so they couldn’t film a full season of mando and instead they did a weird hybrid.
Dont be the First one,"When they first teased ""The Book of Boba Fett"" at the end of Mandalorian season 2 I thought it was going to be season 3 of Mando instead of its own show. Like a sort of anthology, seasons 1 and 2 would be ""The Mandalorian: The Books of Din Djarin"" and season 3 would be ""The Mandalorian: The Book of Boba Fett"".

In hindsight, I think if Boba Fett had been season 3 with no other changes and they made it clear that the story was shifting focus to a different set of characters it would have been better received. Of course, some people would stop watching because no more Baby Yoda, but when Din and Grogu do show up again it would be like going back to watch a season you missed instead of feeling like being forced to watch a different show in order to keep up with the main one.

It seems riskier on paper, but I think that strategy would have paid off better than how they handled it."
Dont be the First one,"I disagree. For the opposite 

The first few were amazing. Though only the flashbacks. The flashbacks with the sand people were masterfully done 

The episode where he builds his weapon and goes on that drug induced journey. It was so good

Once we stopped getting flash backs is when the show became mediocre"
Dont be the First one,"According to Favreau (who wrote the show), he saw it as Mando 2.5 from the start. They were continuing boba’s journey that we started to see in Mando 2, but also figured that of course Mando would help his new buddy boba out. 

Personally, I think it’s pretty obvious what happened. Mando S3 was getting delayed because of Pedro, Disney needed a show to fill the gap, and Favreau slapped something together to keep the mandoverse train rolling.  That would also line up with him seeing it as Mando 2.5 from the start; of course he would see it that way since it’s the show to fill the gap and keep the mandoverse going while people are waiting for S3.

Sadly, it ended up being an uneven, meandering, anticlimactic mess. The Mando episodes were really good though, and I really liked the sand people stuff. I also have a theory that those were planned to be the start of Mando S3 but got rolled into boba to tide people over."
Dont be the First one,I must be the only goofball alive who liked it mostly. I really like the idea of people changing. I think the show could have used a little more exposition explaining his change in character. That’s huge too because I’m a fan of show and not tell stories.
Dont be the First one,I definitely feel like Disney forced them to make BoBF and the “Mandalorian” episodes were originally written for Mando Season 3.
Dont be the First one,Imo The Book Of Boba Fett is probably the worst “big thing” show Disney+ has done. It only became good when it became another show… and brought back a personal favorite character.
Dont be the First one,"Yeah I really liked the flashbacks to Boba’s time with the Tuscans, but the handing of Boba’s power struggle with Mos Espa was embarrassing."
Dont be the First one,"The 2nd episode is excellent, but yeah not much outside. Clearly another obi wan where it was a movie shifted into a mini series"
Dont be the First one,"I collect 4Ks and blu rays, and I just realized I had no idea there wasn’t any Mandalorian physical media. It makes sense I suppose, given it was THE first major show for the platform… but man 😭 you could do so much cool stuff with a proper boxset release"
Dont be the First one,"I work in the film industry, and I’ve worked on 9 marvel projects. Until recently I had a complete collection of physical collection of every project that I’ve worked on.  Now with streaming only releases, it isn’t possible anymore to have my complete “Resume Collection.”"
Dont be the First one,"They didn’t release the episodes on dvd and Blu-ray? I don’t collect physical media anymore, so I haven’t been paying attention— but that’s actually fairly surprising. 

Did they release the last season of Clone Wars? That would drive me insane, if they didn’t!"
Dont be the First one,Unfortunately definitely not a worthwhile investment anymore for studios to manufacture physical media
Dont be the First one,"They’ll only air one episode, or maybe a few, but they won’t broadcast the full season because they want to drive D+ subscriptions."
Dont be the First one,"From what I've heard, this is part of some scheme to cook the books and offset the costs of streaming. By putting these shows *back* on regular TV."
Dont be the First one,There's something for everyone!
Dont be the First one,"I still think AMC carpet-bombing the *Mayfair Witches* premiere across AMC+, AMC, Acorn TV, ALLBLK, HIDIVE, IFC, BBC AMERICA, Shudder, Sundance Now, Sundance TV and WE tv holds the prize for this type of promotion."
Dont be the First one,Yes they do. They could drop the sound of a couple of F bombs and show the first two episodes.
Dont be the First one,"If they did something like that, it should just be all the best Peacock content on one branded ""Peacock night"" per week. Same with Paramount/CBS, seems like a way to drive new subs from the traditional broadcast audience."
Dont be the First one,mandalorian is the best thing on tv. you’re reducing it to a commercial.
Dont be the First one,You talk as if The Mandalorian is not a monster on streaming and the biggest show of D+...Besides TLOU is not even bigger than things like Euphoria and House of Dragon to demand that kind of action.
Dont be the First one,Or as it's known there kostenloses Fernsehen ohne Werbung.
Dont be the First one,CBS showed the first season of Discovery a couple years ago during the slow season.
Dont be the First one,"I’d prefer they do that than remove the shows from existence.

I imagine they just must not deem it that profitable? They’d rather archive a show to avoid paying out royalties and residuals. 

This didn’t used to be a problem at all, but the latest round of SAG-AFTRA negotiations bumped up the rates that streaming services have to pay to actors. That’s the real reason for the specific pattern that’s been occurring, along with high interest rates"
Dont be the First one,I'm starting to get the impression that these companies want to avoid paying royalties to creatives as much as possible (which is why shows are getting taken off services) and I imagine airing them on broadcast doesn't help with that.

They love each other, but it's like Capulets vs Montagues, it would never work."
Invisible City,"I doubt I am the intended audience, but this looks like it has been churned out with as little extra work as they could get away with. 

The background in the majority of the trailer is a still, completely unanimated city, with no attempt to even make it feel slightly alive. The main models are, I imagine, left over from the movie, but the animation is terrible - look at when Yi hugs the monster at 34 seconds in and her hand just floats above it. 

It looks like the cast from the movie (or at least some) have returned, but Chloe Bennet just doesn't sound like a 15 year old girl and the others are pretty generic. 

They squeeze in a burp and a toilet joke in under 2 mins, which shows the quality of writing and where it is being pitched. 

This is the very definition of TV filler."

Invisible City,"I'm brazillian and there were a bunch of things I didn't like about how our folklore was portrayed. 

First, Iara isn't black, she is indigenous. She was a great warrior that got attacked by her two jealous brothers and killed then, afraid of the punishment her father, the Pajé, would give her, she ran but he caught up to her and threw her in the river. The fish turned her half fish to keep her from drowning and then afterwards she started killing men. That story is much more awesome than the one in the serie. 

I didn't liked Cuca as well because she should be half crocodile! 

There was also a boto in the sea!

There were no indigenous people at all in the series! It's like they were trying to erase them. 

The environmental police officer investigating a murderer was kinda forced too."
Invisible City,"Question, was his wife also a folkloric figure?

I ask, because from the little I gathered, Corpo Seco only had that effect on spirit beings, so it never quite makes sense to me as to why she would die as she did. 

I'm not sure that a season 2 is necessary. I think that the story was told in a satisfactory manner. A season 2 would eventually come off like 'As aventuras de Eric, filho do boto!'

What we never quite learn is who turned Ines, Isac, and Camila into the spirit beings. The Capoira, Boto, and Curupira all seemed to have been created as spirits. But the rest of them were all humans made into spirit beings upon death. Curiously, from what I gathered, Ines, Isac , and Camila represented multiple figures combined into one."
Invisible City,"On the other hand, maybe that makes the show look ""mysterious"" for outsiders, in a good way. 

It's probably like me watching [The Yin-Yang Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdZPRVpJXB8) and wondering ""what in the actual fuck did I just see?"" every couple of scenes. =)"
Invisible City,"I think that a great deal of the version of the Dry Body shown in the show took some artistic liberties, like was the case with the other characters. In the original legend the Dry Body is, as the name implies, a ghoulish undead creature that in some versions consumes the lifeforce of the living - and in a few ones they specifically mention that he consumes *the blood* of the living, making it a Brazilian version of the vampire. I don't think that there's ever mention of him being able to exist as a spirit changing bodies or being able to suck the lifeforce of other entities, but in the show they opted for that.

Anyhow, the origin is similar to what we see in the show - a man so evil that when he died neither Heaven nor Hell accepted his soul, which was then forced back into his rotting, mummifying corpse. And in the end Earth itself reject his body, spitting it out, and then he begun to roam through eternity haunting the living."
Invisible City,"give a chance to ""tropa de elite"", its a very good brazilian movie"

I am Brazilian too and I never heard this origin story. Source? :)

The only thing that I found weird about the Iara was that she's usually a fresh water mermaid, living in large rivers. But then, as in the case of the Boto, they took the liberty of putting fresh water entities in sea water because the show is set in Rio de Janeiro. But they hint that this was possible only due to supernatural causes - Eric gets completely befuddled when he finds a dead pink Amazon river dolphin in the beach.

> I didn't liked Cuca as well because she should be half crocodile!

\* Alligator. :) But [in the original legend](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuca) the Cuca can have both completely human shape as well as a reptilian one. Remember, she is a powerful witch and a shapeshifter. Also, all the entities had abandoned their original, almost entirely destroyed habitat, and forced to live in a large city disguised as humans.

But who knows, maybe in the next season she will assume the reptilian form. ;)

> There were no indigenous people at all in the series! It's like they were trying to erase them.

Actually there were, when we have flashbacks of the Curupira's origin we see that in his mortal life he was married to an Indian woman that was killed by (apparently) a white farmer. Also, it seemed to me that in the fisher village they preserved some indigenous traditions and knowledge (like when Ciço performs a ritual on Eric), although after centuries they were already highly mixed."

A série claramente foca em dizer que as entidades (como foi bem mostrados nos flashback da origem de cada uma) eram originalmente pessoas comuns, que devido a uma série de fatores/condições, se tornou ""encantada"". As exceções são o Boto, o Curupira e o Tutu, que não ficam bem claros No caso da Iara por exemplo, o original (o que se sabe, pq foi bastante alterada) era de uma índia que foi morta por traição e jogada nas águas, e no seu rancor retornou como entidade para se vingar, afogando os homens. A Iara da série passou pelo mesmo, então provavelmente o que a série quis passar é que não existe apenas uma Iara, mas ""Iara"" é uma entidade que pode surgir quando essas condições se repetem. O mesmo com a Cuca, o Corpo Seco, o Saci... Isso é bem comum no nosso folclore, então creio que é a raiz das origens de boa parte das entidades.

> I didn't liked Cuca as well because she should be half crocodile!

- A Cuca era meio crocodilo só no Sítio do Pica Pau Amarelo. A lenda original veio de Portugal e não tem nada disso.

> There was also a boto in the sea!

- O Boto foi morto na praia, mas nada diz que veio do mar.
 
> There were no indigenous people at all in the series! It's like they were trying to erase them.

Bem, como já disse, as entidades vieram de pessoas comuns. Pelas roupas, essas pessoas viviam na região do Rio poucos séculos atrás. E não havia mais muitos índios lá nessa época... Nem sei como o Curupira escapou. Talvez na 2 temporada coloquem mais, espero."
Invisible City,I agree!!!!!!! Iara not being indigenous really made me upset
Invisible City,"> A season 2 would eventually come off like 'As aventuras de Eric, filho do boto!'

Well maybe, maybe not. I would like to see other entities in season 2, like the Boitatá (the Fire Serpent), and the [Caboclo D'Água](http://www.guiadosquadrinhos.com/personagem/caboclo-dagua/39624), who probably inspired aquatic movie creatures like those of The Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Shape of Water - ""coincidentally"" always coming from South America. =) Also, there's plenty of local stories tied to specific cities / places, like [the Blonde of Bonfim](https://globoplay.globo.com/v/2328146/)."

Invisible City,"Look up New England, US Vampires— this “dry body” version in the show is a very similar version of historic folklore in the area I live in! There is a great podcast with a story about it — Ashley Flower’s Podcast, “Supernatural”"
Invisible City,"Thanks, I'll check it out."
Invisible City,"Iara in the series says different cultures call her by different names, including mermaids and Mother of Waters. 

This is not a documentary, so it's possible they made her be an entity that is present in several cultures, pretty much how you can trace parallels between Zeus, Thor, Jupiter and even the catholic God.

[Mami Wata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mami_Wata#Names ) is an African legend often described as a mermaid-like figure that was brought to Brazil by African slaves, including in the form of [Yemanjá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yem%E1%BB%8Dja), a deity that was mixed with the catholic [Our Lady of Navigators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yem%E1%BB%8Dja#Syncretism) (Nossa Senhora dos Navegantes).

Saci Perere is originally an indigenous legend that was africanized.

Cuca is originally an Iberian legend and the alligator thing was created in Brazil. A lot of Brazilian folklore is a mix of Portuguese, African and indigenous legends. 

The writers of the series took some liberties to make them more human and place then in an urban environment."
Invisible City,"> Alligator

Actually, the jacaré is a [caiman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiman), a close relative of the alligator."
Invisible City,"But it really frustrated me, most Brazilian legends are in fact indigenous legends, there are few with blacks, after all their beliefs have evolved into religions. I understand that they want to give representation to the black population, but with that they erase all the influence of indigenous people who became part of the Brazilian culture thanks to the children of ingienas with whites (caipiras and synonyms)"
Invisible City,"Na prática Eles apagaram os índios. Super tinha como fazer personagens indígenas seguindo esses princípios, eles fizeram assim porque quiseram."
Invisible City,"But then at that point, the story would be different. 

As I understood the series, the central focus was on Eric finding his way and ultimately restoring the balance between the worlds.

We see that he has a half sibling, and his daughter, like him, will one day take upon a similar role. She's a quarter legendary being, whereas he is half. 

I don't think the aim of the show was to showcase every entity. That would be an interesting series, but I don't think it fits with the story they told here."
Invisible City,"The original vampire legends from Eastern Europe also often involved someone who did something ungodly in life being tormented by a curse after death. The modern view of ""vampirism as a communicable disease"" seems to have appeared in literature over the 19th century and then was boosted by movies from the 1900s on."

I am curious to see if in the next season they will touch more on the subject of Afro-Brazilian deities."
Invisible City,"

>Saci Perere is originally an indigenous legend that was africanized.

Actually, it's a bit more complicated....

>A lot of Brazilian folklore is a mix of Portuguese, African and indigenous legends. 

Saci is actually the poster boy for this phrase in a way no brazilian myth could be. He is originated from indigenous myths, like the Jaci Jaterê (a treacherous creature whose powers come from his magic staff, and if anyone is able to take away his staff, he throws himself to the ground and cries like a small child, just like how Saci needs his hat), but he is also influenced by the portuguese trasgo (a treacherous creature who uses a red hat and loves playing pranks), and also Anoni (a minor deity from Africa who was part of the yoruba pantheon, sometimes portrayed as a man with only one leg and smoking a pipe).

Because of this, i don't think it's reasonable to refer to the myth of Saci as ""indigenous"". He is a mixture of many different myths and should be considered its own thing. 

P.S: sorry for the lack of sources, but I couldn't find any in english. You can search any of those names, though."
Invisible City,"> caiman

Today I learned! I thought that they were one and the same. :)"
Invisible City,"Na verdade o povo indígena foi representado na vila da floresta, são cablocos pescadores. Cablocos aqui não como raça/cor de pele, mas como um amálgama cultural entre índios e brancos, mas que vivem na floresta e respeitam as tradições e valorizam a terra que os criou"
Invisible City,"> But then at that point, the story would be different.

Yup. Personally, I hope that they opt for an anthology series like American Horror Story or The Haunting of Hill House / Bly Mansion, with a different story / characters each season."
Invisible City,"Nah honestly Elite Squad and City Of God focus way too much on ""slums"" and misery and while it's been a reality in some place its one of the reasons why North-Americans see Brazil in such a bad light. We're not just slums and rainforests, we have actual cities lol. And we're not a freaking Spanish colony in Africa or whatever they seem to think... We're very mixed, racially. Pale looking blonde people all the way to Asian looking people. Those films are classics, yeah, but they don't help making Brazil look better; because what is portrayed in those films is not how the entirety of Brazil is.

Sorry for the rant. I just hate stereotypes so much."
Invisible City,You are totally right. I simplified it too much because I didn't want to enter in all details about Saci and Cuca like I did with Iara.
Invisible City,É que ainda tem tribos indígenas no Brasil. Acho importante valorizar isso. Eles já são muito apagados da nossa história.
Invisible City,"It would destroy the continuity of the show. 

I'd like to know why he was unable to kill Camila and why Corpo Seco was so enraged when she was in the home. Was he fully in possession of Luna at that point? If not, maybe it was just Luna."
Invisible City,"The guy asked for good movies made in Brazil. You totally can inform the guy that these movies are not representative of Brazil as a whole, but whatever you think about them, these are good movies, with good productions, very good actors and do show some facets of Brazilian life. 
 
Your comment is exactly what you mentioned. Just a rant since you didn’t suggest any other movie and you are not being helpful at all. 

BTW, any movie industry is not an exact image of the country they represent. Hollywood's movies are not how US are entirely. Bollywood's movies are not how India is entirey. K-drama/Dorama is not how South Korea is entirey. Mexican novelas are not how Mexico is entirey. 

If someone watch a movie and think the entire country is that way, that person is pretty naive and it’s more their problem than a production problem. I understand that there is a trend to portray Brazil's poverty in movies made for international market, but you can't devalue the quality of these movies just based on that."
Invisible City,"No, it's fine. I'd say that, despite the influences, the other myths have ""clearer"" origins (cuca is european, curupira is indigenous...), but Saci is quite complicated in comparison."
Invisible City,"I liked it. Are those legends supposed to be like a minor magical race(like fairies of folklore in the west) or something worshipped as gods at some point?

A few years ago there was another mystical folklore single season series set in rainforest of the Amazon, fun show to, can't remember the name of it."
Invisible City,"I just binged the entire season this evening. Super glad your thread isn't archived so I have some place to express my excitement!

I really enjoyed it and am eager to see what creature Eric will be revived as. If I understand correctly, the creatures were human once and died tragically. Then were revived as these magic creatures? 

Wonder if this is part of Brazilian folk lore, or unique to this retelling?

Hope this thread doesn't get archived before S2 arrives."
Invisible City,"Well, I'm not sure. There are many stories and thus many versions of those legends. There are some of them that didn't appear like the Headless Mule. A mule that has fire where it's head should be."
Invisible City,"If you like that sort of series opening, you should check out at least the first episode of ID: Invaded.  The main character wakes up in a mysterious dimension with no more context than the viewer has.  Without spoiling too much of the mystery of the first episode, I think I can mention that it's a sci-fi crime series, sort of similar to Psycho-Pass."

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Invisible City,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching.

Invisible City,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ❤️"
Invisible City,Yellowjackets?
Invisible City,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Invisible City,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Invisible City,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Invisible City,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Invisible City,Why?
Invisible City,"😐 .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. 😅"
Invisible City,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Invisible City,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Invisible City,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Invisible City,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Invisible City,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! 😩
Invisible City,Ted Lasso anybody?
Invisible City,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Invisible City,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Invisible City,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Invisible City,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Invisible City,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Invisible City,Nordic shows are great
Invisible City,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Invisible City,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Invisible City,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Invisible City,"Awww.. THANK YOU! 😄💕 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Invisible City,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Invisible City,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salomé by Oscar Wilde."
Invisible City,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Invisible City,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. 😅💕
Invisible City,I havent seen Akta either but I know what you're talking about. lol.
Invisible City,Luckily haven’t seen a single one of these lol
Invisible City,I highly disagree about Heels.. it was a well written show with good drama.
Invisible City,A worst shows of 2021 list is incomplete without Apple TV's Invasion included.
Invisible City,I will not stand for Heels slander.
Invisible City,"i had to sit thru Sex/Life. Wife loved it, for me every minute was torture."
Invisible City,I'm not entirely convinced half of these shows aren't made up.
Invisible City,"I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin. It was canceled the same day it was released (hyperbole).

Also, where are Wheel Of Time and Foundation? Again, I enjoyed both, but I spent a considerable amount of time on both subs and both series are very divisive 

Heels doesn't belong on this list. A Best of 2021 series..

I agree with Yasuke. I was expecting historical fiction that made me Google a whole bunch of terms, but instead we got some science fiction junk. Did have a great soundtrack."
Kid Cosmic,"Glad Netflix isn't so cancel-happy for animated series as they are for live-action. Season 1 was an absolute delight, would highly recommend to people of any age."
Kid Cosmic,"Despite finding the titular Kid Cosmic to be an insufferable albeit realistic child character, he comes around at the very end and the payoff of season one was great.  According to the press release, the reason Jo is the focus of this trailer is because season 2 is about Jo learning to lead, and season 3 will be Papa G learning sacrifice.  Which of course means he's gonna die."
Kid Cosmic,This show is super fun. I love the art style. Can’t wait for more
Kid Cosmic,I tried watching the first ep and couldn't really get into it. Maybe I’ll give it another episode or two.
Kid Cosmic,"Most of what I watch on Netflix these days is animated content. Especially if looking at new shows I've started in the past two years. I haven't even started a single new live action show on Netflix this year, but have started three animated shows. Hopefully Centaurworld gets renewed too."
Kid Cosmic,I'm sure they order these in bigger batches and spread them out. you can't produce 10 episodes of kipo or whatever in a few months.
Kid Cosmic,"The parallels between Kid and the red neck man-child in the last episodes were awesome.

>  Which of course means he's gonna die.

That would be pretty fucked up, given Kid already lost his parents."
Kid Cosmic,It gets better
Kid Cosmic,That’s how they did it for Infinity Train.
Kid Cosmic,"Really can't wait, and a bit surprised, since Season 2 only dropped in September. Granted, the seasons are pretty short.

I want more *Powerpuff  Girls* easter eggs!"
Kid Cosmic,Love the art style. Reminds me of the early Gorillaz designs.
Kid Cosmic,"Someone in the reply comments on Twitter said it looks like ""a French BD come to life"", which makes sense since Craig said Tintin was a main inspiration for this."
Kid Cosmic,article’s been 404ing all day
Kid Cosmic,"I'm sure this is a cost thing but although the backgrounds look very rich, the characters are completely clean, with no textures. I wish they'd been able to transfer that hand-drawn style to the more dynamic parts of the frame."
Kid Cosmic,the spirit of old cartoon network lives!!!
Kid Cosmic,"Im actually gonna make it instead.

Its gonna be a Jason Roiland spin off thats kid friendly."
Kid Cosmic,"Just what we needed...more bean mouth, bubble head animations...yay."
Kid Cosmic,[removed]
Kid Cosmic,"Wow, I saw the poster for it, but didn't see any animation yet. This looks gorgeous!"
Kid Cosmic,Glad to see Craig back after suffering the one-two punch of having *Wander Over Yonder* cancelled and Cartoon Network rebooting *The Powerpuff Girls* without his input (and rebooted again as an upcoming live-action show).
Kid Cosmic,"I think part of the magic with this show is often I would forget while watching that it's a kids show. I know, it's got kids in it and it's silly but I felt more immersed in the plots than I usually am. You end up really rooting for the kid to succeed. Just my two cents."
Kid Cosmic,"***Loved*** this show on Netflix. And the setup they left with for S2.  And, as someone still in mourning for *DuckTales,* it was incredibly cheering to see Francisco Angones's name on the writing credits for the first episode."
Kid Cosmic,Holy wall of text
Kid Cosmic,I think Star Trek Enterprise would have really hit a sweetspot with the whole romulan war and stuff that would've happened had it not been canceled.
Kid Cosmic,"So, CBS had a whole NCIS universe happening, and through various crossovers, it tied into the Peter Lenkov reboot universe (Hawaii Five-0, MacGyver, Magnum P.I.) as well as Scorpion.

At one point on Five-0, Kono leaves the island to go hunt sex traffickers, never ti return. IRL, her departure was tied to a contract dispute (fuck the producers, she deserved the raise, but that's another story).

However, it would have been so cool to have a massive, season-long crossover event where Kono went coast to coast chasing those traffickers, guest starring on the various shows in the shared universe as she continued her hunt. She could have teamed with NCIS: LA, then gone elsewhere in California with Team Scorpion, petitioned the Phoenix Foundation (MacGyver) to help somewhere, stopped in New Orleans, and made her way to Washington to come all the way back to the original NCIS. 

Epic fucking fail, CBS."
Kid Cosmic,"I wish that Harper's Island had spawned a series of ""who-dun-it"" type shows where the fans could interact online with different clues as to who the killer was. That was the original idea behind the show but it only had one season and very few viewers.

I always thought there was a lot of room to grow a show where each season was a different mystery and you could go online to their website and look for clues, interact with other fans, watch video shorts, etc.

I still haven't seen a show do this, and I think there is a huge missed opportunity here."
Kid Cosmic,"1. Friends - Ross should've stayed together with Emily. They seemed to be more equal , have more in common. Ross and Rachel made ZERO sense. I think if Emily stayed it would've been refreshing for the show which got stale at that point. 

2. LOST - the mystery of ""What's the deal with Walt?"" never got addressed satisfactorily and IMO, was one of the more tantalizing mysteries on the show 

3. Dawson's Creek - Andi was by far more interesting than Joey or Jen ever was. She should've stayed with Pacey. And i think they should've gambled by writing off one group of characters and following the other - either have Dawson go to USC and retool the show to focus on his time there OR write out Dawson and follow Pacey/Joey in Boston. 

4. Felicity - Season 1 was fantastic. The rest sucked. Felicity never really grew as a person. She ended the way she started. She should've dated Noel and stuck to art. I would've written off Megan, Elena, and Sean early on. And frankly, write out Ben - he clearly was failing school, didn't belong."
Kid Cosmic,"Quantum Leap should've gone through with it's planned crossover with Magnum PI

And while never planned like that one was... Murder She Wrote and Columbo should've also had a crossover."
Kid Cosmic,Star Trek Picard should have really killed off Picard at the end of season one. Rios’ ship should have then been renamed “The Picard”.  Any seasons after that would follow the adventures of Rios and the rest of the gang without Patrick Stewart.
Kid Cosmic,Jackie and Hyde should have stayed together.
Kid Cosmic,"In Doctor Who, The Doctor and Master's relationship should have evolved after season 10 when Missy wanted to join his side. The character had a clear progression in that season, so I wish he didn't revert back to 'hehe I am evil and I just want your attention' psycho that we saw in Season 12. Of course, the characterisation of the Master is the least of the problems with that run of the show, but it really upset me how they flushed down one of the better character arcs for the sake of cheap villainy. He could have been a friend/advisor/companion/rival. Many things really."
Kid Cosmic,"A Faith the Vampire Slayer spin off could have been amazing. The rumored concept of Faith travelling from town to town like the Littlest Hobo would have made for a cool niche of its own between Angel's big city LA and Buffy's small town Sunnydale, well predating Supernatural & Co, but could also have been used to function as essentially an anthology. I think she would have been a really interesting character to see out there, cut off from any better or worse influences, and having no safe havens or support systems to lean on. 

It would have allowed for a huge amount of storytelling flexibility, and the format would also have played to Eliza Dushku's strengths way better than Dollhouse. 

The only caveat is that I was never sure Whedon (all else aside) really understood the character's appeal. A lot of her best moments/episodes were steered by other writers.

Supposedly it was proposed to Dushku but she was afraid of being typecast."
Kid Cosmic,"Grimm should gave left both love interests as they were(no redemptions, stay dead, etc), and stuck to no magic, everything being biochem/bio stuff"
Kid Cosmic,"The Flintstones had success with the future spin off, The Jetson, but I feel a current day spin off would have garnered the same sort of success as The Simpsons. Being able to reference current events in the jokes would have given the show a lot wider appeal than the predecessors."
Kid Cosmic,OP should have picked one example…
Kid Cosmic,"yea, i just upvoted n scroll down to the comments. lol. don't have time to read all that sorry OP. 😅"
Kid Cosmic,Sometimes I feel like the only person who really liked Star Trek Enterprise. The Romulan War would have been amazing :(
Kid Cosmic,"Yeah, they should've been focusing entirely on the Romulans and the first steps into the Federation from the very beginning.

Not that Temporal Cold War crap."
Kid Cosmic,The show is filled with plotholes and lazy writings. I was trying to count and I found atleast 17.
Kid Cosmic,"Sir, this is a Wandys"
Kid Cosmic,"I loved the finale but can understand where people may have had problems

White Vision felt a little shoehorned in. I appreciate that it was there to set up a possible future story for Vision and I enjoyed the dialogue between them but it did feel rushed

Some of the lack of screen time for side characters in the finale was due to Covid I believe. I read somewhere that the credits had the name for a ""Darcy double"" which makes me think Kat Dennings wasn't available because of Covid restrictions and had to have her face digitally inserted into the scene

The one part I completely disagree with you on is your claim that Wanda's grief just ""ends"" in the finale. She knows exactly what she has done and what she has lost and it is incredibly clear that her story isn't over (something I would say if we didn't even know her upcoming return in Doctor Strange 2). She knows that before she can deal with anything head on, she needs to learn more about herself and her powers. Her powers being natural also more closely align with her mutant origin from the comics"
Kid Cosmic,"You seem to have misunderstood some elements of the story.

Wanda didn't really have a backstory for them to ruin. She almost died to a stark bomb as a kid, was exposed to the mind stone and got powers SOMEHOW. Even in the movies and tv shoes that came before no one understood HOW Wanda got her powers from the mind stone cause it killed EVERYONE. 

secondly, the Agatha all along bit wasn't establishing that Agatha did everything. It sort of implied but the ending makes it very clear, Wanda set up the town, Agatha found it and infiltrated it and began manipulating Wanda to steal her power.  The Agatha All Along element was that Agatha was the one disrupting Wanda's perfect life.

The final battle was pretty meh and the fact that Wanda was let off the hook for kidnapping and torturing a town is really weak. Also the Peter reveal was pretty uninteresting so they definitely dropped the ball on some important elements."
Kid Cosmic,"THANK YOU!!! I felt like I was crazy seeing so many praising the finale. Which sucks bc I genuinely loved episodes 1-7.

 However I had many of the same problems. Mainly with this episode being dedicated to Visions farewell, except that he got the Loki and Gamora treatment and is now still out there... Weird vibe.

Also probably super unpopular opinion but the Monica Rambo scenes felt so out of place with the rest of the show. I also did not understand how her powers work. Or how she got so incredibly powerful just from Wandas magic. Very random element to me, not a huge Capt Marvel fan to begin with"
Kid Cosmic,"I largely agree with you, though perhaps not in extent.  I'd stop short of saying the last 2 episodes *ruined* the series, but they were, to me, quite a letdown.  I largely expected to be disappointed though.  It's really hard to coherently pull back the curtain for the grand reveal on a weird, wonderful, mysterious series, as was built up in the first half of the show.

The thing that *did* ultimately work for me was Wanda's feeling of loss resonated.  She had lost so much in the MCU, this was how she coped, and once again she was going to lose everything.  I totally understand if the show had already lost you by that point.

I was, like you, really disappointed that Agatha was in fact the big bad.  I personally hate the [she-planned-it-all-along trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan).  It can work, if done carefully, which was certainly not the case here.

Monica's demonstration of her powers was so slapped on, such a ham-fisted, obvious hinting at future MCU expansion.  It felt like something Zach Snyder would do.  

I don't know that Wanda got away from all this disaster without consequence for her actions.  It's really left up in the air what the ramifications are."
Kid Cosmic,"
>The strong and almost unarguable implication is that Agatha’s switch to being a villain is Wanda’s work

That's not the implication at all. They clearly show Agatha coming into Westview and transforming herself to fit the aesthetic. She's in Wanda's bubble but she is in control of herself and since Wanda doesn't really understand or is in denial about what is happening that gives Agatha the ability to manipulate her and the situation to get what she wants, which is Wanda's power.


>that she is some kind of super-witch, immune (somehow) to Wanda’s powers, who created and controlled Pietro (maybe), and even killed her own dog for some reason

It's shown in the show that Vision can break the spell for people in the world. It's not hard to believe that Agatha would be able to protect herself from it.

She killed the dog to stress out Wanda. Her entire goal was to get Wanda to give up her magic. She is using Wanda's grief and desperation to feel whole to get it. By causing chaos and turmoil in Westview that pushes Wanda further into desperation making it more likely for Agatha get what she wants.

That's as far as I got in this. I would like to read it all but this post is just too long."
Kid Cosmic,"As far as Heyward tracking Vision, he said he was tracking the vibranium signature. It's explained that Wanda's powers literally change reality, so she created a vibranium Vision."
Kid Cosmic,"Just finished the series and although I only read the initial paragraphs of the OP post about Agatha, that subject is why I came online to see if I was somehow the only person who thought this way. I am a casual Marvel fan and have seen most of the films and I enjoy them and the interconnected universe they set up. Even though I knew the basic premise of Wandavision before watching, I really enjoyed how it developed and how it turned out to be Scarlet Witch basically dealing with her grief and the sinister prison that she'd created, the implications of that and the challenge for Vision and the outsiders to try and free people and get through to Wanda. 

Only, like the OP says, for the intriguing storyline to get completely thrown out the window from episode 8. Exactly as the OP says I was convinced the Agatha scenes were Scarlet's subconscious creating a villain to blame it on. I thought the Agatha ancient witch scene was a comedy style TV parody of how villainous witches are made, another interesting change in direction of the fake TV Wanda had been created. But as it went on I started to realise with absolute disbelief that this was the actual plot! Its so stupid, its so forced, it completely undermines everything the show had built up to that point. What's most disappointing is how it took such an original idea and just turned it straight back into the generic Marvel fare. What a joke, made even worse that we actually thought it WAS a joke until it... wasn't.

Its such a shame as there was so much potential for real tension at the end, emotional  resolution with Vision, the plight of the townspeople, and so on. I don't read the comics and so don't give a damn about artificially inserted witches storyline. I haven't seen the Dr Strange movies but for me the magic side of the universe just doesn't work in the setting they've created through the other movies, its so jarring. But that's a side note, the main issue is the last two episodes just destroy all the tension, mystery and emotional potential from what had been an enjoyable show up to then. Also the addition of the scenes of the lady who passes through the barrier and somehow has powers was so confusing - after reading up it seems she is a bit part character from Captain Marvel or something, But for the average viewer why would you think she had powers or understand wtf is going on there. It's just so random.

Great concept and commendable for most of it, with a, terrible, terrible ending. What a shame!"
Kid Cosmic,"*Nailed* it. I feel almost exactly the same way.

It was all over a period of just one week, though, not months."
Kid Cosmic,"I think the show was very very good and it just missed the landing. And that's ok. I have my complaints about it, but I still enjoyed it and thought it was a worthwhile watch. And, I'm sure that as phase 4 gets fleshed out more it will make more sense. But, for now, we are kind of just sitting on a pile of red herrings that went no where."
Kid Cosmic,"Hard agree. The ending reminded me completely if game of thrones...an amazing ride that was rhetroactively invalidated by a horrible ending. If your fanbase comes up with a better ending than the professional workers, then the audince is going to feel let down. 

Fore the biggest insult was the peitro fake out. Teasing a multibillion dollar movie tie in, only to half heatedly undo it felt like I was being robbed. 

You have exactly 1 mutant in the avangers. You are a company that just bought the x-men IP. You are between phases, having just completed a decade+ long plot arch. You have a show entirely about the one character that could bring it all together...and you just...pretend? It was infuriating. She was long considered the daughter of magneto for Christ sake. Imagine if Ian mckellen had walked in during end credits."
Kid Cosmic,"I can't imagine being so disappointed by a show, movie, or book that i would write so much about it."
Kid Cosmic,Some people take marvels too seriously
Kid Cosmic,Tldr

Kid Cosmic,"And this is why this place sucks for actual substantive conversation. If you're not sucking off Parks and Rec, Barry, Mr Robot, Brooklyn 99, Community or more lately Warrior then you might as well not expect any replies and even then it's just fucking memes and catchphrases. ""Streets ahead"", ""Britta'd it"", ""Cool cool ciool cool cool"", ""Noice"", ""It's Nikolaj"", ""I swear I'm saying it right, ""hello Friend"", etc. Come to an actual place to discuss a TV program, get told basically to shut up and go away with a meme. As if this comment is on topic or contributing anything to the actual discussion. Fucking ridiculous. 

Shit let's just post The Racial Draft of Charlie Murphy;s True Hollywood Stories for the milluionth time so everyone can just post ""UNIIITY"", ""Game, Blouses"" and all those lines that get posted in every thread on this site even in places that don't discuss TV like /r/worldnews

Heaven forfrend anyone post anything thought out and comprehensive to explain their views and in turn expect anything worth a fuck in response."

Kid Cosmic,">I also did not understand how her powers work. Or how she got so incredibly powerful just from Wandas magic.

they didn't explain it in detail, but they said that going in and out of the hex so much was altering her DNA."
Kid Cosmic,I suppose that could explain how but not why. Or why he was keeping his tracking a secret. In the end the fact he was tracking Vision was entirely pointless.
Kid Cosmic,"Amazing! I thought I was the only one. Welcome to the club, person of taste and culture."
Kid Cosmic,"Seriously! SWORD apparently started the week disassembling the most complicated piece of technology ever constructed, and had completely mastered that tech AND rebuilt him perfectly by the end of the week."
Kid Cosmic,"I don't blame them for not being able to wrangle Ian McKellen as well but I do blame them for wasting what they did have. Evan Peters was one of the best things about Fox's X-Men and to just utterly waste him like that? They've got the actor, they've got the rights, they'vs got a good justification for bringing him into the MCU permanently, and then they just discard all that. I can't imagine what they were thinking. If Feige cant place him just yet at least leave open the possibility of someone using him in a Phase 4 film."
Kid Cosmic,Someone TLDR this for me?
Kid Cosmic,They explained more than once I believe that the vibranium that makes up Vision is worth several billion dollars. Would you not want to know where several billion dollars worth of something was just kinda hanging out?
Kid Cosmic,Didn’t they have a throw away comment in a previous episode about having torn him down and rebuilt him five times?
Kid Cosmic,"Tdlr; unless your circle jerking a select few shows, your roof to fuck off for trying to have a real conversation.

It kinda devolves briefly into some tangent about Tv shows being discussed more on other subreddits but it circles back around to being angry at this sub for its lack of discussion.

I disagree hard with this, I think this whole OP post was baiting, so to respond with “this is a Wendy’s” is appropriate imo"
Kid Cosmic,That could be true. There were so many throwaway lines it's hard to keep track of them.
Kid Cosmic,Wandys*
The Unsettling,The title of my sex tape!
The Unsettling,"I enjoyed it.

Waltz is playing the kind of person that got him Oscars. That he outshines the rest of the cast is the biggest problem.

There’s a lot of loose strings too.

Still kept me guessing while binging."
The Unsettling,The “prime video” curse
The Unsettling,"I enjoyed the show, it was fun and had me guessing on all the weird stuff...but LITERALLY NOTHING IS EVER EXPLAINED.  The ending to the show SUCKED ASS."
The Unsettling,It was so weird I kept watching it but I agree ultimately it was just meh.
The Unsettling,Kinda weird review to lead with not having watched past episode 3.
The Unsettling,Could've *Consulted* someone on how to make a good show that's for sure 🥁💥
The Unsettling,"Did anyone read the book?  I really don't want a season 2, but is there more to the story?  I feel like they got everything wrong that Severance got right."
The Unsettling,"it's not gold but it has some meat on the bones

you should dip you toe into it"
The Unsettling,Fargo season 3 did it better.
The Unsettling,"Binged it. It's not bad, just expect a weird dark comedy. The worst thing about it is that it doesnt explain everything at the end, and there's way too many loose threads. They didn't own up to the mystery that was set up at the beginning, and that brings it down a major amount for me to the point that I wouldn't recommend it."
The Unsettling,"Watched it all this afternoon. It was ok.
But so many holes..inconsistency in the character development. The main 3 all changed so much without much reason.

Plus there was next to no resolution in the end other than the ""what he's made of"" bit. Also seemed like the consultant had done much worse stuff previously.. and towards the end outside of the what the show presented in general.

I mean its entertaining but some really poor execution in character building and the story itself overall"
The Unsettling,"(No spoilers) The final episode was poorly conceived.  Complete waste of time. Ranks with the original *Dexter* series finale for bad writing. 

Which is unfortunate, as *The Consultant* had some intriguing story twists before falling apart. Did the creatives have a good initial idea? Yeah. And that’s about all."
The Unsettling,"In hindsight I see a lot of similarity between The Consultant and The Menu. Both are set in a specialized workplace (high end restaurant vs video game company). Both are satirical dark comedy / horror. Both have a diabolical sadistic psychopath antagonist playing mind games with a captive audience, the diners in The Menu and the office staff in The Consultant. The antagonists both have an icy cold demeanor with a slight vaguely foreign accent to add to their detachment. I found The Menu to be much better done however, smarter and with better timing and some actual satirical dark humor that hit. And the fact that in The Menu there were paying diners as the hostages gave it a more relatable dimension on a human level."
The Unsettling,"Yea I finished this last night.  Each episode was generally entertaining and interesting, and Waltz is infinitely watchable, so I wouldn't call it bad, but I had a strong feeling the ending was going to be wildly unsatisfying and boy was I right on the money.  Such a stupid ending.  Not even bad, just...nothing.  No real answers.  No real horror.  Definitely a C- show at best."
The Unsettling,Feels a bit like they saw Severance in production and were like “hey we need one of those!”
The Unsettling,I know it’s based off a book or some other shit but when waltz can’t walk up stairs and then face fucks the ceo it just screamed of frank Reynolds getting real weird with it solely for the sake of getting weird with it. And for that reason I was out.
The Unsettling,"Really couldn't get into it, unfortunately.
Gave up after the first episode. It felt like a waste of talent and really no story to tell."
The Unsettling,One of my friends from college is one of the actors in this show! I haven’t had a chance to watch it yet but everything I’ve seen looks pretty cool
The Unsettling,I liked it a lot.
The Unsettling,"this show is like a car wreck, you see the first couple of episodes, then you decide that it's not that interesting and you should watch something else, but you have to look at the next episode to see whats happening."
The Unsettling,"The strangest thing about this show is that it is apparently a comedy, genuinely confused. There are zero laughs, just a creepy somewhat all over the place meh drama type thing? I could have accepted the fairly crap plot, acting etc if it at least had a good ending!"
The Unsettling,">  ...and Mostly Mediocre.”

So pretty much just like everything else Prime churns out."
The Unsettling,"I watched the first episode and kept thinking, ""doesn't this company have lawyers?  Isn't everything the consultant is doing is illegal under California law?"""
The Unsettling,"I watched it all today, but only because of Waltz. It wouldn't have made it past the first episode otherwise."
The Unsettling,"I absolutely loved it. It’s not so much a mystery as it is a story about a mysterious person, and the loose threads/remaining questions are supposed to be for you to answer for yourself, as with any good piece of literature. I can’t stop thinking about the big reveal and I’m planning to rewatch it soon so I can see how that reveal was hinted and teased earlier. 

If you want to see what he’s made of…"
The Unsettling,What hot garbage. I kept watching to see if it would get better but it never did. At least I now know that I don’t need to watch s2 if there is one.
The Unsettling,Everything on Prime is basically terrible. They're getting owned by HBO and Apple TV.
The Unsettling,But the writing is SO GOOD /s
The Unsettling,I lasted 15 minutes before nope-ing out.
The Unsettling,Paste magazine is overdone and dry.
The Unsettling,It’s pretty boring. Not worth watching.
The Unsettling,"Mostly mediocre sounds really appealing to me, what with everything going on in the world."
The Unsettling,"It started off great but got really weird in the 2nd half, lost interest at that point"
The Unsettling,Interesting to review after only watching the first two to three episodes.  I always figured reviewers actually watched all of what they reviewed so they actually knew what they were reviewing in totality…
The Unsettling,"I can see the pitch now ""Angel Heart but in Silicone Valley"" and not as good.

Got bored after a bit. So maybe it picked up?"
The Unsettling,Vastly mediocre
The Unsettling,">A responsible critic watches 2-3 episodes of a show before writing a review

Wait... what?

That's like saying ""a responsible critic watches 20-30 minutes of a movie before writing a review"""
The Unsettling,I mean I’d watch for Waltz alone. Dude is brilliant.
The Unsettling,Trash. Waste of time. Shit acting. Nepo baby lead. Bad writing. Insanely huge potential. Zero payoff. I won't be reading the book. Someone please give Christoph Waltz better things to do with his life. And me.
The Unsettling,"boring nonsense,  I think Waltz should just stick to acting and let others produce.

I want him on a tv show but not one this crap."
The Unsettling,Everybody is talking about gold skeletons…did I miss the part where they explained why sang got on his knees to survive patoff?
The Unsettling,"Not great, watched it all. I guess I'd probably watch Cristoph Waltz in anything then"
The Unsettling,Agreed!!
The Unsettling,Anyone notice the terrible edits between takes where Waltz’ face morphs?  Happens when he’s talking to Craig’s wife in the lobby by the door
The Unsettling,How is it being classified as a comedy? Its not even a dark comedy.
The Unsettling,I think you can sum up almost every Amazon original production as this lol
The Unsettling,Prime is pretty terrible at scripted television.
The Unsettling,"I really liked it and I actually understood the story, symbolism, allegories, etc. there were 0 loose ends at the end, you only think that if you didnt understand it 🤷‍♀️ it was really good and christoff absolutely killed it. i hope this means a career breakthrough for brittany ogrady also. she held her own next to waltz and is so gorgeous!! 

hated Craig tho"
The Unsettling,“Prime Video’s The Consultant Does Dallas”?
The Unsettling,This comment had more dramatic effect and comedic timing than in all 8 episodes of the show
The Unsettling,you had me at mediocre
The Unsettling,Little weird sounds about an alright name for a penis
The Unsettling,They come off as inexperienced child actors compared to him.
The Unsettling,"After first episode I was hooked. Waltz was brilliant in it and the story was very well done. Binged it in one day. ""thank you for the drink..... Craig"" the pauses and way he delivered his lines is just... Fantastic."
The Unsettling,I liked it too
The Unsettling,"Finished episode 3.  Fairly bland story and not sure I'll continue.

Anyone willing to convince me if it's worth the time?"
The Unsettling,"I have to admit Waltz is amazing, but I did just the first episode and I was bored to be honest. No one in the film is close to being a good actor as Waltz. The story is kind of lame too."
The Unsettling,"sigh....

wish you were wrong"
The Unsettling,"The endless kinda annoyed me, why did he have a gold skeleton inside him,"
The Unsettling,Yea it was a truly garbage ending
The Unsettling,"It was very disappointing. As you said, no answers to many of the questions. The show was very different from the book ending, as well. That may be part of the problem. The book ending was bad for other reasons.

I think the showrunners decided to leave us with all these questions to justify a season 2, which is lazy writing. I got halfway through and just wanted it to be over so there was some closure. I doubt I would watch season 2 if they renew it, but I also think it will get cancelled.

I got Lost or Twin Peaks vibes - the writers were more concerned with crazy twists and ideas and not concerned with payoff."
The Unsettling,He is a bloody >!robot!< 😄
The Unsettling,[removed]
The Unsettling,"So, it’s like Lost?"
The Unsettling,"I thought it looked eh, however, lol I seriously contemplated watching it strictly because of 
Waltz. I just don’t think I care enough to commit."
The Unsettling,The payoff at the end ended up not being worth it imo.
The Unsettling,"That's how most tv reviews are unfortunately, they review the pilot and score the whole season based on it."
The Unsettling,"The mad part is that the first three episodes are arguably the better ones; if they'd watched just one or two more, it's very unlikely that the review would have been as positive."
The Unsettling,lol this was exactly my thought. like someone watched Fargo season 3 and couldn't get enough Thewlis so they made a whole series around it
The Unsettling,Both of these things are explained though and not just 'weird for the sake of weird'.
The Unsettling,Yea. That was not needed as it really had no meaning. And any other time there was no vibe like that between him and that character.  Plus basically no resolution on what the consultant actually is.. to know if he just made them see that or not.
The Unsettling,I did that up to episode 6 before I gave up. Waltz is impressive but I just got tired of the acting/interaction of the two main office characters - Elaine/Craig. Maybe I'll go back to it but over it now.
The Unsettling,"I guess you mean ""any streaming service"" but you are right nonethless"
The Unsettling,The English is *really* good. Chaske Spencer nailed it.
The Unsettling,you forgot about the boys?
The Unsettling,"Seriously and they called it ""one of the most successful mobile games company in Los Angeles"" but no HR, lawyers, employment rights, and contract law?

In AppleTV Mythic Quest, a comedy show about another successful LA mobile games company:


- Antics? HR always involved in like every episode 

- Business stuff? Montreal/Ubisoft is calling every 2 minutes to yell. 

- Staff? Composed of CEO, VP, and a shit ton of directors, managers, and executives. Even when they're arguing with each other, projects have negotiations and hierarchy 

- Discrimination? Half the staff has a boner for labor laws, discrimination laws, contract and employment rights

Meanwhile in the consultant, just the first episode:

- Employee executive with his own office cries his eyes out after being informed he smells and is given a mop bucket to spongebathe himself in his office himself... a mop bucket previously used to clean  up human fluids in the previous scene. An employee of no importance or anything to the show. In Cali/USA, this dude would be winning super lawsuits

- Wheelchair black woman gets fired for being literally 1 second late after given 1 hour to arrive to work by the CEO or be fired. Disabled employees have protections against these types of abuse. Super lawsuit

- New CEO just takes over the company. No HR, no board of directors, no managers, shareholders. Nothing. Oh amd why the old ceo's mom can't take over? Reason: speaks no english. That's it. No hiring of a proxy or translator, no translating app, not even a single Korean in the company to help translate? Weakest excuse ever

- New 2 minute CEO just cancels all company projects without any plan, research, head company, or shareholders caring. It's a successful mobile game company, half of gamers would be incensed 

- How is main girl, the secretary, the highest ranked person to operate the company"
The Unsettling,Ha yeah I am a lawyer and I kept yelling at the tv “WHERE ARE THE LAWYERS!” Like everyone just listens to this guy and just accepts that he is in charge? What do the governing documents say?
The Unsettling,"Big reveal? Which is what exactly?

This show is written like a poor episode of Supernatural with Sam and Dean cut out of it.  Don’t get me wrong, love me some Supernatural, but there are no “big reveals” in that sort of story."
The Unsettling,HBO and Apple don’t get me my packages here in a day though
The Unsettling,100% agreed.
The Unsettling,"Lemme guess, the face fucking was too much?"
The Unsettling,"usually there's some sort of text in a review that says ""four episodes watched for review"" or something like that."
The Unsettling,You're not nearly as smart as you're pretending to be.
The Unsettling,Hijacking to say this post is full of spoilers.
The Unsettling,"I'm going to agree that the main characters around him were not at the same level as he was.

But really loved the show. Had a Cronenberg vibe to it."
The Unsettling,"I must admit, I'm only like 4 episodes in.

Waltz is amazing, the other actors aren't terrible, but nothing to write home about either.

The screen writing and dialog isn't that bad either.

But the plot is god awful. The premiss is intriguing, the mysteries are compelling, but i just couldn't get past the fact that the two protagonists don't act like real people. They behave exactly how they have to behave to make the plot move the way the writer wanted it to. Chopping and changing just to make the story."
The Unsettling,"I don't know about that.  I haven't finished watching it yet but I've liked Brittany O'Grady's acting so far.  Maybe not on par with Waltz, but that's not a fair comparison if you think about it.  These are younger actors at the beginning of their careers being compared to a popular Academy Award winner."
The Unsettling,if you finished the show and understood the deeper meaning... i think thats kind of the point
The Unsettling,I could have done without the “Craig” character or the actor playing him. But watching Christoph Waltz do his thing made the show worth watching.
The Unsettling,This annoyed me the most. What was the point of the gold bones?
The Unsettling,Maybe the it’s trying to insinuate the replacement of the human workforce by robots?  Just a wild guess.
The Unsettling,how did you guys not understand the golden skeleton...
The Unsettling,">cancelled

Yes! Payoff was missing. I agree."
The Unsettling,[removed]
The Unsettling,"Blame the distributors for not making more episodes available to critics for review. The most famous case of this is Bojack Horseman. Netflix sent out the first six episodes before the show aired and those are pretty meh episodes. It took a BIG creative leap in the second half of the season. There were critics who when the show came out kept watching and said as much. But if Netflix had supplied them with those eps to begin with, the reviews would have been a lot better."
The Unsettling,"I don't think that's unfortunate at all. In this time of TV abundance, if a show hasn't grabbed me by episode 3, I'm out. There are way too many good stuff out there to watch.

Gone are the days where you had to wait until season 3 of TNG to see it achieve brilliance."
The Unsettling,True
The Unsettling,"Netflix churns out a lot of good content, even if it is just by law of averages."
The Unsettling,That was a BBC show…
Zac and Mia,You can see her just dying inside behind the fake tv smile.
Zac and Mia,Of course the Ellen audience would clap on 1 and 3.
Zac and Mia,WHY DO AUDIENCES HAVE TO CLAP LIKE THAT AUUUGGHHHH
Zac and Mia,"Wait i'm stupid and confused. Can someone explain,  is she(Ellen) in on it or are they playing her like a fool?"
Zac and Mia,Yeah y'all really looked into a scripted segment too much.
Zac and Mia,"Ok, but can we talk about how fucking good Zac and Taylor sound singing together? Spot on harmony and their tones blend so damn well."
Zac and Mia,[deleted]
Zac and Mia,That audience need to learn how to clap on 2 and 4
Zac and Mia,"Damn man, they've got some ice in their veins to sing that straight to her face like that. Much respect."
Zac and Mia,"I think you’re reading a lot into this OP.

Pretty cool how immediately encouraging Taylor Swift is though when the dude plays his first chord. There is a genuine love of sharing music there."
Zac and Mia,"Look at Taylor Swift hating Ellen!

(In one of her many ongoing friendly appearances on her show.)

Y’all really need to get a grip."
Zac and Mia,Huh?
Zac and Mia,"Yeah, no; there's way too much being read into this."
Zac and Mia,"Not even low-key, Zac Efron is my man crush. The guy absolutely kills it and just seems so charismatic. I'm going to watch high school musical just because of him."
Zac and Mia,Watch Ellen’s hands as she grips the chair
Zac and Mia,Reddit loves celeb gossip now.
Zac and Mia,"Do people just upvote this harmless song because they hate Ellen? I don't think this was really meant to be a ""fuck Ellen"" type of song. T Swift had been on Ellen 8 times at this point. If it was so bad and she didn't like her, why would she be on there?"
Zac and Mia,There's literally no call out in this.
Zac and Mia,May favorite part is where they almost hand Taylor the crappy guitar. Like please if there is a 4000 dollar guitar it belongs to Ms Swift.
Zac and Mia,Zac Efron can get it.
Zac and Mia,"Taylor is so good,oh man."
Zac and Mia,I’m going to admit what I never thought I’d admit. As someone not from the high school musical generation I never got the interest in this guy back in the day but over the last couple of years I have really come to appreciate how talented and charismatic Zac is. I watched Greatest Showman for the first time recently and thought he was great.
Zac and Mia,"I think it's surprising that people are so shocked at the revelations about her.

I remember back when she had her last sitcom a couple staff came out about her behavior and instead of an investigation being done, they were shamed and called bigots."
Zac and Mia,TAKE YOUR GOD DAMN FEET OFF THE SOFA...you aren’t Rick James
Zac and Mia,"Just my opinion that doesn't seem to have been voiced, but Zac and Taylor playing the guitar was clearly part of Ellen's plan, but I can entirely believe the improv was off the cuff. These are two talented musicians already playing quite basic chords of a well known song, so riffing some words on top isn't unbelievable.

You have to remember this was 8 years ago when Ellen was still seen as top tier, and so being called or having her show being called weird just isn't negative press. No one was really reading between the lines that it mattered, and for Ellen, posting it or putting out on air just meant more viewership for her channel over a diss track that most people (at the time) would just think was endearing."
Zac and Mia,What's with the oxygen bottle
Zac and Mia,"Every time I see a Taylor Swift clip I just come away loving her and not caring about the context. She's got talent, a sense of humor, enthusiasm even when she's at the tail end of like a 14 hour day press and meet and greets. And when she shows up at a hospital and with zero apprehension just lights up the lives of kids with serious illnesses, including horrific burns, I mean she's just a force of nature.

The ""I could have died"" line was very funny and btw, Ellen's obsession with scaring people is just part of her warped personality. She's never self-effacing, she's just mean."
Zac and Mia,Man Taylor is just incredibly talented
Zac and Mia,Ellen definitely punched an intern after this segment
Zac and Mia,"I’ve never liked Ellen, so when this business about her being a nasty person broke loose, I was real eager to see some real evidence come to light. Thus far I haven’t seen shit. This here? Give me a break, it’s sarcasm. People are reading way too much into the flimsiest of shit. ‘Omg look at her eyes, no life in them.’ ‘Omg you can tell she is literally dying inside, fake smile is fake.’ ‘Omg even her guests hate her!’ Feel like I’m watching a group of 12 year olds trying to get their teacher expelled from high school because they were bored and decided she’s just no good."
Zac and Mia,As a straight man: Stupid Hot Taylor and Sexy Zac
Zac and Mia,I dont really see what you are talking about tbh
Zac and Mia,This is great. They had to have gotten together for at least one rehearsal.
Zac and Mia,WHY IS THE AUDIENCE CLAPPING ON 1 AND 3
Zac and Mia,"unrelated, but why is there a cylinder of oxygen next to ellen’s chair?"
Zac and Mia,"This is god level at throwing a shade by them! I mean WOW! 

""Every time I come on this show, it's really weird"" 

Perfect!"
Zac and Mia,Boy.... Zack Efron.... I'm not gay but.... Damn..... He's the total package
Zac and Mia,"I was definitely not about to watch a Zach and Taylor video but god damn am I glad I did. They're so talented, I never knew that Zach could sing. 

The lyrics and everything were on point, so well done,."
Zac and Mia,If America ever goes into another world war the only they need to do to get their troops over the top in a war frenzy is produce two guitars apparently
Zac and Mia,She smiles but she's dead inside. Audience clapping at her expense for a change
Zac and Mia,Wtf people be clapping on 1 and 3 like maniacs ugh. Where’s connick jr when you need him
Zac and Mia,Ellen is Madelyn Stilwell irl
Zac and Mia,"When she stands, and they’re like .. er no."
Zac and Mia,"Okay, I'm out of the loop. What's the controversy with Ellen?"
Zac and Mia,"For a website that loves to call out scripted stuff, this comment section is surprisingly dense."
Zac and Mia,So now I'm gay for Zac. Fucken thanks for that. :/
Zac and Mia,Ellen is so aggressively passive aggressive. She's never seemed genuine.
Zac and Mia,"Define ""Disarming Smile""

>If someone or something is disarming, they make you feel less angry or hostile.

So, she asks you a line of questions that paints you into a corner but, for some reason, you're not mad at her."
Zac and Mia,2&4! Not 1&3!!
Zac and Mia,What song is this based off ?
Zac and Mia,"""Call out"""
Zac and Mia,she probably fired someone 7 seconds later.
Zac and Mia,Damn if this is scripted.. Ellen is really good at looking genuinely nervous/uncomfortable. Just look at her crushing the arm rest with her hand
Zac and Mia,This is why I love internet I missed this I saw this and thought it was amusing but I had no idea why until I watch this now.
Zac and Mia,This is not what the title says
Zac and Mia,She probably went and yelled at some interns after this
Zac and Mia,"Lmao.  Taylor hates her so much, that was her 8TH time on the show."
Zac and Mia,"Love how when they start, you can see her clutching the arm rest of her chair like ""whhhhhaaaaat the fuck is happening.... oh god... what do I do?"""
Zac and Mia,"Reddit help me out, when I click video links in the Reddit app my iPhone opens safari and then YouTube in safari and the original video doesn’t open.  Wtf is going on?

Also, Ellen sucks and why the hell is she not cancelled for her behavior when anyone else would be?"
Zac and Mia,She looks like she wants to choke them.
Zac and Mia,Damn that was awkward.
Zac and Mia,"Except the guitars were on standby, the picks were already on the table, and the song was 100% scripted by her own team."
Zac and Mia,Taylor Swift has the weirdest posture
Zac and Mia,Watch her hands clench the arms of her chair.  My gal has some control issues.
Zac and Mia,"Wow they really owned her spontaneously on the spot and it wasnt a talk show bit, that's why they had guitars given to them just for no reason. Ellen really was shocked by that, it wasn't pre planned."
Zac and Mia,This feels like a stretch..
Zac and Mia,All I'm saying is this was a perfect way for them to slap her in the face in a fun way that Ellen of course couldn't get enraged by because 1 TV armad 2 she knew this was gonna get watches and clicks.
Zac and Mia,Look how she grips the chair and looks dumbfounded when they switch up the lyrics. I'm not sure they ran this by the crew.
Zac and Mia,Why did they return to the show after that? weird
Zac and Mia,I can't believe Ellen still has a show & celebs still support her....
Zac and Mia,There’a this 1 frame clip at 3:19 where you can see Ellen’s TV face turn into her demon face and it’s really creepy. If I scroll slowly back and forth between the frames it gives me the shivers.
Zac and Mia,Seems like you guys are reaching
Zac and Mia,"Based on her face and reaction, she is pissed - and thing is, Taylor swift on your show means it's not getting buried somewhere.

Honestly pretty great."
Zac and Mia,Ugh.Plastic people.Celebrity worship is trash.
Zac and Mia,"Why do people expect superstars to be super nice? That is such an  unrealistic expectation. Some are actually really nice people, but those are the exceptions. For most they don't have to be nice all the time, as their money, fame and power carries them through anyways. So I see the people being really disappointed in Ellen as rather naïve people."
Zac and Mia,"I see people on reddit are still holding grudges for the sake of karma. This is like that circle jerk post people make saying ""Just a friendly reminder that [celebrity name] is an asshole."""
Zac and Mia,"So I'm not 100% caught up with the hostile work thing. Was it her (Ellen's) employees making it miserable there, or Ellen herself?"
Zac and Mia,He sounded better than her... and I didn’t even know he sang .
Zac and Mia,3 interns were throttled to death seconds after commercial break and buried in the Mojave
Zac and Mia,She deserves it.
Zac and Mia,Just realised Taylor Swift moves like a Marionette when she's not holding a guitar
Zac and Mia,This shit passes as “intelligent” call-out to you mouth breathers?
Zac and Mia,"Yet again,people on social media are nuts.

Regardless of Ellen not treating her workers good enough or not,this is a conspiracy theory."
Zac and Mia,Came here to say this belongs on r/WatchPeopleDieInside
Zac and Mia,Ellen is 62 years old.  It's not like her show was going to go on forever.
Zac and Mia,Holy shit
Zac and Mia,She looks so uncomfortable lmao
Zac and Mia,"Damn, you can definitely see it in her eyes."
Zac and Mia,That's awesome they made up new words to that Weird Al song.
Zac and Mia,Damn she almost set those two on fire with here eyes
Zac and Mia,Clapping on 1 and 3. Audience is entirely white.
Zac and Mia,Ellen is the female Tom Cruise...with no stunts.
Zac and Mia,"I don’t watch Ellen. Never seen an episode. Never will. Besides what these two said, what else makes her/her show weird or unwatchable?"
Zac and Mia,I just threw up in my mouth
Zac and Mia,"This makes me so embarrassed, I almost can't listen to it! Yikes. You can tell it's too true lol"
Zac and Mia,Fuck me those kids got some huge balls calling her out!
Zac and Mia,"Let’s be honest. She has all the ingredients to have a great show. She has an amazing personality, funny, great host ( when she’s not an asshole). But she’s basically someone who almost, almost, had it. But decided to self sabotage her self. Because self doubt, or imposter syndrome, or excessive self confidence, whatever. Is frustrating she just fuck it all up."
Zac and Mia,Just when I thought Reddit had hopped off Ellen’s nuts. You people need to find something better to do.
Zac and Mia,This was so iconic when it came out
Zac and Mia,"*zach strums the guitar once and the crowd loses their fucking minds*

And this is why I find these shows fucking pathetic. Why does everyone have to be screaming all the time? It’s obnoxious as hell. Bunch of losers. Oh and fuck Ellen. Stupid fucking cunt"
My Dead Ex,She already went through a lot damn it man
My Dead Ex,"Christina Applegate seems like a legit nice lady and she's always fun to see on screen, it really is a bitch that some people get more than their share of shittiness like that."
My Dead Ex,"Applegate:

>”There was the sense of, ‘Well, let’s get her some medicine so she can get better. And there is no better. But it was good for me. I needed to process my loss of my life, my loss of that part of me. So I needed that time.”

>”The powers that be were like, ‘Let’s just stop. We don’t need to finish it. Let’s put a few episodes together.’ I said, ‘No. We’re going to do it, but we’re going to do it on my terms.'”

>Applegate also said that she had put on 40 pounds and “can’t walk without a cane” but hopes people are able to overlook her physical appearance.

>“If people hate it, if people love it, if all they can concentrate on is, ‘Ooh, look at the cripple,’ that’s not up to me. I’m sure that people are going to be, like, ‘I can’t get past it. Fine, don’t get past it, then. But hopefully, people can get past it and just enjoy the ride and say goodbye to these two girls.”

The final season of Dead to Me releases Nov. 17th."
My Dead Ex,This is heartbreaking I feel for her so much. She struggled with breast cancer and now this it's horrible. She is an amazing actress and made this show so great. I hope she will be able to continue to do what she loves. The show is very enjoyable and I am glad she was able to finish it! I commend her that could not have been easy at all.
My Dead Ex,"I had no idea about this. Absolutely awful for her, but very selfishly I’m glad we are getting another season of this great show. Jen and Judy’s friendship is one of the most well written and believable on television"
My Dead Ex,So sad to hear about the diagnosis. I loved her in Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead as a kid.
My Dead Ex,"Some of those quotes are devastating. Dead to Me is an incredible show, probably the most impressive mix of comedy and tragedy that I’ve seen and Christina and Linda are both so good in it. It’s going to be sad seeing it end along with knowing that this is probably the last big project Christina Applegate will be able to do."
My Dead Ex,"This makes me not feel good :( I hope things get better for her. I know there’s no cure for her condition, but she’s such a wonderful spirit, just sucks."
My Dead Ex,"Christina Applegate is an actress who should have had a much better career than she had.  Don’t get me wrong, she’s had a great career but she should be part of Hollywood’s A-list elite rather then on the periphery of it.

I think her career has been subject to some unfortunate timing and creative descissions when they have tried to give her her own vehicle.  But still, even in bad projects she’s been involved with, she is the highlight and shines.

Wish her the best."
My Dead Ex,Let's give a quick shout-out to Christina Applegate
My Dead Ex,"Nobody says FUCK like her. 

She to me (being the same age) has always be gorgeous and funny. 

She is so underrated, she held her own in Anchorman, look at that cast. 

Few celebrities I feel bad for, for her, she has my total sympathy"
My Dead Ex,Aw man. Selma Blair and now Christina Applegate?
My Dead Ex,"Let's give a quick Shout out to Christina Applegate for her commitment! *YES*

But seriously bringing people joy and laugh could be a great way to lift up the mood and motivated her to fight for cancer.  Hope she's doing well."
My Dead Ex,This is so sad.  I had no idea.  I'm really looking forward to the third season of 'Dead to Me' but I suppose it will be bittersweet.

My Dead Ex,I’ve come to the conclusion that Christina Applegate is a fucking gangsta.
My Dead Ex,"Fuck, she's been through a lot already, and now this?"
My Dead Ex,This is really depressing news. I have a friend with MS and it’s no joke.
My Dead Ex,"This is heartbreaking news! I absolutely love her in everything I’ve seen her in. Definitely an underrated actress, so smart & talented. One of my fav movies is the Sweetest Thing and Cameron Diaz is the big name in that movie but Christina steals the movie for me, the dressing room montage with the pretty woman scene-the best!"
My Dead Ex,"currently re-watching Samantha Who? on Hulu & it’s amazing✨ if anyone is wanting some more Christina Applegate in their daily lives, highly recommend!"
My Dead Ex,Wishing her nothing but the best.
My Dead Ex,After everything she has MS? That is bullshit. I have family with MS and it can be terrible. And she's finishing this fantastic series on top of that? Damn I respect her even more. I hope for the best for her.
My Dead Ex,"Wow.  I haven't watched this show, but her commitment to it definitely makes me want to."
My Dead Ex,Why did they hide it? Could they have written it in to the character?
My Dead Ex,"She’s so ridiculously talented, intelligent, graceful, beautiful… the list goes on, and life doesn’t give a fuck about any of that. The only choice to what life dishes out, is to continue it with dignity and on our terms. She’s a Fucking Queen."
My Dead Ex,"Oh man!  She is a cancer survivor and now she has MS.

Hang in there Christina, hopefully they can manage your symptoms enough for you to continue working."
My Dead Ex,Good for her. Do it your way!
My Dead Ex,"Glad to see that she’s staying positive, she’s had some tough challenges."
My Dead Ex,Does the universe have it out for her? Wtf.
My Dead Ex,Let's hear it for Christina Applegate
My Dead Ex,The only one I really liked off of Married.  Although I liked the parents better on other shows later on.
My Dead Ex,im glad she is doing this. giving her audience closure. and also ms is a difficult and expensive disease. we know enough about us health care so extra money will be helpful in her condition. not that she would need it.
My Dead Ex,"For whatever reason, I feel connected to her, and empathize with her situation. 

Feel like she simultaneously got dealt a great hand and a shit hand. 

Aces and Eights."
My Dead Ex,"I would have understood if they didn’t film season 3 but after the cliffhanger from season 2, I’m so glad they did. Christina Applegate is amazing"
My Dead Ex,Damn. She is a real one👏
My Dead Ex,"A true professional. 

A shining light from her industry."
My Dead Ex,Let's give her a quick shoutout
My Dead Ex,"Nothing but pure respect for Christina. I'm so eager for S3, I know she's said she probably won't watch and worries over how the fans will perceive the changes her body has gone through due to MS, but I believe the fans will rally and give her nothing but love and support."
My Dead Ex,Just dropping in to say that Christina Applegate is one of my favorite people in Hollywood.  I wish her nothing but the best.
My Dead Ex,What a bad ass. It sucks to see good people get dealt a shit hand.
My Dead Ex,I love Tits mcGee
My Dead Ex,"She has MS? Oh, no!"
My Dead Ex,"She is such a gem, I love forward to seeing this cane and all!"
My Dead Ex,I’m really sorry to hear about this. Wishing her all the best.
My Dead Ex,Had no idea she had MS.  She’s amazing.
My Dead Ex,After reading all the great reviews about the show I can’t wait to watch the show. It sounds like she has a real approach to life and that’s so refreshing. Big respect ❤️
My Dead Ex,Dead to me first season was fantastic. I need to catch up. Hope her the best 🙏🙏
My Dead Ex,"As long as she doesn't turn out to be the third twin of her dead husband, I can accept everything."
My Dead Ex,this is the first I've heard of this diagnosis. poor woman that sucks.
My Dead Ex,Really happy that they finished the show.
My Dead Ex,Hey let's give a quick shoutout to Christina Applegate!
My Dead Ex,She has been acting my whole life. I hope she finishes well and takes a well deserved rest.
My Dead Ex,"I’m glad she can live off residuals and investments enjoy her life before she get too sick. She made it. We talk about her, it’s done. Famous, wealthy  and good at her job. Take a break. I’m nobody."
My Dead Ex,MS is pretty hardcore.
My Dead Ex,"Wait..I thought the show got cancelled?

Edit: why am I getting downvoted? I was deeply disappointed when I heard it was cancelled. I didn’t know they were finishing up one more season"
My Dead Ex,40 pounds? Try 60 (me) 😁
My Dead Ex,"I’m not really ‘celeb crazy’ but I’ve always enjoyed Christina Applegate and followed her career. Really hate hearing this, to be honest. Sucks that bad things happen to good people."
My Dead Ex,Man that's a such a shame she was diagnosed with MS. I've been a fan of her work since she was on Married With Children.
My Dead Ex,I had no idea she had MS as well.  That’s crazy that her and Selma Blair have it.
My Dead Ex,[deleted]
My Dead Ex,I wonder if she had mono when she was younger
My Dead Ex,Dead to me. Everyone cries. 10x per episode minimum. Stopped watching that show.
My Dead Ex,"Wait, is Christina Applegate alive? Or am I thinking of Brittany Murphey"
My Dead Ex,As long as it doesn't have the other girl randomly crying throughout the season. It seemed like overacting.
My Dead Ex,"By all accounts, one of the nicest ones in the industry... nobody deserves what she's dealt with but certainly not her."
My Dead Ex,"I have a friend who had MS and went for controversial surgery in Mexico, where they used her own stem cells to replace her bone marrow. I was super dubious  but it actually worked for her. I was happy to be wrong."
My Dead Ex,"What had happened to her? I'm sorry I'm a bit outta the loop

Edit: I just saw another comment mention had a fight with breast cancer. Man that sucks"
My Dead Ex,No kidding. She seems like one of the good ones. I feel horrible for her.
My Dead Ex,MS is a terrible and frightening diagnosis.
My Dead Ex,"I really didn’t like Dead to Me (mostly because I saw every twist coming a mile away and it just felt goofy), but I LOVED Applegate in it. She’s so good at playing bitchy- I love her appearances on Friends as Rachel’s selfish horrible sister haha."
My Dead Ex,"Honestly, she doesn’t seem that nice to me. Just real as fuck and above the bullshit. I respect her a lot - that’s better to me than being nice (which I mostly interpret as fake these days). She actually seems super antisocial in the interviews I’ve heard from her. Love her for entertaining me on TV my whole life."
My Dead Ex,How can you not love that woman.
My Dead Ex,[deleted]
My Dead Ex,[deleted]
My Dead Ex,Wow.
My Dead Ex,Think this is probably a huge reason why the upcoming Married With Children revival is going to be animated instead
My Dead Ex,Ms diagnosis feels like something erasing who you are or were. It doesn't happen gradually either. Flares spike you and it's the inflammation that causes the damage. Took me a year and a half to even feel a tad normal again which was just a small vacation of relief followed by always feeling like being hung over. Even cognitive thought was taxing.....I hate ms
My Dead Ex,"She was secretly the star of Married with Children. Nailed every line, made every motion funny, extreme talent on display."
My Dead Ex,"I'm right on top of that, Rose!"
My Dead Ex,One of my favorite movies
My Dead Ex,"I think part of her career trajectory can, for better or worse, be tied to how well she played Kelly Bundy. Another classic case of being so iconic and great in a role that people were reluctant to see her as anything other than the dumb, slutty girl."
My Dead Ex,She really held her own in Anchorman and I don’t believe her role is talked about enough with all the other hilarious performances.
My Dead Ex,"I think Kelly Bundy overshadowed the real Christina, and it hurt her- I don't think she was taken seriously for a while after ""Married With Children"" ended.  The fact that she's got some real comedic chops was a revelation to a lot of people (myself included).

Add on to that the loss of her mother to breast cancer, then her battle with it, I think she was out of the game for a while.

It's too bad- she's a very funny, charming and likeable actress."
My Dead Ex,She comes from that era where there were television actors and there were movie actors. It was hard to crossover from TV to mainstream film regardless of talent. Consider Bryan Cranston who had to play one of the greatest TV characters of all time before he started getting decent Hollywood roles. Even after playing Hal he was stuck doing some AMC drama playing a school teacher before his momentum built in movies.
My Dead Ex,"""It's like, 90 degrees...""  
  
*vomits* ""Lauren, what's going on with you?"""
My Dead Ex,"“Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility? Your immaturity? Your total disregard for other people’s feelings?!?!?!”

“Uhhh, to name a few!”

I love her as Amy Green in Friends."
My Dead Ex,This is what i came for
My Dead Ex,Jamie-Lynn Sigler as well :(
My Dead Ex,Which is so crazy - they were both in The Sweetest Thing with Cameron Diaz. What are the odds?
My Dead Ex,Oh yea. I love how he can seemingly just pop up on a show and play a part within his range with the disease and it's great. I can see her being able to do that as well.
My Dead Ex,"I'm out of the loop, prior to MS what had happened?"
My Dead Ex,Love The Sweetest Thing! So funny. Doesn’t Selma Blair also have MS?
My Dead Ex,That is such an underrated show.
My Dead Ex,My guess is she will be doing a lot of sitting or maybe leaning on things
My Dead Ex,She's a SAG union member so she has life time healthcare.
My Dead Ex,"Doesn't matter she most likely has ppms which is the kind
that has no treatment...money can't buy you a cure if it
does not exist."
My Dead Ex,"She FINALLY, after all these years, had a hit t.v. show that was getting her raves. I'm glad she got to finish it out on her terms."
My Dead Ex,Tits McGee has the night off.
My Dead Ex,It was but they had one more season scheduled.
My Dead Ex,"Yeah, she's talking about a horrible illness. This is a time you should keep it in your pants and be a regular decent human being."
Love Daily,"If he gets the gig, there should be a regular segment where he and Ronnie Chieng trash talk each other as they did in an episode."
Love Daily,"I actually watched the Daily Show again due to his hosting. He really brought a big jump in energy that I really liked, not that Trevor wasn't good, but this was refreshing."
Love Daily,Patriot Act being canceled by Netflix made me sad. I think Hassan Minaj is a great comedian and an equally great TV host.
Love Daily,"I think he talks over people too much, but that's definitely something he could work on by hosting more."
Love Daily,Hassan or Sarah Silverman they are born naturals
Love Daily,"The Patriot Act was the best TDS spinoff after The Colbert Report and Last Week Tonight. It ended way too soon.

I didn't watch his week of hosting TDS but I know he deserves it just from how great he was on TPA.

Netflix is weird with their weekly comedy. Joel McHale was amazing on The Soup. I was so excited for his Netflix version. Then that was cancelled after a season (maybe two?). Hassan and Joel deserved more."
Love Daily,Him and Ronny Chieng ripping on each other was the best daily show segment I’ve seen in a long time.
Love Daily,"I really want to like him, but his vibe is like when you’re in a convo with someone who’s on cocaine— his enthusiasm, whether contrived or real, sucks the funny out of the room for me. He’s got smart funny material but he just has this coked-up used car salesman energy in his delivery that actually hurts the material he’s delivering"
Love Daily,Personally I want Roy Wood Jr
Love Daily,I liked Wayans the best so far.
Love Daily,I could go for him or Sarah Silverman. Thought they both did great.
Love Daily,"He's been my favorite so far. Silverman and Handler did well too, but they came off as kind of the smuggy elite while Hasan plays more to a general audience."
Love Daily,I wanna se Levar Burton take a swing at it.
Love Daily,"There's something about him I just don't like, and I agree with almost every he says."
Love Daily,Something about Minaj's act and style just always seems to polished and forced.  Like he has focus group tested each joke and bit.  That much polish seems to just kill some of the humor for me.
Love Daily,"Honestly confused why Netflix got rid of Patriot Act. It was a solid alternative to the Daily Show for people who don't have cable. The Problem with Jon Stewart is literally just the same concept. That's not coincidence, it's a great format."
Love Daily,"After seeing him behave obnoxiously on Celebrity Jeopardy, I never want to see him do anything again. He was disgusting and disruptive."
Love Daily,Agreed. I love Hasan in anything and this would do him and the audience some good
Love Daily,I'd rather have Roy Wood Jr.
Love Daily,"He really knocked it out.  
Was pleasantly surprised with Chelsea and Sarah as well too"
Love Daily,I thought Chelsea Handler felt really natural as well.
Love Daily,Hard disagree. Sam Bee should get the fucking crown she deserved to get when Jon left. The Daily Show would've stayed relevant if she had gotten the hosting gig instead of Trevor.
Love Daily,He’s ok in small doses.
Love Daily,"Strong disagree, his personality is toxic. He talks over other people and delivered his lines akwarkdly. Sarah Silverman rocked and so did Wanda Skykes"
Love Daily,"I watched some of the clips that were put up on YouTube and he was really good. I didn't like the kid's segment were he talked about taxes without explaining what the money was being spent on, how purchasing power has changed and that taxes aren't a flat rate."
Love Daily,Thank you! He was way better than Trevor. I felt a little of the memory of Jon in that chair. It has to be Hasan.
Love Daily,As long as they don’t let him back on Jeopardy lol
Love Daily,I 100% agree! I hadn't watched the show in years and when I heard he was hosting I turned it in on YouTube and he was fantastic!
Love Daily,He’s been the best so far. I think he’d be the best option if he even wanted the gig.
Love Daily,His delivery and style are too bland
Love Daily,I disagree. I wasn’t a fan of his stint (and I didn’t mind Patriot Act).
Love Daily,"So far he has definitely been the most natural host. He just does it well. His interview with Kevin O'Leary was really good stuff. My only criticism would be that sometimes he has TikTok teen energy.

I think TDS is kind of angling for him too, just based on the promotion and extra content they produced for his week that they didn't do for the other hosts."
Love Daily,"I liked him a lot. I still don’t think he’s quite as funny as Jon Stewart was (I don’t think current Jon Stewart is as funny as he used to be), but he is passionate about holding people accountable. There is a lot of crazy shit going on in the world right now, from the media to scammers on social media, and I think Hasan is the right guy to hold them to the fire."
Love Daily,"It was good, but it felt more like Patriot Act than Daily Show. More smart young dude-lecturing / monologue rather than a series of fake correspondents covering news and interacting with a fake news host."
Love Daily,"Honestly can’t stand him, feels like he comes off pretentious and uninformed. Patriot act would just straight up have false facts he would work from"
Love Daily,"It should be Hasan's.

His White House Correspondent's Dinner set was amazing.  And that is the hardest gig a comedian can face.  He did as well as Conan or Norm there.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7oG74nHSTQ"
Love Daily,"I don't watch The Daily Show or know who Hassan Minaj is. Is he a good comedian? I just watched his most popular gig on Youtube (White People at Indian Weddings - 4.7 million views) and the crowd was basically dead silent. A lot of the jokes were stale. Can't blame the crowd or Hassan really, but there was a lot of disconnect there."
Love Daily,"That's awesome. Hasan may actually get me to watch TDS after like a decade.

edit: nevermind, misread the headline. Hope he gets the gig though."
Love Daily,"Patriot Act was outstanding. I liked him on Daily Show but it would be interesting to see how he performs when he grooves in, because I think he was FAR better in Patriot Act. But give him the chance and it could be something very special."
Love Daily,I haven't watched any of the guest hosts except Hasan and I've been watching The Daily Show for at least 4 years. I would watch the show again if it was him.
Love Daily,"Comedy lost when the Patriot Act ended far too soon.

Thought Hasan was great. At the very least, it's an excellent audition for him to have his own show down the road. Outstanding work."
Love Daily,1000%.  He was a perfect fit.  Hope it pans out this way.
Love Daily,Would be perfect since that's where he got his start
Love Daily,I guess it depends on the audience they are trying to attract. He really only appeals to left wing audience. If that’s the goal then he’s a good pick. If they want to appeal to outside of that like John Stewart did then he’s not a good pick at all.
Love Daily,"Trigger alert: Sarah Silverman is better. 

Hasan moves too much. His schtick works well with stand up and field work. On the desk not so much. I do appreciate his work calling out Kevin O’Leary though that was noice. 

For me Sarah’s style fits better. She has a good amount of energy with delivery with a smartass smirk."
Love Daily,Sarah Silverman
Love Daily, I think he’s an outstandingly unfunny philistine lol. So perfect replacement for the last guy.
Love Daily,The search should be over. He was better than Trevor Noah ever was in my opinion
Love Daily,"I’ll agree he did a good job, but I think Leslie Jones has been the best so far. There’s just something about her energy that I think would be a big boost to the show, and I used to watch Trevor all the time."
Love Daily,"If they don’t put him permanently on TDS, they should at least renew Patriot Act. I was really disappointed when they canned it."
Love Daily,"I like him better than Trevor Noah a lot. Noah for some reason comes across as a bit haughty/arrogant regularly, but I can't quite put my finger on it.   


Minaj seems more personally vested with more ""this is really important and crazy shit people need to realize is happening around us"" and less ""look at how stupid I can make \_\_\_\_ issue sound like"" takes"
Love Daily,"He seriously does. Once John left, I have it a shot for a while. It was tepid, and meh. I tuned back in for Hassan's appearance... was blown away. FIRST thought I had was that he needs to be the permanent host of that show. The energy, the timing! He's a blast.

Made me look up his White House correspondence speeches again."
Love Daily,I agree 100%. I hope that move is at least being considered (by both parties)
Love Daily,He can talk about culture war BS and sneakers but out of his depth in politics. Plus his energy is annoying and he needs everything written out for him. He’s boring off the cuff. That’s ok though cuz the Daily Show is irrelevant anyways
Love Daily,"Totally agreed. 

Also, and no offense meant to Trevor Noah, it'll be nice to have an American back at the helm. Noah always seemed to just not quite grasp some of the issues facing our nation, and Minaj absolutely gets it. Like, Noah had this ""haha, Americans"" sensibility, whereas Minaj is rightly appalled by his fellow countrymen. It's much less of a ""haha they're dumb"" and much more of a ""you guys we are so screwed."" Feels more like he's in it with us, as opposed to just nearby."
Love Daily,"I've been watching all of the guest hosts, and I strongly agree. Hassan Minaj's episodes had the same feel as peak Jon Stewart era Daily Show eps."
Love Daily,Patriot Act was still even better
Love Daily,Patriot Act was one of the very very very few Netflix originals I have enjoyed and ju--oh yup it's canceled immediately as with everything that people say is good lmao
Love Daily,He got people talking and watching the show/clips again. None of the other hosts registered with the public in the same way.
Love Daily,Agreed
Love Daily,He’s so good.
Love Daily,"I agree I hope they decide to give it to him..I saw one clip and instantly thought he is perfect for this, dare I say even a better fit than Trevor. Got John vibes indeed!"
Love Daily,"A lot of great hosts. Leslie Jones I thought crushed it. She was so funny and alive and entertaining and I was laughing the whole time. She had such a fun take on the show. I enjoyed Marlon Wayans and he was fun to watch. Hassan is definitely on a different level, just from his deep understanding of the news and politics with his ability to keep a crowd energized. And also has a bit of hope for future, carrying some of the best qualities of Jon and Trevor. I hope he gets it."
Love Daily,"I watched full episodes in the first time in a long time

If Hassan gets to host then I’ll watch the show and if not, I doubt any other host will make the show feel relevant again"
Love Daily,"Yes, I would watch the daily show again if took over."
Love Daily,Sarah was pretty dope though too..
Love Daily,"Haven't been able to tune in for a bit so I haven't caught any of the guest hosts, but my choices post Jon were always Minaj or Klepper. Hopefully ends up being one of them."
Love Daily,"After seeing him on Celebrity Jeopardy, I'm 100% opposed to this."
Love Daily,"He seemed really passionate about the topics he covered. That level of energy reminded me so much of Jon Stewart. It really did feel refreshing compared to the other late night shows. 

Don’t screw this up Comedy Central."
Love Daily,I've only been watching one episode of each new host but Hassan was so good I watched all of his episodes. He killed IMO and deserves that permanent host position!
Love Daily,Didn’t he take a step back because he and his family were getting threats at their home? His wife said cut that shit or leave.
Love Daily,Ha has a really good story on The Moth about his prom night in high school which gets really heavy at the end but has a lot of comedy in it as well. Really recommend it to people he’s a talented dude.
Love Daily,"Yes please, especially after that Marlon guy being so fucking lame and unfunny"
Love Daily,Agree He is just spectacular to watch
Love Daily,"He has been so fricking good. I particularly love his after the cut youtube clips. He tore into Skip Bayless for taking something Giannis said out of context. And I had never heard the phrase ""green card energy"" until watching him. Hope he is permanent."
Love Daily,"I agree 100pc. 
He is probably the best guest host so far."
Love Daily,He was the best so far though Sarah Silverman was a close second.
Love Daily,"Eh, Hassan kinda fell flat sometimes because it felt too try hardish. He also imo didnt leave gaps for jokes to really settle into. Silverman has been the winner so far for me."
Love Daily,"His Netflix show was awesome as well, he deserves the gig"
Love Daily,I really liked Sarah Silverman as well
Love Daily,"At this point they should end the show and start something new. No one will ever capture the same balance Jon had, which is ultimately what made the show what it was."
Love Daily,I’m excited for Al Franken to host
Love Daily,Not suprising his netflix show was pretty damn amazing.
Love Daily,"I like him but that segment interviewing the kids was weird. At one point he asks them how much they think they should pay in taxes, using a fruit roll-up as a prop. In the end he tells them they should pay 90% because it goes to schools and roads. 
Most taxes go to Social Security, Medicare / Medicaid, and the Military. Yes at the state level some of it goes to education and infrastructure, but this is often funded through property and gas taxes respectively, and it's a small portion of overall taxes for the average person. A teen getting their first paycheck is not paying barely anything into their school. 
The sad thing is that Minhaj has more talent than any of the others combined, but he's gone from The Patriot Act to just another sellout pushing the daily spin."
Love Daily,He was great! Easily my favorite so far.
Love Daily,Agreed.
Love Daily,"Nah, he's obnoxious and pretentious."
Love Daily,"He should, but since his Netflix show got cancelled, I don’t see Comedy Central choosing him."
Love Daily,"I'm rooting for Ronnie Chieng but I don't even know if he is being considered.  If he doesn't get it, Minaj is my next hope."
Love Daily,I’ve been watching clips on YouTube of the various hosts. Really thought both Sarah and Handler would be excellent replacements too. But I like the random hosts thing they’re doing. Just get me Sir Ian
Love Daily,"Hasan is like the everyman for everyone 40 and under.  He gets the trends and lingo, is up to date on everything he reports on."
Love Daily,Another minority hire
Love Daily,Disagree. He just made the show into the patriot act... He's self obsessed. Self absorbed. And makes the show less about comedy and more about his agenda.
Love Daily,I agree. Although the same couldn’t be said when he hosted the Independent Film award last week. Not sure what happened behind the scene.
Love Daily,Yes!  He was great.
Love Daily,"He is amazing, fully support this."
Love Daily,"The fact that Netflix didn't continue with his show was absolute bullshit.

The Trudeau episode showed he has no problem speaking truth *directly* to power."
Love Daily,"Totally agree! He seemed a little uncomfortable in his interview with Shark Tank guy, but I’m sure that will change over time. He’s the best temp host, by far, and is a perfect fit for the show."
Love Daily,I just want Patriot Act (or an equivalent elsewhere) to come back. The Daily Show format isn't the same for me.
Love Daily,"I love the guest hosts, they have all done a great job. I love all the variety."
Stolen face,"No martial art or self defence is 100%. most good classes would advise to run at first opportunity in a street fight than advertise ways to always win or defend yourself without risk in a street fight. It wouldn’t really be much to accurately test given how unpredictable real violence is 

Would be good to see some myth busters type stuff on wild claims some make on martial arts or self defence"
Stolen face,The best self defense is cardio.
Stolen face,"It’s a weird idea right off the bat, you’re being trained in self defense to fight off a rapist or kidnapper or something. Of course the average self defense trainer isn’t going to be prepared to fight a professional martial artist.  I don’t know what this would prove except to make people look dumb.  And not even necessarily the instructors, some expert martial artists trouncing the guy who normally teaches people “keys to the face, stomp your heel on the ankle, run like fuck” the martial artists are going to come off like bullies.

But then all the obsession with Muay Thai. You just wanna see people do Muay Thai. That’s cool, but just suggest that show then. “I like Ong-Bak and also the slightly dumber one with the elephants, I wanna see more of that.”"
Stolen face,">attending as undercover trainees

This is a good way to piss off the local senseis, I think. Nobody likes being caught unaware, and likely once people found out it was undercover you are unlikely to get their cooperation, and only foster bitterness, with the ending being ""If they had only asked, I would have been happy to participate"".

Go the opposite route: send out letters, ""We will be in your area"", get 4 or 5 to confirm, film at each place for a few days, and after a couple of weeks you have the 4-5 episodes worth."
Stolen face,Not quite the same but fightquest was a cool show
Stolen face,"This just demonstrates a profound ignorance around actual violence in general. The idea that violence outside competition is anything less than unpredictable and chaotic is laughable. There is no ""best"" martial art in any sense but the situational and immediate. That's literally why there are so many."
Stolen face,"I'd rather they get whoever did episode 1 of season 2 tbh, the fight in ep 6 was cool (and better than most of the fights in S1) but felt too overedited with all the slo-mo and CGI stuff. Just give us a clear, well-shot fight with realistic camerawork like in episode 1 of both seasons."
Stolen face,"Is that the slo-mo episode? If so, those are the worst fights in the whole show."
Stolen face,"First episode was the only one I really enjoyed. Witcher is best when its just Geralt doing Witcher things. The political stuff don't come across very well and aren't interesting to me. 

Yes I read the books and played the games. Erectile disfunction."
Stolen face,The Witcher is *not* trying to be a “Game of Thrones style ensemble story”
Stolen face,"To me, the most compelling thing about the Witcher is how romantic it is. In Baptism of Fire, Geralt says something like ""When a time comes that you need my help, call my name into the night, and I promise I'll return.""

There's a lot of cool fairy tale logic and geralt constantly wants to be the knight in shining armor. What makes me love the witcher specifically is that the characters don't live in a world that inherently rewards that kind of behavior. It's really fucking hard to be chivalrous, but that makes the moments where he succeeds feel better. 

Episode 1 of season 2 is the one that captured this feeling best imo. We get our enchanted castle and our cursed friendly noble, but we're also put into a difficult moral position, where the one with the curse pretty clearly deserves punishment.

I love all the scenes with voleith mir right up until they do the whole ""YOU HAVE TO FIGHT, YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH"" bullshit I've seen a million times."
Stolen face,"this is one of the downsides to a show releasing all at once. When I binge a season, all the episodes run together in my mind. So it's harder to engage in satisfying discussion about all the elements."
Stolen face,"I wish they could just scrap the whole witcher show and let literally enyone try again in a few years. Henry Cavill will still be the perfect age then, and hopefully we get a good show."
Stolen face,"> I'd rather they get whoever did episode 1 of season 2 tbh

What a hell of an episode that was. Kristofer Hijvu coming out of the gates swinging in this episode."
Stolen face,Slo-mo fight scenes are always a let down. Guarantee movies like John Wick would not have become popular if all those gun/ fight scenes were in slo-mo.
Stolen face,"It was. The dude's tooth flying out triggered me. By the end of the fight I felt satisfied, but man was that a cheesy shot."
Stolen face,"You may not enjoy the political aspect of the Witcher, yet it is part of  the lore.

Without it the show would just be a bunch of fight scenes with the monster of the week, which would get people here to complain about the lack of plotlines 😆

I really think people are really spoiled and complain too much with this show."
Stolen face,"Exactly, people blame the show for not being smth it never ambitioned to be."
Stolen face,Can you give examples of how it isn’t? Contrasting the perspective shifts?
Stolen face,">voleith mir

Ya watching that scene I kept hoping for some other out come rather than that. Help from an unforeseen corner, rather than, oh Ciri is just too strong for the Big Bad. How is the Wild Hunt going to be a threat to Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri if Ciri can just overcome Voleith so easily?"

Stolen face,"This is very interesting! Not exactly something I would have expected to see on this particular subreddit (is there a subreddit for categorizing speech patterns?) but interesting nonetheless.

  Did you come up with these statement categories yourself, or are you drawing on some pre-established category system? I think your conclusions look fairly sound based on the examples you provide, but I would say the criteria by which you sort the statements could use refinement. The difference between 'binary quality' and 'non-binary quality' doesn't really look like a measurable difference at all to me (why, for instance, is 'very tough' given as an example of a binary quality, whereas 'very annoying' was given as non-binary? Is it solely the sentence structure that defines which of the two it is, not the descriptor?)

  You've got me thinking about this and I didn't expect to think about this today (or any day), so that's a win."

A more or less popular subreddit for ""categorizing speech patterns"" would be like literal heaven to me!

Could you give examples of problems with other distinctions? The ""binary/non-binary"" one turned out to be the weakest in this analysis.

You're right, if we're comparing specifically ""very tough"" and ""very annoying"" - they're the same. I was thinking about something else, but the fishing example of ""binary"" is probably not very good anyway. 

> Is it solely the sentence structure that defines which of the two it is, not the descriptor?

The category of a description is never truly defined, it depends on the context of other descriptions. *(the fishing examples skip that)* I made an illustration about this: [here](https://i.imgur.com/FBSGtbk.png).

Circles are like quotes. Colors are like categories potentially applicable to those quotes. Any particular circle can be just a mess of colors, but when you check a **group** of circles - you may notice the color that pops up more often than others. In the upper line it's **red**, in the lower line - it's **green**.

A weirder illustration, with trees: [here](https://i.imgur.com/EI5st53.png). Upper pictures emphasize tree trunks in a special way (compared to the lower ones), even though tree trunks are present in every single picture. Elements of the trees are the same, but you pay different kinds of attention to them. It's a weirder illustration, but I like it more than the color one: I like to think about my categories as ""attention patterns"".

> You've got me thinking about this and I didn't expect to think about this today (or any day), so that's a win.

I don't know how to objectively test the idea by myself (I'm not a programmer, I don't know a cheap way to generate many speech tests), so I want to get people interested in this topic by posting analyzes.

I think that categories like this can be applied to the speech of real people... and if speech patterns exist, people should know about them.

Do you think there's a way to share something like this with linguists or machine learning people?"
Stolen face,"I don't have paramount+, but do they combine multipart episodes to one? That cutting out 6 episodes sounds about right."
Stolen face,"ATLA has 61 episodes. They probably just combined The Day of Black Sun episodes (+1), The Boiling Rock episodes (+1) and Sozin's Comet episodes (+3).

56 + 5 = 61 episodes."
Stolen face,"> Circles are like quotes. Colors are like categories potentially applicable to those quotes. Any particular circle can be just a mess of colors, 

Ah, so what you're saying is that they're not intended to be mutually exclusive descriptors. That may be where I was seeing ambiguity; I understood the categories to be akin to dividing lines, not independent 'applies / does not apply' assessments. 

  Knowing this, I don't think I have any further individual instances to point out in the quotes you categorize; any discrepancy between my evaluation and yours is likely to just be a difference in judgment, not an objective difference. (Which one could say means the system needs further refinement? Generally, the purpose of rules for quantifying something is to allow different individuals to reach consistent conclusions over different sets of data by applying consistent judgment criteria.)

  I'm not a programmer either, but in any case, to use a program for this you would almost certainly need to be able to express your qualifying criteria in pure logic such as (If word = Verb And location(word) = 3...) or something along those lines. So you would first have to do that, and to do _that_ you would probably have to do a really deep dive into the theoretical construction of the English language to understand what strictly quantifiable constructs and patterns correlate to your definitions. And the English language is an contradictory bitch, so _that_ is probably where this spirals into impossibly complex territory perhaps better approached by machine learning or something.

  If I had infinite free time I would try it myself, but I most certainly do not so that's about as far as I can speculate.

  As for where you could share this: Hell if I know! I'm an amateur writer of fiction and a Material Engineer. The former is why I'm interested, and the latter is where I got enough programming experience to begin to speculate on what you would need to approach programming something related to this, but neither mean I'm in any way involved in or even aware of a relevant field. Maybe look for groups of hobbyist linguists? That might be something that exists."

I think there're problems if we disagree about whole groups of quotes. If you look at a bunch of quotes of Katara and a bunch of quotes of Aang and don't see how they gravitate towards different descriptions - I didn't reach my goal. But if we agree, you can say that the rules are consistent for groups of quotes.

> And the English language is an contradictory bitch, so *that* is probably where this spirals into impossibly complex territory perhaps better approached by machine learning or something.

I agree and think that maybe even without language contradictions such approach could be still impossible: you need to analyze the quotes in context of each other + you may need at least on some level understand the actual ""meaning"" of the quotes.

But by testing I meant this (sorry for not clarifying): you could use a program to take, let's say, random redditor's quotes and generate a test for a human. A test can give you **N** sets of quotes and ask you what sets you're sure don't correspond to a single person. (If speech patterns exist you should be able to do that.) If you can solve those tests and teach others to solve them, it won't prove the idea outright ('cause personal information can get into samples and serve as a hint), but should spark more interest in investigating the issue further. It also won't be testing my particular descriptions, but the general idea that distinct universal speech patterns exist. The idea that you can tell apart the speech of people you don't know.

I can ask a friend to make **1** test for me, but what if I need **50** tests to do a little bit of training? 

> but neither mean I'm in any way involved in or even aware of a relevant field. Maybe look for groups of hobbyist linguists? That might be something that exists.

I see... thank you for the idea about hobbyists! I myself heard about [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) (but it's usually not about **universal** patterns, as I understood) and [Discourse analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_analysis).

As I've wrote about the tests I started thinking... maybe it's possible to get people interested in creating a ""speech tester"" just for fun? I guess it can be funny or interesting even if you don't believe in the patterns, since anything can come up in random quotes (funny, thoughtful, important or sad)."
Stolen face,"Thanks for this, I will watch these episodes and I applaud the effort you put in. Even if the quality varies, I love the cast of characters the Simpsons created and can watch them in almost any scenario.

What I find annoying about Simpsons criticism is yes even if you don't think the show was as good as it used to be, most of the people saying that haven't watched the show in years, and therefore are speaking from ignorance and pre-conceived bias. And worse they have to be a party pooper for those who still enjoy the show."
Stolen face,way of the dog was excellent and threw right back to the very first episode
Stolen face,Dude thank you for this. The Simpsons were everything for me and my sisters growing up. We watched at 5/5:30 and 10. Everyday. I will check these out as I have admittedly been a purveyor of the “Simpsons” suck now regime.
Stolen face,i’ve been needing stuff to watch lately and i’m a big fan of the simpsons peak seasons so thank you for this
Stolen face,Going to go through these. That quote from Halloween of Horror sounds like some 90s level Homer-being-a-good-dad.
Stolen face,"Couldn't agree more with this post. I would also recommend Todd, Todd, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me? (S31 E9). One of my favourite episodes."
Stolen face,I would also add Barthood. The parody of Boyhood.
Stolen face,"I've been rewatching on Disney+ and planned to stop after the ""golden years"" but kept going since I'm stuck at home anyway. I'm on season 17 and still been enjoyable enough."
Stolen face,I have always maintained they have at least one episode each season that reminds you what it was in its prime.
Stolen face,"Heartbreak Hotel was funny in a cringe type of way. I liked it, but it made me sad to see how broken their marriage is. I was expecting the black & white scene to be a dream sequence but nope. Marge was really after that dude lol. Then the way it ended was just… man y’all need a divorce already😔"
Stolen face,I have been watching it every now and then recently and I have to agree people need to give this show a chance again it got really bad for a few years but damn if it isn't good now
Stolen face,"The whole ""Simpsons is unwatcheable"" fad has completely taken a life on its own.

That's like complaining that your favorite sports team got knocked out in the first round of the playoffs, and that they're worthless.

Stolen face,“Simpson Safari” was the episode that made me notice the dip in quality. That whole episode just feels very off. It’s like a series of comic strip gags in a fish out of water setting. There is no plot until the last 5 minutes and then it ends with the simpsons becoming billionaires (?)
Stolen face,So you disagree with my opinions on episodes you haven't even watched?
Stolen face,"You’re getting downvoted but it’s true. After 9 great seasons, the show started to fall apart and a few good episodes per season doesn’t make it a good tv show."
Stolen face,"I agree with the guy above that by season 11 it was shockingly bad. I think I have the had the whiplash effect he mentioned. I struggled through until about 14 I think.

Stolen face,"I agree, and like you I am curious to see the episodes recommended here. But I'm skeptical because of the assessment by OP of season 9 as ""transcendent"". IMHO it was already starting to slip there, and was merely good, not great, much less transcendent.

I don't know what gay issues he must be working through but I just can't with him. Each show he has to have some senerio where he has hot men turn out to be evil psychopaths that end up torturing and sometimes kill the women who are interested in them. Maybe he a bad experience with a jock and their girlfriend in school but I unsubsidized when I realized what was going on.

Edit: The shows im mainly referring to are the ones he was mainly incharge of starting with scream which, alright but then...

vampire diaries -- where damon fed and had sex with Caroline and erased her memories,  He only showrun season one I wonder why.

The following where the first thing the ""hot"" serial killer did was kill young women.

Stalker were is self explanatory. But still twisted as fuck. 

And now this.

And not for nothing this dude was a republican until 2008... a gay republican."
Stolen face,The only way I could watch this show was to skip through the boring scenes. Season 2 is probably worse too lol. Hopefully James Wolk can get another project after Watchmen that is ...watchable
Stolen face,It was an amazing show with a lot of wasted potential.
Stolen face,"I agree, stupid ending. See my edit above."
Stolen face,"Yes, correct. If you didn't read about it, it's hard to tell."
Stolen face,"I don't know what other shows he's been involved with, but in this case it sounds like you are referring to the Riding Hood story, and to be honest, that kinda is the story. And having charming men turn out to be psychopaths and killers is the rule in Hollywood, isn't it? When did you see an ugly guy who was the villain?"
Stolen face,"When it keeps showing up in all he's shows, its a weird pattern."
Stolen face,"If its a pattern, then thats definitely a problem. Is he really that cliche?"
Stolen face,yes. But I will say this show is as bad as it got the other shows were on network where im sure there was less control. But yeah hopefully he gets therapy that shit is hard to watch. But CBS has some other good programing check those out.
Stolen face,"I'm watching 'The Stand' and 'One Dollar' - this is a weird show thats actually quite good but has absolutely nothing to do with the one dollar bill in the title. I mean its not even mentioned once in the entire show.

What are some other good shows on there?"
Stolen face,"Lol I legit was gonna write in my last post skip one dollar. Its interesting but suffered from the same problem as Tell me a story, which is a lack of oversight.

Of your looking for good adult drama the good fight is fantastic. Its a spinoff of a CBS procedural but they really take advantage of being on a streaming that show looks really good and the writting is superb but it does get very political if your trying to avoid that kind of thing.

But since you don't seem to be opposed to syfy can I recommend star trek discovery. Its All Access most expensive show, supposed to be their GoT. I wasn't a star trek fan in anyway but I got hooked. Try season one and if its not working for you skip to season two where the show looks even better and they changed show runners so the story pivots a bit but still good in my opinion. 

I can't think of another show rn but I hope that helps."
Stolen face,"I really hope One Dollar has a good ending or I'll be pissed. I didn't see The Good Wife so I'm afraid the new spinoff won't make much sense without it.

And I'm a huge Trek fan. I visit and post on r/startrek.

I've watched Discovery S1 and almost half of Picard. IMO both shows are a bit of a let down after starting well, and many other Trek fans share that view. I heard S2 of Discovery gets much better. I also haven't seen 'Lower Decks' yet."
Stolen face,"Oh in that case you have your answer, I know those shows can be a late down. I do recommend season 2 though even though season 3 kinda sucked. But lower decks has nothing but good praise and even though I don't watch Rick and morty(I think those creators had a hand in it) the show was really really good. Especially if your familiar with star trek."
Stolen face,"Finished One Dollar. Excellent show, much better than Tell me a story! had a very satisfying ending."
Stolen face,I enjoyed that analysis. I remember binging the show and seeing some of the same view. Namely the focus of the show not being about as agency to-dos as much as Don’s personal goals.
Stolen face,Great summarization!
Stolen face,This was a great post to read. It reminded to start rewatching Mad Men all over again.
Stolen face,"> The second time he fails, he abandons his forward-thinking philosophy in the Hershey pitch, and reminisces about his own true childhood growing up in a brothel. This mistake of looking back costs him dearly, as you all know.

The Hershey pitch is not about failing, looking back, or being a son of a brothel whore.  Don Draper was a successful ad man because  he was exceptionally talented at *recasting* the perception or image of a product.  But he had that talent because he had the soul of an artist, not exceptionally driven by wealth or status.  

Recasting the perception or image of a product was really about capturing the essence of the product.  And that ability came from him capturing the essence of himself, and from there, his ability to affect the perception or image of Don Draper.

The Hershey account was Don Draper's Kryptonite.  It was the perfect product that literally did not need rebranding.  Hershey was The perfect product, and Don wanted to be in essence The Don Draper.  That realization was caused him to meltdown in the pitch meeting.  He started out by going through the motions, then he tried to dig into that inner pit where he could produce some unique truth, and ironically, it was a perfect pitch, because Don was able to share ""his"" truth towards the product.  But a perfect product doesn't need rebranding, and Don had to admit he wouldn't change a thing about Hershey.

I consider the final season to be a ripoff of the Siddhartha mythos, where a naive young man goes forth into the world in order to find enlightenment, becomes entangled by worldly values and women, hits bottom, and then finally walks away from the BS that is ego and worldly values.  After all, what the fuck could McCann Erickson give him?  In the Siddhartha mythos, he comes across his son, and tries to raise him, but the son was on his own path, and rejects his father entirely.  In Mad Men, this is represented by his ""niece"", the daughter of his mentor, the real Draper's wife.  Only by losing his ""child"", Don was able to finally let go of the world itself, and come to accept everything, including himself,  which is sort of what enlightment is in Hindu philosophy.  That's why Don is sitting in meditation at the end; it represents him finding enlightenment.  

I've always hated that they closed the show with that Coca Cola commercial, because I never believed Draper went back to advertising."
Stolen face,"I’m not sure whether I agree with you, but I really enjoy reading theories on what the show is about. It speaks to how clever the writing is that it’s simultaneously great, while also being evasive in what it’s message is."
Stolen face,"It's interesting on rewatches how much I pity Don. 

He's just downright pathetic for large stretches of the show, hurting pretty much anybody in his path the moment they aren't exactly what he wants them to be. To his credit, the show is sprinkled with haphazard acts of kindness from Don, but thats usually just a means to avoid his own problems."
Stolen face,"I look at the ending more of a critique of the pop new age religion of the time. Don is nothing if not a man who thinks he's past his demons only to eventually come back to them because there are no easy answers and he is someone always in search of them. He marries Megan specifically because shes the easy answer.

He'll take the ideas and sell some soda and not learn any lessons."
Stolen face,"I like it because at the end it feels like he was enlightened and that he may have felt suddenly unburdened by his internal divide.  I like the thought that he went back and did the coke commercial because he reached his own enlightenment, realising that everyone has the 'competition' inside and that is what marketers thrive in.  Now he understands himself, so he now understands everyone, and stops feeling like he has to be something, he just is whatever he wants, and makes people into whatever he wants.  I've felt that he ends up in a neutral, peaceful state, with complete self-understanding, so he can lead others wherever they want or wherever they should to be. He became the leader he was always meaning to be."
Stolen face,">I never believed Draper went back to advertising.

That was the whole point of him of him calling it in. I think he made that final pitch is swan song, not caring if he got the credit or not. All that mattered was that he created what is actually considered one of the most influential ads of all time. 

I think Don simply walked away after that. Maybe 15 years later wrote a memoir. But that was it."
Stolen face,[deleted]
Stolen face,"THIS is what I got out of the ending. Don basically found a way to sellout enlightenment. He was probably happy for a few hours/days/weeks, and then he went back to being his miserable old self."

Hilarious, because I picture in the sequel to Mad Men that Don Draper becomes an early new age guru, rather than going back to advertising."

Stolen face,"No, I read it, don't find it particularly enlightening or in agreement with it.  I decided it'll take too long for me to pick apart, and boring to read to boot."
Stolen face,Don is a character that is repeatedly shown not ever learning anything or accepting himself and owning up to it. He always looks for a way out of that and I think this is just showing how hes going to sell out this revelation too
Stolen face,"I think he'd always go back because advertising is the one perfect thing to him. When he's working on advertising he's perfect, it's just every other time that's the problem. To me it always made sense he'd ultimately figure out how to turn this experience into a sales pitch. Mad men is usually pretty critical of new age religious movements too throughout the show."
Stolen face,"> I think he'd always go back because advertising is the one perfect thing to him.

(Geez,) in what sense???  Don didn't do it for the money.  Don didn't do it for the acclaim.  Don walked out on McCann/Erickson during the pitch meeting.  Don didn't even think advertising was his identity at that point.  Don went West and finally came to peace with Dick Whitman.  How do you go from personal enlightenment to bullshit advertising with your bullshit persona???  Didn't occur to you that if he became a new age guru, that he'd be selling something new, that meant more to him?

>  Mad men is usually pretty critical of new age religious movements too throughout the show.

In what sense?  Bert Cooper pushing Libertarianism on Don wasn't a new age movement.  Hindu guru/hippies wasn't ""new age"".  New Age movement was birthed in the 1970's."

I for one am so happy they didn't mess with the story.  Too many adaptations just do lip service to the source material and end up being completely different.  This just upsets the existing fanbase, especially when the adaptation is bad to boot.    Here they had a stellar story and didn't mess with it often recreating scenes that were near identical to the game.    It was so awesome seeing it come to life without significant changes other than cutting things for brevity.    

Here's hoping they do the second game similar justice as it's story is just as worthy of being adaptated straight up though I can see how they might tinker with way they tell the story in that they'll show the stories of the dual protagonists at the same time rather than separately."

Also, I found when I played the game I sided with Joel almost fully. Like he was doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons.

The House Arrest of Us,"I must applaud the show's comittement to the source material, but the execution left me wanting. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as HotD.

Ellie not being able to swin paid off with her nearly drowning while trying to reach the hospital near the end of the game, but that was cut from the story. Instead we got a flashback, which explains why Ellie is immune, which undermines why it has to be Ellie that needs to die in order to produce a cure. 

Action setpiece, tense sequences where you sneak past Clickers, or move through spore-filled underground tunnels (which wouldn't work anyway, given how they changed the cordiceps), the show could have used more of those."
The House Arrest of Us,House of the Dragon season 2 and Last of Us season 2 are going to pull huge numbers is what you're telling me. HBO wins on both counts.
The House Arrest of Us,"Great HBO, now do oryx and crake!"
The House Arrest of Us,"Man, I really hope HBO picks up a good Sci Fi IP. That would be the ultimate trio.

Bring back FIREFLY please"
The House Arrest of Us,Bring back WestWorld!
The House Arrest of Us,"I never played the game or seen anyone do it.
So i didnt know what to expect when i started watching this series.
After the 2 first episodes i pre-ordered the PC release for the las of us, after 5 episodes i jumped on youtube and watched jacksepticeyes playtrough of the last of us 2.

I don't know why i never bothered earlier, but goddamn this is some good shit."
The House Arrest of Us,God I Hope so
The House Arrest of Us,Well deserved. The Last of Us is the better show with better source material and audiences clearly agree with that sentiment
The House Arrest of Us,"Kid asked me why did Marlene task a single man to deliver Ellie across the country when she managed to teleport there before them with a big armed crew?

I didn't know what to say"
The House Arrest of Us,Pascal Power.
The House Arrest of Us,Now get the rights to Red Dead Redemption. Adapt the 2nd game first and then the 1st.
The House Arrest of Us,HoTD > TLoU
The House Arrest of Us,"Don’t care, HOT D still better 👍

TLOU was pretty good but it didn’t really blow me away. A nice 7/10 show, maybe 8. Was never gripped like I was watching my Targ friends weekly"
The House Arrest of Us,"Unpopular opinion but to me this show was way overrated. Boring, characters making dumb decisions, like walking around unattentive. I enjoyed Raised by Wolves and From much more."
The House Arrest of Us,"The most overhyped tv show I've ever seen. Just wait, it's not even going to be close to House of the Dragon in terms of award nominations"
The House Arrest of Us,I'm happy these two shows got made but at the same time it makes it hurt even more seeing things like Wheel of Time and The Witcher with c tier writers with no respect for the source material.
The House Arrest of Us,"As an experiment in turning a video game into a show, I thought The last of us was really great sometimes. The last episode however, did not work for me at all."
The House Arrest of Us,…so they both performed extremely well?
The House Arrest of Us,"And people try to say that hbo is the worst streaming platform. HBO is by far the highest standard when it comes to making quality content, it’s not even close."
The House Arrest of Us,Is the season over yet? Can I pay for one month of HBO and watch it all at once?
The House Arrest of Us,if only they did halo correctly.
The House Arrest of Us,It was pretty lame compared to HOTD.
The House Arrest of Us,"hey, i didn’t have time to follow the show this last month, was it good?  did it feel like a video game movie addaptation?"
The House Arrest of Us,Its a much better show so thats great
The House Arrest of Us,Good
The House Arrest of Us,[deleted]
The House Arrest of Us,"Excellent, TLOU was so much better."
The House Arrest of Us,"No surprise. HOTD was a pretentious, often boring disappointment. TLOU wasn't perfect but at least met my high expectations."
The House Arrest of Us,I honestly didn’t like house of the dragon but loved TLOU but that’s just my opinion
The House Arrest of Us,"Why does anyone care about this kind of thing? If it’s good it’s good, do we really need to know who’s watching which more?"
The House Arrest of Us,"Hype is a powerful thing.

I watched it all and thought it was okay. The game is superior."
The House Arrest of Us,My favorite thing about The Last of Us is that there were no late night misunderstandings that dropped the entire European country into a bloody war and made a family slowly kill each other over the course of decades which resulted in one of their descendants losing it 270 years down the line and burning a city down :)
The House Arrest of Us,"It's a bit like comparing the heights of new NBA players to Minut Bol.  They are all frigging giants.

I'm just impressed that HBO has managed to keep its quality > quantity in an era that seems to be all going the latter (at least in terms of it's original scripted content, not so much the streaming service licensed content)."
The House Arrest of Us,The nice part about The Last of Us compared to House of the Dragon is that you can see things on your TV screen when you watch it.
The House Arrest of Us,Good. It was better.
The House Arrest of Us,"Well deserved. 

Craig Mazen does it again"
The House Arrest of Us,"Well deserved. Great casting, even greater writers."
The House Arrest of Us,Deserved. It's a better show.
The House Arrest of Us,"That's because ""The Last of Us"" wasn't a mediocre show trying its damnedest to ride the hype of a show that came out ten years ago."
The House Arrest of Us,Now let's get them to do an Uncharted series on HBO. Can Craig do comedy?
The House Arrest of Us,Good. Screw Game of Thrones and everything that spawned from it in the cinematic spectrum. They did us so freaking dirty with that last season.
The House Arrest of Us,I dropped off hard with House of Dragons. I got to episode 8 and just forgot about it.
The House Arrest of Us,"This season felt so rushed

Episode 3 spent too much time away from Joel and Ellie. That episode being longer than the finale is a shame

The lack of infected is a damn shame

Walking dead season 1 was much better"
The House Arrest of Us,"I couldn't finish HotD, got to episode 5 dragging my feet. I watched TloU every Sunday night, it was a better show for me personally, but I think my opinion is from a biased perspective, I played the game, but never read the story about HotD so felt less invested"
The House Arrest of Us,It's a vastly better show
The House Arrest of Us,Not surprised.  House of the Dragon was awful
The House Arrest of Us,"I didn't care for house of the dragon. Just didn't grab me. I feel like the only one. On the other hand, I loved TLOU."
The House Arrest of Us,Not watching any gOt spin-offs as revenge for season 8
The House Arrest of Us,I couldn’t get into either show. I think I’m over GOT and zombie type shit. I’d like to see more dramas about real life again. Plus that girl in The Last of Us just makes me want to turn of my television.
The House Arrest of Us,"Almost as if respecting the source material has its pay offs. While HOTG’s been doing great job at sticking near the source material, the fuck up that was Game of Thrones season 8, has tarnished the brand’s reputation. IMHO."
The House Arrest of Us,"HoD sucks donkey balls.
That’s why."
The House Arrest of Us,Was it really THAT good???
The House Arrest of Us,It was better.
The House Arrest of Us,"fuck that game of thrones lite boring ass bullshit

this isnt even close"
The House Arrest of Us,HotD is the definition of mid and I'm tired of holding my tongue
The House Arrest of Us,This always ends each episode with a “OH NO!’ It’s always a long week until the next episode!
The House Arrest of Us,"Loved both.  HBO is back, baby."
The House Arrest of Us,"I can't watch shows like these. I have the attention span of a gnat and I get bored, really bored."
The House Arrest of Us,"Yeah, because house of the dragon sucked in comparison"
The House Arrest of Us,"If it keeps sticking close to the games, it’s going to jump from Game of Thrones Season 1 to Season 8, in only two seasons. I am a fan of the games, but The Last of Us Part 2 is a narrative dumpster fire."
The House Arrest of Us,What’s the appeal of the shitty incest show? Are people really that degenerate?
The House Arrest of Us,It's worth pointing out that HotD went up head to head with NFL football
The House Arrest of Us,…. Because it is FUCKING AWESOME
The House Arrest of Us,Can’t wait for season 2
The House Arrest of Us,Fucking Obviously
The House Arrest of Us,"I’m still not really healed from how the last few seasons of GoT went, and House of the Dragon seemed played out by the time it started. I needed more substance than watching a show that uses soft core porn as it’s backbone. The Last of Us was one of the best shows I’ve seen in a while."
The House Arrest of Us,"Of course it did. It's a much better quality show. 

George RR Martin is done. Dont care about that man and his little universe anymore."
The House Arrest of Us,It was better than house of the dragon but doesn’t even compare to the game.
The House Arrest of Us,HOTD was awful. Just a politics show for the casual viewer.
The House Arrest of Us,Not bad for a show that is so boring.
The House Arrest of Us,…because it’s a much better show
The House Arrest of Us,"Yea bc house of dragons sucked
I’m surprised white lotus didn’t beat house of dragons"
The House Arrest of Us,They both have horribly unlikable main characters.
The House Arrest of Us,"If any HBO producer is reading this

Do you see what happens when you put effort and hire good writers?

But that doesn't mean we want a pletora of bad/mediocre zombies shows now, ok?"
The House Arrest of Us,"Yeah, It's still winter outside. House of the Dragon ran through the summer. Not very fair numbers."
The House Arrest of Us,"Fungos \&gt; dragões, simples."
The House Arrest of Us,"It's pretty good, even though it commits the fucking sin of having the word fuck said way too many times in the fucking script. To the point I can fucking hear it coming before the word fuck is out of the actor's mouth. It really lessons the fucking impact of fuck when it's said every fucking few minutes. 

Otherwise, it's good. Fuck."
The House Arrest of Us,Two shows with terrible writing—save for episode 3 of TLOU which was brilliant!
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,The visual of Joel’s wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I like how Troy Baker is listed as Video Game ""Joel"" in the BTS after the episode"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,[removed]
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,So was the implication that they were eating the girl’s father in the dining hall? (Among many other people evidently)
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,there is 100% a very bad reason why david was a teacher before the outbreak
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,“I made you eat your parents”
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I do like how at first it seemed like they only ate the one guy who died, but then joel finds the whole room full of bodies. so they been at this a while"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Always wondered how a video game actor as good as Troy Baker would do as a live action actor. The answer is good
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,[removed]
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""It's okay, I believe him."" 

So badass and so chilling at the same time."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,the actor for david did a great job
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,the meat from the soup isn't venison is it...
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,That grown man just slapped a little orphan girl in the face and then fed her her father. Eric Cartman would be proud.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I’m seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,[removed]
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‘own’ her as his pet at his side. I’d recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""I believe  him"""
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Oh yeah. That’s that shit I like right there
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""Baby girl"" 🥺 

Gonna go weep brb"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Indicative of David’s character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else’s

Edit - 4x’s the cannibalism"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, “baby girl.”"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,I’d nit pick Joel’s recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn’t so fucking awesome
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I’d expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I’d just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,100% that kid’s dad was the ear
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn’t others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season 😬"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn’t still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind 😳
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in “it’s okay baby girl” was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, “In an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.” And damn if Joel and Ellie aren’t stainless steel survivors."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,[removed]
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,I counted 22 stabs…damn Ellie
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Great episode overall. I wish they could’ve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,That went by so fast
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,If you’re gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"I’m curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Tiny little pieces David!
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Shout out to Ellie for properly killing a villain. Keep stabbing until they’re dead! None of this one stab and run away so they can come after you again nonsense 👏🏻
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Ellie’s screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Best episode so far imo.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"As someone who’s never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It’s hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I’ve seen in ages, and am loving it."
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,[deleted]
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,Fuck.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"Jesus, that was intense"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,"“It’s okay baby girl, I got you” I AM NOT OK"
We Are: The Brooklyn Saints,[removed]
Sober Companion,"If you don’t know about Lauren Lapkus, get into her. She’s hilarious. Comedy Bang Bang backlog has a lot of her character work.

And the Threedom podcast has lots of her as a person."
Sober Companion,[deleted]
Sober Companion,"I recently saw Lauren  in Good Girls and she was great there too.  I never watched Krysta's 2019 show Daybreak but I loved her in Trial and Error and Smash on NBC. Excited for this new show. 

Sounds like it's a mix of CBS's B Positive and Single Drunk Female on Freeform"
Sober Companion,double comment
Lara,Who?
Lara,">Fox News has long maintained a policy that prohibits people from being contributors when they announce a campaign for public office. In this case, since Donald Trump has announced his intention to run once again for president, the network’s rules bar Lara Trump from being paid for her commentary. 

Oh, yeah, that's *totes* the reason why they fired her. Not because they've been inching away from Trump the moment he failed to deliver the Red Wave for the Republicans and have since made it worse with his now public spat with Kanye and dinner with Fuentes. They could have easily fired her last week but didn't. Man, the legal department must have cheered when they found that contract clause."
Lara,It’s almost like she had the job because of her last name
Lara,let her know hobby lobby is hiring
Lara,"During the 2020 election, Lara Trump came to our city for a campaign event and like 14 people showed up."
Lara,I assume it’s because Hannity is looking for someone new to sexually harass.
Lara,Oh no! She was so capable and qualified!!
Lara,She married the dumb one.
Lara,She should part ways with her plastic surgeon
Lara,"""Contributor"""
Lara,"Ah, yes. Fox News, with the journalistic integrity."
Lara,The fucks wrong with her eyes. Looks like a malfunctioning robot.
Lara,"This is another sign Fox is moving on from the trumps, they've been showing far less deference to ""ill douche"" lately.  They've ignored his rallies, and haven't been as enthusiastic about his run as they were in the past.  

Expect Fox to start pushing Ronnie White Boots more and more, especially considering the legal trouble the trump organization is facing in 2023"
Lara,When did Fox News get policies and ethics?
Lara,"Oh no, anyway…"
Lara,"Ah so it's a company rules thing and not a ""the Right is moving away from being blind MAGA followers."" I guess on the surface that's a plus since it means FOX News at least has some integrity when it comes to who they pay. 

I don't think this means they're turning on Trump though. If Trump pulls ahead as the clear favorite FOX News will be all over him again."
Lara,What the hell is wrong with her eye?
Lara,"So if Faux ""News"" claims to have a ""long maintained"" policy of not employing candidates or their family members, then how is it that Chimpy Bush's cousin, John Ellis, is the one who was in charge of FAUX's election night coverage in 2000, and is the one who told the network to project his idiot cousin as the ""winner""??

Policy or not, the entire network seems to be purging itself from Team Orange ever since the ""Red Wave"" turned into a ""Red Puddle""."
Lara,"The Lawsuit is going badly and they are tossing ""Good Faith"" gestures out to try and influence the jury."
Lara,TWUNT
Lara,Why does she have that Forest Whitaker stare?

Lara,"Haha even fox is ditching dear leader, they want desantis"
Lara,Hahahaha
Lara,She looks like a mugged clown
Lara,Shouldn't this be in the /Upliftingnews sub?
Lara,Never heard of her.
Lara,Like toilet paper.

Lara,I think Trumplforeskin has been banging her behind the scenes.
Lara,"It's 2024 campaigning time. Donnie will be paying them all six figures from the campaign slush fund for  two years.

If he does well she'll be back on Fox in no time."
Lara,"""Contributor"", in the same way I contribute to the local sewage system."
Lara,I will really miss her insightful analysis as to why everything Trump did was good and everything Biden did was bad.
Lara,Maybe now she can run a fundie pyramid scheme and have a robust upline with other morons.
Lara,Being a moron is usually good business on fox news. Probably wasn't blonde enough to fit their image.
Lara,She is a liability for the Desantia to come.
Lara,Miss cocaine is leaving?
Lara,She needs a Botox intervention
Lara,Read the article. They only got rid of her because The Mango Fuhrer announced his candidacy - conflict of interest to have a PAID contributor who is a direct family member of a candidate (or something).  She can still appear as an unpaid guest.
Lara,Off to MLM Hun world to fleece the rubes.
Lara,I haven’t checked the comments yet but I’m sure they will be level headed and reasonable
Lara,Can anyone in Trump family hold down a job?
Lara,"The House of Fox has bent their knees to the House of DeSantis, forsaken their oath to Trump."
Lara,Trump family Stepford Wife
Lara,Creepy bitch.
Lara,The Purge of the Trumpanzees continues (until he is the 2024 candidate.) /what a bunch of maroons.
Lara,Guess she had one foot in the oven and not enough in the brave
Lara,"Safe to say, she won't be missed (?)"
Lara,"Oh no, guys, how’s Fox News going to continue now this major blow has been dealt?"
Lara,Think of Lara
Lara,Who cares about her or Fox News?
Lara,Who?
Lara,Why do they have this policy if they aren’t a news channel but an entertainment channel?
Lara,I’m missing the part where she announced that she’s running for public office. Not suspicious at all.
Lara,"I am surprised that Fox News hasn't literally spun this by blaming President Biden (yet again) that we are indeed headed for a recession, as they had to let Lara Trump go to save a few bucks."
Lara,Oh Dr Lara who can diagnose dementia in Biden but not see anything wrong with her Father in Law! Stable genius
Lara,FOX News is awesome.
Lara,/s ad
Lara,"A lot of talking about airtime this and that but no one talks about all the stupid shit that your favorite “most voted president in the world” is doing , democrats are really fucking up everything while all you liberal lazy asses are talking about how cnn or fox likes trump or not .


Like it or not , Trump WILL BE coming back in 2024 ."
Lara,"Wait, she was a contributor?"
Lara,So useless pundit gets punted. I doubt even Trump sheep give a shit.
Lara, What did she contribute??
Lara,"“Ol’ Gums” wife is hitting the unemployment line‼️ No more “gravy train” - except at the grocery, for the dog."
Lara,Her?
Lara,Bye LA-RA ( in my david perdue voice)
Lara,Fuck me Alex!
Lara,Not a fan of Murdoch at all. But grateful he’s done with Trump.
Lara,Ahh she went to culinary school and got a BA in communications. Why was she even someone worth broadcasting?
Lara,"Let not forget in the court of law 
Attorneys for Fox stated 
The network is entertainment!! 

FOX ENTERTAINMENT  Please let try to call it what it is.  Cheap entertainment 🤑"
Lara,Vapid clown woman. Buh-bye!
Lara,you know you are a loser when fox news basically fires you
Lara,"Too crazy for fox, or didn't want to put up with the non stop sexual harassment?"
Lara,Who the fuck is this?
Lara,Apparently Eric’s wife
Lara,Mike Jones!
Lara,Sarah Huckabee Sander’s eye twin
Lara,You may remember her from such pieces as “Married to a man-a-kid” and “how to get ahead by selling it all”
Lara,"You know, an *actual* product of *actual* nepotism..."
Lara,You know her as Slender Man
Lara,I’m still betting on Fox to run back to Trump before the 2024 election.
Lara,Don't forget he's saying the Constitution should be suspended/ignored.
Lara,fox has inched away from trump and toward desantis. its obvious.
Lara,"Like that time Hannity spoke on stage at a Trump campaign rally.  
A blatant violation of journalistic ethics"
Lara,He's been openly talking about running for two years. This is a bullshit excuse.
Lara,"Trump and much of his family + previous administration members constantly appearing on the channel + many of Fox's most viewed talking heads, continuously floating the belief that Trump was improperly removed as president, but somehow only now does the policy of that potential conflict of interest magically apply, because he officially announced he's running again."
Lara,Ya the first time they found that clause in the contract was after it was signed. The hoops you people jump through
Lara,"See, Fox News itself is a contributor by being the propaganda piece. So they can't have a contributor for a contributor - that's contribution inception, or conri-ception, which conservatives can't stand."
Lara,"The rules bar payment for her commentary;
They are not doing something that needed to be done, she was there for money. They all were/still are."
Lara,This may be a bit off topic but has Trump left the country at all since losing the election?
Lara,They’re still trying to “land the plane.”
Lara,"My memory has died, but didn't he make some kind of legal argument that he was running to protect something immediately after the election?"
Lara,"Are there any example of them keeping someone on despite this policy?

Don't get me wrong: I'm sure they're happy to get rid of her for the reasons you state. I'm just wondering how strong this policy actually is."
Lara,"“Rules” 🤣

Sure Jan."
Lara,Censorship!
Flower of Evil,It's going on the list. Thanks!
Flower of Evil,"Sounds good, but where can we watch this?"
Flower of Evil,"I watched it on Viki with english subtitles, no subscription needed. I'm sure the site is legal so I'm allowed to say where it is? I reside in the US btw"
Flower of Evil,"I played most RE games. They shine in the atmosphere and gameplay departments, not in plots and relationships. The story each game offers is at best entertaining without an emotional depth. 

Creating an amazing RE show will require you to create an amazing plot from scratch."
Flower of Evil,"There's more nuance here than what you imply. Last of Us was practically tailor-made to be adapted to live action. The thing is steeped in cinematic techniques. Some even criticize that aspect of it, saying games like that are too much like playable movies. It's something Hollywood can easily wrap its head around. As such it's no surprise that it made for a good (or at least faithful) adaptation."
Flower of Evil,"My brother in Umbrella Corp, are you really comparing the narrative source material of TLOU to Resident Evil?"
Flower of Evil,"The Last of Us video games are already extremely well written stories with well written characters that hold up against any other medium. Most video game stories, even the games that are known for their great stories, are not really amazing compared to other mediums. Most video game stories aren't anything special once you remove the gameplay and player agency from the equation. This is why game adaptations don't work very often."
Flower of Evil,I think the Last of Us proves that a video game should only follow the source material when the source material already plays like a movie.
Flower of Evil,"I thought Welcome to Raccoon City was alright. It was a stupid little Zombie flick, and I honestly don't expect much more from a RE adaptation.
Would I watch it a second time? Probs not. Did I have a good time looking for all the easter eggs? Definitely. (Now that I'm writing this I actually might rewatch it and turn the easter egg hunt into a drinking game lol)"
Flower of Evil,">  If anything, The Last of Us show has disproved any doubt that a video game adaptation needs to follow the SOURCE MATERIAL.

Not at all... there is plenty of shit source material that should NOT be translated to TV. 

Last of Us was already a good story that had to be adapted. Some games absolutely do not need to be remade shot for shot lol, especially half the resident evil games which had plots closer to a  bingo board.

If anything we need to ditch source material and just create new stories in established worlds. I already played the games, i know what happens - show us something new with new characters."
Flower of Evil,"This stems from 

A. Last of us has a practical Oscar winning script in a fucking game.

B. Resident evil has a literal by the books barely there storyline that has been shit on so many times and retconned alot of plot points later on.

Having said that I DO love the show but I have more complaints than I would like to have with the adaptation, but it IS comparatively better than any Resident evil movie adaptation by a long shot.

The cast of the show is great and can all act, but certain plot devices/story moments are taken in a different (not always good) direction imo.

Definitely a 9/10 tho for sure"
Flower of Evil,[deleted]
Flower of Evil,"To be fair, the last of us game gave the show a clear outline to follow when it comes to dialogue and story.  Resident Evil had the worst cutscene dialogue possible to adapt for tv or movies."
Flower of Evil,"People crap on that first movie, but they had to jettison ""authenticity"" to save the movie.

Romero's take was 100 times worse.

They made the protagonist a new character, because adapting Chris or Jill was not going to work back then.

Could it be done now? Maybe. But even the sequels screwed that up. Wentworth Miller tried so hard. :(

I remember at the time people complaining the UMBRELLA team were wearing STARS uniforms, but Umbrella would TOTALLY DO THAT.

The disappearing bodies were a fantastic joke about the original playstation's memory limitations.

Beyond that, any of the other stink was SONY. They've got more movie producers than talent."
Flower of Evil,I love the Resident Evil Movies.
Flower of Evil,"The Last of Us has much better source material, though. It was easier to adapt because it was already a cinematic experience. 

The more recent Resident Evils that are less action gameplay focused would be closer to The Last of Us in ease to adapt"
Flower of Evil,"Something to keep in mind is that Neil Druckman himself is directing the last of us series, whereas most video games IP gets sold off to big studios who have no idea wtf they’re doing and don’t actually like/care about the source material that much. RE movies had little to no interest in being congruent with the games, same with that monster hunter movie that was a weird isekai about us marines or something.?? Not a video game but shinichiro watanabe wasn’t involved in the Netflix adaptation of cowboy bebop at all and he says he couldn’t make it through the first episode lol

Edit: the Witcher show is another obvious example"
Flower of Evil,"It’s HBO, they could make a show from Pong and it would be good.  Though it does help that Last of Us is story driven."
Flower of Evil,"The Resident Evil games are written as campy, B-movie schlock early on. It's not on the same level of writing, game direction, and tone as The Last of Us

So a RE adaptation just does not have a strong enough source material as a foundation that would elevate it to prestige tv writing"
Flower of Evil,"The problem is TLOU has a phenomenal plot, dialogue and storyline. RE doesn't. RE is atmosphere, only."
Flower of Evil,"To be real most of the stories arent that great to translate into a movie. Something might be possible to make, but i feel if they did try again they do 7. Much smaller cast to have to write dialogue for, nothing super. And given the nature they have multiple types of villains and scares (you go from crazy hillbilly, insect queen, a hillbilly silence of the lamb, to psychological)."
Flower of Evil,[removed]
Flower of Evil,RE games don’t have good plots and need to be altered for adaptation. TLOU has a plot that could’ve won best picture and changing it would be risky.
Flower of Evil,"Last of Us already had a great story and characters, it was just a matter of finding a studio willing to pay what it would cost to create the world and a creative team with the talent to bring it to life, everything else is right there in the game. Resident Evil, on the other hand is still more than anything just an action survival horror video game with archetype characters and a storyline that revolves around solving puzzles and reading notes. A creative team can recreate the look of the locations and characters but everything else falls on them in scripting."
Flower of Evil,It makes me feel the opposite - now there’s a great model/template that other adaptations can follow if they want to be successful.
Flower of Evil,I wish they would have put more effort into Welcome to Racoon city. It was a lot closer to the games but the cast was bland and it had that low budget feel to it.
Flower of Evil,Two vastly different franchises
Flower of Evil,"I think you could make a great rec movie but you'd have to lean into the b movie aspects of the games, I think physical effects, paired down action would make a great re game.
That said I feel like silent Hill fans have been disrespected even worse, silent Hill 2 could make a great somber/serious horror film, but the movie lens into action and if I render correctly completely bungled the lore"
Flower of Evil,"I feel you, but RE is total Z-level horror shlock and proud of it. It's one of these games like the Mario ones, gameplay first, whatever plot late. Impossible to adapt, basically, whereas TLOU is the opposite"
Flower of Evil,"I don't wanna break it to you but narratively the Resident evil games are fuckin batshit and TLOU works because it's grounded and therefor the real visuals and humans acting it out works. 

For Resident Evil? Idk, a few of the stories are solid but a lot of the franchise is both narratively fuckin awful and so out there and ridiculous that they could never do SEASONS based on any of the later games.

And to also equally talk shit about TLOU. 

That game is a mid tier videogame cut in half by a solid movie that plays between levels and during some sequences they both happen. 

Most of TLOU is just PURE narrative and nothing else."
Flower of Evil,"I'm saying this as a fan of resident evil: these games from a story perspective are at their VERY best campy, shlocky, silly, stupid fun. An accurate Resident Evil adaptation would just about be a so-bad-its-good silly ass piece of crap, and in that regard the RE movies are JUST that, even if they're entirely inaccurate to the events of the games.

Now, I'm not saying you couldn't make a good RE movie- you could adapt Resident Evil 4 and just lean super hard into it being a campy spy movie (but with zombies). Cast Joel McHale as Leon and Nicholas Cage as Saddler, throw in some halfway decent action. I think you'd come out the other end with a watchable action movie. But trying to adapt the story of any of these games with even a modicum of seriousness is a highly misguided effort.

This is all in aid of saying: the story of The Last of Us has narrative weight, is told really well, and has enough depth that it could survive the change in medium while still allowing the shows creative team to express themselves. It's massive false equivalency to say that a Resident Evil TV show could have reached the heights of The Last of Us."
Flower of Evil,reisdent evil games are written like cheesy b-movies. the last of us was always written as a prestige hbo show. stop regurgitating this stupid bs.
Flower of Evil,"To be fair, TLOU (game) was written to be a much tighter narrative with themes, hooks and dilemmas both physical and moral.  RE1 was a shot at horror with some unintentional camp that took off into a franchise.  Adaptation for RE always had a pretty large margin for error, but yeah, it seems every major attempt has failed catastrophically, at least creatively.  I'm still pretty upset that Paul W.S. Anderson hasn't been publicly flogged for what he's done.
  The point is, TLOU was pretty much already written like a movie, adapting it for a theater or TV series wouldn't be difficult at all.
RE wasn't built like that, or even around the story at all, so pinning down what makes it amazing outside of the gameplay is kind of a losing proposition.  I still want a 1 to 1 screenplay for RE, just to see what that would look like."
Flower of Evil,Comparing any resident evil storyline to TLOU is a BIG stretch
Flower of Evil,RE source material is nothing even close to TLoU
Flower of Evil,When are people gonna understand its always been about the network. HBO respects source material and its showrunners WAY more than most.
Flower of Evil,"Far too often creatives feel like they NEED to put their own spin on something. Sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn’t."
Flower of Evil,"The problem is Last.of US was already acclaimed for a great story. Well told and already well shot as a game. It becomes easy to adapt when the game itself is story proto story board.

RE, never had a great story. Nothing extraordinary. And if you take a game IP and it already has a weak story then either you'll fail to create a new story worthy of the IP or make a half baked version of the same story and stretch it to movie time."
Flower of Evil,"...The characters and plot from Resident Evil games are ridiculous, though.

Also, TLOU show DOESN'T follow the source material fully. But the stuff they changed works well."
Flower of Evil,Resident Evil was and will always be a money machine.
Flower of Evil,it seems like Constantin Films has like a perpetual hold on that IP.
Flower of Evil,"Good stories make good series, if well executed.  

The primary reason that TLOU is engaging is that there was always a good story, and that the story is well-executed.  

I don’t think its success says anything about video game adaptation, other than proving something we should have already known- video games can be adapted into good series if there was always a good story in the game, and if the series is well-executed.  

My fear is that the takeaway will not be the simple truth above and instead will be “video games are ready for adaptation!” And we will be getting heavy promotion for poor adaptations of popular video games coming soon to Netflix and Amazon prime.

“Zac Efron stars as Toad in Mario Party: the series!”"
Flower of Evil,Isn't it because not all show producers actually like the source material?
Flower of Evil,They butchered the resident evil movies :(
Flower of Evil,"Garbage in, garbage out."
Flower of Evil,Amen
Flower of Evil,"I don't see why it's so difficult to make a faithful adaptation of the first game. It's almost like playing a movie, anyways."
Flower of Evil,"Ehh, have you seen the game's story? It's all corny, too. It was always destined to be a bad movie because it's about immersion and action, not good plot or believable characters."
Flower of Evil,"As a HUGE RE fan, it makes more sense to me that they fucked it up over and over again. TLOU has a compelling and dramatic story. RE has at its core a short mystery to solve and.... stuff to kill. So Hollywood turns it into an action poop-sock every chance they get bc theres no substance there. 

Now, could they make a suspenseful horror thriller of RE? Probably. But. Fuck."
Flower of Evil,"Idk, I feel like LoU was already a good story. That was basically half the work done. Then you gotta get good producers, casting, and sets and you’re golden. LoU is basically a cinematic for the show, like the ones for Marvel movies. I mean, take the game away and the story is fine."
Flower of Evil,"Meh, RE and TLOU are a different genre. TLOU is way more narrative based than RE that relies on a different narrative, based on the environment and atmosphere."
Flower of Evil,TLOU is an example for all other video game adaptations to follow
Flower of Evil,"I always thought resident evil would work as a television show, if they did it mini series style. Resident evil zero is one mini series, then the next, and so on. It could be action packed and not need a ton of subplot."
Flower of Evil,Video games will be the next comic books. Resident Evil will be rebooted and done right don’t you fret. Hollywood is desperate for known source material.
Flower of Evil,"The last of us makes all other video game adaptation look like they were made by people unaware that they existed as good stories in a different mediums. 

I also think its really disrespectful to all the storytellers in video games and the gamers who love them to change the source material so much that what made it cool to begin with, completly gets lost. 

Halo was imo, the most disgraceful thing to happen to video game adaptations since the super mario brothers movie and microtransactions.  

Hopefully going foward, the last of us can teach filmmakers that the apeal of video game storys translates to gamers and non gamers alike because a good story is a good story regardless of medium.  I hope its not just wishful thinking on my part."
Flower of Evil,"I don't see why everyone is so amazed that the last of us is being adapted so well. TLOU is a story first and a game built around that. Adapting older games/franchises is a lot harder than ""just follow the source material"" when most of the source material is gameplay. How do you adapt a game where the majority is running around a house solving puzzles and shooting zombies. There is barely a story in the first 3 RE games that would make for an interesting film."
Flower of Evil,"Resident evil wasn't an adaption, it was a dumb show with the name resident evil slapped on"
Flower of Evil,"Its because idiots who dont play the games write and make them...

Still puzzles me when writers say they dont like the source material they are adapting.  I think this happened on netflixs witcher and Henry had to argue with the writers over their versions of the story...

What the fuck are those people doing in those positions?"
Flower of Evil,[deleted]
Flower of Evil,It’s because Netflix is a shit stain company that shouldn’t be given adaptions
Flower of Evil,The resident evil games are cheesy and the plot is dumb. The movies stay true to that
Flower of Evil,"I wish Resident Evil fans (of which I am a massive one) will soon realize the strengths of RE as a franchise is in it's interactivity. 

The characters and plots are paper thin and redundant, because they're all riffs on pop-culture.

No, a spooky mansion with two heroic super-cop characters unraveling a corporate conspiracy with zombies and mutants doesn't exactly have a lot of depth outside of actually playing it, where it's one of the best survival horror games ever made. 

A faithful movie would just be a pale imitation of the media that inspired it, and the general population would know it, sure maybe hardcore fans would enjoy it, but I don't think most people would be very jazzed about a generic slow burn haunted house with zombies flick, the market is already completely oversaturated with lame entries.

As for characters in the series...lets see....Jill Valentine, super swat cop, no real character traits to speak of other than ""hot"". Chris Redfield, super swat cop....yeahh...kind of drawing another blank here. Barry Burton, another swat cop....defining character trait? He uhh...likes guns? Albert Wesker, cartoonish comic book villain who moonlights as a super swat cop. I love these characters, us fans love these characters, but they are as thin as they come.

Last of us didn't require extensive retooling, Joel, Ellie, Tess, Marlene, every character in the game really have strong writing, strong motives, strong character traits, strong personalities and situations they go through that already presented itself well for cinematic dramatization.

For RE to work as a movie you're undoubtedly going to piss of fans, maybe Chris is a recovering alcoholic, maybe Jill has PTSD from some unseen STARS raid that she has to overcome throughout the story, they would HAVE to inject some clearly out of character drama because there is absolutely nothing to their characters, the only way for it to work is to turn it into something that it's not, which is what has happened for 7 terrible films and a terrible netflix series. Or you can be faithful to the paper thin characters and watch 3 terrible CG films and a terrible cg netflix show, it's almost as if Resident Evil removed from it's game context has absolutely nothing worth portraying in other media."
Flower of Evil,"The Last of Us is probably the perfect candidate for adaptation to tv. It’s basically a playable movie already with an excellent story. Also they got the perfect people involved with Druckmann from Naughty Dog so it stays in touch with the games, and Mazin who is a brilliant screenwriter and knows how to create a post apocalyptic atmosphere.

Basically they used the right game and got the right people."
Flower of Evil,The Welcome to Racoon City movie was really good. Characters and situations from the games. Better than all the Jojovich movies and the Netflix series combined. I hope they make more movies since they ended with a mid credit cliff hanger.
Flower of Evil,"TLOU actually kind of makes me angry lol. Because it shows how absolutely simple in concept approaching an adaptation is - *just respect the damn source material*. 

The MCU has been showing us this for *15 years,* and we're still getting garbage like Resident Evil.

So much potential down the drain over the years."
Flower of Evil,"Just about every other live, video game adaptation should be absolutely embarrassed by what TLOU is doing. 

If Paramount had any sense at all, they'd take the Halo series' entire preproduction and writing crew, shoot them into the sun, and reboot that POS."
Flower of Evil,"""Have been straight up abused""...

First World abuse, they didn't make my tv program the same as the game."
Flower of Evil,"as it is with books. it really is not difficult to create a successful show if you stay close to the source material.

harry potter did it, game of thrones did it before they chose their own way. and with computer games it is just like that. people have fond memories of these source materials. then fucking respect that source material! look at the witcher, look at wheels of time, look at the lord of the rings tv series. all fucking trash. now look at sonic the hedgehog another succes. why because they respect the source material!

 that is why i can not comprehend how you can fuck it up so badly every time. stay close to the source material. easy peasy!"
Flower of Evil,"Resident Evil, Halo, Wheel of Time, Witcher, the one thing all these shit shows have in common is idiot writers who thought they could do better than the source material they were hired for. Hopefully Hollywood looks at the success of Last of Us and House of the Dragon and finally takes a hint"
Flower of Evil,"Or Witcher, or Rings of Power. Such a cool stories completely butchered by woke show runners"
Flower of Evil,"I think I’m the only one who preferred Resident Evil. 

It was camp, it was over the top, it was ridiculous- but it was different and it was fun. 

To me, TLOU feels like a less impressive version of what I’ve already seen in the game. The show feels like what we’ve already seen a million times in The Walking Dead."
Flower of Evil,You’ve basically retracted from your whole post in this comment lol
Flower of Evil,"I will just say this. “The Last of Us” has had over 20yrs of being able to look at Resident Evil and all the other adaptations/etc and evolve, which is something I would expect all shows or movies to do compared to others made decades ago. They’ve still been making Resident Evil movies over the years but they were already in that identity so it is what it is. Raccoon City was decent but it’s only the one ya know. This is like saying the NBA today makes me sad about how NBA was back in the 60s or something. If we’re comparing these athletes to those athletes…today will always look way better. These showrunners are looking at horror related things, looking at Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, all these shows that have been fairly big too."
Flower of Evil,"And Halo is off to a great start for that ""abusing""  lawl. What makes it worse is the time from the simple idea of ""what would a live action adaptation look like?"" We got....this.  Somehow season 2 was greenlit, but I expect nothing less from the studio that allowed the abomination and absolutely unneeded series, Star Trek Picard.

I honestly keep forgetting Resident Evil got a TV ""adaptation.""  My head is still remembering the moviecircle jerks. We had WAY too many, people!"
Flower of Evil,"This is the quality difference between HBO and Netflix.

There was a time when Netflix originals were on par with HBO's originals, but not anymore. They're mostly just trash now."
Flower of Evil,Sonic the hedgehog was surprisingly good too
Flower of Evil,I am sad about how utterly the potential of Witcher book adaptation was destroyed so I feel your pain
Flower of Evil,"The Resident Evil storyline isn’t exactly breaking new ground. It’s not the strongest thing the franchise has going for it. The Last of Us on the other hand, has a critically acclaimed story that seemed, 10 years ago, to be ripped out of an HBO show only to later become that very thing."
Flower of Evil,"What do you mean, did you not like the inclusion and diversity in the shitty series? I mean that's what makes a series great right?"
Flower of Evil,"People highly overrated the RE games, especially the original game which was objectively terrible in almost every way. The movies are garbage but it's not like the source material is some sort of masterpiece"
Flower of Evil,Mila jovovich and her husband seem to have the rights and butcher it everytime.
Flower of Evil,"Resident Evil IP is not TLoU IP. It can return in many different forms and made by someone else than netflix.

For me the first movie is the best... the focus is on zombies and horror, it's got great atmosphere, cool action scenes (not over the top like in later films) and awesome soundtrack."
Flower of Evil,Dude. You're 13 and probably never played RE1. You're attacking windmills here.
Flower of Evil,The only thing about RE I liked was seeing glimpses of Cape Town.
Flower of Evil,"Tbf, TLOU has much better characters and stories to adapt than resident evil.






We can leave resi as games, their stories aren't good enough to be actually good films or shows, unless they're were to be very loose adaptions."
Flower of Evil,"A well written game gets a good adaptation. I LOOOVE the RE games, but the writing is always a mess."
Flower of Evil,"I’d be interested in seeing the RE7/RE8 storyline with the Winters translated to tv. 

It’s fairly easy to isolate it from the rest of the lore, and if it works out you could pick up more from there."
Flower of Evil,"Yeah

Maybe Netflix witty hire real writers next time snd try"
Flower of Evil,* cries in Witcher *
Flower of Evil,I like some the RE titles.   At their best they are nothing but mindless entertainment but not just anyone can make films like these.   If TLOU has more depth then good for HBO but the RE films have a place in many bluray collections.
Flower of Evil,The first RE was really good
Flower of Evil,"In 2-3 years HBO will be looking for the next video game to bring to the screen, so maybe then?"
Flower of Evil,"Early RE games don’t have the necessary plot length to handle a TV show. Even when Capcom wrote their own movies (and oversaw Vendetta and Infinite Darkness) they preferred original stories set within the same universe.

An RE1 adaptation for instance would need heavy alteration to work even as a movie. The event itself lasts about 10 hours (late night to dawn), so an 8 hour TV show would have to cut away from the mansion as much as possible to avoid dead air. Characters rarely interact in RE1, and the cast is mostly dead - Romero added more STARS members to fill this gap in his adaptation. You could save time by having the Mansion Incident itself happen late in Episode 2 with the Helicopter setting off Episode 1 - use footage of monster attacks, the RPD investigation and Umbrella to pad those two out.

Final issue is the VFX- most of the monsters in RE1 will have to be done in CG. I asked the VFX artist Kevin Lingenfelser if he thought a movie could be done on a $40 mil budget (the lower budget RE movies) — very conditional on a producer and director who are experts at cost-cutting and are fine on a low salary. For a director you’re looking at Jonathan “Two Takes” Frakes if no one knew he existed.

TL;DR - early RE games are not good sources to adapt from faithfully (RE5, sure), and the VFX budget would have to be big to use all the monsters as needed."
Flower of Evil,"The most recent movie from last year was so close to being faithful, but still failed.

Their biggest mistake was thinking they can cram the events of both Resident Evil 1 and 2 into a single 1hr 47m movie taking place simultaneously without the possibility of Resident Evil 3 and Nemesis..

One day I'm sure we'll finally get a true adaptation."
Flower of Evil,"HBO >>>>>> Netflix  
  
Cancel your Netflix subscription"
Flower of Evil,I’ve seen a couple people say this but the RE games are completely different than TLOU and are pretty different to adapt. TLOU is an extremely detailed and textured character study and morality play. RE is more of a horror situation you are experiencing. You would need to create a ton of new story/characters for RE that you just don’t have to for TLOU. That’s true for most other potential video game adaptations as well
Flower of Evil,"I haven't seen the Resident Evil show but regarding the embarrassment that are the movies, I've always found it cynically funny that the director of the first movie said he was a ""fan of the games"". such an absolute bullshit statement to immortalize into pop culture"
Flower of Evil,"The Last Of Us outclasses Resident Evil from a narrative point of view. It's had such a successful adaptation because the source material is already well-written enough that it is easily adapted. 

If you take and adapt the Resident Evil source material, you get a campy b-movie horror. There's nothing wrong with that, but that's all it's going to amount to. 

If you were to stick even more closely to the source material of Resident Evil as you suggest, it would probably be even worse as you'd have cheesy videogame trope villains and protagonists that don't translate well to a passive medium."
Flower of Evil,"It feels like a company gets a pitch from a writer for a brand new IP and they get turned down, but the company doesnt want to lose the writer so they go ""well, we just got the rights to this popular video game IP, do you want to be showrunner?"". Then that writer out of petty spite decides to write their trash ip in the good ips skin instead. Most of the trashy tv shows based on VGs ive seen have actively admitted they never played the games.

Either that or theyre too egocentric and would never admit that video games are a form of art in themselves and not just something that losers do."
Flower of Evil,"The Last of US TV Show - some changes from the original but manages to keep the theme and follow the story of the game, at least based on the first two episodes shown. Characters are great, acting's great, location's great, it's very entertaining.

Netflix Resident Evil - important main hero characters are not present, villain got race swapped and his entire persona got changed, he was given two daughters who then proceed to deal with real world social justice issues, the zombies don't attack the daughters even when they surround them in order to allow 1 vs 1 combat, main character is super unlikeable as if she was written to make the viewers angry and there's so much more wrong about the show.

Look, I prefer adaptations of games to follow the source strictly, but The Last of Us showed that it is possible to make some changes while still making the show highly entertaining. I just hope not all adaptations will make changes to whatever they're doing just for the sake of making changes."
Investiture of the Gods,Up until they said Korea I had no idea which systemic religious sex crimes they were going to expose. Keep 'em comin'!
Investiture of the Gods,"10 years for three rapes, release, and subsequent rape..."
Investiture of the Gods,Thought this was going to be about the moonies.
Investiture of the Gods,"Aside from the documentary, I’d love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That’s a documentary all to itself."
Investiture of the Gods,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
Investiture of the Gods,"I’m not sensitive at all, I eat up horror and documentaries about uncomfortable topics, but this one is very brutally straight forward.

Like, there’s no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
Investiture of the Gods,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family’s involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea’s search engine. Creepy stuff."
Investiture of the Gods,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
Investiture of the Gods,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
Investiture of the Gods,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It’s the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more “man of God” using the scriptures to literally screw children."
Investiture of the Gods,"OMG!!! I’m actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
Investiture of the Gods,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
Investiture of the Gods,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they’re trying to hide.
Investiture of the Gods,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
Investiture of the Gods,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
Investiture of the Gods,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
Investiture of the Gods,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
Investiture of the Gods,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
Investiture of the Gods,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
Investiture of the Gods,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
Investiture of the Gods,Reverend Moon?
Investiture of the Gods,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
Investiture of the Gods,Cool now do the Catholics of America
Investiture of the Gods,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
Investiture of the Gods,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
Investiture of the Gods,Religious people be like: “come to our church so we can molest u”
Investiture of the Gods,Do jehovah's witnesses next
Investiture of the Gods,IMHO I can’t wait for all organized religion to die…. The harm it’s caused far outweighs any good.
Investiture of the Gods,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
Investiture of the Gods,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
Investiture of the Gods,Will this involves the moonies?
Investiture of the Gods,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
Investiture of the Gods,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
Investiture of the Gods,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
Investiture of the Gods,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
Investiture of the Gods,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
Investiture of the Gods,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
Investiture of the Gods,The world is really fucked up.
Investiture of the Gods,">3rd March

btw"
Investiture of the Gods,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we’re sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to “evangelize” people. It’s flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a “devil” to bring down the “will of God”. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
Investiture of the Gods,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
Investiture of the Gods,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
Investiture of the Gods,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
Investiture of the Gods,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
Investiture of the Gods,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn’t want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn’t true - it’s disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn’t see anyone else mention it."
Investiture of the Gods,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It’s a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
Investiture of the Gods,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
Investiture of the Gods,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
Investiture of the Gods,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
Investiture of the Gods,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don’t care about some “leaders” in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
Investiture of the Gods,Netflix sucks haha
Investiture of the Gods,[removed]
Investiture of the Gods,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
Investiture of the Gods,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
Investiture of the Gods,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
Investiture of the Gods,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
Investiture of the Gods,"I say, do the USA next!"
Investiture of the Gods,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
Investiture of the Gods,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
Investiture of the Gods,Reminds me of “silenced” about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
Investiture of the Gods,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
Investiture of the Gods,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
Investiture of the Gods,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
Investiture of the Gods,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
Investiture of the Gods,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
Investiture of the Gods,Name?
Investiture of the Gods,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
Investiture of the Gods,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
Investiture of the Gods,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary 😌
Investiture of the Gods,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
Investiture of the Gods,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
Investiture of the Gods,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
Investiture of the Gods,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
Investiture of the Gods,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a “virtue”
Investiture of the Gods,"Reminds me of Tool’s song, ‘Opiate’"
Investiture of the Gods,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
Investiture of the Gods,Is this related to the unity Church?
Investiture of the Gods,That’s what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
Investiture of the Gods,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
Investiture of the Gods,just put the CC on then
Investiture of the Gods,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
Investiture of the Gods,"I can’t do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
Investiture of the Gods,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
Investiture of the Gods,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
Investiture of the Gods,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
Investiture of the Gods,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
Investiture of the Gods,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
Investiture of the Gods,Then do a series. All American religions.
Investiture of the Gods,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
Investiture of the Gods,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
Investiture of the Gods,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?
Investiture of the Gods,"*Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey* and *the Keepers* are both pretty interesting"
Investiture of the Gods,"Give Jesus Camp a watch if you haven’t already, gave me some un-invited flashbacks."
Investiture of the Gods,"Dude, delete this. There are tons of documentaries on US evangelicals and the shit they get into.  This just shows you're too lazy to look before posting."
Investiture of the Gods,The only problem with that is that its too many documentaries too little time to make them. They already have a small mountain. The supply overtakes production regardless of demand.
Investiture of the Gods,🙃
Investiture of the Gods,Well it’s made by Netflix so I’m gonna assume no
Investiture of the Gods,You showed them.
Investiture of the Gods,The interviews are all real. The one being followed is so stressed out later she is puking on camera in a cup on the way to a press conference.
Investiture of the Gods,There's actually a ton of them.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"This show was really bizarre tonally. A lot of it feels like target audience is supposed to be pre-teen, but then there random interjections of surprisingly crude/sexual comments feels like it would distance that audience somewhat. 

I think it tried to be a show for both 12 year olds and 30 year olds and the writing failed at both"
Fate: The Winx Saga,The 2nd season sucked
Fate: The Winx Saga,"It really was a terribly written show but I do admit I watched every episode lol, kind of like hate watching but also kinda guilty pleasure."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Did it end on a cliffhanger?
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Netflix is really good at promoting their shows to me through cancellation headlines. 

Interesting strategy."
Fate: The Winx Saga,The original Winx Club is hard to live up to.
Fate: The Winx Saga,The first season was ok. The second not so much.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"It was in a bit of a strange place thematically. Alternatively, ""The bastard son of the devil himself"" fits the same niche but has more interesting world building."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Forget the 27 club. I think the Netflix 2 season club has the higher count.

I heard it's because of how they do their contracts"
Fate: The Winx Saga,I mean that show was not good at all. The writers needed to pick a demographic
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Season 2 was shite. So yeah, I don't feel anything about this"
Fate: The Winx Saga,This is why you don’t end a season without wrapping up the major plot points. Unless you are already renewed.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I don’t know why they thought that making the show oddly sexual was a good idea, no one thinks of sex when they think of winx club"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"W.I.T.C.H is the superior ""magical girls show that starts with W"" anyways. Though it's almost completely forgotten..."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I really liked it. There's a place for light-hearted shows which allow you to switch off and enjoy the spectacle. 

I do wish streaming services would commit to a certain number of seasons so things don't end on cliff hangers."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I’m a bit surprised they did not give this show a final season. It did around 25 million equivalent complete viewings in its first month. Not great but definitely not bad and I doubt this was an overly expensive show. 

Seems anything under 30 million (with a few exceptions) is going to get cancelled at Netflix. 

I’ll miss this one. It was utter nonsense but still a fun YA fantasy series."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I thought this was quite fun. It wasn’t “good” by objective metrics, but it did a fine job of scratching my 10 year long Percy Jackson itch. I could’ve used another season to wrap it up, but any more than that would’ve been a tad egregious."
Fate: The Winx Saga,The second season was SOOOOO BORING AND FUZZY. It makes no sense. The writer needs to never get any work again
Fate: The Winx Saga,I never watched this show but I am at the stage where I really ask myself if there is any point beginning to watch a Netflix show anymore just so they can cancel it after 1-3 seasons max.
Fate: The Winx Saga,fuck you all!! it was my guilty pleasure. :(
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Netflix needs to start providing alternative endings to all their cliffhanger shows, cause at this stage its 50:50 if we’ll ever find out."
Fate: The Winx Saga,That dang ‘ol 2 season netflix curse!
Fate: The Winx Saga,Hopefully they'll do a Beatrix Trouple spinoff
Fate: The Winx Saga,I’m somewhat not surprised because season 1 was decent watch but it didn’t last
Fate: The Winx Saga,Netflix - the place where shows come to die.
Fate: The Winx Saga,I liked the first season but the second season I didn’t even go past the 3rd episode.
Fate: The Winx Saga,This should’ve been a perfect show for me but I couldn’t get into season 2. So something was definitely off. Just felt uninspiring for me to binge.
Fate: The Winx Saga,My wife watched it because she was a fan of the cartoon when she was a kid. She did not care for this version
Fate: The Winx Saga,Never heard of it.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"2nd season finale spoilers from the article.

>!Fate‘s seven-episode second season ended with a series of game-changing reveals for Bloom — including that she was put in stasis as a baby 1,000 years ago — which sent her on a new mission into the Realm of Darkness, where she finally encountered the woman who gave birth to her more than a century ago.!<

>!Additional finale twists included Aisha processing that Grey is actually a blood witch, which is a dealbreaker no matter how many Speedos he wears; Terra, who recently came out as gay, beginning a new relationship with Kat; and Beatrix sacrificing her life in the battle against Sebastian, only for the Shadow to seemingly resurrect her.!<

One of these things is not like the others."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Ohh I have been getting crazy with want to express my dislike at this show… just plain didn’t like it , the MC … sorry to say (not) but just couldn’t get behind her acting , the utter stupidness and selfishness of her character was a huge turn off. In general not sorry that is getting cancelled. Shadow and bone was 10x better cast wise and talent wise . Thank you"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Indistinguishable from Shadow & Bone, The Bastard Son and the Devil Himself and so many other shows when scrolling through Netflix.

Their release and content model is so strange."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Here's to hoping they keep that axe far away from Shadow & Bone. Would hate to see an actually good show get the axe, whilst dribble like The Witcher keeps trucking along."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Not surprised. I liked season one, but honestly couldn’t tell you if I finished the second one or not. Probably didn’t, but either way, not memorable."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"GOOD! They literally butchered everything about it from casting, to story line, and wardrobe. Winx Club already had a decent plot going for it in its earlier seasons, all they had to do was make it a bit more mature (by nature I don’t mean sh*t like sex scenes or dumb ass drama). Also why tf did they make almost the entire cast British?!? 😭 so much potential, but they missed the mark by a lot."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I liked season 1 but didn’t care enough to come back to Netflix for season 2 

Can’t say I blame them"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I actually just watched the first two episodes last week. Got pulled off to watch other things, so I guess it didn't suck me in.

Probably won't continue it now that I know its been canned."
Fate: The Winx Saga,If only it had a more stupid name. Maybe that would have helped.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I dropped out about 3 episodes into season 2. It felt like I was watching something completely different, and just felt super disjointed and hokey,"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Good.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I remember liking the first season, had no idea what was going on in the 2nd season."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Never even heard of it
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Nooo. I'm sad now. I really liked this show just for an excuse to zone out of the real world. 

I always like the shows that get canceled  so this is the story of my life 🙃"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Never should’ve made a second one. Could’ve been an amazing adaptation of the cartoon, but they fucked it up by making magic an afterthought and primarily focusing on boring, badly written drama."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Why tf would they want to cancel such an amazing show?!?

This is completely unfair!

Did it ever occur to them to do even the SLIGHTEST bit of advertising? Bc there is an entire horde of people out here who are fantasy/sci-fi fans.

Netflix... i gotta tell you, I only signed back up for Fate. 
I will be canceling my subscription yet again. 
I hope you go out of business! Bc you deserve it."
Fate: The Winx Saga,What a way to leave us hanging. The show had it’s good points. The main actress made hella stupid choices. But wow. To cancel the show at this juncture is sadistic.
Fate: The Winx Saga,Somehow I watched the first season. The second season I couldn’t even make it through episode 1.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Stop making ""light"" IPs that use jokes to take themself seriously dark and gritty for no reason beside Christofer Nolan, The Batman was about Bruce coming out of the dark and throwing the agnst.

I wander how long until Paramount+ will do their own Winx show."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Noooooooo!!!
Fate: The Winx Saga,Not surprised after season 2
Fate: The Winx Saga,Uuu do Witcher next...after season 3.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"It really felt like a CW show the second season. I’m usually one who complains Netflix cancelled shows too quickly, but this one was getting tough to watch."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Nooooooooooo
Fate: The Winx Saga,Another guilty pleasure gone forever
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Awww. That’s a shame. It was okay.

At least it didnt end on a cliff hanger."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Nooooooo I loved watching this show. It will be truly missed.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"dang

usually they let them get to the 2.5 season mark before letting them go"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Did they ever explain why they couldn’t use guns?
Fate: The Winx Saga,this show looked terrible
Fate: The Winx Saga,I was disappointed when I found out it wasn't about a legendary racehorse
Fate: The Winx Saga,With a name like that im surprised it didnt get cancelled after one
Fate: The Winx Saga,I think it’s for the best…
Fate: The Winx Saga,"As I never watched the original winx, I loved thisssss"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Not surprised, season 2 was pretty lame"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Not surprised the second season was really cheesy.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"The show was very silly, but for some reason it was quite fun to watch.  It seemed like it had good viewership numbers so I thought it would get more seasons."
Fate: The Winx Saga,My Japanese gf called this cheap Harry Potter lol
Fate: The Winx Saga,I liked the main actress so hopefully she and the woman who plays Star Girl go onto bigger and better things
Fate: The Winx Saga,"First season didn’t exactly miss in my opinion I was drawn in excited for the story to develope and common magic is always cool. But two episodes into the next season I was lost. Too many questions. And not enough just enjoyment of watching something unfold. It was
Extremely rushed and the script was hallow and lacked the actors even understanding the story itself."
Fate: The Winx Saga,"First season looked like it appealed to mature audiences, second seadon one pure teen show. I hated 2 nd season"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"At a time not very far in the future. Next News:  
**‘The Witcher’ Cancelled at Netflix After 4 Seasons**"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Sigh knew it was gonna happen, season 2 was really awful. Like the whole CGI thing with transforming at the end reminded me of shamalans avatar movie."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Netflix and their half-ass originals. Pffft
Fate: The Winx Saga,The abrupt actress change really didn't help the show.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"That’s terrible.

What is Fate: The Winx Saga?"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Get ready for Sandman next
Fate: The Winx Saga,Who’s hearing about this show for the first time because of this article?
Fate: The Winx Saga,never heard of it. i mean i know the original cartoon but i'm not surprised this failed.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"(Insert show) Cancelled at Netflix after (Insert season(s))

This happens so often I canceled them months upon months ago."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Another intellectual property damaged by netflix
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Wow, two seasons of “I’ve never heard of it” cancelled?!"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Damn it. Me and le wife enjoyed this show.
Fate: The Winx Saga,">	cancelled after 2 seasons

As is Netflix tradition"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Good riddance! 

How bout next time you actually cast someone Asian for Musa"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Terrible name for a show.
Fate: The Winx Saga,Oh thank goodness
Fate: The Winx Saga,I really really enjoyed the first two episodes watched with my mom and dad. They don't like fantasy but they can get this. Loved silva. I watched the cartoon when I was young and I have to say the live action was different but I a good way.  Not..kid like
Fate: The Winx Saga,The what saga?
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Waiting for ""The Witcher"" cancelled after 4 seasons."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Good. They probably wondering why it fail. It should be more successful than the owl house. Because according to people online like midnight edge animation is use to be one giant toy ads like in the eighties. Maybe this show fail and the owl succeed because the owl house takes risk while fate is playing it safe and according to alt right not “woke”
Fate: The Winx Saga,Im shocked
Fate: The Winx Saga,Never watched it bc they cut out my girl Tecna
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Oh no, anyway"
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Should have been a W.I.T.C.H series. Winx is still way too wholesome for trying a ""darker"" version. Go bubble mode and make it colorful or just do something else, this in between version was something that no one could really get behind."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Is that about standard for Netflix ?
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Good riddance, I love fantasy but this show was a steaming pile."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Oh no! Anyway…
Fate: The Winx Saga,"Good

(Puts on flame proof* armor)

*Statement not yet confirmed"
Fate: The Winx Saga,I got really bored like 3 episodes in.
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I'd be interested in how things would have gone at Netflix if they had a policy that every show always qualified for a final season, but the showrunner was required to bring things to a (hopefully satisfying) conclusion and wasn't allowed to leave things open and angle for another season. Just a whole streaming service of complete shows instead a streaming service of 7% complete shows and 93% shows that end on an unsatisfying cliffhanger after 1 or 2 seasons."
Cromartie High School,I totally enjoyed the absurd humor that this series pushed.
Cromartie High School,It’s a high school just for children of Anthony Cromartie.
Cromartie High School,This song plays in my head whenever I walk down a hallway.
Cromartie High School,This show had me almost in tears laughing.
Cromartie High School,Really funny show.
Cromartie High School,Absolutely!
Cromartie High School,I was pleasantly surprised with this anime. I wasn't expecting much but ended up enjoying it a lot.
Cromartie High School,"I was only planning on linking to the playlist and giving a brief description, and then this somehow happened. If you can't tell, I've been really enjoying this show lol."
Cromartie High School,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
Cromartie High School,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
Cromartie High School,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
Cromartie High School,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
Cromartie High School,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
Cromartie High School,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
Cromartie High School,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
Cromartie High School,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
Cromartie High School,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
Cromartie High School,"""Adulting"""
Cromartie High School,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
Cromartie High School,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
Cromartie High School,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
Cromartie High School,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
Cromartie High School,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
Cromartie High School,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
Cromartie High School,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
Cromartie High School,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
Cromartie High School,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
Cromartie High School,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
Cromartie High School,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
Cromartie High School,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
Cromartie High School,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
Cromartie High School,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
Cromartie High School,as a nonactor me too.
Cromartie High School,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
Cromartie High School,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
Cromartie High School,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
Cromartie High School,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
Cromartie High School,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
Cromartie High School,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
Cromartie High School,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
Cromartie High School,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
Cromartie High School,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
Cromartie High School,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
Cromartie High School,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
Cromartie High School,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
Cromartie High School,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
Cromartie High School,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
Cromartie High School,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
Cromartie High School,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
Cromartie High School,This whole sub has just become ads lol
Cromartie High School,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
Cromartie High School,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
Cromartie High School,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
Cromartie High School,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
Cromartie High School,You forgot *Hey Dude*
Cromartie High School,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
Cromartie High School,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
Cromartie High School,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
Cromartie High School,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
Cromartie High School,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
Cromartie High School,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
Cromartie High School,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
Cromartie High School,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."
Cromartie High School,Drake Bell doesn't care for an adult version.
Cromartie High School,Definitely ready for that word to die.
Cromartie High School,yippee yippee yeehaw!!!
Cromartie High School,"And they always mean incredibly basic things like doing laundry and paying bills. Never the tough things like fighting with the insurance company to cover cancer treatment, trying to get speech therapy for your kid, or caring for a disabled parent."
Cromartie High School,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
Cromartie High School,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
Cromartie High School,I’m glad someone said it.
Cromartie High School,Coconut Head?
Cromartie High School,Who?
Cromartie High School,posting this and not saying the name?
Cromartie High School,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
Cromartie High School,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
Cromartie High School,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
Cromartie High School,The Internet is ads
Cromartie High School,Always was
Cromartie High School,"Well, what else is there to do here ?

I prefer those ads over people bootlicking Netflix execs."
Cromartie High School,This is a podcast about adult life not a rewatch podcast but agreed
Cromartie High School,The short lived Aliens in America too.
Cromartie High School,She also made one of my favorite games of all time: Enslaved. Great part alongside Andy Serkins.
Cromartie High School,She was also in Suburgatory for a few episodes
Cromartie High School,She also did a great performance as Trip in the video game Enslaved. Did motion capture for it and everything.
Cromartie High School,She had a role in the Twilight movies as well.
Cromartie High School,"Such a shame. It feels like a no brainer for new content, but I guess Nick doesn't feel the same way."
Cromartie High School,"Something about it just grinds my gears. It's like internet speak to me, I'd react the same way if someone actually said LOL in real life."
Cromartie High School,"Wish I Was Here was a solid movie, but I don't know why I needed to fund it."
Cromartie High School,"This is where the minor celebrity comes in. If he can come up with a pitchable product like a movie, he can try doing a Kickstarter and use his fame to promote the Kickstarter."
Cromartie High School,100%...i need to binge this show eventually. I'm currently watching 3 long as shows right now though...
Cromartie High School,"The internet is for ads  
The Internet is for ads  
Why’d you think the Net was had?  
Ads, ads, ads"
Cromartie High School,Am..I an ad???
Cromartie High School,"Lmao what do you mean ""she made?"" She isn't a game dev lol"
Cromartie High School,I really don’t understand why not. Just put it on Paramount+. The iCarly reboot seemed to get a decent amount of buzz.
Cromartie High School,To me it's the idea that being an adult is like being at a job. Something that's inconvenient but you have to do it to live. No you are an adult 24/7 start acting like it
Cromartie High School,"Yeah, but even that's a stretch. 

Devon hasn't acted in much of anything in years, so having a crowd-funded project would be much harder for him than it was for Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels."
Cromartie High School,ok work avenue q
Cromartie High School,">	Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels.

God, I’m so excited about that kickstarter. I backed at the highest tier and am waiting on my first delivery."
Cromartie High School,I'm not convinced that Sanderson is actually human. I'm pretty sure that he--and John Ringo for that matter--are robots who write and do not sleep.
Cromartie High School,Adrian Tchaikovsky too.
Im Home,i thought the story was that it was cancelled *during* the 1st episode while it was airing ? 
Im Home,[deleted]
Im Home,They literally started the series with a round of applause for Hitler. 
Im Home,nobody Goebbeled that up?
Im Home,"Isn't it still rumored that there is more than the pilot floating around out there?

I would honestly watch the hell out of a limited series like this. Especially if they turned the camp up to 11. A self-mocking series parodying 80's and 90's sitcoms with a 'funny' and constantly shit on fuhrer as the lead? Sign me up."
Im Home,There were a lot of REALLY bizarre shows and movies from the 90s that practically no one remembers.
Im Home,"This comes on after Roseanne, right?"
Im Home,So someone tried making Springtime For Hitler into a syndicated series.
Im Home,[deleted]
Im Home,I remember seeing this video one time awhile ago and always passed it off as a fever dream or something 
Im Home,Hogan's Heroes on steroids
Im Home,"All I can think of is Bojack Horseman when Princess Caroline wanted to get Cate Blanchett to star in an Eva Braun movie and Quentin ""Tarantulino"" wanted to turn it into a romantic comedy. All these kind of people, but in *real life*."
Im Home,I found out about this not very long ago and I couldn't believe my eyes. It's such an out there idea. The episode wasn't bad either. I'd watch more episodes if they existed.
Im Home,">In unseen episodes the Hitlers plot to murder their Jewish neighbours.

O_O"
Im Home,A few friends and I tried to watch this pilot the other night. It’s... *bad.* Like even in the scenes without Hitler (Who has a NY accent btw). We didn’t even finish the first ten minutes before it stopped being ironically funny. 
Im Home,"I can see why a satire like this wouldn’t fly and would piss people off,
but I can also see a show like this nowadays written as a smart poke at sitcoms.

I mean they’d have to be really really careful about it but I can see it happening."
Im Home,"Welp, turns out waiting just 45 years after someone methodically murdered millions IS too soon to make a sitcom about him....who knew..."
Im Home,How did I Nazi this when it aired?
Im Home,Why do they have American accents? Lmao
Im Home,"Possibly the worst thing I’ve ever seen.







**I want more**"
Im Home,When will they reboot this?
Im Home,It's also not just that this show was dumb and in bad taste but it legitimately is pretty mediocre with some lame puns and run of the mill sitcom humor.
Im Home,remember when they arrested a guy for making a video where his dog did a nazi salute? Amazing to think 20 years earlier that same country had a comedy show about hitler and eva braun. How did nazi's become MORE offensive as time went on? Usually the offense starts severe and tapers off. Then again that same country did just throw a guy in prison for live streaming content near a court house.
Im Home,This would have been alright as maybe a 1-3 part sketch on something like MadTV but actually trying to create a whole season of a show around one joke is asking for a lot.
Im Home,this shit was ahead of its time. if only it lasted longer..truly a masterpiece
Im Home,Not great but not terrible either. 
Im Home,It could have worked - comedies about Nazis have worked before. Hogan’s Heroes lasted longer than the war itself. 
Im Home,reboot
Im Home,"TESD makes, and the world takes..."
Im Home,When i came across it a few years ago i was surprised at how much i enjoyed it. Insane concept but the way it was handled wasn't the most outrageous. 
Im Home,Why was it cancelled. That sounds fucking hilarious 
Im Home,"Saw it on YT and I thought it was pretty funny
"
Im Home,Hogans hero's are just as odd 
Im Home,"Yeah, gonna have to go ahead and save that one for after work"
Im Home,I guess it's time to change the batteries in my smoke alarms. 
Im Home,Great episode of Omnibus on this show. https://www.omnibusproject.com/podcasts/heil-honey-home-entry-577-pr1413.htm
Im Home,This looks like it should have been a 5 minute SNL sketch
Im Home,"A higher quality video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTj0NfQy4T0"
Im Home,r/therewasanattempt
Im Home,biggest mood of all time
Im Home,"That was awful.  Not an ounce of cleverness in it.  Then again, I only watched the first three minutes, but I'm not going to torture myself any further."
Im Home,Mr. Hilter?
Im Home,"Personally I'd rather see a super serious television show that goes into Hitler's life and death with an ensemble cast of the people he surrounded himself with, something ethically gray and compelling like Breaking Bad or The Sopranos that tries to make him a relatable villain and shows his rise to power and inevitable defeat. Obviously there was nothing ethically gray about what Hitler did, but he was a real person and a fascinating historical character. I think there's a lot of untapped dramatic material there if people would just be willing to observe the man without kneejerk outrage. Obviously he was a monster, but shows like Breaking Bad and The Sopranos and Game of Thrones have shown that monsters can be interesting television. "
Im Home,"Maybe Roseanne can reboot it, seeing as she's currently out of a job."
Im Home,"Who cares that its about hitler or whatever.  If it sucks it sucks, and this definitely sucks."
Im Home,"This would definitely work as a recurring SNL sketch or Adult Swim thing that's meant to be like ""wtf"", but an actual tv show... eugh.

Apparently the guy who created it wanted to make fun of the way 50s and 60s tv would somehow make a sitcom out of *anything* - I mean there's a show with a talking a horse and a woman who gets reincarnated as a car for fuck's sake, he had a point."
Im Home,You're telling me there wasn't a *single* Jewish network executive to point out that this might be a bad idea?
Im Home,What the heil???
Im Home,"I wish we lived in a world where if you found something distasteful or offensive you'd simply not watch it again and leave it at that. This show sounds ridiculous in an entertaining way, it's not like it's actual hate speech which advocates you kill your Jewish neighbors. How arrogant do you have to be to demand the entire world can't have something simply because it offends your personal sensibilities. "
Im Home,"man the 90's were like the wild west era of TV. I miss the days when people were more interested in what makes fun tv rather than what a bunch of entitled college kids think is socially acceptable now. The socio-political climate has made movies and TV so.... narrow, now. People aren't anywhere near as willing to take risks."
Im Home,Does anyone know where to access the other 7 episodes? Or who has the copyright?
Im Home,[deleted]
Im Home,I thought it played in one time zone and was cancelled before being played in another 
Im Home,"Yeah, being cancelled after one episode gives it a story that helps it get remembered. Otherwise it'd probably have been mostly forgotten. "
Im Home,"I don’t know if it ever aired in the US, but at the time this debuted there was already a comedy hugely successful in the UK, Ireland, and Australia called ‘Allo ‘Allo set in Nazi-occupied France during WW2 and the Holocaust. Some of the main characters were Nazis and it showed you could do a surprising variety of successful Hitler, Nazi, and related jokes if you actually wrote jokes and didn’t just rely on “ooh Hitler, so taboo, are you shocked?!” (See also: The Death if Stalin.)

Of course there was Hogan’s Heroes, too, but that played it safer, they were POWs being treated pretty well and occupation, war crimes, etc didn’t come up much at all. "
Im Home,Upvote for working a Yiddish term in
Im Home,"I feel the same way reading the Nazi pun comments ITT that are not very clever, subversive, or all that funny"
Im Home,"It's no ""Mr. Hilter"""
Im Home,"I kind of want a show about someone trying to remake this show in modern times. Thing The Producers, but with Heil Honey, I'm Home."
Im Home,I feel like this show has potential today though
Im Home,"Honestly I am pretty strongly offended here. Making Hitler the everyman star of a cookie cutter sitcom without doing anything to subvert or undercut it really only contributes to trivializing and normalizing Hitler and Nazis. 

All I'm saying is that if sitcoms and Nazism existed in mainstream culture at the same time, a show like this would probably be propaganda."
Im Home,Apparently they were satirizing *I Love Lucy* which did the same thing.
Im Home,"No, the masses were führerious."
Im Home,"Maybe if it was made by someone who has true a knack for satire and provocation it could work, but it would have to be more clever and creative than this. In my opinion though I think it would work best as something more meta, so maybe a satire about people trying to create a show like Heil Honey I'm Home. 
"
Im Home,"> I would honestly watch the hell out of a limited series like this. Especially if they turned the camp up to 11. A self-mocking series parodying 80's and 90's sitcoms with a 'funny' and constantly shit on fuhrer as the lead? Sign me up.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_5"
Im Home,I think the camps were turned up way higher than eleven.
Im Home,"Yeah, I believe they filmed a few episodes, but they haven't surfaced yet."
Im Home,"Actually, the creator has stated on numerous occasions that the entire series was produced and he owns a copy to all produced and finalized episodes."
Im Home,"All eight episodes of season one were filmed, edited, and delivered to ~~the BBC.~~ BSB. They even had to replace the woman playing Eva midway through the first season, but none of the second actress's episodes were aired. This was also Patrick Cargill's final TV show before he passed away."
Im Home,"Have you ever seen That's My Bush? It's a parody of 90s sitcoms by Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC-m1ptBzuI

(Not implying that Bush is anywhere near as bad as Hitler.)"
Im Home,Check out Detective Comrad on Amazon Prime
Im Home,Or if they just used different evil people for each episode or several episodes.
Im Home,"This isn't a terrible idea, but based on that pilot they did NOT have the chops to pull that off. That was just....lame."
Im Home,"There was a good Hitler comedy for an episode of Man Seeking Woman, at least."
Im Home,"I think the award for most bizzare goes to Cop Rock which featured a Randy Newman-esque song about human trafficking entitled ""Baby Merchant"". 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPk966PuQNE"
Im Home,"Like Poochinski, a tv pilot featuring a Chicago police detective (played by Peter Boyle), whose spirit is transferred into a flatulent English bulldog.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poochinski"
Im Home,"There's one called [*Viva Laughlin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Laughlin) where characters would break out singing.  The strangest thing was they were singing over the song, where you can hear the original vocals of the song.

[The show had Hugh Jackman cameo as the villain.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vtonEFBeZk)

The concept was copied from *Blackpool*, which is a show about UK's version of Atlantic City."
Im Home,Check out Heat Vision and Jack. Jack Black is an ex astronaut with super intelligence when the sun is up. Owen Wilson plays his best friend who was turned into a motorcycle. Together they are on the run from Actor/Hitman Ron Silver.
Im Home,"you asked for it

https://us-east-1.tchyn.io/snopes-production/uploads/2018/03/roseanne-hitler.jpg"
Im Home,Timely.
Im Home,"Same here - I was BS-ing around on TV Tropes and somehow stumbled upon this. It's like that ""six degrees of separation"" theory on Wikipedia about Hitler. I just kept clicking links and ended up with this."
Im Home,The guy who was live streaming had been warned not to do that before. You can’t just freely film things for youtube outside of courthouses in the UK AFAIK. 
Im Home,Agreed... the bit would get old REAL fast
Im Home,"There's a reason shows like that are mostly about *fictional* monsters.  I'd think that doing one based on an actual, historical genocidal maniac might just be a bridge too far."
Im Home,I mean some would argue that it's really inappropriate to create a sit-com based on someone who brainwashed tens of millions and then killed millions more in horrific ways... you know... gauche. Offensive. Tone-deaf. All of those words.
Im Home,"To be fair to BSB, this was a show for a fledgling channel - and Heil Honey was intended to be a satirical comedy, written by Geoff Atkinson. Atkinson was one of the lead writers of Spitting Image, which was a highly regarded political satire (drawing, at its peak, 18 million viewers - 30% of the population). Furthermore, this was at a time when Allo Allo was still on air, and when the channel was showing reruns of Dad's Army.

Suffice to say, I feel execs at BSB were expecting a slightly more satirical show than what they got. Then again, it's possible they were well aware that the show would garner attention, which would work to get the channel more well known. All publicity is good publicity, as they say."
Im Home,"They were probably hoping for another [""Love Thy Neighbor""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Thy_Neighbour), a show about a bigoted white man who has a black family move next door. It ran for 7 seasons in the 1970s."
Im Home,"After watching for a few minutes, I wondered whether it was the only way to get an unapologetically Jewish family on TV back then -- make them be Hitler's neighbors?

I know Seinfeld almost got the ax early on for being ""too Jewish."""
Im Home,"Yeah, they might miss out on winners like this show, which ran a single episode. "
Im Home,"...Except this is an article about a 90's TV show that got cancelled for not being PC.

Which, I'd even wager, would be a TV show that'd be easier to get on the air today than it was back then. "
Im Home,"Doug mulray funniest home video adult version IIRC.  Channel owner called up while it was on air and said something along the lines of ""get this shit off my channel or off the air"".  Kerry Packer was famous for being, errr, direct."

Daughter From Another Mother,I wasn't sure it was worth investing in but man Paw Patrol season 6 brings everything together.
Daughter From Another Mother,Witcher is doing great numbers. It is good news for those who enjoy the show like me. They can make 7 seasons as they planned because the show is very popular. I guess it is bad news for the people who hope for its cancellation.  Squid Game might be the biggest thing in recent TV history. Its second season will break all kind of records.
Daughter From Another Mother,Squid Game still killin' it!
Daughter From Another Mother,"I’m warming to these weekly ratings. I still think the system unfairly disadvantages shorter seasons and shows with shorter episode runtimes but I’m definitely enjoying having some consistent comparative data. 

To the naked eye the ratings chart makes it look like The Witcher has been the number one show of the week by a long shot. If you break down the data we find that The Witcher s2 was neck and neck with Emily in Paris s2. 

The Witcher s2 got the equivalent of 22.1 million complete series viewings in its second week. Emily in Paris got the equivalent of 21.9 million complete viewings in its first week. It was neck and neck! 

The data shows us both fall short of mega hits like Squid Game and Money Heist but that both are among Netflix’s most popular shows. 

Maid’s performance gets more impressive by the week. Not only did it do big numbers in its early weeks it is still in the top 10 for a 13th week. Very few shows have that staying power.

Sad to see The Silent Sea get off to such a soft start. South Korean shows post-Squid Game got a good lift but that has faded a tad with each new show that got released. Hopefully folks find it week 2. It might have got buried under some big hits in The Witcher, Emily in Paris, and Don’t Look Up as well as the staying power of Money Heist."
Daughter From Another Mother,I've got a 2 year old. About 9 million of those Cocomelon views are probably from my household alone.
Daughter From Another Mother,Maid was such a fantastic series.
Daughter From Another Mother,"Damn, *Emily in Paris* is much bigger than I expected. Not my cup of tea, but more power to people who like it. Also great to see *Witcher* continuing to dominate. I really do hope they change their showrunner in the next seasons, she's absolutely dragging the show down, it could be so much better. Sadly it seems unlikely to happen."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Titans season 3 is surprisingly good for a show that I thought was kind of ""meh"" through the first two seasons. The ""standalone"" episode passing at the same time at the Afterlife and in Paradise Island (and showing a kind of very different version of the Amazons than what we are used to see) was the best one for me."
Daughter From Another Mother,"I got together with some people on Christmas and was surprised to hear that so many people were into Witcher, including people whose tastes I didn't think would line up with it. It has a much broader appeal than I originally understood."
Daughter From Another Mother,Thanks for reminding me why I stopped paying for netflix
Daughter From Another Mother,"Why would anyone hope for something’s cancellation? Just don’t watch it dude. 

Sure, be critical of it, rate it lower but why wish for something other people(and many as far as data tell) enjoy to end?"
Daughter From Another Mother,"> who hope for its cancellation.

Why would people hope that? Just don't watch it and let the people who do enjoy it, keep enjoying it lol"
Daughter From Another Mother,"If I'm remembering correctly I think there's actually been data that shows that people complete shows at a higher rate with shorter seasons, so it's actually much more advantageous to be an 8-10 episode season than one that's 15-20. 

Amazon has made the decision to ONLY allow their shows to be 8 episodes moving forward."
Daughter From Another Mother,"I heard that when they first offered her the position of showrunner,she declined. I wonder why they didn’t just move onto someone else."
Daughter From Another Mother,How exactly is she dragging the show down?
Daughter From Another Mother,Netflix is never going to financially recover from this.
Daughter From Another Mother,"For the Witcher, it’s because the TV show isn’t *exactly* like the books, and a lot of people who want it to fail are the “die hard, day one” type fans. The show failing would give them satisfaction as they could point and go “that’s what happens when you don’t listen to fans” or some bullshit 

It’s really pathetic, happens with a ton of properties and not just limited to television"
Daughter From Another Mother,Because “fans” think everything should be about them and for them.
Daughter From Another Mother,"I think as far as streamers like Amazon and Netflix are concerned shorter seasons are better for a whole host of reasons. Truth is most folks complete a season of 13 episodes in the first week or two just as they would for a 6 or 8 episode season so the extra episodes are just a wasted investment. Better to mare more shows with shorter seasons. 

I’ll be interested to see if Amazon’s decision to switch to weekly rollouts of their biggest shows gives them reason to extend the season orders back to 10 in order to hook a third month out of viewers. Weekly rollout still favours slightly longer series."
Daughter From Another Mother,That sounds like the book fans that are mad about the Wheel of Time show.
Daughter From Another Mother,"This is complete horseshit. Episode 1 of Season 2 has important differences from the books but fans loved it anyway because it was faithful to the *spirit* of the characters if not the details. Episodes 2 through 8 of Season 2 spit on the spirit of those characters by having them do things that are antithetical to their established history. 

Plus, a lot of it is nonsensical CW-level writing such as two people on one horse escaping from a group of mages and kings because they turned over some braziers."
Daughter From Another Mother,I love the Witcher series but there's a bunch of karens review bombing it.
Daughter From Another Mother,Fans need to understand they only a small fraction of the general audience. They aren’t entitled to anything.
Daughter From Another Mother,"As a non-book reader of both, yeah it’s the same, but the negative online attitude from Witcher fans is much more visceral than the WoT fans.

Both of which are absolutely nuts, people need to get a grip."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Everyone reading my first comment, this is what I was referring to"
Daughter From Another Mother,"Might be because the Witcher franchise is a little bit more known. Not trying to trash WOT, but the Witcher has the books, the games and the show certainly has more viewership than WoT."
Daughter From Another Mother,"No, you're just incapable of intelligently arguing your point and instead make vague, condescending generalizations about fans of the books so that you can pretend to be superior. In reality, you do not have any rebuttal to my point about S2E1 being very positively received by the community and you do not have any rebuttal to my point about the writing in the remaining episodes being of poor quality."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Nah man, I think I hit the nail on the head"
Daughter From Another Mother,So explain why Episode 1 of Season 2 was so positively received.
Daughter From Another Mother,"You do realize I never called the show bad or good? Simply pointed out that some book fans are being piss babies and you went off about *one* episode

You're the exact person I was talking about, and this thing you got going for one episode is just proof of that

There are plenty of shows I hate or dislike, and instead of whining, complaining or getting *angry on the internet about it* I just fuck off and ignore it"
Daughter From Another Mother,"You claimed that Sapkowski fans were upset ""*because the TV show isn’t exactly like the books*."" The reaction to episode one proved you wrong and you realize that, hence your refusal to explain that contradiction. The reality is that episode one of season two was positively received because fans of the books and people who had never read the books both liked it because the story was engaging and respected the established nature of the characters despite it differing in important respects from how the books told that story.

Thank you for proving my point that you're intellectually incapable of defending your statement and instead are just making generic insults towards fans of the books so that you can feel better about yourself."
Daughter From Another Mother,">There are plenty of shows I hate or dislike, and instead of whining, complaining or getting angry on the internet about it I just fuck off and ignore it 

and yet, here you are complaining about people voicing their hate/dislike of a show xD 

even if u disagree with or not like them, at least they are talking about a show on the television subreddit. But ur on a whole other level with the whining about people not liking something. Then you wanna call them out xD oh the irony

btw, everyone is free to voice their opinion of a show in a television subreddit, positive or negative."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Okay, you are obviously of sound health and mind. I am taking great offense and shame over you insinuating I'm unintelligent"
Daughter From Another Mother,"Someone asked a question, I answered it. Someone then gave a perfect example of what I was talking about 

>	and yet, here you are complaining about people voicing their hate/dislike of a show xD

And I could say the same thing about you now? That whole line of thinking is just so pathetic. 

>	btw, everyone is free to voice their opinion of a show in a television subreddit, positive or negative.

Yeah… So why did you call me out for complaining, when I’m free to have an opinion? Did I ever say he shouldn’t be allowed to speak?"
Daughter From Another Mother,Again with the insults to distract from your abject inability to defend your statements.
Daughter From Another Mother,">Someone asked a question, I answered it. Someone then gave a perfect example of what I was talking about 

nah, that person was talking about people wanting shows cancelled, then you went on a tangent complaining about fans voicing their opinions, generalising book readers and so on

>And I could say the same thing about you now? That whole line of thinking is just so pathetic.

uh what? You're on a television subreddit whining and stuff about people voicing their opinions

that's actually pathetic mate, as i said, at least the other people are talking about a show

I'm just calling you out, in part cause it's hilarious how you can't see the irony here xD

>Yeah… So why did you call me out for complaining, when I’m free to have an opinion? Did I ever say he shouldn’t be allowed to speak? 

cause you're whining about people having opinions, i.e something that has nothing to do with a television sub. Also your whining isn't an opinion

not hard to figure that one out mate"
Daughter From Another Mother,"Manifest still doing so good is wierd.

Reddit told everyone hated that show lol"
Daughter From Another Mother,"It's good to see Cobra Kai getting the love.  It was so hard during seasons 1 and 2 to explain to folks what Youtube Red was and how amazing that show was.

The Silent Sea was pretty enjoyable.  Glad to see it's still pulling in some views.  Maybe it'll get renewed."
Daughter From Another Mother,"There was no major new releases last week in the English language side of things so the big shows from the previous weeks continue to dominate. That lack of new content seems to have benefited Stay Close. It nearly trebled its viewing hours in week two! 

On the foreign language side it is always tough to gauge shows like Cafe Con Aroma de Mujer and Queen of Flow due to the fact that they have 90+ episodes which skews them in the charts. 

OK start for Rebelde. Less OK start for Kitz. A quick disappearance for The Girl From Oslo dropping out of the charts after posting an OK opening weekend number. 

It is often difficult to gauge what Netflix’s metric for success is for foreign language shows."
Daughter From Another Mother,"aside from ozark and stranger things, are there any big things coming out of netflix this year?"
Daughter From Another Mother,Reddit has no idea what is popular in the real world. They brag about never hearing of shows like Bridgerton and acting like the fact that they never heard of it must mean it can’t really be that popular.
Daughter From Another Mother,"Vikings: Valhalla maybe? Depending on whether they can win over the fans of the original show. 

Also the new season of The Crown"
Daughter From Another Mother,Whats Bridgeton? I've never heard of it. Are you sure it's popular?
Daughter From Another Mother,Those Last two episodes of cobra Kai blew me away. Great Season and I can't wait for Season 5!
Daughter From Another Mother,"Cobra Kai, The Witcher, and Emily in Paris all dropped within a few weeks of each other at the end of the year and ended up being some of Netflix’s top rated English language shows of the 6 months they have reported the ratings. The only other shows that got close to them in those months were Maid, Sex Education, and You. With Outer Banks trailing a tiny bit behind. 

Impressive final month of the year for Netflix especially when you throw in the numbers done by movies like The Unforgivable and Don’t Look Up as well. 

The Squid Game effect was full display again with the performance of The Silent Sea but it is worth noting that each new post-Squid Game Korean original has seen diminishing returns from the previous series. The Squid Game effect might be fading. Be interesting to see how All Of Us Are Dead fares in January."
Daughter From Another Mother,"I knoww, it was thoroughly enjoyable"
Daughter From Another Mother,Amazing luck that her daughter got the role.
Daughter From Another Mother,Still pissed about her letting Jack go…..
Daughter From Another Mother,Is this the sequel to I am Sam?
Daughter From Another Mother,Remember when Spielberg's daughter got attached as director to some film and she said her name had nothing to do with it and how she had to struggle like everyone else? lol
Daughter From Another Mother,I hope she is good. I would hate to see something with Kate Winslet ruined by bad acting.
Daughter From Another Mother,I've gotta be honest. This stuff has never really been an issue in fields like acting. If an actor who's a draw wants to do a project with their kid or whoever... let em. Project probably wouldn't exist otherwise anyway
Daughter From Another Mother,"It's the lying that aggravates more than the nepotism! Just say you wanted to give your daughter a leg up, ffs."
Daughter From Another Mother,That’s a pretty ignorant statement.
Daughter From Another Mother,"I mean her boobs were great in titanic.  I mean, her acting was great in titanic."
Daughter From Another Mother,"It's an objectively true statement. Actors are allowed to work with their own kids. 

Whatever ""fairness"" is being breached never existed. Get famous enough to have pull and you can do a project with some friends or family. Welcome to life."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Lol, you’re completely missing the point. But that’s cool!"
Daughter From Another Mother,No I'm not. Maybe don't apply my words to a context other than the one I used them in?
Daughter From Another Mother,"Really giant implications you’re missing. Again, very ignorant views on your part."
Daughter From Another Mother,In this specific context? No.
Daughter From Another Mother,“Kids of actors getting roles has never been an issue”. 😂
Daughter From Another Mother,If you have to make up quotes I didn't say in my posts right above you then you are just admitting you are wrong
Daughter From Another Mother,That’s called paraphrasing
Daughter From Another Mother,These WWE plots are so elaborate these days. I’m guessing this one ends in a cage match.
Daughter From Another Mother,This new season of Succession sounds great.
Daughter From Another Mother,Time to have stone cold Steve Austin come back for management!
Daughter From Another Mother,"He’s still doing creative, so from an audience standpoint, nothing changes"
Daughter From Another Mother,"Stephanie: I'm a bit burnt out from my duties and would like time with my family so I am going to take a break.

Vince: Yeeaaahhhh, so about that...."
Daughter From Another Mother,Can someone ELI5 what has happened?
Daughter From Another Mother,I can't believe he renamed his daughter from Stephanie to Interim CEO
Daughter From Another Mother,"So they leak out that she underperformed at her job and her father pushed for her to take a step back because she just wasn’t very good. 

And now they hand her the company to run.    This is a bold strategy Cotton"
Daughter From Another Mother,"Still in charge of creative though.

Dang…"
Daughter From Another Mother,"> daughter

I guess he really is stepping back and not influencing WWE management in any way."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Vince looks in a mirror.

“YOU’RE FIIIIRED!”"
Daughter From Another Mother,As God is my witness he's broken in half!
Daughter From Another Mother,I walk like him.
Daughter From Another Mother,"It’s kind of weird reading these comments and seeing people be like that this is somehow the beginning of something big. 

Vince “handing” the company over to Stephanie is the same way Trump gave up his assets when he became “President” to his sons. He’s still just as involved as he was before. Nothing changes, he just hides behind Stephanie now."
Daughter From Another Mother,Bah gawd!  That’s Stephanie McMahon’s music!!
Daughter From Another Mother,*southpark voice* -she took his jerb.
Daughter From Another Mother,That man has a family!!!
Daughter From Another Mother,Remember when he had the Mr. McMahon “kiss my ass club?”
Daughter From Another Mother,Didn't his limo explode?
Daughter From Another Mother,"The guy who supplied steroids to wrestlers in the 80s and early 90s until the government took him to court and has multiple allegations of everything from actual rape to minor sexual assault going back to the 80s - and who bragged in a Playboy Magazine interview about his numerous affairs - caught up in a scandal involving favouritism towards a woman he was having an affair with, and a $3m payout upon her leaving?

*shocked Pikachu face*"
Daughter From Another Mother,"That is an *amazing* coincidence, isn't it, how sometimes *the best* person for the job *just happens* to be the son or daughter of the former CEO! I mean, what luck!"
Daughter From Another Mother,"I'm very confused. (I don't watch wrestling). I always thought this guy was playing a character who was the CEO but was also involved in the weird story lines and wrestled occasionally.  

Is (was) he actually the CEO and involved in the actual running of this operation?"
Daughter From Another Mother,Vince is still in control of creative... so nothing's changing at all
Daughter From Another Mother,No wonder she took that break. She knew she'd be working a lot more soon.
Daughter From Another Mother,Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!
Daughter From Another Mother,"There's a documentary... Either ""Wrestling with shadows"" or ""Beyond the mat""  where it shows his office door and it says

Vince Mc Mahons office and right below it another plaque saying ""Women's changing room""

It's amazing with all the me too stuff they haven't gone after him sooner."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Bro said the n word live on television and faked his death a day before one of his wrestlers killed his entire family and THIS is what finally got him to step down. Wild. End of an era, but also fuck Vince."
Daughter From Another Mother,Dayum. Just as I read last week that Stephanie was being booted. How the turntables
Daughter From Another Mother,He stepped down as WWE’s CEO and Chairman but will remain in charge of creative.
Daughter From Another Mother,With any luck this’ll be permanent and he’ll be booted out of creative as well
Daughter From Another Mother,"Is the probe to find out where the payoff money came from? If not, then what is the purpose of the probe? Because I can’t see any other valid reason to be up in his personal life’s details. He had an affair and gave her some hush money…..so???"
Daughter From Another Mother,Not sure he gets the job back from here. There is fairly good documentation about the woman he was sleeping with getting a promotion and doubling of her salary with fairly poor qualifications for the position. So there is misappropriation of funds more than likely which breaks fiduciary responsibility. Then he paid her to keep quiet afterwards which kind of proves he knew it was going to be an issue. Even if the payoff was from his pocket her salary wasn't.
Daughter From Another Mother,You got….NO CHANCE!
Daughter From Another Mother,"Mannnnnnn if he gets fired I swear to god if it doesn’t happen on tv they missed the best opportunity ever. 

Thanks for the good times Vince, the attitude era was my childhood and always will be. I think it’s time someone else takes over anyways. I know he still gets to keep his creative role even in his interim but maybe this will force his hand to let Stephanie or Shane take over."
Daughter From Another Mother,"Ah. The Trish Stratus storyline.

Wonder if it was Roman who filed the complaint of misconduct."
Daughter From Another Mother,“You’re Firrrred!!!”
Daughter From Another Mother,"Wow…. This literally takes me back to the time Vince “got fired” on the show (the fake time). Since me and my best friend (who used to watch WWE all the time) were kids, he always predicted Shane would take over.

Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.

Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.

Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,🙂💕
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!

Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Hot new shows:

Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"Absolutely, I think this is the best year we've had since 2017 (amazing finales for The Leftovers, Halt and Catch Fire, Twin Peaks, great new series like Big Little Lies, Legion, The Handmaid's Tale, American Vandal, The Deuce, The Good Place (started in 2016 but closed out its goat first season in 2017), and great continuing shows like Bojack Horseman, Better Call Saul, Better Things, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.

I feel like this is especially noticeable since 2020 and 2021 were kneecapped by the pandemic, 2019 was pretty good but I think 2022 really benefited from this deluge of shows that were stuck in production during the lockdown phase of the pandemic and then could all be released at once this year.

Bungo Stray Dogs WAN!,"(In order of most anticipated with  justification)

10. Atlanta season 3 (plan to catch up on season 2 as haven’t gotten round to it yet but loved the first season).

9. Ozark season 4 : Really enjoyed the first three seasons with characters and set pieces complex and engaging enough to not make it a Breaking Bad clone. Jason Bateman and Laura Linney are fantastic in the central roles.

8. Stranger Things season 4: Looking forward to the shift in locations and how it will be utilised for the storyline. Trailers look intriguingly sinister.

7. The Walking Dead: The Final Season: I was not convinced by the first part, however as a longtime fan of the series I’m excited to see how the show will diverge from the comic’s ending. Fingers crossed it provides a satisfying resolution to the fan-favourite characters. 
6. The Mandalorian season 3: After the cliffhanger ending of season 2, I’m anticipating how the show will deal with a Grogu-less Mando. Have absolutely no idea where the story will go from season 2, and that excites me. 

5. The Lord of The Rings: Admittedly more intrigued by the spectacle of how this will look due to the rumoured blockbuster budget rather than the plot. It will be interesting to see whether the narrative can be as engaging as Jackson’s work on Tolkien’s classics.
4. Obi Wan Kenobi: My inner fanboy cannot wait to find out what happens to Ewan Macgregor after Episode III. The nostalgia for the prequels drives my excitement for this one, with the hope that Deborah Chow can expand on the character of Obi Wan from the prequel era. 

3. The House of the Dragon: Despite the mixed reception of GOT season 8, I’m very much excited for the return to Westeros on the small screen after three years. Big fan of ‘Fire and Blood’, and hoping that the show can mix the familiar continuity of the world of Westeros whilst also creating a story that stands alone from GOT. Cannot wait! 

2. Better Call Saul Season 6: Across five seasons, this show has gone from strength to strength creating a story that stands alone from Breaking Bad despite bridging the timeline between the two. What I have admired so much about this series is it’s ability to increase the dramatic tension slowly but crucially across each episode. In season 6, I fully expect fireworks.

1. The Last of Us: I cannot describe the excitement I have for this series. As a huge fan of the games, I think there is an incredible opportunity for the story to go deeper into each character, story thread and the world-building. I have complete trust in Craig Mazin and his team to help us fall in love with Joel and Ellie’s journey in a completely new and exciting way. Counting down the days until episode 1."

Ever Night,Court? At night? I’m already laughing!
Ever Night,Wish those 2 drunken bozos would fix my VCR...just wanna watch my Night Court tapes...
Ever Night,This show really jumped the shark when they introduced the Werewolf lawyer.
Ever Night,To this day it gets stuck in my head.
Ever Night,Similar to Barney Miller?
Ever Night,See episode of Buck Rogers with [Markie Post.](https://www.google.com/search?q=buck+rogers+markie+post&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari)
Ever Night,I think we are getting a sequel series soon! I am actually excited about it. 👨🏼‍⚖️
Ever Night,"No one ever remembers this show when I bring it up, glad to see some recognition ! Have t heard of a reboot but I’m curious for sure"
Ever Night,"Markie Post, still hot even with that horrible haircut."
Ever Night,Would watch this every Wednesday night at 9pm on NBC back in the 90s.
Ever Night,This is basically the reason I decided to pickup the bass. This and the Fraggle Rock theme song
Ever Night,I binged Night Court a couple months ago in preparation of the sequel series coming early next year. With Harry's Daughter as the judge and Dan will be back.
Ever Night,You know what that means? It's time for the Intern Special Olympics
Ever Night,Dan Harmon (creator of Community and Rick and Morty) on his podcast Harmontown did a [version of this theme with lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1J3-nFrw20) and I can't hear this song without hearing his lyrics
Ever Night,is this a red letter media reference ?!?!
Ever Night,is there any way to stream this show yet?
Ever Night,My all time favorite sit com.
Ever Night,I can hear it even with out watching the video.
Ever Night,"Excellent! I say, $20 fine and time served. (Real Night Court fans know what I am talking about)"
Ever Night,I loved that show. Thanks for the flashback.
Ever Night,Hey! That's the Intern Olympics song!
Ever Night,A reunion of friends...
Ever Night,I'm sorry if they tried to steal your precious antibodies.
Ever Night,I’m convinced the Seinfeld bass slaps owe the first part of this theme for inspiration

Ever Night,I know Night Court creator Reinhold Weege wrote several episodes of Miller.
Ever Night,I'll never understand why they got rid of the sexiness in season 2 of Buck Rogers.

Ever Night,According to Amazon you can watch it free with ads through Freevee
Ever Night,"That explains it!  As soon as I heard it I was like ""yeah, but that one with the cops in NY was better, with the instrument-by-instrument intro.  What was the name of that show?  I can google it, but 'NY cop show 80s' is just going yo give me 'Hill Street Blues.'  What were the character names?  Wojohoeitz or something like that?  Or was that Taxi?  No, that was Ignatowski.  I bet someone in the comments already thought of it, I should look there."""
Ever Night,"I miss Craig, I miss Geoff, and I miss Geoff's daddy Grant Imahara. Oh, I  also miss Secretariat and Betty White."
Ever Night,BALLS
Ever Night,I miss Ferguson.  His show was the best late night show since Carson.
Ever Night,"The Jay Leno Fly skit gets me every damn time. Craig Ferguson will always be the king of late night to me. 

Also RIP Grant Imahara who created Geoff the Robot."
Ever Night,"There's never been a late night host quite like Craigy Ferg, and there probably never will be. I fondly remember deliberately skipping the actual late night show slot, just to turn the TV back on when it was time for the Late Late Show. 

The show just constantly found new ways to improve and get better and better. The original run prior to Geoff was fantastic, but the absurdist art that it evolved into once that happened was just magic."
Ever Night,[Best Liam Neeson impressionist there is.](https://youtu.be/KeuGxqTZ584)
Ever Night,"He also sounds a lot like Morgan Freeman.

Edit: For those unaware, he also does impressions."
Ever Night,Careful Icarus.
Ever Night,There goes my penis.
Ever Night,This is Miriam isn't it?!
Ever Night,You ever been down to New Orleans Geoff?
Ever Night,Josh was amazing! Craig was both off the charts funny and deeply human and personable as well.
Ever Night,The Philly cheesesteak bit with Serge was legitimately one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen on TV
Ever Night,great that they're on Youtube now. I've been rewatching at my convenience..
Ever Night,Not ALL of the voice work. Larry King did a stint and it was fucking AMAZING and even got Craig to completely break down in laughter.
Ever Night,"I was surprised when I heard his familiar voice one day while my wife was watching the Kelly Clarkson show.  Apparently he does ""the voice of God"" on there somewhat regularly.

Yes, it was my wife watching.  That's my story and I'm sticking to it."
Ever Night,"He’s Herman, I’m Klaus"
Ever Night,Hey thanks a lot.  I was supposed to get some work done this morning and instead I’ve spent an hour down the old Craig Ferguson rabbit hole.
Ever Night,I still haven't found a replacement for Craig's Late Late Show.
Ever Night,"Josh Robert Thompson as Morgan Freeman as Jar-Jar Binks.

https://youtu.be/xH1uwXGQ_ts"
Ever Night,Hey there freckles
Ever Night,And let's not forget that Craig really knew how to interview and make his lady guests comfortable!
Ever Night,It's a stew
Ever Night,[JRT impersonating George Lucas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI0qiUHBuUA)
Ever Night,He has a really good episode of the honeydew with Ryan Sickler. Video or audio. Talks mostly about the show and how heartbreaking it was when it ended and he had like a day to empty his office.
Ever Night,"Yes, and Larry King as Geoff Peterson is the greatest sidekick ever"
Ever Night,Chris Eliot was great as The Man Under the Seats.
Ever Night,"yup, to this day no one has come close to craig and josh, that show was truly special

Josh's talent with voices was really something else, his Freeman and Neeson in particular. He really took the show to another level with his dynamic with Craig

it's so easy to land on a random clip of the show and have a great time, like many, I really miss it

whenever Craig is brought up, I like to link to this nerdwriter video, cause it does a good job of summing up why Craig's late night show was so great:

https://youtu.be/50MU4Cz62so"
Ever Night,*tears up note cards*
Ever Night,"God damn it. We lost Craig and got an obnoxious, unfunny bozo in his place."
Ever Night,Your disappointed!
Ever Night,I miss that picture of Paul McCartney
Ever Night,Don't forget Aquaman!
Ever Night,who is that at the door??
Ever Night,Careful Icarus
Ever Night,Yeah i have a place there. You should come visit sometime.
Ever Night,In your pants.
Ever Night,Here come the playyyyersss...
Ever Night,"The only person I'd remotely compare to him is probably Graham Norton, he has the same chaotic ""I'll follow the funny, not the script"" energy. 

Craig was so good at being serious when he needed to though, the time he refused to make jokes about Britney is so damn memorable. I really wish he was still on, the world needs a weird uncle to make fun of it right now."
Ever Night,90's Conan is similar especially the remote skits of him ad-libbing
Ever Night,Many have probably heard his Morgan Freeman on Family Guy.
Ever Night,"It is you! you old hag!


Careful ferrrrgie"
Ever Night,"(Show ends for years)

Miriam: ...I'm still here."
Ever Night,It is me you rat bastard
Ever Night,That was the bit that inspired me to post this!
Ever Night,I'm sorry i think you mean serrrrrrrrrgggggge
Ever Night,"Is the rabbit named Sid, and does he curse?"
Ever Night,Watch old youtube videos of Steve Allen's Tonight Show... some of those are pretty wacky
Ever Night,"Man, I miss Angela Lansbury"
Ever Night,"You mean the one from menwholooklikeoldlesbians.blogspot.com which also has a photo of our @craigyferg? Man, what a show!"
Ever Night,"""I enjoy the simple pleasures of Daffy Dook."""
Ever Night,funniest moment ever
Ever Night,In *your* pants!
Ever Night,They're so fiiiiiiine!!
Ever Night,"Yep, Craig was a real gift. I mean, let's no forget that this is the same show that won a Peabody award for his interview with Desmond Tutu."
Ever Night,Oh yeah! I totally forgot about that. He even gets a shoutout pretty much lmao.
Ever Night,I wish more people knew about Steve Allen.  He's pretty much the Founding Father of late night comedy.  You can see his influence in a lot of the current late night hosts.
Ever Night,"Thank you for mentioning Steve Allen. A lot of his Tonight show stuff inspired others, like Letterman."
Ever Night,"Allen was a straight-up genius. Songwriter, composer, author, philosopher, comedian…the list goes on! Carson used some of his old Tonight Show sketches as inspiration for some of his iconic characters. Carnac was based on Allen’s The Question Man."
Ever Night,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
Ever Night,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
Ever Night,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
Ever Night,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who’s acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he’s always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
Ever Night,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
Ever Night,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It’s a great five season arc.
Ever Night,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
Ever Night,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Oh, I can stop checking CR then. I was wondering why today’s episode was so late. Hopefully it doesn’t take them too long to air it."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","I have enjoyed this show way more than I thought I would.

This entire season has been great for anime."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Is it me or are all anime currently isekai and sports?
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Animation last couple of episodes has been garbage, so hopefully they work on that. Grant it, it's mostly been human centered last couple of episodes, so not much was lost."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","the last episode was pretty janky, so hopefully the time goes to its improvement"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I somehow periodically check in and watch a new Family Guy episode. It feels like 1/3 end up being hilarious or at least have one really amazing bit. One of the better ones of recent was where they made fun of Silence of the Lambs.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The Handmaid's Tale has steadily been getting worse since S1 but I still watch it for some reason, though if I feel that a scene is going on too long just for the sake of padding the runtime I'll fast forward; or if Elizabeth Moss is staring at the camera for too long because she's too creepy."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","How I Met Your Father.

I really only keep watching it because I like Hilary Duff and I'm hoping it just hasn't hit its stride yet."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","I stuck with Falling Skies til the end even though it felt ""not great"" by the middle.

I pushed through multiple ""not great"" sections of Walking Dead but couldn't make it all the way to the end."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Heroes. God I loved that show but by the end it was so far off how well it had started
"So Im a Spider, So What?",This was Sons of Anarchy for me.  The last season was just completely off the rails.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Honestly? Star Trek Discovery and Picard, though Picard SEEMS to be turning into something acceptable."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Shameless. Just kept getting worse and worse but since I invested all that time watching the first few seasons, I just had to finish it"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Euphoria. Garbage show but I have this weird OCD thing where if I start a show I have to watch it through to the end.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","CSI comes to mind, I find show went into exhaustion after Grave Danger and the miniature killer (the show's peak imho) yet I watched to the end because all considered it was still a very well made show and wanted to see if Grissom would die or something"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","A lot of them, I have this thing where I am compelled to finish anything I start."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Lucifer. It's corny. It's cliche. It's formulaic. It's soap opera-level melodramatic.

But goddamn if it isn't entertaining or charming in its dedication to the formula."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","One show I have kept watching even though I think it's not so great is The Big Bang Theory. While I do enjoy the show and its comedy, I often feel like some of the jokes and storylines are overused and predictable. Ultimately, however, I keep coming back to watch because of my nostalgia for the series and its characters."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Great isn't my baseline for watching a show. I watch a bunch of stuff that I consider to be good (aka not great).

-  The Peripheral
-  Let the Right One In
-  Miss Scarlett and The Duke
-  CB Strike (though it finally got great this past season)
-  House of the Dragon
-  Carnival Row
-  Shadow and Bone
-  The Wheel of Time 
-  The Expanse
-  The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (though this is barely good)

>  I've invested so much time in the characters I need to know what will happen.

I don't watch anything for that reason, but that is baffling to me about the Simpsons.

Nothing every happens to the characters on the Simpsons.."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","jane the virgin, outlander"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Outlander. 

The first season is fantastic but it went downhill steadily after that. I pretty much hate watch at this point but I love the characters too much to not be interested in their fates"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The Blacklist.  It's out of sheer will and need for completion at this point.  If it weren't for the pure joy of watching James Spader chew scenery, I wouldn't have made it halfway through the first season.  Luckily, the end is in sight."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Halo

Never played the games so I don’t know how much they butchered the source material but it was something new with a good bit of action to occupy the mind with."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Two Broke Girls. I liked the two broke girls. The rest of the cast was drowning in a sea of fake accents and very modest talent. I think Garrett Morris was usually just sitting at his desk with a script in front of him. And they should have let Jennifer Coolidge choose an accent she was comfortable with. Russian wasn’t it. Unless her struggling with it was supposed to be part of the comedy.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Game of Thrones.

First four seasons were perfection. After that there was still great cinematography and occassional great episodes like the Battle of the Bastards but the wheels were starting to come off. By the time Season Eight arrived I think everyone was pretty weary with it. After the botched battle for Winterfell it was just a grudge watch."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",The Last of Us
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I stuck through The Last of Us only to keep up with the zeitgeist.  Pascal is also a great actor and he's always worth watching.  But the series explores the same themes as *I Am Legend* combined with *The Road* in nine hours instead of two IMHO.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Supernatural for me too. The first 5 seasons were so great that I kept watching the show for another 6 seasons before giving up. 

At one point I remember thinking maybe I just don't like this stuff anymore. Then I started a rewatch and noticed that the quality difference was like day and night."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The X-Files. 5 years of greatness, followed by 4 years of suffering."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Billions, it's past its sell by date and it is just wandering around aimlessly now. I will give next season a pass."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The White Lotus

Grey’s Anatomy 

Station 19

The Bad Batch

Willow

National Treasure 

Bridgerton

Emily in Paris

Cobra Kai after the first season"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Family Guy, it's just always kinda been around for me I guess"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I kept watching Doctor Who through the Chibnall/Jodie Whittaker seasons even though they were pretty bad.  I'm a Who fan from way back so I hope it will now get better.
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Curb your enthusiasm. The show is awful and so is Larry David but I keep putting it on when I don't know what else to watch.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","It's been a solid 6.x since season 17 (2005).

https://www.ratingraph.com/tv-shows/the-simpsons-ratings-3857/"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Lost. They conned a generation into thinking it was going to get better. Even when every viewing was the definition of suffering.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Family Guy still has some funny episodes, but man American Dad is still consistently hilarious, I love that show even 15 seasons later (or whatever season it’s on)"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","I’ve watched all the way through Family Guy on Hulu more times than I care to admit. It’s never been close to my favorite show, but it’s easy to leave on because it never really gets much better *or* worse. Every episode is roughly the same level of meh, with a few disconnected bits that warrant an ostrich-like “ha-haaa.” There are even a few brilliant episodes over the years—like the bank vault episode—but there’s never a consistent run where you think “this was the the peak and now it sucks.” As a result, you can leave it running in the background forever while you scroll Reddit, knowing you’ll never have to pay attention to the plot, or skip seasons/episodes after Michael Scott or Dennis disappears. You can just leave it looping forever in a state of quarter-focused mild bemusement, like I’m doing right now as I write this."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","> The Handmaid's Tale has steadily been getting worse since S1 but I still watch it for some reason

Season 5 was *actually* pretty good; at least it was a step up from Season 4. 

> if Elizabeth Moss is staring at the camera for too long because she's too creepy.

To the show's credit, it's not just Elisabeth Moss staring at the camera for too long now. They've expanded to include Yvonne Strahovski doing that."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Its so bad. But my fiancé watches it, so I feign interest to not dampen her joy.   


The adopted sister is the worst character on television and I think the show quality would improve drastically just by removing her."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The first few seasons were excellent. Even the middle seasons had merit, but it got monumentally bad in those later seasons. After Rossum left....my investment evaporated. And that final episode...."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Wow I was going to accuse you of just watching for the sex scenes, but I clicked on your profile and you’re trying to figure out when season 34 of the Simpsons will stream. You really can’t stop watching a show, huh?"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",">Garbage show but I have this weird OCD thing where if I start a show I have to watch it through to the end.

That was the same for me (for many shows like Supernatural) and still slightly true. But you have to remember how much time you waste doing that."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","It's the strong cast and the chemistry they have with each other on screen. It's amazing what great casting can do to a show, to the point that people will literally sit through the campiest, silliest shit because they are so connected to the way the characters interact with each other. And the show has a unique premise, which helps. I also think transitioning to Netflix helped them out of the confines of network television writing."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",[deleted]
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Yea I feel for fans of the game. I didn't play it either and the show was bad..
"So Im a Spider, So What?",What similar ground to I am Legend do you feel it covers?
"So Im a Spider, So What?","With Damian Lewis finally returning, this season's the one you're going to pass on?  Dude..."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",https://i.imgur.com/4QFM1PQ.jpg
"So Im a Spider, So What?",It was great.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","I thought it progressively got better as you go on. Season 6 wasn’t the best but I still enjoyed it and was fairly satisfied with how it ended. 

It still makes me wonder what show people like you were watching, because it definitely wasn’t Lost. Unless the type of show that it is wasn’t for you, which is fine."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",It felt like almost every character was doing it this season
"So Im a Spider, So What?","> That was the same for me (for many shows like Supernatural)

At least with Supernatural, because it had gone on for so long, you'd periodically get a few episodes where it's like ""oh *wow* that was actually a really good one"". A few of the later seasons are decent, IMO.

And I mean, Scoobynatural is great."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Indeed it has. They weren't strained to produce as many episodes per season and could depict more mature content than broadcast standards had allowed.

It's one of the few examples ever where the move to Netflix undoubtedly saved the show, resulting in significantly stronger seasons."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I was only there for the raunchy stuff anyways 😂
"So Im a Spider, So What?","> and the show was bad..

That is being generous. The show was utter dogshit."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Pretty much everything.  The TLOU opening is a direct copy of what happened in Legend, just swap out cure for cancer with wheat fungus.  Both characters are loners who are tasked with taking a female character to safety.  And there are fast zombies everywhere.  I could go on."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","None of the things you listed are themes. Thematically, the shows are very different."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I guess I meant narrative elements instead of themes.  Fair point.

"So Im a Spider, So What?",Manifest really hits that sweet spot.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","It's been a while, but CSI: Miami was exactly that for me. Such a terrible, bonkers show."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Zoo. Hilariously stupid show.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Kyle XY. Very interesting premise, atrocious writing and even worse acting. But I stuck it out all the way through"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The 100. The plot just keeps one-upping itself in ridiculousness but I like to sit back, turn my brain off, and enjoy."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Law and Order. Specifically SVU. I won’t stop.
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Does reality TV count? The Salt Lake City variant of the Real Housewives franchise has some flashes of Jon Waters level camp brilliance. These ladies are batshit and also federal criminals.
"So Im a Spider, So What?",How to Get Away with Murder is one of the best for this. Not many shows get close to this. Pure soap opera
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Eastenders, Coronation Street. Basically the uk soaps are top drawer in a terrible sort of way"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",“24 with Jack Bauer” should be the name of the show
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Awkward. It was an MTV original, enough said. But I will be damned if I didn’t watch the entire series."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Suits. Watched it until season 3 in highscool. Just picked it back up and I'm into season 6, such tasty tasty garbage."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Oh man, I loved watching 24 just to see what crazy stuff the writers would come up with to try and top themselves.  Any other show I would have stopped watching, but for some reason with 24 I just said ""Come at me, show!  You can't go dumb enough to make me quit!"", and it was a riot.

The show ran 8 seasons (Edit: actually 8.5 seasons) and had 9 presidents.  That alone is freaking bananas.

Also, they needed a spin-off show that was just Chloe tasing people who annoyed her."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Law and Order: SVU. It's an alternate reality fantasy show set in a world where cops are competent and compassionate and the bad guys almost always get caught and sent to jail. Plus, Ice T is in it."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","I've watched Hallmark movies because I know it'll be good and wholesome. Nothing bad will happen and everyone gets a happy ending. Even the ""bad guy"". Pure veg out and relax stuff."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","24 was like cramming every single action movie idea ever conceived in a single show with a single man saving the planet 408 times, and I sure ain't got a problem with that because it was awesome"

"So Im a Spider, So What?",Teen Wolf
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Once upon a time and scream queens both were so bad and I was obsessed with how bad they were
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Some of Jacks days were better than others. But you got to admit that show had every major actor of the early 2000s. It’s still watchable. If for nothing but Kim Bauer
"So Im a Spider, So What?",House M.D. rewatching it sober has opened my eyes to so many flaws but I love the damn show.
"So Im a Spider, So What?",9:11 Lone Star. Cheesy acting and plotlines and dialogue with no subtlety but I love seeing what kind of accidents or natural disasters they’ll come up with and how its filmed/produced.
"So Im a Spider, So What?","The poor guy has to go 24hours without eating, sleeping or going to the bathroom"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Cobra Kai is a ridiculous show, but I like it."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Go search for ""the pilot of 24 if it was made in 1994"". I laugh until I can't breathe *every single time*

https://youtu.be/JMLH_QyPTYM"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","It’s Chuck for me

Every episode is more or less the same. Bad guys in Burbank, Chuck flashes, Morgan does something dumb and/or creepy, Casey and Sarah go on a mission to stop the bad guy, mission goes sideways and Chuck lucks his way into saving the day. 

But I fucking *love* the show and rewatch it every few years"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","I loved 24. The whole hour per episode gimmick, while not at all realistic, was pretty cool."
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Oh no!  Kim got kidnapped again!

*later season*

Kim:  ""I'm tired of getting kidnapped!""

there was a certain amount of self awareness that kept the show from being totally terrible.  I liked it, but I was ready for it to be done.  Now It seems I'm ready for them to bring it back...lets' do it again!"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Season 5 was peak 24, and honestly was a good season of television. 

That said, [Scalia did use the show as defense for using torture](https://www.theatlantic.com/daily-dish/archive/2007/06/scalia-and-torture/227548/)"
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Criminal Minds. It gets dumber and dumber. They catch 100 serial killers a year in the act and the assistant directors all still want to shut the program down. Rossi got back together with all of his ex-wives throughout the series.
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I love reality garbage like naked and afraid
"So Im a Spider, So What?",I love 24 and while I realise the first season is important I fucking hate the first season but love the rest.
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Gossip Girl..
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Manifest 

pretty sure it was written to capture the Qanon audience but goddamn if Ben Stone is not one of the most amazingly ridiculous and over the top characters in TV, follow your callings people"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Not sure if it fits 100%, but I can throw on [*MXC* and still laugh my ass off at the sophomoric humor.](https://youtu.be/3jeZwUP6fu0) Shit's great!"
"So Im a Spider, So What?","Married With Children.

It's so sexist, stereotypical, but how they as a family are total losers somehow makes it all alright.

I like how surreal it is and that's very rare in live action sitcoms that survive.  That only usually works on shows like the simpsons 

And in the end, I still don't know why, I end up empathizing with every main character on the show."
"So Im a Spider, So What?",Dammit Chloe!
Sesame Street,I grew up with this man talking to me thru the tv.  rip bob.
Sesame Street,">he brought a musical element to the show too, with original songs like ""People in Your Neighborhood,"" ""Sing a Song,"" ""If You're Happy And You Know It"" and even the 'SS' theme song.

Yeah, that last one, maybe don't write it like that."
Sesame Street,"All I've read about him suggests he was just as warm and lovely as he appeared on television. If you've never seen *Christmas Eve On Sesame Street*, I'd highly recommend adding it to your playlist this year. It has [this beautiful scene](https://youtu.be/Sd5PEVKuAro) of Linda teaching the kids to sign the song Bob was learning with them."
Sesame Street,The worst part of being an adult is seeing all the beloved adult figures you grew up with die off one by one. I'll miss you Bob!
Sesame Street,Didn’t expect to lose Bob and Luis in the same year. Thank you for everything you’ve brought to so many people all over the country.
Sesame Street,"Loved him, the whole cast and the show."
Sesame Street,RING THOSE PHONES!! RING THOSE PHONES!! Telemiracle will never have the same feel RIP Bib thanks for making Saskatchewan better by knocking them down all those years!!
Sesame Street,I am so sad 😞 . Everyone from my childhood is dying the last few months.  I have fond memories of listening to “people in your neighborhood” on vinyl and cassettes when I was little.
Sesame Street,"Bob, Luis, Maria, Gordon etc all felt like family.  Bob brought a lot of joy into my childhood.  May he RIP."
Sesame Street,“I’ve got two eyes…”
Sesame Street,I remember Bob not only from Sesame Street but also telemiracle which is a Canadian televised telethon and fundraiser that raises money for disabled and special needs children. RIP to this wonderful human being.
Sesame Street,"Even tho I haven't watched Sesame Street in a long time I will miss Mr. McGrath. While I'm sad he is now gone, I'm happy that he dedicated his life to helping others and got to live to be 90 years old, Bob McGrath is going to be remembered for his amazing work and how he help generations of children. I hope that if there is an after life he is now with Fred Rogers, Stan Lee, and so many others that made people smile."
Sesame Street,"I just adore the dorky humor of Bob [singing the 80s celebrity version of ""Who Are the People in Your Neighborhood""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djq_kc8bgGo) full of the best dad jokes you can imagine, ending with Ralph Nadar destroying Bob's sweater! (You trying singing ""a consumer advocate is a person in your neighborhood!"")

I'm so glad we got most of the old time cast back together for [the 50th anniversary special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvTNHEpXULc) a few years ago (including Bob and Luis). It's sad, I feel like I grew up with Gordan & Susan, Luis and Maria, and Bob and Linda."
Sesame Street,R.I.P Bob
Sesame Street,I liked him. I was just thinking about him the other day and was surprised he was still alive.
Sesame Street,90?? So he was almost 60 when I was watching? Would have never guessed. Will never forget his smiling face. RIP
Sesame Street,Fuuuuuuck
Sesame Street,"Y'know, with his age, you kinda expect it to happen. Yet it still kinda shocks us when it does. He was a legend like that, seemingly invincible to death with how long he's been around. RIP."
Sesame Street,Can’t believe he was 90. Seems like yesterday I was a kid watching him on SS.
Sesame Street,"Proven fact. Pre cable there is a study of kids who grew up with Sesame Street and those who didn’t. Those who did were better at spelling, numbers, colors, shapes, sharing, etc. He did good work."
Sesame Street,"I got to meet Bob (alongside the recently deceased Emilio Delgado and Roscoe Orman) at Dragoncon a few years ago. I told them all what a huge part of my childhood they were alongside everyone involved with Sesame Street. They were all so lovely to talk with, Bob especially."
Sesame Street,He helped to bring a lot of happiness to generations of kids and their parents.
Sesame Street,Awwww. Bob was awesome. I hate that these performers who defined my childhood are leaving this existence.
Sesame Street,There's a man who spent like 50  years enjoying his job
Sesame Street,Telemiracle will never be the same. RIP Bob.
Sesame Street,🫡
Sesame Street,"God bless you, Bob."
Sesame Street,Bob taught me about palindromes! His name was spelled the same backwards and forwards.
Sesame Street,"Ohhh, that's sad, I always liked that you could _hear_ that he was smiling when he sang"
Sesame Street,I've got two ey-yeees...
Sesame Street,"Ah man I see this guy like everyday now that my daughter is watching sesame streets and remembered him from my childhood. He impacted so many kids

Bummer"
Sesame Street,"La dee da dee dah La dee dah dee dah
what’s the name of that song?"
Sesame Street,"""BMG was 90. Rip""

Why did you even put that in their article? Fuck! Do better TMZ.


Thank you for all of the years Bob."
Sesame Street,I grew up with him from 1975-1985; my little one who I had late grew up with him from 2016- he retired (or was laid off really). RIP take time to watch him in the Holiday Sesame Street with your family. It won’t disappoint. What a lovely man and legacy!
Sesame Street,"Not unexpected given his age, but still sorry to hear. RIP."
Sesame Street,:(
Sesame Street,He will be greatly missed. He will always be a national treasure.  RIP
Sesame Street,"RIP, Bob.  I enjoyed watching Sesame Street when I was in first grade back in the mid to late 1970s."
Sesame Street,No! I refuse to accept this..
Sesame Street,"I actually owned a Sesame Street LP when I was young. Wore it out. Bob was introduced to new generations of fans who did not know he'd previously been part of Mitch Miller's ""gang"". For a lot of us who grew up into our teenage years in the 70's, this is a gut punch. RIP, Bob."
Sesame Street,That’s so sad but I bet he is enjoying a cocktail in heaven
Sesame Street,"RIP Mr McGrath.

So long, Mr. Starshine"
Sesame Street,"Damn, I always remember him whenever I’m munching on a celery. That scene just sticks with me since childhood."
Sesame Street,Well there goes my Sunday morning.
Sesame Street,A life well lived.
Sesame Street,"Still can't believe that after 45 years, they just dropped him from the show"
Sesame Street,He looks the same as I remember wow
Sesame Street,"Great Hoopers Store in the sky
RIP to a legend"
Sesame Street,Dang.  This guy was one of my favorite adults when I was a tot.
Sesame Street,His performance was like having a friend in your living room. Thank you Bob for entertaining and educating us.
Sesame Street,He sang the neighborhood song.
Sesame Street,This one hit me so hard. Bob was such a formative part of hundreds of millions of childhoods. Billions?
Sesame Street,It's sad he's gone. I can't watch the show because all the voices are wrong
Sesame Street,Best known for that one time he pissed off Ralph Nader as they sang together.
Sesame Street,"What an amazing person and fixture growing up in the 70s.  
So glad you were a person in my neighborhood, Mr McGrath."
Sesame Street,The golden tenor
Sesame Street,First Caroll then Luis now Bob  R.I.P.
Sesame Street,"RIP Bob

Long Live Maria"
Sesame Street,B. Bob. B. Beloved.
Sesame Street,"Say Hi to Mr. Hooper for us, Bob!"
Sesame Street,A sad day- great guy!
Sesame Street,My parents bought their first color tv in the early 70’s so I could watch Sesame Street in color. RIP Bob.
Sesame Street,We loved Bob 🙏
Sesame Street,"Thanks, Bob. You were one of the good ones."
Sesame Street,"Ah bless him, one of our great childhood mentors."
Sesame Street,Saskatchewan will miss him greatly
Sesame Street,"Oh man. People always talk about the Holy Trinity being Steve Irwin, Mr Rogers, and Bob Ross. But Bob absolutely deserves that mantle. I would struggle to think of someone who was more dedicated and more passionate about teaching kids than Bob. He was always the heart of Sesame Street."
Sesame Street,"I sold him a car, true story"
Sesame Street,"He made my days home from kindergarten fun!

Him and Roosevelt Franklin!"
Sesame Street,"Well that’s a Mandela effect for me, I could’ve sworn Bob died several years ago."
Sesame Street,"Those young actors/educators who got in on Sesame Street, parlayed that into amazing, long-lasting careers."
Sesame Street,I remember doing a telethon (variety in Vancouver) tv spot with him in the early 90s. Seemed like a nice dude.
Sesame Street,First Luis now Bob. My poor childhood.
Sesame Street,This one hurts. Godspeed Bob ❤️
Sesame Street,"Rest In Peace, Bob. Thanks for bringing so many happy memories to children all over the world."
Sesame Street,RIP 🥺👋
Sesame Street,oh no!! :(
Sesame Street,Goodbye Bob.
Sesame Street,NO
Sesame Street,Shit was my childhood. Rest easy o7
Sesame Street,"Thank you Bob, RIP."
Sesame Street,Big part of my childhood; thanks for all the lessons Bob. RIP.
Sesame Street,There goes another part of my childhood. What a bummer.
Sesame Street,Fuck that . You are a legend sir.
Sesame Street,"He had such as a warm and friendly presence on *Sesame Street*. His singing of ""People in Your Neighborhood"" is forever ingrained as a childhood memory. Rest in peace, Bob."
Sesame Street,I have clear memories of being a kid and seeing Bob on the TV. A  genuinely nice guy without a bad bone in his body. Thanks for being a good human sir.
Sesame Street,RIP Bob! Tell Mr. Hooper I said hello!
Sesame Street,RIP Bob and thank you
Sesame Street,"Keep Christmas with You is my toddler's favorite Christmas song.

Sesame Street,I'll never forget him!
Sesame Street,"aw, man. Such a positive influence along with the rest of the Sesame Street crew. I'll miss him"
Sesame Street,"He helped teach so many kids. What a life. 

Thank you, Bob, and may you have passed into the Great Hooper’s Store in the Sky. Say hi to Jim, Jerry, Richard, Carroll, Will, Alaina, and Emillio.

EDIT: And how could I forget Northern Calloway, Leonard Jackson, and David Smyrl?"
Sesame Street,"Me, u and hundreds of thousands"
Sesame Street,Right there with you. He was always such a comforting presence when I was watching TV as a little kid.
Sesame Street,"I watched the old Mr. Hooper clip and it brought back so May memories. Kids programming has changed so much. There is no music during this scene, just people talking like adults.

Bling Empire,"I just watched House of Ho, I enjoyed it"
Bling Empire,"Loved the part where prodigal son is sounding like an absolute asshole about not liking his wife, and his cousin was like 'are you sure you want this on tv?'. Don't really get those 'breaking the 4th wall' moments (outside of piece to cameras) in the other shows of its ilk."
Bling Empire,"It was a weird mix between 'reality show' and 'docu-series'

The ending kind of seemed to wrap it up, telling us what they were all up to next, etc but I was kind of hoping to see more of it

I have no idea what Bling Empire is but if it's mentioned as a comparison to House of Ho I will give it a check

My GF was into it, too and it was an easy watch, for me"
Bling Empire,Sounds interesting. Will check it out
Bling Empire,When did this show advertise itself as Asian cultural education? I thought all these shitty reality shows are just about self promotion.
Bling Empire,"Quit watching “reality” shows, problem solved."
Bling Empire,"U.S. media has its niches. Naturally there are people who are willing to fill those niches! I remember when some Italian Americans called Jersey Shore a misrepresentation, can't wait for the next group to be up in arms..."
Bling Empire,"Ew is the perfect description of that website and the ""articles"" it publishes"
Bling Empire,Seriously? I loved this show.
Bling Empire,"As expected this was the weakest week in months for Netflix and a bad week for engagement of TV shows in general with nothing coming close to hitting double figures for the week in the equivalent complete viewings metric. 

Although The Endless Night only finished 6th place in the non-English viewership hours list with 28,330,000 hours that worked out at 7.9 million equivalent complete viewings to be the top show of the week for Netflix in that metric! 

It was a good week for debuting non-English shows as anime Record of Ragnarok s2 hit 7.2 million and Spanish crime show The Snow Girl did 7 million. They were the second and third best performers of the week. 

4th place was That 90s show with 6.8 million. Down 32% on the opening week numbers. The drop was predictable but is obviously not ideal. It has topped 17.5 million over two weeks though so if it is cheap to produce and does not collapse in the next few weeks I still think this has a shot at renewal. Not like many other 30 minute Netflix comedies have performed better since they started releasing the numbers. 

Women at War (4.4 million, +22%), Fauda s4 (2.3 million, +64), and Shahmaran (5 million, +100%) all grew and had OK second weeks. 

Vikings: Valhalla s2 dropped 55% to just 3.9 million in its third week. It is lucky it was ordered for 3 seasons from the get go as these are 100% cancellation numbers. 

Wednesday 5.3 million (-22%) continues to perform for Netflix and show fantastic legs. 

Ginny & Georgia did a 5.7 million fourth week to give it 50.1 million over that run. Excellent numbers. The first season did 42.3 million so it has grown its audience! A definite renewal. Women of the Dead finished its four week run with a solid 13-16.2 million. Nothing special but at least it garnered some eyes. 

Lockwood & Co is DOA. It only managed 4.4 million. It is already dead as these are awful numbers. This is not Cowboy Bebop, Half Bad, or Midnight Club *bad* but it is First Kill level numbers! 

Kings of Jo’Berg s2 (less than 2 million) and Against the Ropes (less than 2.3 million) missed the charts on opening week. 

I expect another quiet week next week but possibly not as bad at the top end as this week. The big show is the On My Block spinoff show Freeridge while the first two seasons of Girls5Eva land on Netflix. On the non English side there is the Indian Elite remake Class arriving. I think Freeridge will beat the high of 7.9 million we got this week but I’m not sure it goes much past double figures."
Bling Empire,"Ginny and Georgia was a lot darker and sexual than I expected, was surprised we didn't have some conservative organization demand a boycott but I guess they were just happy it wasn't gay. Anyways, it was alright and there will definitely be more coming with these numbers.

Wednesday back to number 2, the legs on this show are insane considering it's a pretty paint by numbers show, the power of old IP!

That 90's Show wasn't amazing but it was watchable, sad it didn't get more eyeballs, will probably not get another season. I wish they had made 20 eps, released them in two blocks like they used to do with The Ranch. 

Lockwood & Co. numbers are really good considering it's only been out for less than three days, could get another season, I watched the first two episodes, haven't gone back so we will have to wait and see what that ""finish rate"" is on this show, that is probably what killed First Kill, had a lot of views but so many people abandoned it before finishing."
Bling Empire,">Lockwood & Co is DOA. It only managed 4.4 million. It is already dead as these are awful numbers. This is not Cowboy Bebop, Half Bad, or Midnight Club   
>  
>bad  
>  
> but it is First Kill level numbers!

Ah, yet another Netflix show with close to zero marketing that will likely end up just shy of renewal numbers and then get cancelled. 

I don't fault Netflix for cancelling shows that do badly, but man do they not even try to get certain shows to succeed."
Bling Empire,"Thank man.          
S2 of G&G beat the second season of Witcher?           
I'm hopeful Lockwood will dominate the UK chart for quite some time since Netflix wants the show to be viewed in their own territory. And it was third in US in first two days and now second, so I'm once again hopeful that it gets to first or continues a powerful second for couple of weeks. I really liked it but yeah, numbers are bad."
Bling Empire,oh god I miss Ozark. wonderful show
Bling Empire,"Things worth noting:

- A very disappointing opening week for David E. Kelley’s second Netflix show The Lincoln Lawyer. It got the equivalent of 5.5 million complete viewings. That is not good for an American show and it is a good bit behind the 9 million that British show Anatomy of a Scandal (Kelley’s first Netflix show) opened with last month. Almost feels like the show is DOA. At least it wrapped the season in a fashion that makes it a workable miniseries. 
- The big winner of the week was Welcome To Eden. It got 11.5 million! Up from the 4.8 million it scored in week one. That is a solid boost and gets it into double figures. This show has been a hit for Netflix. 
- Ozark was solid in its third week with 6.8 million. Outdrawing The Lincoln Lawyer and in line with the numbers the first half of the season did earlier in the year. 
- We got 6 new shows on top of The Lincoln Lawyer. None were big hits. Two made the charts. 42 Days of Darkness (2.2 million) and Savage Beauty (2 million). 4 failed to chart. Brotherhood s2 (less than 1.8 million), New Heights (less than 1.5 million), Maverix (less than 2.3 million), and The Life & Movies of Esran Kuneri (less than 1.5 million). Not great! 
- In reality Bling Empire s2 got 2.3 million opening week while Selling Sunset completed its 4th week for a total of 14.8 million. Impressive for Selling Sunset. 
- The Marked Heart (22.8 million), Heartstopper (between 13.9-16.4), and Russian Doll s2 (impossible to tell as it failed to register in the charts a single week!) all completed their 4 week run. Impressive for The Marked Heart! Less impressive for Heartstopper but those numbers are still very solid for a British show. A complete disaster and embarrassment for Russian Doll. 

Shows to look out for next week are Love, Death & Robots s3 in English and The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem (Israeli) and Wrong Side of the Tracks (Brazilian) as well as the start of Korean weekly Welcome to Wedding Hell. 

A bit of a quiet week upcoming. They must be going light in the week before they drop Stranger Things s4 which will undoubtedly be the biggest hit of the year so far. Hopefully that gives The Lincoln Lawyer some time to find an audience!"
Bling Empire,The English shows after Ozark and Lincoln Lawyer are really dead right now. CBC's Working Moms which even as a Canadian I didn't know existed is in the top 5 of both the global and US list.
Bling Empire,Surpised about Welcome to Eden's numbers. I thought it was pretty bad overall and kinda boring on top of that too.
Bling Empire,It looks like time to let my Netflix subscription go until they reload with new content.  Tough to see top notch series like Ozark go and be replaced by generic fodder like The Lincoln Lawyer that was made for CBS but then dropped.
Bling Empire,What do you do when you miss a show? I’m yet to watch the final season of ozark but I know I’m gonna miss it so much when I finish it.
Bling Empire,[deleted]
Bling Empire,"I thought I read on Twitter (the source and fount of all knowledge and wisdom) that Lincoln Lawyer was at no.1 now. I hope it picks up, I really liked it. It being high in the top 10 hopefully encourages more people to give it a shot.

Yes shame about Russian Doll, probably didn’t need a S2 in hindsight but I enjoyed it well enough.
I’m happy to see Clark in the non English language top 10. A bloody good show."
Bling Empire,I re-watch Patriot.
Bling Empire,"Well it\`s Hard but you gotta move on!

I mean Breaking Bad , The Sopranos , The wire &.... are so many perfect shows that I survived and honestly there so many shows that I haven\`t watch yet so...

I watched more than 200 shows but yet there are more to catch up on"
Bling Empire,You should have blacked out that spoiler comment. Not cool.
Bling Empire,"These numbers were for May 9th-15th. The Lincoln Lawyer will be the most popular show next week without a doubt. The second week is the best week for Netflix dramas 9 times out of 10. How big the jump is for The Lincoln Lawyer will be absolutely crucial. If it just jumps to 7-8 million then it is definitely DOA. Netflix shows fade big on the 3rd and 4th weeks. If The Lincoln Lawyer tops out below 20 million over 4 weeks it will get cancelled. We saw the same happen to Archive 81 and Raising Dion s2. If The Lincoln Lawyer can go crazy and hit 12-15 million in week two (a % gain very few Netflix shows achieve) and then turn in a strong 3rd week it might hit bubble show territory in the mid 20s. 

The interesting thing about The Lincoln Lawyer is that it was one of the first American shows ordered at Netflix *after* they changed their TV head back in late 2020. Be interesting to see if that gives this show a renewal advantage if it can get its numbers up to bubble show levels. The other saving grace for The Lincoln Lawyer might be its ability to skew older in the viewership demo than the average Netflix show. 

I quite enjoyed The Lincoln Lawyer and would love to see it renewed. Felt like the sort of show one would find on USA or TNT a decade ago. Fun and engaging but nothing taxing or brilliant. There is still a place for this type of show in my eyes. The other good thing about The Lincoln Lawyer was the way they wrapped most of the ongoing season story arcs so it works pretty well as a satisfying limited series. More Netflix creators need to take this approach just in case the shows do not hit with audiences. 

Russian Doll is a quality show. I preferred the first season but the second season was still pretty good. It is just a pity it has seemingly not found an audience. It does have the advantage of being one of the few comedies Netflix have that they will be able to push at this years Emmy Awards. 

It was nice to see Clark pop up. I’ve not had a chance to get to it as of yet but it is definitely on my list. The trailer hooked me!"
Bling Empire,I don’t know how. I put spoiler and put the spoilers below that.
Bling Empire,"Thanks for that info about Lincoln Lawyer. Will be interesting to see how that develops for sure. If it doesn’t hit the usual benchmarks but still gets renewed it might be a sign of change (which I would welcome).

Also thanks in general for your comments on these top 10 threads. It’s always nice to read some interesting level headed assessment of Netflix titles on this subreddit."
Bling Empire,You should delete it. Not cool.
Bling Empire,What?! Who would keep reading once they see “SPOILERS”? Or read from bottom to top?
Bling Empire,You never know. You should either delete the comment or Google how to blackout the spoiler portion.
Bling Empire,Fine fine
Bling Empire,"Things worth noting:

- The Lincoln Lawyer is the top show of the week. It got a very solid 13.2 million equivalent complete viewings in its second week. It needs strong third and fourth week holds to give it a fighting chance at survival. It is tracking for between 23-27 million over 4 weeks. That is better than recently cancelled shows like Archive 81 and Raising Dion but not significantly better. Be interesting to see if these numbers are enough for a renewal. Pieces of Her is still pending and it did over 30 million.
- Who Killed Sara? S3 had a great first week. It got 10 million! 
- Another good week for Welcome to Eden. It got 5.3 million making it one of those rare Netflix shows that did better week three than on week one. 
- As for other debut shows? It was a great week for Love, Death & Robots s3 (6.7 million), a place in the charts for Wrong Side of the Tracks (2 million), and a failure to chart for The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem (less than 1.3 million). Easy to see from those numbers for Love Death & Robots and Wrong Side of the Tracks just how much runtime can give a distorted impression of a shows true popularity! 
- Ozark s4b and Grace & Frankie s7 wrapped their 4 week runs in the chart. Ozark’s 36.5 million was a million up on the first half of the season while G&F got between 8.5-10.1 million (it failed to chart on its 4th week). Solid numbers for Ozark. Not so great for Grace & Frankie but to be fair to it these numbers are better than most other Netflix comedy shows so far in 2022.
- My Liberation Notes has joined Business Proposal, Our Blues, and Tomorrow in the chart to ensure that even with The Sound of Magic dropping out Korean shows still take up 4/10 slots. The Korean weekly shows are really proving their value as buy-ins for Netflix. 

Not much to look out for next week beyond Stranger Things s4. Netflix obviously expect it to be a Squid Game sized monster hit and have cleared all other shows from its path. Probably a smart thing especially considering The Lincoln Lawyer, Welcome to Eden, LD&R, and Who Killed Sara? should all still have some life left in them and anything new will get crushed by Stranger Things."
Bling Empire,"Lincoln Lawyer isn’t bad. A very network like legal drama.

It feels like a Goliath clone where the lead isn’t as interesting.

I’m still primarily enjoying Love, Death, and Robots for the animation. The stories so far ain’t great."
Bling Empire,It’s a shame [Bubble](https://youtu.be/8pbWblLkHHk) isn’t on this list. It was so good!
Bling Empire,"Happy to see Lincoln Lawyer doing well. I really enjoyed it in a mid 2000s comfort food kind of way and would happily watch another season or 2.

I recommend My Liberation Notes. I started it on a whim and it’s a really well made character drama about depressed and listless adults in their 30s. Not that I can relate to that or anything..."
Bling Empire,"Where can we see these data?

The link provided by op seems to only show 'hours viewed' instead of viewing numbers (unless I missed something). Hours viewed seems to suggest that it doesn't count the difference in numbers of episodes or duration."
Bling Empire,"It just felt unpolished to an extreme degree. I watched the whole thing, and it just felt very formulaic. Not really bad, just not as good as it felt like it should have been. Also I was really not happy with how the story ended with the main client.  


Also as a poker player, that scene with the voir dire expert made me want to throw up. Not only does it fail to show or prove she knows how to read people, its some how more unrealistic then the finale hand from Casino Royale; which is by far the most ridiculous hand of poker that had ever made it to the big screen. The chances of this round of poker occurring is well into the billions to one territory.  


/RANT"
Bling Empire,"Netflix give the viewing hours metric in their weekly charts. It is useful data but I prefer “equivalent complete viewings” as a data point so I use the data Netflix gives alongside the runtime of the show to calculate the equivalent complete viewings data. That data point is far more useful for a direct comparison of any show or movies performance. At least it is in my eyes so I track the data myself.
I share it here in case any others find it a useful companion to the raw viewership hours data provided by Netflix."
Informer,Can’t wait for Baby Gollum.
Informer,And that type of mindset is why all of it won't be as high of quality as it could be.
Informer,I’m so fucking tired of these creatively bankrupt industry ghouls cannibalizing everything they get their hands on. Nothing is sacred to them.
Informer,Don’t you fucking dare.
Informer,"would be a bitter irony if Tolkien's works get turned into a soulless parade of assembly line ""content""

there's nothing sacred to these hacks"
Informer,"Of course it could be as big, but should it?"
Informer,God I'm so bored of franchises.
Informer,">‘The Lord Of The Rings’ IP Broker Says Franchise Can Be As Big As Marvel & ‘Star Wars’,

for my pocketbook"
Informer,But the real question is do people want it…
Informer,"The year is 2122. Only three genres of film are still produced. Medieval Wizards, New York Wizards, and Space Wizards"
Informer,"Important to note that this has nothing to do with the Amazon show. Embracer bought Middle Earth Enterprises which encompases rights that Tolkien sold in the 70's.

Amazon worked directly with the Estate on a new set of rights that is outside of this.

This has more to do with The Jackson films, The upcoming Anime ""War of the Rohirim"", Video Games, theme parks, & merchandise."
Informer,"Everything doesn't have to be a ""franchise.""  The funniest thing to me was when the Firestarter director tried to create a franchise.  

In any event, the way this theoretically works is if you focus on low budget high margin.  How about a rom com/dramedy set in Hobbiton.  A Cheers style mini-series at the Prancing Pony. 

Franchise IP owners tend to make everything such high stakes and high budget, but that's not really necessary."
Informer,That’s what Morgoth would do.
Informer,"I'm not a gamer and haven't owned a current system since the PS3 was a thing, but wouldn't a property like LOTR be better suited to creating a more interactive experience? I just feel like the world building for Middle Earth would be much better suited for that medium than movies or a series."
Informer,"Didn’t it come out that this was Netflix’s pitch? A Gandalf series, a Elrond series, a legolas series, etc? giving each character a movie/tv show? And even though Netflix’s bid was the highest, the Tolkien estate hated the idea so much they rejected it outright"
Informer,"This is one of those rare exceptions were I'd say ""*blank* is rolling in their grave"" and really truly mean it. Tolkien crafted his world with such love and care, and was fiercely protective of it. He absolutely would not approve of what they're doing with his work, and on top of that, would probably be very upset by it. 

A soulless corporation and a team of underqualified showrunners are standing on the shoulders of a genius, and perverting his work. It's gross. There are just some things you don't touch. Nothing is sacred to these people. The words ""just leave it alone"" ring hollow to them."
Informer,For fuck sake do we have to run everything into the ground? You would think this a golden age to be a nerd but i am so fucking sick of it
Informer,"This is where “if it looks like trash, don’t watch it and/or ignore it” comes into play. None of the garbage Jaws sequels ruins the original for me and the same can be said for many other sequels out there. 

The movie industry is all in on franchises right now. The only way they deviate away from it is if people stop seeing that shit. Marvel starts to suck? Don’t pay for it. Same with rings, Star Wars, and so on and so forth.

Also, find a way to bring back the mid-budget action/drama/etc movies! Streaming tore into dvd sales which really helped those get approved."
Informer,Too bad It will also become shit like Star Wars and Star Trek
Informer,Please... for the love of god just make new IPs
Informer,So LOTR is gonna turn into a bloated reanimated corpse like Marvel and Star Wars.
Informer,"LOTR: A new Ring, LOTR: Mordoor Strikes Back, LOTR: Return of the Hobbit, LOTR: The Ring Awakens, LOTR: The Last Hobbit, LOTR: Rise of Baggins..."
Informer,"I always wondered if users like OP /u/VarkingRunesong works for Amazon.

The amount of promotion and work they do online for certain shows exceeds even the wildest superfans I've seen."
Informer,"I’m gonna be honest. I didn’t really mind Star Wars and Marvel becoming how they did because the owners and creators of those IP’s seemed to WANT it to go in that direction. 

George Lucas knowingly allowed what happened to Star Wars. Marvel was ALWAYS going to be what it is now. 

But Tolkien wouldn’t want that. I don’t think he would want 15 shows and 20 more movies and blah blah blah. He didn’t seem like that kind of person."
Informer,not when you completely walled them off from using anything from the First Age
Informer,"In the word of Red Letter Media, ""ENDLESS TRASH"""
Informer,I don’t want Lord of the Rings to be “bigger” than it already is.  It’s one of the most influential novels of the 20th century and one of the most well received film series of all time - I don’t need *anything* else!
Informer,Boy they are in panic mode
Informer,Still wild that Rings Of Power is just based on notes and scraps of LOTR lore…
Informer,NO! NO GOD PLEASE NO! NOOOOOOOOOO!
Informer,Inb4 *The Silmarillion* gets retconned.
Informer,Tolkienburgers for everyone guys. are you ready?
Informer,Oh no ... another toothpick.
Informer,Oh no :(
Informer,Fuck!
Informer,The idea of a LOTR conematic universe hurts my soul
Informer,Make it stop.
Informer,Rings of Power swiftly put an end to that theory.
Informer,If they do to lotr what theve done to SW and Comic books.then LOTR will be just as dead to me like the others.
Informer,I want a different spin on LOTR. Peter Jackson basically set a precedent for what it has to be like. Was very exited for Del Toro version of the Hobbit.
Informer,Wow great. Isn’t this exactly what Tolkien didn’t want to happen? Now his world is about to get fucking ravaged thanks to greed.
Informer,"Can't even deliver a passable TV show and they're already frothing at the mouth for spinoffs and all that shit.

At least in 10 years time when LotR is exhausted and left in shambles after being Marvel'd/whored out for commercialism, we'll still have the original films to enjoy."
Informer,They are going to butcher this in ways we can not yet imagine.
Informer,“We will find a way to ruin this IP as we ruined Star Wars… and that is a good thing!”
Informer,"another cow to milk dry. I pity the 80s and 90s generation, watching all they loved getting slowly assassinated"
Informer,For the love of Eru Ilúvatar can these fucking corporate cunts please just fuck of and rape some other IP’s corpse.
Informer,"I was thinking about this with Star Wars and Andor not doing well despite arguably being one of Star Wars best works in years. Are these worlds really strong enough for this much content? In books and comics where people who really want to find them can get to them sure, but is the world of LOTR and Star Wars so deep it can support a little industry of media around it and only it. Books and comics are cheaper to produce so Star War's expanded universe thrived with a hardcore smaller group of fans but can that keep up when you're producing multiple shows and you need everyone to tune in like it's the next big event? Everyone wants to be Marvel but Marvel is also unraveling a bit now that shows are added to the mix, but at least they have the benefit of very different stories to tell (She-hulk vs Loki). With LOTR you're always kind of stuck with the same kind of fantasy. You can't move into space or magic, or military espionage like Marvel can. People seem to barely be tuning into a single one season show. Can it really obtain Star Wars and Marvel levels of expanded universe when both of those are already straining under their weight?"
Informer,"AKA let's ruin an amazing universe to make trillions.

F these guys..."
Informer,Fuck me that would be so sad
Informer,Where do they get this fucking info lol
Informer,Smaug: Tales from the Dragon's Lair
Informer,"This has nothing to do with Amazon or Rings of Power or television, in fact. It's more about the game and movie rights that the Embracer Group has. Why was this posted here again? Everyone can pack up their pitchforks... (or at least aim it elsewhere)."
Informer,"Not one, not two, not three, not four, but over a hundred movies can be made in the LOTR universe. This isn’t coming from me, a certified film buff said so, and I believe him."
Informer,"Another franchise joins the likes of Star Wars, Marvel, DC, and Harry Potter into going creatively bankrupt. I predict the same to happen to GoT next the way shit’s going."
Informer,"Yay, more franchises!"
Informer,Just don’t sell it to Disney ffs.
Informer,"No it can’t not in that way ….

The $ and time should go to different fantasy franchises which there r tons .. let’s give Brandon Sanderson a spin at the wheel of this"
Informer,Hell yeah! Good shit!
Informer,If it’s done right yeah
Informer,"SW is not big anymore. 
LOTR It’s not a ‘franchise’ but they’ll try and franchise it. Tolkien is dead. Everything you franchise would be pure made up stuff and we all know the LOTR fans are numerous and very fond of that universe. They will never buy it"
Informer,"""We paid a stupid amount of money to make this, so you have to fucking like it"""
Informer,Oh yay now this franchise can be ruined too!
Informer,Has Hollywood ever thought maybe marvel is the only franchise that should be marvel
Informer,It was a bit shit though
Informer,No thanks. I got bored of trying to keep up with all the Marvel stuff. Don't go the way of having to release a new movie or TV show every other month.
Informer,Will it be as sucky
Informer,Ring Wars Trek Part IX: The Shire Fights Back
Informer,"There is just not enough story there to hold that kind of interest. It wasn’t written like a comic it was written like a history. The further you stray from the popular story’s main characters the more you risk losing interest. Unless the storytelling is fire, there’s no way this will work"
Informer,Not every successful ip needs to be pumping something of varying quality more then once a year to be considered good
Informer,"Please, no.

Marvel and Star Wars are a never ending train of mediocrity."
Informer,"“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.”"
Informer,Can be milked to death\*
Informer,"Dude Hollywood needs new blood, even if the source material is good (and played out), it gets ruined in the execution."
Informer,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*deep breath*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Informer,Lord of the Rings isn’t marvel. It isn’t Star Wars. It’s it’s own unique and beloved thing. It can’t be processed and packaged like those things.
Informer,Ring balls 2: The search for more money
Informer,Yeah I'm done
Informer,"Tolkien’s son even had some issues with Peter Jackson’s adaptation, I can’t imagine what Tolkien would think of some of the things in the pipeline"
Informer,"I'd be ok with it being bigger but just a bit. Honestly, Marvel and SW went too big and I got fatigued and burnt out on both after a while."
Informer,It won’t
Informer,"Oh wow, I’m starting to reach that age where everything I loved is being destroyed for money. Is this what Star Trek fans felt?"
Informer,Tolkien deserves so much better.
Informer,"For fuck’s sake, can’t we just let stories end?!

LOTR has a beginning, middle, and end. There’s a reason Tolkein’s sequel plans were never published. We’ve had the whole story, the end! (A proper adaption of the first and second ages COULD be cool if done right, but Rings Of Power showed us how that goes in that hands of modern Hollywood)

Same goes for Star Wars, Lucas’s story had a beginning, middle, and end which is why the Disney stuff feels so awkward and forced 

Just make new stories, even Marvel’s been stretched too thin lately just throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks. ENOUGH"
Informer,Considering how the current MCU is pretty garbage I wouldn't be so quick to say your IP will be like the MCU. Disney is spamming MCU and Star Wars properties.
Informer,"“Tolkien has become a monster, devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time. The chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work, and what it has become, has overwhelmed me. The commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing. There is only one solution for me: to turn my head away.”
-Christopher Tolkien"
Informer,Suddenly I start to understand why Christopher Tolkein never let anyone have the rights.
Informer,JRR Tolkien would be horrified to know this had happened to his IP.
Informer,"For that, it should be good first. Tolkien is spinning in his grave right now."
Informer,Please God no.
Informer,"Can be with good writers. It’s just night and day between the lord of the rings vs house of the dragon in terms of writing. 

Amazon finally did figure out how to do good visuals which is good. 

They just need to work on hiring better writers because they are terrible at pacing."
Informer,Not with shows like ROP.
Informer,"Imagine the hubris of these cunts, looking at the prototype for all fantasy and thinking ‘this thing has potential’."
Informer,Not with RoP being this shit lmfao.
Informer,"No, not everything needs a cinematic universe. Marvel and DC comics can do it because the comics served as a template for many many years before the movies were a thing... And Warner Brothers still can't get the DCU right."
Informer,damn so Hunger games and Harry Potter should be TV shows too now huh? Then Junnie B Jones and Captain underpants can have their extended series runs. Woah cinematic universes everwyhere.
Informer,They are going to milk every frnachise to the point of overdose
Informer,Any particular reason this was posted here?  Seems out of place since it talks about movie and gaming rights and of course does not include TV rights since Amazon has those.
Informer,"lmao every fear I had about this shit show is coming true. 

Consume your LOTR slop and get excited for more slop."
Informer,Fuck off you greedy gremlin
Informer,God damn can they just please stop fucking with everything?
Cheat,"His accent indicates he isn’t from Hawaii. I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to suggest that his body is being shipped to his loved ones? Also, a prestigious resort like that will want to clean up a mess ASAP so getting rid of the body and returning to normal operations is something they’d invest in…"
Cheat,"I can see your point but I find it fitting with the story.

The only way the working man can leave with the “elite” is dead."
Cheat,My wife reasoned it was headed by to Honolulu for the medical examination.
Cheat,"I thought if Shane and Rachel were headed to Tahiti for the second leg of their honeymoon, they may have a layover in Australia which is why Armond’s body was also on the flight."
Cheat,this crossed my mind early on the show so i always ruled him out. I like the accent theory. He’s definitely not from there.
Cheat,"As far as that last scene goes, Tanya and Greg were on their way to Honolulu, that's a local puddle jumper flight, they wouldn't have been on the flight back to the mainland with the Mossbachers."
Cheat,"All flights from Maui fly back to Honolulu before separating out to international flights. The timing is definitely fast, but there's a chance that it wasn't the next day since I'm sure the police would have done a full investigation before letting people just leave and fly to other countries"
Cheat,"He had parents in the US and they requested his body as soon as were informed on his death, also Maui is hot place for keeping body so shipping body asap was all sides interest"
Cheat,"A little, but I was more disappointed that >!Rachel went crawling back to the douche. !< Great show though and Season 2 also a blast."
Cheat,That’s an interesting observation. It would make more sense to be buried in Maui and I don’t remember if the show explained why he would be shipped out.
Cheat,I assumed they sent his body back to family in New Zealand or something.
Cheat,"I think HBO glitched while I was watching it because I never saw what happened about why there was a dead body in a box. I had to ask my friends what happened. And I like the show, but I don't think it makes much sense"
Cheat,It's not uncommon for employees of nice hotel chains to have deals to go work at other locations for a while. He has an Australian as well so not from Hawaii. Extrapolating a bit but I didn't find it made sense.
Cheat,"I mean the guy is pretty clearly from New Zealand so it's weird his body was put on an east bound plane. 

&#x200B;

Admittedly I know nothing about flying in or out of Hawaii but I feel like you'd go west for New Zealand?"
Cheat,"I figured sending it to next of kin as well. 

It's not like the police needed it for an investigation. They know what happened."
Cheat,"What bugged me is that the body was on the same flight as the rich kid newlywed and his wife.  Armand was a Aussie/Kiwi/something like that, so his body would have been flown west to be laid to rest.  The American couple would've flown east.  

They wouldn't have been on the same flight."
Cheat,"My problem is how fast it happened. If you die today I feel like there isn't much chance for you to arrange transport on such short notice for tomorrow. But, I've never shipped a body so I suppose I don't know."
Cheat,It would go to the morgue lol they wouldn’t need to ‘clean up the body’ by shipping it away.
Cheat,"Well I guess status doesn't matter if ""living with people"" involves sneaking into people's appartments and shitting in peoples luggage"
Cheat,"I can guarantee there are no direct flights from Maui to Tahiti, so this is at least plausible."
Cheat,"While I think it’s good thinking, I think he’s just using his own Australian accent. I doubt they looked for anyone with a specific accent when casting Armond. 

Yes, he could have had relatives away from Maui regardless of accent and he’s being sent to them, but it was probably just a move to throw viewers off. 

I like the symbolism of the working man leaving with the rich elites dead, but I think it probably isn’t much deeper than that. The show runners wanted to throw viewers off. I think it worked."
Cheat,Tanya is worth half a billion. She doesn’t fly commercial.
Cheat,"Did they say he had parents on the mainland? I might have missed that. Otherwise I’d expect his body to go to Australia or NZ. Also, the have A/C in Hawaii, especially at a morgue lol."
Cheat,You’re bad at this
Cheat,Not to mention he was stabbed while breaking into a guest room!   Just seems…fast and inexplicable.
Cheat,"No, YOU glitched. Put the joint down."
Cheat,Incorrect! They were continuing their honeymoon in Tahiti
Cheat,"They were going to Honolulu to continue their honeymoon, so the international flight probably jumps off from there."
Cheat,"I never shipped a body either but I’m a minority in the US and when someone dies in the community but their family lives where I was born, the body gets shipped back fast. I’ve seen it happen a couple times growing up so I guess it didn’t strike me as too weird."
Cheat,"Right, a morgue if they didn’t know where to send the body to. He died at his place of employment so chances are they had his emergency and/or family contacts. 

Also, I don’t mean a physical clean up. I meant moving past an incident quickly so it doesn’t reflect on their business poorly."
Cheat,"No they didn't, it's like an uncertain assumption scriptwriters left for viewers to figure out by themselves. For sure he could be from anywere and yes definetely morgues in Hawaii is a thing, so it could be some financial conveniense for relatives, kind of funeral insurance idk. Anyways show deserve credit just for this hook with body in begining that made viewers eather watch whole season or google to find out whos body it was."
Cheat,"Sorry, my bad"
Cheat,Ooh really?  I missed that.  Thank you!
Cheat,Perhaps the only criminal medical examiner’s office is in Honolulu?
Cheat,"Could be, but I think they were on Maui.  It has international service, too, especially for the Pacific airlines."
Cheat,They actually referenced several times throughout the show that they were heading to Honolulu next. So I suppose the question is whether the body *needed* to go to Honolulu first. But it’s definitely not headed east to the US.
Cheat,Maui doesn’t have international service.
Cheat,"Yeah, but that plane in question looked like a Hawaiian Boeing 717, which is what they use inter-island. The plane had twin engines on the tail; The planes used by Hawaiian to fly from Hawaii to the mainland or international are all Airbuses with twin wing-mounted engines."
Cheat,that’s ironic given (partly) what the show is about…
Cheat,Good old Hollywood accounting by Hollywood guys.
Cheat,¿Dónde está la plata?
Cheat,What is this?  AMC?
Cheat,"he made that dreadful Robocop remake, he deserves to pay for that. Jk, this is shit if real"
Cheat,"I think there is a lot of shady shit going on at Netflix and other streaming services when it comes to money.  
   
It's very hard to define profits, revenue etc. And much easier to conceal/move some stuff that it would be for traditional theater/broadcast releases."
Cheat,o plomo
Cheat,"I mean, he wanted to make that Robocop film match Narcos and his Tropa de Elite movies (those films are brutal btw).  Gritty realism and extreme violence, social themes, and cops versus criminals are things he has long explored well.  In typical Hollywood fashion, the studio execs stamped down on Robocop, much to his frustration."
Cheat,Netflix didn't produce Narcos though.
Cheat,"They were/are the main distributor, so most of the money goes through them or is affected by their statistics etc.  
   
But like I said, I was talking about streaming in general."
Cheat,"I love Twin Peaks. Even season 2, which is better on rewatch. That middle section is a bit rough, but it all pulls together in the end, and there are no fully bad episodes.

That being said, the Evelyn plot can go to hell. It's completely pointless.

I've always felt that it was the victim of a last minute rewrite, possibly due to Lynch and Frost returning for the final few episodes.

It's structurally weird. James rides off from Twin Peaks on his bike leaving Donna behind, meets Evelyn, gets in over his head (not easy with that head), and Donna saves his ass. So James...rides off on his bike leaving Donna behind again. What exactly was achieved here?

The logical thing would be for James to realize how much he needs Donna, and for them to leave town (and the show) together, getting a mutual happy ending. Buuuut then someone decided that Donna had to stick around so she could be one of the decoy victims in the beauty pageant and also a prop in Ben Horne's arc where it turns out she's his kid. So she needs to stay. So James just leaves, which he was doing anyway. So the subplot might as well have never happened.

Just my theory."

Cheat,The West Wing - Toby being the leak
Cheat,"The murder and coverup or the Santiago plot, both from Friday Night Lights season 2."
Cheat,"The one that happened during the end of Bones season 6. It’s been a decade and I’m still salty about how the entire buildup of Booth and Brennan was gutted like that. Talk about jumping the shark. And I know there was an IRL reason for it, but I can still be peeved the writers handled it that way."
Cheat,The Suits storyline where they made an AI based on Donna that ended up being too mean.
Cheat,"They should just remove every episode of Weeds that took place after the town burned down

It would have been a solid ending and we would have been spared the last 1-2 seasons which were rough"
Cheat,"Arrow, that whole felicity in a wheelchair nonsense where the show just became about her. Arrow had some real low lows but that was the worst."
Cheat,"Friends. The entire Joey falls in love with Rachel story line. It got uncomfortable, didnt work & wasnt necessary."
Cheat,"The 100, season 7 when Bellamy goes all religious fanatic and Clarke kills him. Like what."
Cheat,"Deb's ""growing"" feelings for her brother in season 7 Dexter. No, thank you"

Cheat,The cartel plot in Sons of Anarchy.
Cheat,"Connor and Cordelia’s “relationship”, season 4 of Angel"
Cheat,"A few subplots from Lost that added nothing and we’re weird…

Charlie’s bizarre non heroin Baptisim trip. 

Boone in love with his sister.

Ben obsessed with Juliet."
Cheat,"euron from game of thrones

i know he’s in the books, but at that point in season 7 we’re already beyond them, so who cares. shoehorning him into the dany storyline, creating this fake love triangle, etc.

you spend the season six finale clearing the board for the endgame, then add all this superfluous bullshit with ‘ol captain jack finger in the bum"
Cheat,Dwight should have been manager from season 8 on. Fuck Andy.
Cheat,The theater troupe in season 3 of Deadwood. Might have worked if s4 had happened and it had been capitalized on in some way. But as it is it's the one part of the show that feels entirely pointless on rewatch. Brian Cox is quite a talent to waste on that plotline as well.
Cheat,"Gilmore Girls - Rory and Dean getting back together when he was married to Lindsey.  Dean was so pathetic by this time, and it was completely unnecessary to the storyline.  Also putting it in the same episode when they finally put Lorelai & Luke together."
Cheat,"I'm rewatching The Mandalorian to get ready for season 3 and I think the answer for this show is easily Boba Fett. All the other character reappearances make sense for the overall plot of the season of Mando tracking down a Jedi to hand Grogu off to... except Boba Fett. He inexplicably pops up out of absolutely *nowhere*, has nothing to do with the plot other than promising to help Din track Grogu down (which Din does via Bill Burr without much help from Boba Fett anyway) and then he leaves.

And then yeah, Book of Boba Fett was weirdly bad. His motivation throughout is unclear and not a whole lot *really* seems to happen. He takes over a town in Tattooine for some reason, I guess relating to him wanting to have some kind of clan? Family? I have no idea. It has nothing to do with Din or Grogu though.

It'd be pretty easy to retcon him out of the episode where Grogu gets kidnapped, simply not make Book of Boba Fett, and then start Mandalorian S3 with the two (incredible) episodes of Book of Boba Fett that are entirely focused on Din and/or Grogu... and don't feature Boba Fett at all."
Cheat,"Angel Season 4

Cordelia & Connor. It really is a fabulous season outside of that story line. A story line which we have since confirmed was designed by Joss Whedon solely to punish Charisma Carpenter for being pregnant. So it's shit both on it's face as a storyline and behind the scenes."

Cheat,24: Kim and that mountain lion or cougar or whatever the fuck that nonsense was for a serious show in its prime.
Cheat,"How I Met Your Mother - the entire ending storyline.  Throwing away the character growth from Robin and Barney, turning The Mother into a way for Robin to not want kids but still end up with Ted, ignoring the years of storytelling that Ted and Robin just don't work together, etc.  All so they could use the ending they filmed 8 years earlier that no longer fit the story they had told."
Cheat,The Beverly Hillbillies frog man arc.
Cheat,The Tritter story arc on *House*.
Cheat,The main victim in True Detective S2. Nobody was invested in that character and it made the whole story convoluted.
Cheat,"Doctor Who and the Timeless Child. Over time I have started to accept it, but it wasn’t handled well, blatantly broke the “show, don’t tell” rule, and was literally chucked down the garbage chute in the end."
Cheat,"I’d adjust the ending of White Lotus season 2 to be a huge misunderstanding between Tania/Portia and the gays. This would require erasing Jack’s drunken ramblings to Portia and the picture of Greg in the villa. I’d want Tania to be coked up and paranoid that the gays were trying to kill her, so she’d kill them just like in the show, but in fact they were just fabulous and trying to show her a good time. Then she’d still get away with it because of her wealth."
Cheat,REVENGE: David ending up being alive the whole time and falling (back) in love with Victoria
Cheat,The mystic parts of Rambaldi in Alias. Alias was a decent show about spies when Rambaldi was not a focal point.
Cheat,How I Met Your Mother. Just cut out the whole last season if your going to ruin it by killing off the mother so Robin and Ted can be together. Cristin Milioti was a scene stealer and her character deserved better.
Cheat,Toby’s arc in the final season of the West Wing.
Cheat,I also hated the storyline in Orange is the New Black with the panty business
Cheat,Haley getting pregnant with twins in modern family
Cheat,"Season 4 of Prison Break. Even if they kept doing the show, and they shouldn't have, the whole Homeland Security stuff was just dog shit."
Cheat,Enterprise:  the entire temporal cold war.  Without it we might have been actually given a show about a fledgling Starfleet/Federation and all the intrigue and political drama that promises.
Cheat,The fake serial killer plot in the Wire season 5. That plot weighed down an otherwise fantastic season.
Cheat,Person of Interest: Removing any of the out of nowhere romance between Caviezel and Taraji P Henson's characters. They were a great duo without any romance needed. Having Reese profess his love for her just as she dies was ridiculous and unearned.
Cheat,"The Impossible Girl from Doctor Who. The convoluted plot turned Clara into a plot device instead of a character. Fortunately she got better, but series 7B was rough."
Cheat,The aging pill from Oz.
Cheat,Supernatural-the whole Nick/Lucifer story in S14? just beyond unnecessary
Cheat,The entire Terminus plotline in Foundation.
Cheat,Brooklyn Nine Nine's baby storyline. Just felt like they threw it in because that's what the average viewer expects as the natural progression of love between two people. But it felt kinda forced and didn't pay off in a comedic sense. I love the rest of the series but I cringe a little bit on rewatches.
Cheat,Malcolm in the Middle - last season entirely undoing all the growth Fracis and his wife had.
Cheat,"Lucifer's daughter

The whole plot of having to abandon her for 18 years, because he did it before, so if he doesn't do it this time she'll cease to exist?  That's all garbage.

Having Lucifer be forced to abandon Chloe and his daughter for the last 18 years of Chloe's life is just ridiculous, and soured what I thought was a decent final season outside of that."
Cheat,Deb falling in love with dexter
Cheat,"Kwan Ha's story in Halo. Like literally just delete the character.

I remember when S1 finished realising ""hang on, her entire story was fucking pointless and had zero impact on anything"" despite so much time spent covering it.

I'm not watching S2 of Halo so I don't particularly care, but it still strikes me as one of the easiest fixes of easily removing something to make a show better."

De Geheimen van Barslet,"Would love stats on how many of these ads are celebrity-based versus the past few years. Feels like an uptick compared to usual.

I feel like (maybe for us older people) we usually remember (or rewatched in primetime compilation specials) Superbowl ads that relied on a clever concept, interesting visual, and/or big punchline. Now that they all want to go viral, it's a lot of Fallon/Corden-level 'jokes' of celebrities saying their catchphrase or lightly mocking their image (or worse, just... Being there) which may get a smirk in the moment but isn't memorable an hour later. Who's going to remember that Scorsese/Jonah Hill ad a month from now?"

Superstore,"Bo, Cheyenne's ridiculous boyfriend. He stole every scene and he has probably some of the best lines in any modern sitcom. I laughed my ass off every time he was on the screen."
Superstore,"Loved it. It’s the type of show I enjoy watching before falling asleep. It has one of my favorite lines: ""*You don't like to lead. You prefer to sit to the side and make snarky comments like a balcony muppet*""."
Superstore,"I got bored with it, but thought it had a real sweetness that is absent in most shows. It seemed affectionate towards it's characters instead of making fun of them."
Superstore,"I started watching it about a month ago, after watching the first episode round a friend’s house. I’ve enjoyed it so far, but I’ve just started s6 and it feels a little broken. Obviously, you feel the loss of America Ferrera, but also, all the characters are much more hostile and harsh with each other now. I suspect most of it is due to the logical development of every character being more stressed out by the pandemic, but they all seem much less friendly than they used to be. Or maybe it’s just that I’m not comfortable with the pandemic as a setting for a comedy.

Plus, I feel like they didn’t commit enough to the Mateo ICE storyline in s5. The end of s4 was so incredibly bold, and then they just … didn’t really follow it up? He’s back after a couple of episodes, and it’s pretty much like nothing happened at all after that."
Superstore,"The Office/ Parks and Rec are A-tier. Superstore is really really good, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sitcoms, but I would say it’s B-tier."
Superstore,"The show is hilarious. I loved it from the start. The cut in/aways are amazing, and never failed to make me laugh. It was created by Justin Spitzer who was a writer in the office. 

If you really look at it,  the same characters are there. Dina is Dwight without a doubt.  Amy and Jonah are essentially Jim and Pam, Garrett is Darryl. 

I'm really simplifying it,  but you can sort of see The Office characters traits and oddities show up in Superstore. 

It is a great show and one of the ones other than The Office that I am in a consistent re-watch state, pretty much at all times.

Edit: Added a word I missed."
Superstore,"It started strong, but each season was a little less than the one before."
Superstore,It saved me during lockdown and I often rewatch it - the cutaways to the shit customers do always made me cackle.
Superstore,"Superstore is kind of funny, but not great. The writing wasn't as good as those shows, that is the reason it isn't put on the same level as actually well written shows."
Superstore,"I liked the show but it’s not anywhere near the level of The Office, Parks & Rec, Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Good Place which all seem to have that Schur magic.
Simply put, it’s a nice show but not that funny."
Superstore,Season 2 of Superstore is a legit banger.  Every single episode of that season is hilarious.  Not one dud.
Superstore,"For me, the best funniest recent series that was hilarious from start to finish was Detroiters. Great News was fantastic as well."
Superstore,Parks & Recs was rough the first season. Superstore had its lulls & never peaked as high as the others you mentioned. Not an all time great but one I could see a decade from now someone “discovering” & making a Reddit post about how no one talks about it
Superstore,I watched most of it but for me it wasn’t even close to the office or parks. Characters are mostly forgettable and I didn’t think it was all that funny. Just my opinion.
Superstore,Because it's no where near as funny as the other shows you listed.
Superstore,Because it’s not really funny. It’s only good for a few chuckles now and then.
Superstore,I didn't find it nearly as clever as the other shows you mentioned. It always felt corny to me
Superstore,"I would say the show was charming and good natured, not funny.

Also I feel it doesnt get as chaotic in general because of the very nature of the workplace. I've seen crazier videos in the internet that what the show presents. The funniest part is corporate but other shows already have done it while focusing more significantly on that corporate side."
Superstore,"Superstore was funny. I don’t think on the same level as Parks and Rec or The Office, or even B99 funny (if we’re talking monumentary/single-camera style sitcoms)

Thinking back to the three latter shows, I can recall several memorable moments. But with Superstore, I really have to dig deep for those “oh, remember the episode where [insert character] did/said ______ ?!” kind of moments."
Superstore,I feel a big issue was by the time it started in 2015 a lot of audiences(particularly younger people) were looking to streaming for the next big show. The people that tend to drive the pop culture conversation just weren’t watching network shows anymore. Personally I remember keeping up with every new season of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt but didn’t really catch Superstore until it was several seasons in.
Superstore,"Loved the show, did not like either of the main characters. 

Both Jonah and Amy were annoying, and the 'will they wont they' bit they did from the start seemed beyond cliche and I just didn't care at all. 

But the supporting cast was amazing and really sold the show imo."
Superstore,Definitely had the best ending out of Office and Parks and Rec
Superstore,Loved the show as well. The shows finale was one of the best sitcom endings I've seen.
Superstore,I loved it. It really made me miss working at Walmart. That's impressive.
Superstore,"An underrated comedy series to be sure. Are some seasons better than others? Yes, but having said that I don't feel that it has a ""bad"" season, nor do I recommend skipping the first season ""because it hasn't gotten it's groove yet"". The characters are hilarious yet relatable and endearing. It can be a little preachy at times (this is coming from someone who is pro union and despises ICE) but all in all I love this series and recommend it whenever I can!"
Superstore,"I lost interest around the time it became apparent that they were going full steam ahead with the Jonah-Amy relationship arc. I never felt like those two had any business being together, and from the one episode I saw post-them becoming official it looks like they never developed any chemistry and it was just kind of painful to watch. I like them better as frenemies"
Superstore,"Amy never made sense to me as a character.  It's weird to make the lead so unlikable. She was awful to her coworkers, her higher-ups, her husband, her closest friends, her love interest and her daughter. I love to rewatch every now & then & she gets worse every time."
Superstore,"I recommend this show to people all the time for that very reason. It never feels stale which is impressive for a show that survived six seasons. Even more impressive was the way the creators adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic. They didn’t try to come up with a clever way of shooting without masks and they didn’t try to act as though the characters lived in a world where the outbreak didn’t exist; they donned their masks, acknowledged the pandemic and did their best to showcase the comical side of the situation. And I love how unlike a lot of other shows, even short-lived characters feel fleshed out. Jonah’s parents only appear in 2 episodes and I still feel like we learn enough about them to understand why Jonah is the way he is.

Edit: I do have to agree with the other commenters though that it’s not completely hilarious, it’s a more mild comedy with the occasional hard hitting comical moment."
Superstore,Watch Abbott elementary
Superstore,"I think I ended up liking Superstore more than the office. Over time the office lost its charm. The characters all just got to be annoying people to imagine working with, and thus made watching it aggravating. I did find the supercut episodes refreshing, they put a very different feel to the show imo."
Superstore,I'd say it was miles better than both the office and Parks n Rec in how it dealt with real-life issues of being part of the soul sucking capitalist system. I'd never imagine a big network show that would go against the grain as much as it did with themes of workers rights and alienation.
Superstore,"Superstore had high school level jokes. I told my wife that there wasn’t an episode that didn’t have some reference to bathroom humor. Also, the characters were so cliché that every box was checked."
Superstore,"I like this show better than The Office and Parks and Rec. Having worked in a big box store for almost a decade, I can say, the personalities are spot on. Especially Dina LoL. I had a friend who got promoted to assistant manager, and it literally became his personality. Great show!"
Superstore,"It was pretty bland, I gave up during season 3."
Superstore,"I mean, I love Superstore, but it’s miles off the Office or P&R, and then again miles off even funnier shows.

It was definitely just comfort watching - nice, easy, and inoffensive."
Superstore,Watched 10 episodes and never cracked more than a smirk. I don't think it was anywhere near the quality of the other shows you mentioned. Not even close.
Superstore,Would have been better overall if they lost that last season.  I did enjoy it though.  Always love seeing one of the Kids in the Hall.
Superstore,I worked in retail over 10 years ago.  I still have PTSD from it and cannot enjoy the show.
Superstore,"I will have to give it another go, because for some reason it just didn’t click for me."
Superstore,"Superstore was Good but not Great. I can't explain exactly what it was missing, but you cant compare it to the Office or Parks and Rec as both of those had the same quality of actors, quirky characters, compelling storytelling, and most importantly 100% rewatchable. I have seen every episode of Office, Parks, and Rec dozens of times and still find it funny and watchable. I cant say the same for Superstore even though I really enjoyed it."
Superstore,"I can't get into this show at all. Just isn't funny in my opinion. The jokes just come off as desperate or flat out bad. 

No where near the same level as The Office, or Parks."
Superstore,"Hard disagree. I liked the show and thought it had some funny lines, but went sharply downhill the last 2 seasons which honestly ruined the show for me."
Superstore,"Loved most of it but that last season is a bit tough to get through, it's been in the to watch list for a while now. Should just finish it"
Superstore,It's a good show but no where near that level Imo. Too many squeaky clean and cringe moments the other shows just don't have.
Superstore,I’m a couple of seasons behind but I always laughed at Sandra especially during the tornado lol.
Superstore,">Superstore is one of the last series I could say was consistently funny from episode 1 to the series finale

You've clearly never seen Derry Girls then. That's a right crackin' fine show there, that is. A real ride. You'd know that if you weren't so daft or if you listened to Uncle Colm's stories more."
Superstore,"Because it came later and wasn't as funny. There were some good episodes but if I had two bullets and those three shows in the room, I'd shoot Superstore twice."
Superstore,"I really liked superstore and thought it was consistently funny. But it's not a mockumentary like the office and parks and rec. That's the biggest reason I don't compare them. 

The other big reason for me is that Jonah and especially Amy are not likeable characters.  He is a self inflated doosh and she is never able to get past the chip on her shoulder. 

The wonderful supporting characters save the show from failing but the leads (Jonah and Amy) stop it short of it's potential.

By all means if you love the show keep on loving it, but that's what drops it several notches for me."
Superstore,the bits with the weird shoppers are the best
Superstore,The office was just ok. Don’t understand everyone’s love for it.
Superstore,"Yeh don't agree with this take at all.

The Jonah and Amy relationship is a clear knock off of Jim and Pam.

Dina is a poor version of Dwight (weirdo who is competent about at their job they compare deeply about). 

The jokes and storylines are certainly not 'organic'. Think I clocked out when Jonah walked around the store naked over a dare or some shit."
Superstore,"It was a show worth a once over. Supporting cast was far superior to the two boring leads, never before have I been so disinterested in a show's lead characters.. 

Final season was garbage though."
Superstore,"because it came after Parks and Recs and the Office, which defined this type of comedy. it's a copy cat.

and now there is Blockbuster coming to Netflix, which is the same fuckin thing. And it doesnt look that good, which makes me sad since i worked at BB once upon a time."
Superstore,I've always looked at Superstore as what the Office would have been if network executives got ahold of it.
Superstore,"It's funny and good but not close to The Office, P&R, or Seinfeld.
Compared to most 'comedies' in TV today, it's great, but all-time, not so much."
Superstore,"It wasn’t that funny, that’s why it’s not rated the same"
Superstore,Really? It was funny but I couldn’t put any of those people in a Walmart. That was the problem for me. They should have gotten more no name actors that hadn’t had orthodontics. I wasn’t interested in continuing to watch America Ferrera pretend to be someone who works at a Walmart. At a certain point it’s more like weird poverty porn.
Superstore,Final season was straight garbage. A rare show where the supporting cast was far more interesting than the leads from pilot to finale.
Superstore,It was a delight watching live back to back with The Good Place.  A real quality night of TV
Superstore,"Because its not good imo. I couldn't get past the first episode, really didn't like it"
Superstore,Superstore hits that retail PTSD for too many people to be widely popular.
Superstore,"Because it's simply not as funny as Parks & Rec or The Office. 

I was bored of superstore after the first season."
Superstore,Really?? I thought that show sucked. Soz.
Superstore,"It’s not at the same level of the Office, Parks and Rec, etc. because it’s unremarkable.

Don’t get me wrong, I found it consistently funny from the first episode to the last. I laughed hard at a lot of the jokes, which says more about my sense of humor than the quality of the comedy.

The main thing is that none of the jokes stand out. None of them are memorable. 

Superstore is like a series made up of all the jokes you and your coworkers ever cracked, but none of the “for the books” moments. That’s why it’s really funny, but unremarkable, and thus not legendary."
Superstore,"I tried watching it, I chuckled a couple times, but most of the humor felt forced to me"
Superstore,"It doesn’t get put on the level of The Office, P&R, because it tops out at a grade school level of humour

The Office, P&R, Arrested Development (S1-3), Seinfeld, these are all considered comedy classics for the most part because they require cultural knowledge to understand the humour - there are throwback pop culture references, god-tier puns, winks or digs at things outside the show universe, jokes you miss the first time and only realize on future watches - where shows like Superstore or for example Space Force fail is in barfing out a style of humour that should be so appealing to everyone that it only appeals to people without the attention span for a deeper humour

Simply put, it’s grade school laughs. As an adult, I like jokes that require a certain level of intelligence to fully appreciate, and I like when they don’t linger"
Superstore,It was funny until it got preachy. Why does every show have to do this now?
Superstore,I disagree. The show started very funny but the last two seasons just weren’t. They were mediocre at best and I couldn’t get my wife to watch with me anymore because it seemed like the show had no point for a really long stretch.
Superstore,"I thought it was very consistent overall. Definitely on par with Parks and Rec, and honestly a bit better at times. Parts of Parks and Rec like the put down Jerry thing or Jean Ralphio I did not find particularly funny.

Superstore is also one of the rare instances where I didn’t mind when the lead character disappeared. Amy got a bit annoying after >!She became manager!<. And I thought the finale wrapped up things well.

I also loved Brooklyn 99, but it got more absurd over time to the point where the last season was almost unwatchable."
Superstore,Obviously this thread shows how subjective comedy is because I think superstore is every bit as good as the office and more consistently funny than parks and rec and b99. I rewatch it constantly and I love how they incorporate politics. I told my bf to watch it and he hated it after 1/2 episodes but I told him to try again and now he's on his third rewatch and absolutely dies at most episodes.
Superstore,"It was solid until Covid was written into the show, followed by several other current events. Felt very forced."
Superstore,"I think I laughed maybe one time at this show, but it was such a soulless husk and an embarrassing attempt at capturing the magic of The Office. It wasn’t painful, just horribly empty, bland and forgettable sitcom."
Superstore,"Whoa whoa whoa, let’s not get carried away. It was decent but nothinggg compared to The Office and Parks"
Superstore,"Because, straight up and honestly is just is NOT as funny and not as good quality. It's a 7ish, maybe an 8. Parks and Rec is a 9 or 10. There is a noticeable difference."
Superstore,"I think that Superstore lacks this absolut Pitch perfect couple. Amy and Jonah for me, never had the chemistry that Jim & Pam or Leslie and Ben had. 

I think it was good, but not on par with the great ones."
Superstore,"As someone who did retail for way too long they actually dropped the ball a bit IMO.

There should have been more of a focus on the characters dealing with crazy ass customers rather than wacky coworkers. That’s the true entertainment in retail.

Still a good show, but could have been legendary."
Superstore,Because it's not even as remotely funny as any of the shows you listed.
Superstore,">I have no clue how this show doesn't get put on the same level as the Office, Parks and Rec, etc.

Because most people don't think that highly of it.

It's not as funny as those other shows."
Superstore,It was funny.  The manager guy is too irritating and overused.  He intrude on everything. Ruins the show for me.
Superstore,I really enjoyed the show but i never finished it.bi forget why. I felt similarly about brooklyn 99. Just lose steam at the end for me.
Superstore,This show has so many priceless moments and great characters. I especially love the Halloween episodes.
Superstore,"Annual rankings in the US Nielsen ratings (2015-2021): 66, 91, 102, 113, 87, 100"
Superstore,I love this hilarious show!!!
Superstore,"Wife and I were at a family event yesterday where kids were encouraged to dress up. One kid was dressed up as a hot dog... first thing I did was look at my wife and with my best Glen voice I said "" I'm a hot dog !'."
Superstore,"It's ok, but not the best. I'm always down for a rewatch, but Ultimately every episode is ""x character takes something out of context/overreacts"" and that gets old"
Superstore,One of favorites.  Literally have done more rewatches on this show than any other.
Superstore,Its not been long enough. Give it 5/10 years and it'll be cult status
Superstore,"Because Office and Parks and Rec etc. have you laughing so hard you can't breathe.

I like Superstore, but it was more like a consistent chuckle throughout."
Superstore,"It was so under-rated. Having worked I. Retail for years, they got so many little things right too."
Superstore,It's not funny and seeing another token gay asian man acting like a fool on tv disgusts me
Superstore,It's an awesome show if you like to get lectured.
Superstore,Because your opinion is false. The show fell victim to most shows at the time and went political.
Superstore,Because it wasn’t consistently funny and the pacing was odd.  I like it for what it is but it dropped the ball in some ways.
Superstore,I do. I've watched all 3 shows and it's nowhere near as good as the others you've mentioned.
Superstore,"I think it's a good show, but it feels very derivative of those shows without adding anything new. God that sounded pretentious."
Superstore,Because it's not even close to being as good. It's a middle of the road show that'll be forgotten in about five minutes.
Superstore,"Characters are much less interesting than Parks and Office. There is not much funny stuff going on, its just a cliche love story."
Superstore,"I know this is just on the surface and i am probably missing out, but I cant stand that lead male actor.  I dont know what it is, but I just cant do it."
Superstore,"I saw similar post somewhere about Ted Lasso and started to watch it. My god, that was horrible to watch. I literally felt nauseated watching the 2nd season."
Superstore,overall i enjoyed it but that show is just too close to reality at times
The Treflik Family,"""Saved By The Bell"" was originally ""Good Morning Mrs Bliss"" where the teacher was the lead and the students side characters. It was cancelled after 13 episodes and retooled as SBTB with the kids as the leads  ~~and the new principal Belding~~ and no Mrs. Bliss.

EDIT: I misread the Wikipedia article. Belding was in the original ""Good Morning Mrs. Bliss"
The Treflik Family,Family Ties was Meredith’s show then MJF became so popular. What a born star
The Treflik Family,Happy Days with the Fonz
The Treflik Family,"The Fonz and Urkel are basically the gold standards of this.  Far and away the most well-known.

My favorite example, other than those two, is the Green Power ranger.

He (and the Tommy character) not only took over the original show, but he took over like 3 shows after that one."
The Treflik Family,Not as huge but on Stargate Claudia Black was cast as a one off. When Amanda Tapping got pregnant they brought her back for 6-9 episodes. Can't remember exactly but it was to fill in. The chemistry she had with Michael Shanks they decided to kept her for the rest of the show.
The Treflik Family,"Henry Gale/Benjamin Linus was only scheduled to appear on a few episodes of Lost, but Michael Emerson so knocked the role out of the park, not only did Ben Linus continue the entire run of the series, he ended up >!being custodian of the island!<."
The Treflik Family,"Castiel in Supernatural. The actor was only supposed to stay for a few episodes, but they liked him so much they gave him another character season arc and then kept him on after as well. In terms of screen time, he's the third biggest character."
The Treflik Family,Didn’t become the main character but the janitor in scrubs was only supposed to be in one episode but they loved him so much he became a regular.
The Treflik Family,"Maybe Daryl on The Walking Dead. Basically the brother of the antagonist, turned star."
The Treflik Family,"This doesn’t fully fit because she didn’t become THE main character but Rachel Bilson (Summer) was only supposed to be in 3 episodes of The OC but the writers liked her so much they continued writing more. By the middle of season 1, she had a starring role and began appearing in the opening credits. She appeared in every episode and arguably had the most growth of any character. Plus, the Seth/Summer relationship was immensely popular."
The Treflik Family,"Not a clear one character takeover, but the Saved-By-The-Bell-ish teen sitcom California Dreams started off following a nuclear family.  

After a while the parents were phased out and the bro and sis were in a band that was the focus of the show. 

As time went on, both of them ended up leaving the show, so what started as a family sitcom had none of the original family on it anymore, just a show about a high school rock band."
The Treflik Family,"When the side characters in New Girl basically became the main cast was when the show really got it's footing, particular Winston Bishop"
The Treflik Family,"They did a test run of the ER pilot - originally Carole Hathaway was supposed to die from suicide, not survive the attempt.  Test audiences liked her so much, and the Doug and Carole dynamic that they had her survive it instead and hired Julianna Marguiles as a main cast member."
The Treflik Family,"Not so much the “Urkel”-type breakout, but Jasmine Guy as Whitley Gilbert was definitely a side character in the first couple of seasons of the “Cosby Show” spinoff “A Different World,” which was centered on Lisa Bonet’s Denise Huxtable.  After Bonet left it became more of an ensemble show, but Guy seemed to move into the “female lead” slot, her character eventually marrying the male lead."
The Treflik Family,"In Red Dwarf the android Kryten is introduced in Season 2 as a one-off guest character. He returns to become a regular in Season 3 and in Season 7, he effectively becomes a co-lead when the character of Rimmer temporarily leaves.

Colm Meaney played an unnamed Enterprise bridge officer in the Star Trek The Next Generation pilot (almost an extra, he only has a couple of lines), cropped up again (still unnamed) as various crewmen through S1, was finally named O'Brien in Season 2, got married in Season 4 and left in Season 6 to become one of the main stars of Deep Space Nine (but came back in Season 7 to play his younger self in a time travel story). So he went from a two line nobody to ""the most important person in Star Trek history"" (as recently declared on Lower Decks) across 14 seasons of two shows.

In a similar vein, Casey Biggs was cast as a random Cardassian grunt in one episode of DS9 and the writers kept bringing him back just because they liked him. He ended up becoming Space Spartacus, which absolutely nobody had expected."
The Treflik Family,Good Times - the show’s increased focus on JJ was part of what led John Amos to leave it
The Treflik Family,Chris Pratt's character of Andy Dwyer on Parks and Rec was only supposed to be in the show for a few episodes. Ended up becoming a seasonal regular for the rest of the show.
The Treflik Family,"Raising Hope eventually became about the hijinks of the grandparents rather than the parents.

New Girl became more about the ensemble and even then, Jess felt more like the third most prominent of the group."
The Treflik Family,Not as good an example as ops but originally Bart was the main character of The Simpsons then it switched to Homer.
The Treflik Family,"Frasier crane was only supposed to be in a handful of cheers episodes in season 3 as Diane's boyfriend. He went on to become probably the biggest character or them all in his career through the spin off. John lithow was the original choice bit refused as he didn't want to do TV.

I still think it must sting like hell for shelley long when she faded into oblivion after quitting the show in season 5 to do movies. It even must have stung for Ted danson how grammars career trumped his post cheers when danson would have been expected to get the biggest career post cheers."
The Treflik Family,Steve from Stranger Things. Goes from side character to one of the most popular characters along with Hopper and Eleven
The Treflik Family,"With regards to teen shows, Annie (played by Shenae Grimes) was the lead in 90210. The show begins with her and her family moving to Beverly Hills and she is framed as the protagonist in the first season. After season 1 however (and after showrunner shakeups), her role on the show was de-emphasised particularly since the bitchy mean girl Naomi (played by Anna Lynne McCord who made the unforgettable Vladimir Putin 'if I was your mother' video last year) was much more popular in the fandom. As the seasons went by, almost every member of Annie's family except for her brother (who was also a main cast member) exited the show. Meanwhile Naomi became the face of the show."
The Treflik Family,"The show is called Dawson's Creek, but Joey Potter took the spotlight. Everyone was way more concerned with her storyline than his. Pacey as well, but Dawson was definitely at the bottom of that trio by the end of the show."
The Treflik Family,"Key and Peele on Family Matters

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5Zdp1RfoyI"
The Treflik Family,"Arguably, Cody on Step by Step  - the stories started to focus more on him.  Possibly Michael and Stephanie on Newhart."
The Treflik Family,"President Jed Bartlet in *The West Wing* was supposed to be a recurring character, with Rob Lowe’s Sam Seaborn slated to be the main lead, but Martin Sheen knocked it out of the park and garnered such a positive response that he became the central character."
The Treflik Family,Catherine Tate guest starred in a Christmas special  of Doctor Who as a temporary companion. She became a full time cast member a season later and eventually became a fan favorite.
The Treflik Family,"Jason Momoa in Stargate Atlantis.

Well, for as long as his character was on the show anyway.

After the show I hear he did pretty well for himself."
The Treflik Family,Maxwell Q Klinger from MASH. He was only supposed to be a one off. Now he is arguably a Disney princess.
The Treflik Family,Jesse from Breaking Bad was not supposed to be in the show for long. But he became popular fast \^\^ Oh I guess he wouldn't be the main character though.
The Treflik Family,Felicity from Arrow was supposed to be this one off character in first season suddenly became the main character in season 2 and the main love interest for Oliver Queen different from the comics.
The Treflik Family,Randy from South Park. I wish he didn’t though
The Treflik Family,Castiel on Supernatural became a co-lead.
The Treflik Family,"The West Wing was an ensemble cast but Rob Lowe was supposed to be the main character, however the performances of rest of the cast especially Martin Sheen brought the focus to everyone"
The Treflik Family,"The West Wing was originally supposed to just be about the White House staff, with the President only making occasional appearances. The main character of the show was supposed to be Sam Seaborn.

Fast forward a few seasons and Sam's been written off the show, it's an ensemble cast with no main character, and if there was one it'd be either Josh or President Bartlett."
The Treflik Family,Boyd Crowder was supposed to die at the end of the pilot episode of Justified but Walton Goggins was so good that they rewrote it so he survived and became the main antagonist throughout the entire series.
The Treflik Family,Betty White as Elka on Hot In Cleveland was originally only supposed to be in the pilot.  Betty was of course well received and she became part of the main cast.
The Treflik Family,Not quite but I think Becky from full house was only suppose to be a minor character but they liked the chemistry and she became a pretty big character in the show
The Treflik Family,"Happy Days! The Fonz was just a local hoodlum but Henry Winkler’s performance made him the show’s star, even after original star Richie Cunningham (Ron Howard - whatever happened to him?) left"
The Treflik Family,"This might not fit exactly but when The Simpsons first started out Bart was the focal point of the show and Homer was almost like a side character. Bart was the one on all the merchandise and the t-shirts saying ""don't have a cow"" and he was the selling point for the ads and the one on the magazine covers, etc...

Then after a while the writers and the actor who voiced Homer figured out how funny he could be and Homer really came into his own and became the main character and main focus of many of the storylines. Although the show is an ensemble so there really isn't one main character."
The Treflik Family,"You're not asking about spinoffs like Mork and Mindy, right?"
The Treflik Family,"Flo from Alice. 

Flo and her catchphrase caught fire (""Kiss my grits.""), she became an increasingly prominent character and left  for a spinoff that was briefly popular and then quickly cancelled."
The Treflik Family,Dwayne and Whitley on 'A Different World'
The Treflik Family,"Since a lot of people are mentioning minor characters who became main characters here’s two that haven’t been mentioned:

Adriana from Sopranos was supposed to just be the hostess but director was wowed by her presence and she became a huge part of the show 

Mike from 24 is almost to me the most bizarre.  Like he was SUCH a seemingly irrelevant character that for him to have become as big as he did always kind of shocked me.  Actually they had a lot of seemingly random throwaway characters the eventually had massive moments (George, Chappelle, Chloe… that show was like a minor leagues of a sports franchise always cultivating the next new star to take over)"
The Treflik Family,"I had always suspected this and The Office Ladies podcast confirmed,

Andy was originally going to be fired after losing his mind during Jim's prank with his phone. Ed Helms was so impressive, Andy was instead put in anger management for the episodes that already been written and then added into the rest of season 3."
The Treflik Family,"Walton Goggins in *Justified*. Well, not quite a main character, but almost. He was only supposed to be in one or two episodes in the first season but ended up being a regular through much of the series, as well as being one of the best antagonists ever on TV."
The Treflik Family,"Rob Morrow started out as the central character of Northern Exposure and then watched as pretty much the rest of the supporting cast slowly gobbled up pieces of the spotlight. He left and the show continued without him.

Dominic West was the central character in the first season of The Wire. It obviously became more of an ensemble thing and arguably the best season is the one where he's there for literally like three scenes."
The Treflik Family,Happy days really became about Fonzie
The Treflik Family,"J.J. ""DY-NO-MITE"" Evans on Good Times was never intended to get the most lines.  The dad almost quit the show several times because he was jealous.  On the Jeffersons, Florence wasn't even there the first season but in certain episodes she had more lines than George."
The Treflik Family,angel from Buffy
The Treflik Family,"Dr Zachary Smith from the 1965-1968 'Lost in Space.' He doesn't appear in the pilot ""No Place to Hide."" They added his character to generate storylines. His character (played by Jonathan Harris) got more fan mail than the leads Guy Williams (Professor John Robinson), Dr.  June Lockhart (Maureen Robinson), and Major Don West (Mark Goddard) in the First Season. By the Second Season, Dr Smith, Will Robinson (Bill Mumy), and the Robot (Bob May, voiced by Dick Tufeld) had gone from side characters to main characters. The rest of the cast were upset Jonathan Harris had changed the show from a serious drama about survival in outer space to a camp comedy but they were aware his popularity kept the show on the air for three seasons."
The Treflik Family,"I’m surprised nobody mentioned the Janitor on Scrubs. Even in interviews he says he was only supposed to be a one time character, but everyone loved him they just kept him going."
The Treflik Family,Leonard was intended to be the main character of Big Bang Theory
The Treflik Family,"I loved perfect strangers and family matters growing up. And just realizing today family matters was a spin off of perfect strangers!?!?

Wait... What was the question op."
The Treflik Family,ER. Noah Wyle became the star and anchor of the show
The Treflik Family,"I watched the 1992 Muppets Christmas Carol  this past year, and during the guest Sesame Street appearance Elmo was a background character that I don't think had any lines"
The Treflik Family,"Naya Rivera-Santana from Glee was supposed to be only a season character yet because she was so popular and wanted to do a sapphic storyline with Brittany, she became one of the most popular characters on the show"
The Treflik Family,Bobs Burgers has shifted the focus to the kids and off Bob the restaurant.
The Treflik Family,Not the same circumstances but Master of None season 3 - Denise becomes the main character
The Treflik Family,"The West Wing, Mr President (Martin Sheen) was only supposed to show up every once in a while, but became the central character. Sam Seaborn (Rob Lowe) was supposed to be the main character."
The Treflik Family,TIL Family Matters was a spin-off! Thanks for that info OP
The Treflik Family,"On Ugly Betty, they planned to have anew actor/actress every episode to play Wilhmena’s assistant (because she keeps firing them) but then everyone over Michael Urie so he became a series regular."
The Treflik Family,"There’s The West Wing, which is the exact opposite. It was supposed to be a vehicle for Rob Lowe but the supporting cast was so fantastic it became an ensemble."
The Treflik Family,"Breaking Bad introduced Bob Odenkirk as a smaller side-character, but loved working with Bob Odenkirk so much that they eventually gave him his own show."
The Treflik Family,"Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer was only supposed to last a few episodes, and then be killed.  But people loved him so they kept him on."
The Treflik Family,"Superstore. It was originally about Amy, but Jonah ended up the focus."
The Treflik Family,"Good Times  Kid DY-NO-MITE!
and Happy Days with the Fonz"
The Treflik Family,"the ""Build team"" in Mythbusters. Kari, Grant and Tory, didn't come together (and start taking over episodes) until a while into the show. They had a lot more people on screen early on, then later on the Build team's myth was often more of the show than Jamie and Adam's myth until Discovery cut costs and got rid of the Build Team entirely."
The Treflik Family,"Summer on The OC wasn't meant to be a main character, just basically going to be Marissa's none-dimensional friend that showed up sometimes, only having three lines in the pilot... and ended up becoming a main character with an actual personality and character growth and one of the more, if not most, popular characters."
The Treflik Family,https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BreakoutCharacter/
The Treflik Family,Dwight Schrute in The Office.
The Treflik Family,Randy went from just Stan's random dad to a main character and the show is 1000x better for it.
The Treflik Family,I think Sheldon was supposed to be more of a side character in Big Bang Theory
The Treflik Family,Jesse pinkman was suppose die early on I believe in breaking bad.
The Treflik Family,"Happy Days...the show was originally about Richie Cunningham and Potsie mostly, then by season 3 Fonzie became the main focus of the show. I was also told Joey and Phoebe on Friends were not really meant to be main characters on the show (according to Matthew Perry's new book) but became main characters on the show as it went on.

Actually it happened on Happy Days twice in season 3-7 was mostly about Fonzie...seasons 8-12 were about Chachi and Joannie mostly, and Fonzie ironically stopped picking up women and became of a partner and owner of Arnold's and also an automotive teacher...in the last episode he tried to adopt a son,,,and was able to adopt him, women were not important to him anymore...guess he had a lot of fun in the past and he got bored with them, or the writers wanted to make Fonzie more responsible. Seasons 8-12 Chachi and Joannie basically took over the show."
The Treflik Family,"Apparently, Andy from Parks and Rec was supposed to be a one-off side character in season 1"
The Treflik Family,"Topenga was supposed to be a one episode character on Boy Meets World.   She became one of the main three characters  (Corey,  Shawn, Topenga)"
The Treflik Family,"Happy Days was the king of this. Fonzie was a supporting character. Ron Howard was the star. When they realized what they had he went back burner. They even had the talk with Ron about it. He was a little hurt but rolled with it. 

Family Ties was the mom's show. She was the most famous actor on the show. Alex stole the show completely. To Michaels credit he stayed on the show till the end, even when he was the biggest movie star in the world.

Pretty sure Michael stayed because they let him do Back To the Future. The producer talks in detail about this on the Television Academy YouTube channel. Micheal had a driver and he slept in a station wagon with a mattress in the back to and from the sets."
The Treflik Family,Are we sure Steve Urkel became the main character though? I thought he was very popular but every episode still focused on the issues of the core family first. I don't recall episodes focused solely on Urkel.
The Treflik Family,Webster. The show was supposed to be about the parents but Emmanuel’s agents turned it into his show.
The Treflik Family,"He didn't take over the whole show, but Andy in Parks and Rec was originally a temp character. He was so liked that they made him a full cast member."
The Treflik Family,Night court in season 2 Markie Post played Christian Sullivan for one episode and it seems in season three till the end I believe 8 seasons she became a main character which I think is close to what OP was saying.
The Treflik Family,Jesse pink man in breaking bad
The Treflik Family,Frasier in Cheers
The Treflik Family,The Simpsons started giving more importance to Homer when he became popular
The Treflik Family,Ben Linus in LOST

 If you want to go really old school, try Sam from the Pickwick Papers... 1837 or so."
The Treflik Family,"Not tv, but Popeye wasn't introduced into Thimble Theater until 10 years into its' run and was only intended to appear in one story arc, yet he proved so popular among readers that he became the main character and had the strip renamed after him."
The Treflik Family,"In Stargate Rodney McKay was an unlikable scientist that mostly served as an annoyance for Sam Carter. He appeared twice (I think) as an expert on stargates. Later he became main cast of the Stargate Atlantis spin-off.

In Stargate Atlantis you could argue that the character of Radek Zelenka was a case of this. Originally a one-off character (that was originally meant to be Russian, not Czech) was promoted to a semi-regular. Not the main cast, but still appeared in like half of the episodes.

In Star Trek there was Chief O'Brien. Transporter operator in TNG who appeared on some occasions. And then in DS9 he became one of the main cast.

Again in Star Trek, but this time not exactly the same character. In a TNG episode there was a character of Nick Locarno. A cadet whose action caused the death of a fellow cadet. The actor - Robert Duncan McNeill - was supposed to reprise the role in Voyager. But that would mean that the creators would have to pay royalties to the writer of the TNG episode. So they created a copy of Nick Locarno for McNeill to play - Tom Paris.

In Doctor Who they had the character Donna Noble in one of the christmas specials. She was originally a one-off character, like all the characters in the specials. But a season later she was promoted to Doctor's companion, probably because the audience really liked her sassy character... and honestly it was refreshing to have a female companion that doesn't fall in love with the Doctor."
The Treflik Family,Raquel from vanderpump rules.
The Treflik Family,"Not exactly what you are asking but in the original Twin Peaks, the character who played the villain Bob was originally part of the crew.  David Lynch saw his image in a reflection and decided to add the actor into the show in the pivotal role of Bob."
The Treflik Family,"Bubbles is a side character in Trailer Park Boys at the start but he arguably is the face of the show in later seasons/movies.

I liked him as a side character but think he's annoying when he's the focus tbh"

Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"Along with true crime, they are popular with women most of all. I think there are a bunch of reasons. The shows confront something in society they fear, a legitimate threat they have to think about day-to-day. I am guessing it's cathartic watching it play out in the safety of their living rooms. I think ""You"" has the added element that Joe is not a bad looking fellow and he's also charming. You kind of see how someone could fall for the Ted Bundy type tricks. 

Also, my partner and I are big into horror and there was an article I read recently linking the enjoyment of horror with something called ""benign masochism"". Basically something that would be normally be unpleasant, in this case fear, feels good when you know you are safe. Another example is eating really spicy foods. I can see this being a factor with these shows too."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"People are fascinated by what scares them. I kind of chalk it up to how men will watch war movies. The threat of having to go to war is a lot more real for men than women with selective service and such.

Being stalked or sexually assaulted or being targeted by a serial killer who hates women is more of a threat to women. So it's a more visceral fear to explore for then.

It's kind of odd because I hate to hear about that stuff. But I live with an elderly religious woman.  She can't handle cursing at all. Her daughter had to stop watching shows on HBO and such because she'll always complain about how much the cursing bothers her.  But half the time I go by her room I get to hear about awful stuff done to some poor woman being described by a narrator."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"It's one of the darkest facets of human nature so the motivations fascinate us. Like most horror, it's a way to explore the emotions behind real fears in a safe way"
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"You is campy and funny as shit.

But i think the answe to the overall question of the post is that the darkness within humanity is a pretty interesting topic to explore.

It's the scarier type of horror because of how real it is.

The fact that normal people and lives are mostly (for your sake and mine) free of said darkness does raise some curiosity."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"I watch the murder channel on occasion (ID Discovery) and it is quite literally mindless repetition of a formula. Content-wise, it's like a mystery and horror movie wrapped up in one."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"> I've never seen these shows

You honestly SHOULD start by watching one."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"Murder mysteries have thrived for centuries now because they remove the main witness, so a particularly adept sleuth is required to solve the case. Whenever a woman is the victim, she's usually a pretty girl and everyone knows she's not really being killed, so it's nice to look at the pretty girl."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"As with all interests or genres, everyone has a different experience. But....

1 - they're telling about human nature
2 - cautionary tales, one can learn a lot about protecting themselves by learning basic commonalities of past crimes. A major lesson, IMO, is how girls are often conditioned to value manners / politeness over their instinct but that's to their detriment.
3 - personally, I was a young teen when a friend was murdered and then peripherally knew a few women that were victims of what was believed to be a serial offender. These events were all during formative years and tackling fears meant learning as much as one could. The murdered friend ended up as a case being unsolved for many years, so there was little real info in her case but much to learn from the global community."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"When I watched ""You"" for the first time , it creeped me out. But I was also hooked to the show.
The Fall is the same. Paul Specter really made me feel disgusted, but it's a great mystery/thriller.

I think people love good thriller."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"The same reason mystery and suspense novels have always been popular.

The human mind is primed to pay very close attention to Caution Tales about horrible things that happened to other people (even fictional ones). We've been learning from each other by listening to stories for thousands and thousands of years, and the thrilling, scary ones are often the most attractive and memorable."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"Depictions of dangerous, murderous people have been popular since the Greek tragedies all the way through Shakespeare and into today. I don't need to watch TV shows about people who punch a clock and pay their bills; I'm already doing that. I want to see something more gripping and out of the ordinary and where the stakes are high."
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"Learning and developing life skills through entertainment is evident in many species.

After years of the media portraying women as victims it's not surprising that people are attracted to these types of shows. It could be a way to develop empathy or strategies for self defence.

I personally enjoy biopics that present the true story as though it was a fictional crime drama. This removes the real world bias and allows you to consider events or motivations that lead to the person acting in the way they did."

No shows are popular.  They just get enough viewers to be considered successful."

It doesn't matter that the evidence universally contradicts all that, this time it is absolutely true because it just sounds like it might be true. We can worry about proving it later, we must be outraged and stop it now before it's too late!"
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,I am fine with this but isn't this more people's obsession with true crime stuff and netflix simply catering to people?
Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer,"Oh fuck off. Fictional violence has not and will ever not be the cause of people being violent in real life or desensitized to real violence. I have been watching violent material since I was at least 11, and even when I accidentally bump into someone I feel bad, because I have a properly developed mind and was taught right and wrong. I never have hurt anyone and I never will. And I've been around many people who watch violent stuff too and are productive members of society as well. 

However, I still watch movies like American Psycho, Hellraiser, and Pulp Fiction because they're good movies and I watch shows like Hannibal, Fargo and Ash vs. Evil Dead for the same reason. Yes, the violence of those are graphic, but sometimes it's because it's just entertaining like Ash vs. Evil Dead (the violence is part of the humor, but just because I laugh at the unrealistic violence there doesn't mean that if I see real violence that I think it's funny) and other times it's because it's a part of the story being explored. 

The same goes for Netflix and yes, there are a ton other things on the service that don't have graphic violence (like Frankie & Grace and Fuller House). So if you don't like the graphic shows, that's fine, everyone has their preference, Netflix has other options, including an entire kids section. But to try the paint a picture that Netflix is pretty much nothing but mindless bloodbaths is such an oversimplified statement. 

Now, some violent movies/shows are good and some are bad, but there's nothing wrong with them being popular or people watching them. Just because people watch a documentary about Ted Bundy doesn't mean they want to be Ted Bundy, they're just interested in learning about the subject (especially if they're like me and didn't even exist during the time of Ted Bundy). 

Millions and even billions of people watch violent media all the time and yet most of them don't act out real violence and are kind and compassionate people. I'm so over this violent media debate, when time and time again, most that are against it are nothing but buffoons who have no true understanding of artistic expression. You can not like violent stuff, but don't brag that you're better than me because of it."

Laid-Back Camp,"I agree that it’s not really a show that would last today, but scenes like this https://youtu.be/waMUK8LwQT4 and his letter to Karen when Cobain died are some of the best in the show at peeling back the layers on Hank. He’s not a good person per se, but I do think he means well."
Laid-Back Camp,[deleted]
Laid-Back Camp,"Lol you think David Duchovny has the type of general sex appeal where it's convincing that most women would want to jump his bone at the very sight of him?? *Pfffftt*! Like... would you? Lol! 

And I didn't jumble up anything. I mentioned the actor for one sentence then went right into talkin' about the character."
Laid-Back Camp,"Edit: *Okay I'm editing this reply because I actually have more to add*

It's funny how you say ""character development"" when honestly Hank is the sole character subjected to any sort of character development in the show, whether in the earlier or later seasons. 

Karen is a badly written character from the get-go, the writers just doesn't seem interested at all in giving her any depth, which leaves her being a very shallow plot device of sorts, and this is the main reason why I think the relationship plot between her and Hank was dull and repetitive (because a great relationship plot has 2 or more great characters at its core). 

Other characters like Charlie, Marcy, Mia (and all the other crazies that show up) are pretty one-note and aren't subjected to any development. Becca has unique character traits (with her nihilism and all), and even though I kind of disliked her I must admit she did have some development in the background... but eventually got flandarized just like Hank did when they forced her into a similar situation as her mother. 

Honestly, I just think season 4 is better plotwise, while season 5 is just funnier (*and steps away from the Hank/Karen mishap for the most part*). I mean yea from seasons 3 onwards Hank pretty much turns into a man-child, character development wise, but I don't think this is a *bad thing* per se, especially for this type of show. 

And yes I did find a lot of it ""pretentious"". I just feel like what this show transitions back into when it's not trying to be all sentimental and profound, gives it no place to even attempt to be sentimental and profound in the first place. 

Ok let me put it like this. I don't want a *serious* relationship drama from show that portrays women the way Californication does, the same way I wouldn't want to have sex with a convicted rapist... or listen to a neo-nazi talk about issues in the black community... or buy weed from a crack dealer.  

But I'm just giving my take here. If you have a different take it's all good, we all have our different opinions. lol."

Laid-Back Camp,"I don't even care about the whole ""woke"" thing like but this... this was just distasteful in that regard. 

I advise everyone to just let nostalgia be nostalgia and not rewatch these *suspect* and outrageous shows and media from the past... or maybe it's better if you do? Idk."
Laid-Back Camp,"Tbf Duchovny is a professed recovering sex addict who has a long history of affairs. I found this quote from a recent story about an autobiography he’s writing (googled to make sure he was in fact the actor I I was thinking had a sex addiction stint in rehab): “He was a lothario..Women flung themselves at him and he found them hard to resist."" [Source](https://okmagazine.com/p/david-duchovny-set-record-straight-addiction-divorce/)

He also has a history of alcoholism which I think was probably a big part of his connection to the character of Hank Moody. An alcohol soaked sex addict risking/ruining his personal relationships and career in one of the few places in the country it could go largely unchallenged - LA - with a career in the entertainment industry to boot.

All that said, I do largely agree with you on this show. I loved it when I was a teenager as it aired and grew out of it as I grew older and it grew - well, you saw how it grew. I have rewatched the occasional episode since and while I found myself laughing at some parts, I found myself thinking about how wonderfully/woefully of the time it was."
Laid-Back Camp,"Let me start off by saying I came off too hostile in my original comment. My bad.  I loved the show when it originally aired but have not done a complete rewatch in a couple years. I wont get into an argument about the portrail of women in the show because, frankly this show is a fantasy trip for men much like Sex and the City is for Women. As such, the women in this show are written usually as 2 dimensional as the men are in that one. That show also has failed attempts at drama (Although I will say the hopeless romantic writer, drinking and screwing his way through LA does a better job at the drama attempts than the blogger and her girl squad who have no problems picking up new, attractive, poorly fleshed out guys and doing the same thing through NY) 

 You elaborating helps alot because your original comment had few examples besides ""I've evolved"". BUT in no universe are the final couple of seasons on par with the first. The show becomes a PARODY of itself, and it wasent that far off from parody to begin with. The Finale? The final shot is the plane with Karen and Hank leaving everything behind in LA, rising into the sky as his Porsche is left in the foreground. I'm sorry but the Hank Moody in the first couple of seasons would have thrown up all over his typewriter with that kind of sappy, neat ending.  The thing about his adventures and sexcapades and even his brief times with Karen is that the dude is usually MISERABLE, no matter what. That tends to make him more sympathetic but it's also more heartbreaking when he goes into self destruct mode as he does a few times.

I would actually argue the drama is BETTER for it in this show. It hits the right notes during the sad and tragic dramatic times. I think the worse the show ever becomes is when it's silly and carefree with no repercussions for anything, like whatever season he was on the bus with the Musician, yuck. But if you didnt feel anything when Lew Ashby died and Hank finishes the book the next episode, then this show just isnt for you.   But regardless, that's just my opinion and I could be completely off too. Sorry again about the aggressiveness in the first comment lol

EDIT: I gotta edit too because I forgot something. I LOVED becca, I thought she was well written and I loved their entire relationship. The whole ""Father"" and ""Daughter"" thing when they start a conversation felt genuine and it came off to me like a dad and kid that loved each other and actually understood each other, faults and all, which is a rarity.  She gets annoying and bratty in the later seasons but hey, shes a teenager from LA raised in a weird parental environment. IDK, I loved their relationship more than any other in the show."
Laid-Back Camp,Yup. That was another very good one. It hit close to home.
Laid-Back Camp,[deleted]
Laid-Back Camp,Yea damn... that truly is fascinating. 😶
Laid-Back Camp,"> BUT in no universe are the final couple of seasons on par with the first

Nah, I didn't say that... not necessarily. You seem hung up on this but to be honest it doesn't really matter, from seasons 1 - 5 the show essentially remains the same. The issues found in season 1 are also found in season 5. I didn't even watch the final 2 seasons here. I just said that seasons 4 has a good plot, and season 5 is funnier. 

> The show becomes a PARODY of itself, and it wasent that far off from parody to begin with.

If by ""parody"" you mean when the show started swifting away from the relationship drama and leaning more into it's more outrageous aspects and puerile sex humor... for all the reasons I mentioned before, I thought this was good because this, in my opinion, was what the show did best. It's relationship drama wasn't good, it didn't have a strong set of characters, and its own juxtaposition made me roll my eyes everytime it tried to be sincere. 

> But if you didnt feel anything when Lew Ashby died and Hank finishes the book the next episode, then this show just isnt for you.

This scene is an example of that. This scene seems sincere, but taking it with full context, everything that Lee Ashby did and the fact that dude was kind of a misogynist prick, a character trait the show gassed-up... then this scene is just, *whatever*. 

But anyways, you gotta realize that this is my 2nd viewing here, and I did love this show once. I think you should give it a rewatch and you'll maybe see where I'm coming from. And yes, I do agree that ending was trash, that's why I didn't even bother watching it."

Laid-Back Camp,"""I didn't even watch the final 2 seasons here""  

So you rated the last 2 seasons that you didnt even rewatch as the best?

  ""From Season 1 - 5 the show remains the same, Season 4 has a good plot and 5 is funnier"" 

Well, which is it?  The first few seasons are more sincere and serious where the final few are more outlandish and comical, the show very clearly does not stay the same the entire time.  Maybe you should rewatch the entire thing before having all these opinions about watching the show from your new, more mature and enlightened position."

Laid-Back Camp,"> So you rated the last 2 seasons that you didnt even rewatch as the best?

What? No. Read the post I rated seasons 1 - 5.... there are 7 seasons! Lol. 

> Well, which is it? The first few seasons are more sincere and serious where the final few are more outlandish and comical, the show very clearly does not stay the same the entire time.

Oh my god. 🤦 I don't know if I'm being too vague or if I made a typo or something but you seem to not understand a word I said. So let me rephrase.... 

I meant ""*essentially*"" the show is pretty much the same for these 5 seasons. The flaws that are found in the first few seasons are the same flaws found in the later seasons... this never changes! The show was ""outrageous"" and ""comical"" in the first few seasons too... but it clashed with the ""sincere"" and ""serious"" aspects that you mentioned, creating the juxtaposition I talked about earlier. 

In season 5, it leaned more towards its outrageous and comical aspects, so the juxtaposition wasn't that bad, and it came off less like it was trying to be something it just couldn't be, especially with a weak relationship plot at its core (*there are just soooooo many better relationship stories out there man*).

 Why did I think it's sincerity and shot at serious drama fell flat? Because of all the reasons I mentioned in the post. Mainly the lack of depth for prominent characters, and lack of self-awareness to the fact that they're attempting to do this on a very insincere premise, with a very nonchalant attitude towards things that I honestly never want to see portrayed in a nonchalant manner ever again. 

Do you understand me now?? 

Okay let me make it simpler:

Outrageous and comical aspects - Fun, but nonchalant and lacks self-awareness. 

Sincere and serious aspect - The main character is good, but it's lacking a well-written *other-half*, and the outrageous and comical aspects are too nonchalant and carefree for me to take whatever sincerity this show is trying to relay seriously."
Laid-Back Camp,What? I .... I can't even fathom this convo right now man. Whatever.
Lupin,"damn, legendary voice for a legendary character. RIP"
Lupin,"Man voiced the character form 1969 to 2021, that's longer than a good chunk of people lived. Atleast he went out on his own terms, and they gave him an OVA dedicated to sending him off."
Lupin,So long and fair well old friend
Lupin,"Such a shame, he will be missed. Jigen is such a badass."
Lupin,"He passed away on July 30, 2022 due to pneumonia. May he rest in peace.
>Kobayashi announced in September last year that he was retiring from his long-time and iconic role as Daisuke Jigen in the Lupin III franchise after 52 years (Akio Ohtsuka replaced him in the role for the Lupin the 3rd Part 6 anime). Kobayashi had voiced the character since 1969, and was the only remaining original first-generation cast member in the Lupin III franchise just prior to his retirement from the role."
Lupin,Salute.
Lupin,"He never missed, but he will be missed."
Lupin,"good bye, partner"
Lupin,Bless
Lupin,"🙏 rest well sir, your voice reached the lives of millions."
Lupin,o7
Lupin,It's amazing he did the role from the original pilot in 1969 and the first series in 1971 until only last year with one exception in 1987 when everyone was replaced as a one off and didn't leave the role when the other three originals left in 2010 because his voice still worked at age 77.
Lupin,Rest In Peace world
Lupin,Rest In Peace Legend!
Lupin,R.i.p.
Lupin,"My favorite series of all time, RIP Jigen"
Lupin,GOAT
Lupin,RIP
Lupin,Goodnight sweet king
Lupin,"Damn, may he Rest In Peace"
Lupin,"Damn I just started the og anime abt a month ago, I just sit down to watch it  whenever im in the mood, this is heartbreaking. 

R.I.P"
Lupin,I hope they named a maru after him.
Lupin,Lupe steal like lupin the third
Lupin,"He quit in the new Lupin series, I missed.  His replacement just sound off."
Lupin,Which OVA?
Lupin,"Man, that's impressive. Even for just one character that he voiced, there's a lot of history behind his work."
Lupin,This Man has voiced the same character for twice my lifespan.
Lupin,Episode 0 for part 6
Lupin,"Laughs in 10,000,000 voices - Mel Blanc

But seriously voice actors are amazing and they never get enough credit."
Lupin,"It aired on Toonami here in the West (in English, so *less* impactful) a few weeks ago."
Lupin,And then theres crisp rat as mario
Lupin,"Ya, while Epcar is almost as iconic as dub jeigen, it does feel a bit odd dubbing it, but hey I'd rather have it both ways than not."
Lupin,"The dialogue in part 6 is a lot tighter and more literally translated than part 2. Epcar is a lot more fun with improv, just my opinion."
Lupin,"Actually it was Epcar who decided that, he was originally not for the punched up script with part 2 when he was brought on to direct, but begrudgingly went along when he was told they where trying to get the adult swim audience. (He later came around to part 2s fun dub) but when he was brought back as the director starting with part 4, hes tried to keep it close to the original script, tho still let's some things pass by."
Lupin,"Wow, that’s really interesting.  It’s something about the pacing of dialogue that just clicks right in the fun dub, especially with him."
Lupin,So we've reached Lupin the III?
Lupin,Elaborate heists please and less family woes
Lupin,I really like this show. Omar Sy is great. He should have had a bigger role in the Jurassic movies.
Lupin,"Happy part 3 will be out soon, helps me brush up on my french a little bit. Very good show imo."
Lupin,Can't wait...
Lupin,These Netflix adaptions are really getting out of hand.
Lupin,Same
Lupin,One thing I’ve always appreciated about Netflix is that they have a great catalog of foreign media. It’s fucking great to see something new and original and not the same rehash of the tired formula of Hollywood
Lupin,Don’t forget about Dark on Netflix as well! One of the best shows I’ve ever watched. It’s in German and is an excellent take on the after effects of time travel.
Lupin,"It didn't take off the way Squid Game did, but I really enjoyed Hellbound. Very interesting supernatural thriller, and it felt like a very Korean take on how such a phenomenon would end up going down (quasi-Christian cults are a *big* thing in S.Korea)."
Lupin,"Call My Agent (French, Netflix) and My Brilliant Friend (Italian, HBO) are two other wonderful foreign shows I discovered over lockdown."
Lupin,"Thank you Netflix, for recognizing the world has many stories and perspectives.  Keep up the good work!"
Lupin,Also enjoyed Alice in borderlands and not sure which origin but Great Pretender was my favorite Netflix show of 2021. It's really worth watching.
Lupin,"It also wasn’t a bad year for animation.  Arcane, Castlevania, Mithchells vs the Machines.  I hope Netflix invests just as much into Animation in the future."
Lupin,I never got the chance to finish the Spanish Ministry of Time show before Netflix lost the license.  I’ll never know how it finishes.
Lupin,"Squid game is the biggest korean show, but my favorite on netflix will always be crash landing on you"
Lupin,"Below Netflix international shows released this year are also worth checking out:

  
**The Billion Dollar Code** (Germany) (Drama based on true story)  
**The Chestnut Man** (Denmark) (Scandinavian Noir crime thriller)  
**The Innocent** (Spain) (Mystery drama based on the Harlan Coben novel)  
**The Unlikely Murderer** (Sweden) (Miniseries based on the true crime)  
**Hellbound** (Korea) (Supernatural drama)  
**D.P.** (Korea) (Drama based on post-military life in Korea)  
**My Name** (Korea) (Action thriller)  
**Young Royals** (Sweden) (Coming of age teen drama)  
**Katla** (Iceland) (Mystery/Supernatural drama)"
Lupin,"How can lupin be a hit ? I’m a french, i like omar sy but Lupin was some serious bullshit, no coherence between plots, very very bad acting and bad caracterizing… i could go on and on, did many people liked that show or just a lot watched it by curiosity ?"
Lupin,"Stupid name, awesome show- “Money Heist”
Another awesome show- 3%

First is European Spanish
Latter is Brazilian Portuguese"
Lupin,Lupin was generic as fuck in my opinion. Had to stop watch after 4 eps
Lupin,"Naked Director S2 and Alice in Borderland from Japan were good too. From Korea, other than Squid Games, Hellbound and Your Name were also quality."
Lupin,"I am here for the sharing of cultures. Even if they overlap heavily, you can still smile and appreciate the roots. Its interesting!"
Lupin,"Loved both shows, and Money Heist, ffs, money hesit, I let the shitty title put me off watching it for so long, House Of Paper sounds so much better. 

Anyway, more quality feriegn language content please!"
Lupin,Lupin fucking rocks!
Lupin,"I just started watching Invisible City. So far that’s been a lot of fun too! I’m a lore junkie but never looked into Brazilian folk lore so it’s fun and new for me, while the story is also compelling so far!"
Lupin,Lupin sucks
Lupin,Omniscient is also really good!
Lupin,One bright spot of quarantine induced rerun hell!
Lupin,You'd think that this would make American studios reconsider what they are producing and why this is happening.
Lupin,Lupin was a hit?
Lupin,"Lupin was a megahit? Always thought it was ""mixed"" at most"
Lupin,(but Lupin isn't good)
Lupin,"Me over here watching my 3% rewatch, who has never heard of octopus game"
Lupin,Once the dubbing is done well
Lupin,"Lupin
Squid Games
Dark
Money Heist

All great shows including more foreign language shows. Most folks are either too lazy to read subtitles or xenophobic to other languages besides English. I almost had to put a gun to my friends heads to get them to watch Lupin yet I always watch the shows they like smfh 😅"
Lupin,Lupin is brilliant! My favourite international series this year
Lupin,Is lupin about a werewolf or
Lupin,Yeah because not everyone is into DC/Marvel
Lupin,"I watched sqid game. The first episode was pretty good, then it became progressively more unwatchable"
Lupin,I first Read megashits and was like wtf are you on I wanna try some of that
Lupin,It was all Squid Game. Lupin was whatever.
Lupin,Lets not forget the final instalment of Money Heist. Thought it was a great show that needs more promotion.
Lupin,[deleted]
Lupin,"Squid game was awful. Tired trope and cliché after tired cliché and trope.

It shows how low the bar is white westerners have for foreign media."
Lupin,It’s funny how… forgettable even hit Netflix shows are.
Lupin,Because Hollywood only cranks out propaganda these days. We are tired of their shit.
Lupin,HellBound was pretty good too. Solid “Humans go fucking crazy” show
Lupin,"Howww
Yea"
Lupin,"My take is people watch English speaking shows with subs nowadays due to actors speaking softly or bad sound production.
I can't remember a time I have never had subtitles on even when I could hear what was said been doing it since I was a teen."
Lupin,"This past year I enjoyed Ragnarok, Dogs of Berlin, Trapped."
Lupin,"Unfortunately not many seem to have seen Beyond Evil.

Everyone should watch Beyond Evil"
Lupin,Money heist is a good one too!
Lupin,"The fact that there’s still not a big international audience for Gomorrah is amazing to me. It’s hands down one of the best series made in the past 10 years. The first 2 seasons are immaculate,"
Lupin,"I've loved the foreign YA shows that netflix has.  It's a nice difference from US shows.  Elite, Blood and Water, We Are the Wave, Young Royals, Baby.. . . ."
Lupin,"> Foreign language

And it's all dubbed in US I'm sure?"
Lupin,"Yep, tons of foreign media and they cast a very wide net in terms of genres. Arcane, midnight mass and squid games are 3 of my favourite shows from this year, but outside of all being from Netflix couldn't be less alike."
Lupin,"Huge reason to keep Netflix is that they have the best foreign tv selection and great originals that are foreign. This year I’ve seen a two spanish series, a Korean one, a Mexican one, and a French one."
Lupin,"I have watched so many Korean series this year, and French, German, Russian, Spanish, etc. It's been a treat to watch new stories and learn the tropes of other countries' genres."
Lupin,Exactly. Tho it does frustrate me when I’m not aware it’s a foreign film and the words and the lips don’t sync up. I hate that it defaults to an English dub
Lupin,Yeah
Lupin,you should get mubi
Lupin,"We’ve got a great idea:

It’s the Hero’s Journey, but……..wait for it………IN SPACE!!!

Don’t like it?

Ok, how about the Hero’s Journey, but as a Western. 

Rinse and repeat while making money hand over fist with comic book movies."
Lupin,"Hollywood is so dry pretty much most tv shows follow a set formula for the genre the show is and honestly it gets boring. I recently watched a Korean Show about how we always fondly remember our childhood/teenager years but eventually there comes a time where slowly but gradually you start losing touch with your friends, and it's those cherished memories that still link you and your friends together."
Lupin,And having the ability to choose dubbing for much of their content makes it far more accessible.
Lupin,Best show on Netflix. Incredible. Sic Mundus Creatus Est
Surviving Death,That theme song was ... not exactly the tone I expected.
Surviving Death,"""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" 

Someone will just have to tell me when they provide no real evidence at all because I can't do it."
Surviving Death,"Two things while watching this bizarre film. 

1. Why the hell are all these people white

2. Why the hell are all these people white."
Surviving Death,The twist is that everyone was dead the whole time.
Surviving Death,"All but one were so white! It took any credibility away from the series for me, tbh."
Surviving Death,"Nah, the twist is they'll cancel it after 1 season instead of 3."
Surviving Death,Thanks! I know what I’m doing tomorrow evening.
Surviving Death,So many people say You is a guilty pleasure.  Personally I don't feel an ounce of guilt for really enjoying this show.  Just finished season 4 tonight and loved it.  Joe is pure plot armor but honestly I really just don't fucking care.  Stab away Joe.  I'm with you till the end buddy.
Surviving Death,Joe is the the textbook definition of plot armor. There must be no good lawyers in the you-verse if he’s able to successfully frame so many people
Surviving Death,First time?
Surviving Death,did you not pay attention to the part where Joe said he wanted Marianne to be found. so her daughter would have closure?
Surviving Death,"Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just *needs* to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous.

As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe."
Surviving Death,"I dropped this show after they decided to kill Love and just start the cycle all over again. It was a nice guilty pleasure, but I’m done. The best part of S3 was the brief moments where Joe and Love worked together.

Did they bring Mariane back? Such a dull character when compared to his previous love interests. I couldn’t stand his infatuation with her in S3. I was like, ffs, just focus on Joe and Love."
Surviving Death,I this season 4 was the best season. It was dumb mindless drama. Yeah lot of plot of armor but it’s popcorn tv just set back and enjoy it.
Surviving Death,[deleted]
Surviving Death,Also would he not watch the news to see if they found her body?
Surviving Death,"I think you're applying too much real world logic to the show. It's a silly murder comedy drama, not a documentary."
Surviving Death,"The writers don't understand Joe's character but you do. 
It's always been you.
You're the only one who understands Joe."
Surviving Death,"I think this is You's worst season. The whole murder-mystery vibe of the first 5 eps was just okay, but none of those formed into a cohesive ending as the ""killer"" just ""revealed himself by the end of ep 5. None of Joe's investigating has come to a cohesive thought.

With the benefit of hindsight, of course this isn't what really happens (talking about who the killer really is, ep 6 above). But all of the runtime investigating who the eat-the-rich killer was wasted and almost the entire 5 eps felt like they were almost all for nothing. 

Aside from that, the first 5 eps had a weird vibe. I think the writers wanted to change things up, but the generic murder-mystery vibe of the first half made You lose it's identity. It was never like that for the past 3 years.

The 2nd half felt worse. It's almost 5 eps of joe just fighting his inner demon (you-know-who), and the plot just felt like it was pondering up until the 10th ep. I absolutely loved the last half of ep 10 though. The plot twist has been a number of times so it wasn't really a shocker or a game-changer, and it really slowed the pacing down."
Surviving Death,"I'm just starting to watch season 4. I love the quasi Hercule Poirot whodunit with a established group of suspects in a modern, but traditional English setting. There was even a nod to Agatha Christie in the library! I hope there are more seasons set in Europe.

Binge watched it. Talented writing. Excellent."
Surviving Death,The blackmailing to kill rhys made no sense because it implied Kate’s dad knew rhys has something on joe. In reality rhys doesn’t know who tf joe is
Surviving Death,"I'm going to agree with A LOT of what you said. Hands down the worst season. It didn't get good or interesting until episode 9!! 🤦🏼‍♀️ The whole ""Eat the Rich"" drama was over the top. None of the characters were good. Over the top, bad acting and hey who cares. Zero investment. Yes in season 2 & 3 there were over the top characters but the writing and acting brought them to life. Forty! Loved him! Sherry and Cary! Hysterical! There's no saving the ""Eat the Rich"" crew! No depth and uuuggghhhh so poorly portrayed.

Was taking that storyline sooooo far worth the payoff at the end! Not sure! 9 episodes were wasted. And really why oh why wouldn't Nadia call the police immediately when she found Marianne. And run like hell when she saw Joe!.🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
Surviving Death,It took you until season four to realise the writing makes no sense?
Surviving Death,"your complaints make no sense, ur questioning why a psychopathic killer who was experiencing dissociation killed people because of ""not much rationalization"" and yes not hiding Mariennes body was questionable but to me hiding her body was just extra work that wasnt necessary, he hides bodies that would be linked to him, NOt hiding her body isnt a ""plot twist"" in my opinion"
Surviving Death,"This show is not going for awards. It knows what it wants and executed on it. I love it. I just started, “Your Honor”. The judge is every bit of fuck up like Walter White was. It’s cringey, but I’m sure they know this."
Surviving Death,What I don’t get is now Joe has multiple personality disorder? Lol it would make sense if that was the case since season 1
Surviving Death,That’s how I felt until this season. It was sooo nonsensical that it wasn’t even fun anymore
Surviving Death,What was plot armor about joe in this 2nd part? I swear yall love throwing that word around when theres plausable reasons for whatever it is
Surviving Death,"How many people are going to use the useless phrase ""plot armor"" 😒 use your big words and explain exactly what you mean!"
Surviving Death,Joe has the good lawyers 😂
Surviving Death,"Not only that but Marianne wrote that in the letter she left for Joe that he read and then burned.

She literally requested that her buddy be found so that her daughter would have closure. 

It was not luck it was all part of the plan to keep her body safe and I guess there OP missed that part."
Surviving Death,">Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience. Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

>Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

No the plan doesn't make sense at all. Too many things could go wrong. You don't get locked up for months and decide to remain locked up with someone that hasn't fed you for a while. There was even no guarantee he would return. The plan to kill a professional could also easily go wrong. 

>The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just needs to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous

I don't have a  problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire. 

Joe in past seasons never killed for flimsy reasons. Why would Joe kill a drunk girl cos she said: the murders started after he appeared.

No one even took her seriously.

Joe mostly kills for obsession, love or to protect himself or those he loves. Even when he kills bad people, it isn't for flimsy reasons like that.

>As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe.

He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that"
Surviving Death,You should watch it. It will piss you off
Surviving Death,The season 4 love interest will frustrate you even more
Surviving Death,"I know a lot of people disliked Beck when the first season was initially airing, but she had by far and away the most chemistry with Joe, and the writing for her was far stronger than any of the love interests that came after her."
Surviving Death,I noticed that at the end. They just wanted him back in New York with no credible story on how to get him there
Surviving Death,"You can't even read and understand what I typed. You just rushed to defend

I said it makes no sense that she would fake her death rather than just escape or call the police. It makes no sense because she had no idea what he would do to her body.

Remember he burnt his ex-wife...there's no guarantee he wouldn't cut up Marienna or bury her

Her gamble makes absolutely no sense especially when you look at the easy option of getting him arrested...which she refused to do because PLOT"
Surviving Death,I’m with you. Felt like they killed it this season. This want early joe
Surviving Death,Seriously. He died but was lucky to get revived from the bay. It is broad daylight but no one sees him slit someone’s throat. His gf is apathetic to him being the one who murdered all her friends and her dad.
Surviving Death,">The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience.  
>

Of course getting the police would be the better plan, but she was traumatized, scared, tired, etc. The only thing that was keeping her going was her daughter. She wanted to get home and make sure the glove-trotting serial killer would never find her again.

>Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though. He didn’t care about burning Love’s dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn’t love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

>I don't have a problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire.

Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

&#x200B;

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that

He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media. He can erase any connection Joe has to Kate or himself. Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads."
Surviving Death,"So do you not know how the real world works. As stated in the show there are people watching the area because its a popular spot for people to jump from. And do you not believe in medicine or science? From personal experience i can tell you people survive drowning. When i was like 16 i got pulled out to sea and was basically dead, but here i am writing this. The only unrealistic thing about that scenario was how fast his recovery time was.

Did you not see the body was hidden in a non populated area behind a car with trees around. Its not that hard to understand…. He didnt just kil him in the middle of a busy highway 

Joe never said he killed all her friends and dad. He only specified that he killed people before. And we know kate is not all the way sane either. She is used to her father disappearing people (killing them) she herself gave kids cancer. And she did dispose of a body previously with joe. She loves him and so she accepts him. 

Im really trying to understand how this is plot armor to u, its not rocket science."
Surviving Death,">We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though.

Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.


>Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.


>He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men.

Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads.

Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice"
Surviving Death,">This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.

I’m not denying that it‘s a gamble or irrational. I’m just saying she’s a traumatized, desperate woman trying to make sure her serial killer kidnapper/stalker can never come looking for her again.

>This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.

Of course not, he’s crazy. He thinks a guy whose book he read and is running for mayor is blackmailing him.

Also I’d argue that he’s *always* smart enough to cover his tracks. When he’s more stable he comes up with it on his own. But when he’s split into Joe and “Rhys”, his mind rationalizes the importance of cleaning up his own messes by coming up with  blackmail schemes and avoiding being “framed.”

&#x200B;

>Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice

If Tom was running for mayor I’d agree, but he’s just financially backing Rhys’s political opponent. Plus, like I said, he can bury stories. No one knows Kate was responsible for children getting cancer when she was 19. If the media found out Joe killed Rhys, who would look deeper into Joe and Kate? Joe’s only friends are Kate’s friends. They barely know him, and they’re all too self-absorbed or too dead to cause a fuss in the media. Plus they would want to protect Kate anyway."
Surviving Death,"i loved black summer. it put walking dead to shame, but i never hear anyone talking about it and i dont know anyone who watched it."
Surviving Death,"No news in a while on whether or noyt a season 3 is coming. Kinda disappointed.

That one episode where everyone is trying to take over that manor in the snow is amazing."
Surviving Death,"The second season had 2 of the best hours of television I saw that year (2021?)

Was kind bummed when a certain character died."
Surviving Death,"I love Black Summer too but am sort of the opposite of you.

I thought S1 was solid but nothing special. However, S2 was legit good imo. The nonlinear storytelling was a little disorienting at first like you say, but they tied it all together really well by the end. 

Went back and rewatched S1 after finishing and it just confirmed my feeling."
Surviving Death,I love it and I'm annoyed with Netflix that they seem to be slow boating it. We should have like 5 seasons by now.
Surviving Death,"The best zombie show on television imo. The season 2 finale chase scene, gets the people going!"
Surviving Death,How did you like it compared with Z Nation?  The last season of Z Nation was total crap for me and I didn't even finish watching.
Surviving Death,"I liked the more ""realistic"" approach compared to other shows. I wish they did more tho :("
Surviving Death,I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it in this era of zombie media saturation. It was a surprisingly fresh take.
Surviving Death,I would also like to point out that it has absolutely the best Atmos soundtrack of any TV show (or media in general). There's a scene in the second season where there's someone walking upstairs and all the noise takes place completely overhead. So awesome.
Surviving Death,It was good but I enjoyed Z Nation better. The campy tone of Z Nation was so good. (Except for season 4 that was a disaster)
Surviving Death,"> No news in a while on whether or noyt a season 3 is coming. Kinda disappointed.

Yeah, I check on it occasionally. Good thing I'll say as at least it hasn't been canceled."
Surviving Death,Those two episodes were phenomenal.
Surviving Death,"I only watched the first season of Z Nation. If I remember correctly it was a bit humorous and slapstick? Black Summer is serious, not humorous at all."
Surviving Death,"Hi. I'll try to answer.

I don't think they always change. On The Original Series there were several actors that were regularly in the background or used for playing small roles. Yes, there were even actors as redshirts that got killed more than once. And there are different types of extras. Most extras come in for a day or two on an episode by episode basis, and will just be put at whatever station that helps make the screen look like it's filled with activity. Sometimes there are a small core group of regular extras that will appear in multiple episodes throughout the season and get paid a little more. I worked a background office worker extra on a TV show for two seasons. On the show Two Broke Girls, some of the regular diner patrons pulled double duty and worked as stand-in's for the main actors during set ups.

Day players (actors with one or more lines) are different. But, like extras, day players are not under a contract, so their appearances are subject to their availability. Basically Trek has always reused actors and does put some effort into trying to retain them, though it's not always possible, and keeping them at the same stations all the time is obviously not a priority."
Surviving Death,The guys in the red shirts who beam down with the landing party are not good candidates for recurring roles.
Surviving Death,"I do background acting on shows and movies. Some tv show directors are very particular about background, like to hand select them and are adamant in the casting calls about ""only fresh faces "" meaning you had not worked on camera on that production.

I think it just helps with authenticity in their mind. In practice, it doesn't make a huge difference to the average viewer."
Surviving Death,"I think the various Star Treks do try to keep some sense of recurring extras. Voyager did this as much as they could due to the premise of the show. TNG tended to stick to a handful of day players for the helm position and various other background crew. DS9 had Morn. Discovery's bridge crew has more or less stayed the same since the beginning, existing in a weird state somewhere between day player and actual cast.

It's also not a fixed crew, other than Voyager and Discovery because of their unique circumstances. Realistically, most of the crew would only serve a few years at most at a single post before being transferred and/or promoted somewhere else."
Surviving Death,"Spock and Riker had the job of creating the work schedules.  If it was ALWAYS the same person at the same console that credibility goes down (like Tom Paris, Harry Kim, and Tuvok on Voyager though they were in a situation where they literally couldn't pick up a new qualified Starfleet officer.)"
Surviving Death,"They keep getting into the teletransporter with Kirk, Spock, and Scotty, which is the Kiss of Death...Nobody can survive that!!"
Surviving Death,"Some of the Star Treks made more of an effort about. Voyager had a few extras who were around pretty much the entire series. Understandably, of course. I remember one guy even had his own wiki entry.

Ultimately as others have pointed out it's often a matter of logistics. Someone won't necessarily be available to do extra work for 6+ months of the year, for seven years. Certainly they wouldn't want to be paid the same for that entire time either."
Surviving Death,Chief O’Brien on NTG started as a nothing part.  He did have a few lines in the first episode but he didn’t even have a name until season two.  While never being a main cast member on NTG would go on to appear in 225 episodes between TNG and DS9.
Surviving Death,"You're not supposed to be looking at the extras.

But some shows don't allow background to do the same show for more than once a season. Some extras have better things to do."
Surviving Death,"Thank for the answer, sheds a little more light on what i asked about. I put too much of star trek stuff into the question i guess, what i am interested in is really only the production side for this question."
Surviving Death,"Well they die mostly. I just meant the other bridge staff or staff in general, sometimes you see a person twice, mostly on the next episode then. But there are never recurring characters that are not on the main staff. (Edit: In Tng there is a nurse that is seen more often, that is actually what i mean, why are there not more of those ""named"" background characters.)

Like a person that is on the bridge now and then, or in the medical station. Those are always new people."
Surviving Death,"I can understand that, as i said in the case of Star Trek those are ships with over a 1000people on board, so it may make sense to always see new people."
Surviving Death,"Voyager is a good example for this as it was one isolated ship in a far away place without any crew transfers.

I still think that there were a lot of new people brought into it for extra roles instead of relying on a small pool of people.

I actually should have brought that up in my original post."
Surviving Death,"There's not a regulation or obligation for upping an extra to a semi-regular extra, or for promoting a day player to a cast member. It's all up to the producers to make those decisions. Colm Meaney is a good example of someone that started out as a day player with an unnamed character that was later given a name and promoted to full cast member. Sometimes it happens like that, but there's no official process for that to happen to every actor."
Surviving Death,How sure are you that they don't do exactly this?  Have you really paid close enough attention to who is in the background of every scene to know for sure that those same people don't show up in the background of other scenes down the road?
Surviving Death,"While I am not an expert on this, my understanding is there are 'background actors' who don't have lines, and 'principal performers' who do.  An actor can remain background even over an extended period of time, so there's no contractual reason to churn them, but there's also probably not that much benefit to trying to ensure some concept of continuity for individuals in roles where it's not essential to the story."
Surviving Death,"Thanks again for staying with what i really asked. Colm Meaney is probably the best example for this. 

Seems it was a pretty obvious question, i just read that the Screen Actors Guild has some pretty strict rules about stuff like that. Just for example who is mentioned in the credits and where etc. Maybe, what i was thinking about, only applies to movies. 

I guess i did overthink this one a bit."
Surviving Death,"No i didn't, it was just something that came to mind when i thought about always seeing new persons that i never saw before. 

But why is that so important instead of the question i asked, if there is some rule or law that prohibits using extras more than a few times without upping them to cast members?"
Surviving Death,"Thanks, that is more in line of what i meant. They just use new extras because no one really cares. I was just wondering about it because i read about some laws that gives more rights (money, insurance, etc.) to people that are continually employed by a specific show in one role."
Surviving Death,"You're not crazy for liking something, if you like it you like it, but if others don't then they just don't. It's really not that complicated."
Surviving Death,"i binged it in a day.  it's not high art but it's extremely watchable

and man, it goes HARD at times.  love to see a show not pull punches with an otherwise ""morally upright"" character"
Surviving Death,The critics have an agenda against Chris Pratt
Surviving Death,I thouroghly enjoyed it too. And the TV LINE review that came out bashing it before it even aired is suspect as fuck. It takes a huge portion of the article before they even get into the actual review/plot...
Surviving Death,"I have been wondering this too. Seems that everywhere I look reviews are pissing all over it, but then I look to real people and they all love it. 34% critic reviews, 92% Audience reviews.

What is with all these really large disconnects between critics and audiences? Was the show perfect? no. But it was fun, and told a good enough story with good enough characters.

""It doesn't look deep enough into PTSD!"" why the fuck would it? Its an 8 hour long action movie with revenge and conspiracy themes. Critics are hating it for what it isn't instead of what it is. Which is weird."
Surviving Death,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show. Chris P did a wonderful job and some of the supporting cast were great too. Relatively familiar concept - and certainly rung true of Without Remorse - but that was shockingly bad, whereas this was bingeworthy entertainment. Would watch a season 2!"
Surviving Death,"It’s slow and it’s different. But it’s good. The main character is not what you’d call charismatic. Oddly enough I think it makes him more interesting. Maybe because it feels more realistic. Maybe it’s because we have been saturated with over the top charismatic main characters- I don’t know. 

There is a lot I could pick on in this show. But I wouldn’t be saying anything new. Besides, there is nothing surprising about the women in our modern day stories being written as nothing more then to be there to support the men. I’m genuinely shocked when I see a display of women getting to play actual real human beings. That’s shit is rare. 

I did spend most of the show thinking That one dude was his actual biological brother. Whoops. 

The main character is not anything like me. He doesn’t think like me or act like me or live in a world that looks much like the one I live in. But that makes it that much more interesting to watch. When you can’t guess what the person could be thinking or feeling or how he might react- it keeps you guessing. 

I like that this show gave us something different. I can appreciate diversity in the art we consume. Chris Pratt did a good job playing this guy. It’s different for him. He doesn’t get to rely on his “nice guy” charm. He is what makes this whole series work."
Surviving Death,"I liked the reporter character. She didn't feel the way you describe her. Yeah, she was annoying at times, but come on, she's a reporter, it's in the job description"
Surviving Death,I loved it.
Surviving Death,"7/10 is the perfect score. I think we're so starved for fun *mature* action series that we'll like sub par (Reacher comes to mind) series. I think The Terminal List would have been better if it were 2 episodes shorter and the ""twists"" were less obvious but it was an easy watch on a Saturday."
Surviving Death,"I thought it was pretty good, although he got gut shot going after the SecDef, was on the  verge of passing out, then 3 weeks later sailing a boat? Unless on heavy pain meds, not possible. 

Not to mention he took a bullet straight into the shoulder…..am i to believe he can fight skilled private security nonetheless hold any weapon or strike anybody with that arm?"
Surviving Death,Watching it now and so far it's great. Don't get the hate
Surviving Death,"I like it. 

That doesn’t mean it’s good but it delivers what I’m looking for in a show like this.

It’s feels like the Tom Clancy movie starring Michael B Jordan but stretched out to a series.

I’ve only watched the first episode so I’m still trying to figure out how they’re going to keep the premise going this season, much less potential future seasons."
Surviving Death,"The show is great. User audience scores are all in the 80s to 90s. It’s so called professional reviewers that are giving the show a bad score. All of it due to their politics, calling the show right wing. Which is pretty ironic, because if the show has any ideological bent, it’s that it’s anti corporate."
Surviving Death,I thought it was great. Some people didn't like the flashbacks to his family but I thought it really drove home what was lost instead of them essentially being props which is too common. (Ok they were killed theres your motivation let's move the story along)
Surviving Death,"Kind of makes me cringe as the protagonist he's just killing everyone, random security guards assigned to details get axes to the head even if they surrender."
Surviving Death,"Its alright, a solid 7/8 outta 10 because some of the acting and dialogue made me want eat a pile of ahit to get the taste of cringe out of my system, especially with the daughter but the overall plot and actions was pretty good for an action flick. However i find it crazy how the political/ military systems fail to catch this one dude. The bastard was more elusive then bin laden."
Surviving Death,"Nah, it's great."
Surviving Death,"I really enjoyed the series, I really liked Pratt in this too."
Surviving Death,I liked it a lot better than some similar shows I’ve seen.
Surviving Death,"I liked the portrayal of the hero as a competent soldier. He rarely fails to do what he set out to do. Example is the plan to assassinate Steve Horn. Another show would have found a way to make him escape and show up for some final showdown. But not here. The protagonist goes in with a plan, overcomes any obstacles that threaten the plan, and executes it. No bs. Much more satisfying to see."
Surviving Death,It's not really a review if you just write out the show's plot in three paragraphs with a few comments.
Surviving Death,The fact you’re asking this question is the reason why propaganda is still used today. They’re making you feel guilty about a show you like
Surviving Death,"This show is a big ""fuck you"" to woke critics. They think they are experts of some sort, instead of giving unbiased and professional opinions, they feed us with lies to support their political agenda. I almost got fed by those lies but luckily, I saw some pretty well-executed action scenes on Youtube. Got hooked immediately. The show is a solid 8/10 to me."

Back to Life,"Doesn't a genre have to, you know, go away before you can 'bring it back to life'?"
Back to Life,"Despite the clickbaitey headline, this was a pretty interesting article. It hinted that they're going to adapt The Last of Us Part 2 as well, and I'm really curious how that would work as a television adaptation."
Back to Life,Video game live action adaptations have been so terrible over the last few years I have very low expectation but let's see its from the same guy who made Chernobyl.
Back to Life,ugh im so excited for this show i hope it lives up to the hype
Back to Life,"The game was more about relationships and struggle, the clickers were just an ever present background threat that would come up at times."
Back to Life,"Something they say in the article that sticks out is that Bella and Pedro have to have a convincing relationship, otherwise the show is not going to work. From the trailers so far, I think the main thing that I’m not sold on is the two of them, but I think the reason I’m not yet sold on them is because of how perfect everything is in the video games. Movements, dialogue, acting, etc.  

Which brings up an interesting aspect to this show. Most movies are show based on popular IP’s almost never seem to get it right. Watchmen’s transition from comic to film lost some of the impact the comic had, and you can include the other numerous video game adaptations. 

I can appreciate the willingness to add or change some things to make it stand on its own, but I worry that they are changes for the sake of changes that could hinder the overall story. If I were a betting man, I’d still think it’s going to be a great series, but I’m eager to see how it pans out.

And adapting the second game? Good luck there. Part 2 is probably my favorite story in a piece of medium ever but I have no idea how they should handle the telling of that story from a structure stand point."
Back to Life,"In my opinion, the games weren’t good because of the zombies, they were good in spite of the zombies. As long as the characters and storytelling are still there, hopefully it will be good."

Back to Life,There is no way this is gonna suck right? Way too much going in its' favor for it to be good.
Back to Life,it won't
Back to Life,[removed]
Back to Life,"The choice in music in the trailer made me slightly hesitate, I’m reaaally hoping this is good"
Back to Life,"It's a great article with a lot of cool insight into the production. They just couldn't resist a pun for the headline, I guess."
Back to Life,"I think he means revive the quality. 

Even the premier zombie show on television ""The Walking Dead"" has only been declining in quality since the start."
Back to Life,No you see the zombie genre has been dead but never went away. Just sort of brainlessly trundling along.
Back to Life,"god damn do i wish it would, too."
Back to Life,"Spoilers for TLoU2 and Game of Thrones below:

>!Pedro trying set the record for “number of times head was smashed on HBO”, maybe? !<"
Back to Life,"The New Yorker’s article had even worse headline and that was also a good read. From those two, I don’t think we should be worried about quality or such. It’s clear the people involved are passionate and they understand what they’re doing."
Back to Life,I’m hoping they don’t. The gameplay and everything was great but I hated the super predictable outcome of the game.
Back to Life,I think it will. It seems like the creative process of bringing it from a video game into a series has been meticulously handled. And I think that Druckmann being heavily involved guarantees that it won't suck. Also it being an HBO adaptation instead of Netflix gives me more hope
Back to Life,That sounds like every Zombie piece of media.
Back to Life,"You're not wrong that the show hinges on Pedro and Bella having a convincing on-screen relationship, but frankly watching the trailers encouraged me rather than concerned me."
Back to Life,"Their relationship is supposed to be pretty contentious and tense at times. It'll probably be pretty hard to tell where they're at in their relationship during a trailer.

And I'm pretty sure Pedro has chemistry with every living thing on the planet, so I'm not too worried."
Back to Life,"They are both wildly charismatic, talented actors. There’s no doubt they’re both going to be amazing.

BUT I don’t think either are going to even try to imitate the games, and I think lots of fans are going to have a big problem with that. I think Pedro is going to be more like Joel’s game persona (but funnier, probably) but I don’t see Bella going anywhere near Ashley’Johnson’s performance as Ellie. They’re just two entirely different actors. (It also doesn’t help that Ellie is essentially an Ellen Page clone in looks and writing in the first game)

If you want to see Bella be a bratty kid she just delivered a great comedic performance in Catherine Called Birdy."
Back to Life,Part 2 is super adaptable but you can't  screw it with the casting 4 more leads.  That first chapter with young Abby and his father is going to hurt a lot.
Back to Life,"Yeah honestly out of all of the video game franchises I’m a little surprised HBO went with TLOU bc arguably the biggest part that made the game so great was the acting. It’s a pretty simple story in a fairly oversaturated setting/genre, but the characters bring everything to life. I don’t doubt that they got great actors for the tv show but I’m just not sure that turning TLOU into a tv show really ads anything. I’m worried it’s just going to feel like another basic zombie show, just with HBOs budget."
Back to Life,"Pedro is a great actor, he’ll probably really nail this role. But the trailers really have me worried, very wooden, average performance from the little I’ve seen. Nothing I have seen convinces me he’s going to be great here. But everyone else seems to think he’s nailing it, so good news is I’m probably just wrong."
Back to Life,Last of Us Part II is your favourite story across all mediums?
Back to Life,"THR came out with a Q&A with both of them. [Video here](https://twitter.com/thr/status/1610746839489445889?s=46&t=6YY-kqmSe3jkz0I4qthDAw) 

Their chemistry / dynamic is there. They’re adorable!"

Back to Life,Are you telling me humans are the real monsters? Wow
Back to Life,Sure. They just share a lot of similarities with zombies.
Back to Life,"This has the same energy as the “they’re not dragons, they’re wyverns” argument."
Back to Life,"Nothing indicates this show will fail lol. It has huge buzz at the moment. 

The zombie genre never really stopped doing well on TV or streaming anyway."
Back to Life,"One can not make proper critique on trailers like this show has. Not for line deliveries anyway. 

As we all know they change heavily. We've seen that already just in the trailers."
Back to Life,"I don't think anyone wants it to go the way of The Walking Dead and they say as much in the article. If they stick to their word if/when it's a success is another matter.
>Indeed, neither Mazin nor Druckmann want a show that’s season after season of weary survivors trudging endlessly through decaying buildings wary of mushroom zombies — that would be an undead fate all its own.


>“I don’t have any interest in a spinning-plates-go-on-forever show,” Mazin says. (He doesn’t say “like The Walking Dead” here, but I do.) “When it becomes a perpetual motion machine, it just can’t help but get kind of … stupid. Endings mean everything to me.”"
Back to Life,"Yeah this is the correct take.

Unlike shows like the Witcher, Rings of Power, Halo and Wheel of Time, they actually hired an incredibly competent showrunner.

Seriously, looking back at each of the showrunners of the shows I mentioned, they are all quite obviously either woefully inexperienced or completely unfit for the shows they were hired to helm."
Back to Life,"D&D would Iike to be called competent, but they sorta forgot."
Back to Life,"Well, unless their show runners want to give up on a project to work on Star Wars at least"
Back to Life,"Lol? D&D? Whoever ran Westworld? Nic Pizzolatto? A show being on HBO doesn’t guarantee it being a high quality one like it used to be back in the day, so this show has just as much of a chance of sucking as it has a chance at being good. Although, considering Neil Druckmann is playing a huge part in it, I would actually say that the chances of it being bad are higher than average"
Back to Life,When is it coming out
Back to Life,[deleted]
Back to Life,"Don't hype yourself up dude, it never ends well."
Back to Life,"I'll believe it when i see it. History has shown writers/producers, etc. disdain for source material"
Back to Life,HBO was the best show ever until the last couple seasons
Back to Life,Take On Me? It’s a reference to Part II. The show itself will be scored by Gustavo Santaolalla.
Back to Life,"Yeah I was impressed with the detail and insights in here. Writer really took the time to delve into the hows and whys of the show being greenlit, and wrote it in a fascinating way."
Back to Life,"People can saying that, but whenever I check ratings websites, every season is pretty consistent and it usually has pretty high ratings."
Back to Life,"Americana zombie genre is kinda mids. 

But oversea zombie movies and shows are dope. 

The Kingdom -Korean

Train to Busan -Korean

The Night Will Eat the Living -French 

American zombie movies tend to be bloated and bad. 

Foreign films tend to hit just right. I blame Marvel."
Back to Life,It's the only show I can think of that ran for multiple seasons where the pilot is the best episode.
Back to Life,">!And people always act surprised that he'd take a role where his character never takes off his indestructable space helmet. It's not a costume, it's job security.!<"
Back to Life,Okay.
Back to Life,fingers crossed! Never been a video game person but loved Arcane (although obviously super different story/filming as its a cartoon). HBO def gives me hope
Back to Life,TLOU fans act like it invented every trope of zombie/post apocalyptic fiction.
Back to Life,Well it's not. TLOU takes place like 20 years into the apocalypse. Most zombie fiction is not in the future. The relationship people have with the apocalypse and with the infected is very different than most zombie fiction.
Back to Life,I don’t think I’m encouraged or discouraged. I think to me it feels off because it’s not an exact 1 for 1 recreation (which is on me and my preconceived feelings having played part 1). I think when it’s all said and done and we get to the ending episode it will for sure succeed in the same way the game did.
Back to Life,"The fact they were auditioning Kaitlyn Denver from booksmart suggest they were kinda right doing that search, just a hunch."
Back to Life,It’s up there for sure
Back to Life,"Yeah especially when we are talking about ""the zombie genre"". And even if we aren't ""zombie"" and ""infected"" are just two ways different stories make the same monster."
Back to Life,The success of the game had to be so vindicating for him.
Back to Life,"This was the argument used by Danny Boyle when 28 Days later was coming out, ""they're not zombies, they're infected,"" which is technically correct, the creatures are still living humans just infected by the rage virus, but the film had all of the hallmarks and trappings of a zombie movie, which made his argument come off as kind of pretentious."
Back to Life,"Coff coff, the walking dead called, it wants to know where all the viewers where when it ended recently."
Back to Life,">Halo

Back to Life,Two billion dollars in profits and 59 Emmys. Total incompetence.
Back to Life,I see that the mean muscly girl lives in your head rent-free lol
Back to Life,"You guys are insane for bringing up GoT, and thinking that is knock on HBO."
Back to Life,If D and D weren't competent showrunners y'all wouldn't still be complaining about them.
Back to Life,Jan 15th
Back to Life,Why are bot accounts responding so late...
Back to Life,I want to believe
Back to Life,I think it's going to be good 🤷
Back to Life,Neil Druckmann is involved…
Back to Life,There really wasn't disdain just a lot of misunderstanding of a quote from mazin. He's a huge fan of the games.
Back to Life,"That makes sense then, I haven’t had the chance to play part II

Thanks for that"
Back to Life,"He does this and more in his podcast, Scriptnotes with fellow screenwriter John August. It's a podcast for screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters. They have over 580 episodes."
Back to Life,"TWD is one of those shows that's been so consistently popular and well liked by most over the years that reddit's contrarian hate circlejerk meter has to go off constantly even though its dumb. 

The hate here relative to how popular the show is is absolutely laughable. Especially since it rarely is actually hated by critics either.

Same thing happened to game of thrones and a hundred other things. The sub argued constantly that no one likes thrones anymore until literally any thrones content released and of course was popular as hell."
Back to Life,"If ratings = quality then why was 2 And A Half Men one of the most highly-rated shows during its run? TWD might have mass appeal, but I don't think many critics are tripping over themselves to praise the quality after season 4 or 5."
Back to Life,"*Every* season? No way. If ever there was a “peaks and valleys” show, it’s The Walking Dead.  

Even as late as 9-10, they managed to pull off a great arc with the Whisperers (a genuine accomplishment, considering it came *after* losing Andy Lincoln); but everything that followed was a mess, with a stilted ending undercut by the franchise’s refusal to die."
The Netflix Afterparty,London Hughes is fuuuucking annoying. Spade and Fortune are great though.
The Netflix Afterparty,"I'm happy for him to be (likely) cashing in big time after Comedy Central screwed him over.

A year ago, Spade launched a nightly chat show on Comedy Central.  It was surprisingly great.  It wasn't over produced, it was just him and a different-each-night group of his celebrity friends, cracking jokes about the pop culture events of the day.  Spade has a huge contact list so he had no problem getting guests, or including including any up and coming people he felt like.

You didn't have to be a Spade fan or even a fan of comics.  It deliberately kept politics off the menu, so it drew high praise from just about everyone, regardless of where they fell on the social spectrum.  It was sprinkled with half decent little bits, which I see have been poached into the new show.

Just as people were noticing the universal praise for Spade's show, COVID hit.  As most productions shut down, Spade actually continued doing the show, but from home, with remote guests.  He didn't miss a day!  But for some reason, the twits at Comedy Central wouldn't air these home brew episodes.  He kept it going for weeks while everyone else was shut down and pondering their own existence.  

Then, as other shows tiptoed to re-opening, Comedy Central just canned the Spade's show.

It made no sense.  At a time when most content was just... gone, he was making content for them, and they didn't care.  They didn't even have a replacement, so they just let Trevor Noah do extra long, extra tedious interviews in its place.

Netflix tends to insanely overpay and keep hands off the production, so I'm glad he's getting the last laugh at least."
The Netflix Afterparty,"I am glad that David Spade found a new gig after Lights Out was cancelled.

I am not sure if Netflix is the best place for weekly show though."
The Netflix Afterparty,"I want to like David Spade but the most recent thing of his I liked was Tommy Boy.

I just get tired of his arrogant character that, without fail, delivers like he invented sarcasm."
The Netflix Afterparty,"Wait, is it just going to be Spade with the same two sidekicks? Huge mistake.  Spade has basically all of Hollywood at his disposal, and having just those same two sidekicks will get old, fast.  If they're going to rip,off his former show, just do that, and have the revolving guests thing."
The Netflix Afterparty,"She really is. I like the idea of the “season finale recaps” that cable would have after big shows though, but she needs to go"
The Netflix Afterparty,Fortune is fuuuuucking awful too.
The Netflix Afterparty,We thought so too.... she also needs to lay off the blow...
The Netflix Afterparty,"He was screwed over but also he is so so so so damn rich

Which means he wasn't hurting particularly

Where was his home brew episodes?"
The Netflix Afterparty,"Yeah I loved lights out, he got so many great comedians on the panel"
The Netflix Afterparty,i am eternally pissed the soup another weekly show on netflix wasn’t given a bigger chance
The Netflix Afterparty,You’re gonna sit here and tell me you don’t like Joe Dirt
The Netflix Afterparty,Why you gotta do Emperor’s New Groove like that?
The Netflix Afterparty,"He's good in a side role, but he can't really carry anything on his own. IMO"
The Netflix Afterparty,"All of them should be on either his personal Instagram or YouTube channel, some are on lights out Instagram"
The Netflix Afterparty,To be honest Lights Out was a brief relief after @midnight & Chelsea Lately ended.
The Netflix Afterparty,Leaving out Larry Wilmore and Jordan Klepper.
The Netflix Afterparty,You only get one shot… Twice !
The Netflix Afterparty,"Everything on Apple TV+ feels like someone really cared about it. Not always to the best result, but stuff doesn't have that corporate manufactured feel."
The Netflix Afterparty,"I actually just watched it for first time over last few days too right after watching Detroiters for the first time. Noticed Sam Richardson was in Afterparty too so decided to give it a go.

Thought it was really good - liked the different perspectives all being a different type of genre, liked the characters and there were a lot of good actors in the cast, and thought the central mystery was well done."
The Netflix Afterparty,"They're working on a season 2, but I don't know much about it. I wouldn't look it up if you aren't done with season 1."
The Netflix Afterparty,"What a coincidence, I clicked play on a whim and ended up watching the season today"
The Netflix Afterparty,I loved it. It’s so fun to watch.
The Netflix Afterparty,That was a fun watch
The Netflix Afterparty,When I start something with a mystery element there's a nagging feeling that maybe the ending will be disappointing because there's so much weight on the reveal. This one left me satisfied.
The Netflix Afterparty,"Definitely watch the [music video](https://youtu.be/wIdmCpqCPWk) they did for it.

Miller (and Lord) do a great job of making catchy music for their stuff."
The Netflix Afterparty,Such an amazing show. Can’t wait for season two. The Xavier music video and albums are brilliant.
The Netflix Afterparty,"It was great but it was also very obvious who the killer was.  I hope they make a better mystery for Season 2.  
  
OP, if you haven't seen Black Bird make it the next one on your list."
The Netflix Afterparty," > Ben Schwartz is particularly fantastic 

Oh you think so?"
The Netflix Afterparty,The Apple astroturfing is unreal on this sub.
The Netflix Afterparty,It's so great! I'm looking forward to the next season!
The Netflix Afterparty,I wasn’t blown away but I enjoyed it.
The Netflix Afterparty,"Sam Richardson is a treasure, and should be in a lot more stuff. (And hopefully not in stuff that gives away the ending in the first ten minutes.)"
The Netflix Afterparty,"That's a good way to put it yea. A lot of different things so you won't like everything, but there's a high quality to it that you don't see on Disney+, Prime or Netflix to the same degree."
The Netflix Afterparty,"Outside of Mr. Gorman, which had some good acting and scenes but otherwise was meandering and plotless, everything I have watched on Apple has been great

I love For All Mankind and Foundation among other shows (severance, ted lasso etc.). They make good TV."
The Netflix Afterparty,"I feel they are the one place that just gives talent a big check and says “go nuts”. At the moment they don’t care about ratings they just care about reputation.  We love a lot of their shows.  

The Morning Show had an awful second season and we dropped it though."
The Netflix Afterparty,S2 comes out Apr 28!
The Netflix Afterparty,"I know Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, and Zöe Chao are returning, in addition to this new cast:

- Elizabeth Perkins as Isabel
- Zach Woods as Edgar
- Paul Walter Hauser as Travis
- Poppy Liu as Grace
- Anna Konkle as Hannah
- Jack Whitehall as Sebastian
- Vivian Wu as Vivian
- Ken Jeong as Feng
- John Cho as Ulysses"
The Netflix Afterparty,Yeah it was a real fun show to watch.  Even more fun when you go back and see the clues they planted throughout the series.
The Netflix Afterparty,"I just finished it and I agree. Even tho i picked the perp, there were a ton of red flags I missed."
The Netflix Afterparty,"They also released the character's mini album. 4 songs:

* [Imma Live Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjmmBbQA4Us)

* [Just Like U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhwrqjgD78)

* [Do Wet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAu775_BAKI)

* [X Marks the G Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk-xIU0OvVc)"
The Netflix Afterparty,"Now that I finished the season, I have to admit your comment was unfortunately a spoiler for me. Mad at myself for posting before I finished. However, looking back - my sentence about Ben is very funny."
The Netflix Afterparty,"Yea that has to be it. Definitely not the fact that their content is of high quality across the board and is being noticed, at the same time there's a lot of low effort, low quality new content from Disney+, Netflix and Prime."
The Netflix Afterparty,🙄
The Netflix Afterparty,"Disney+ and Amazon Prime are the epitome of that ""corporate manufactured feel."" They're releasing primarily lifeless crap nowadays."
The Netflix Afterparty,"Haddish is still getting work after her very unwholesome skit last year?  That's gonna be a yikes from me, dog.  Shame, too, the musical episode of S1 still lives rent-free in my head with that ""You only get one shot, twice"" song.  Guess I'll have to sail to my friend's house to watch S2 on his account so that none of my subscriber fees goes into Haddish's royalty checks."
The Netflix Afterparty,Take out Whitehall and that's a great cast.
The Netflix Afterparty,"well, that sold me on the show

Hauser's performance in Black Bird bought enough good will for me to check him out in more things"
The Netflix Afterparty,"Did you figure out who the killer was?  I was downvoted for saying it, but it was very obvious.  They were the only one that didn't have a matching story.  That one character's events were almost completely fictional."
The Netflix Afterparty,honestly it doesn't really matter who the killer was by the end of the season.
The Netflix Afterparty,There are tons of good shows on FX but you'll never see such posts for FX because they don't hire astroturf squads. HBO is a different class so it getting praises definitely makes sense. AppleTV+? Not so much. Plue Apple TV+ has less than 1% viewership in the US. So who the fuck is watching these shows?
The Netflix Afterparty,"It was filmed, or had already started filming before the news broke about her. I hope they don't bring her for season 3 if there is one"
The Netflix Afterparty,Bruh I saw posts about The Bear out the ass when that was airing. People definitely talk about FX shows here
The Netflix Afterparty,">	There are tons of good shows on FX but you’ll never see such posts for FX

A lot of people get long free subs to Apple TV+ with new devices. To watch FX I’d either need to have cable or know about FXNow…which I only know about because I just googled it now."
The Netflix Afterparty,What other FX show has got that much traction here? Almost none unless you count 'Mr. Inbetween' which is an older series.
The Netflix Afterparty,">	. To watch FX I’d either need to have cable or know about FXNow…which I only know about because I just googled it now.

Hulu"
The Netflix Afterparty,"Just recently, Reservation Dogs got its well-deserved fair share of love and 'traction' on here. A lot of people went to bat for Under the Banner of Heaven when it was airing and soon after, and while The Old Man and Fleishman Is in Trouble didn't break through as strongly, I still see them recommended from time to time.

Otherwise - Fargo, Always Sunny, Archer, What We Do in the Shadows, The Americans, Justified, Atlanta, Legion and The Shield all have massive fan bases on this sub and are talked about very, very often. Lesser mentioned but no less loved series like You're the Worst, Devs, Baskets, Dave and Better Things are also mentioned consistently.

You're just wrong. People are just excited about the quality-first brand Apple TV+ is currently building. People have been impressed with the quality FX brand for a lot longer."
The Netflix Afterparty,Legion is literally mentioned twice in the sub's sidebar.
The Netflix Afterparty,I'm absolutely ready for more and would have loved Ben Shwartz to return for a cameo or something
The Netflix Afterparty,I hate the name of this show because I always confuse it with Search Party which was also a comedy murder mystery.
The Netflix Afterparty,"Walt: It's finally my turn to be the star of the season!

...

Guys?"
The Netflix Afterparty,Really enjoyed the first season but I still find Tiffany Haddish an odd and poor choice.
The Netflix Afterparty,Nice! Afterparty was a surprisingly clever series.
The Netflix Afterparty,"This is good to hear but the second season does need to step up the writing

The first season was entertaining. but considering the cast, the show should have been much funnier.  It's still worth watching."
The Netflix Afterparty,That was a great whodunnit where they gave you enough breadcrumb clues towards who the murderer is. If you pay close enough attention you can figure out who it is before the finale which is really rewarding.
The Netflix Afterparty,🏁 ¡Ska-pe Diem! 🏁
The Netflix Afterparty,Do you have diarrhea or do you don’t have diarrhea?
The Netflix Afterparty,"Afterparty is the only murder mystery thing that xame out in the post-Knives Out resurgence that I really loved. Creative,funny and a solid mystery."
The Netflix Afterparty,They got their one shot… twice !
The Netflix Afterparty,Most exciting part of this announcement for me is that Zach Woods will be in it. I’ve missed him since Silicon Valley went off the air.
The Netflix Afterparty,Whoa. Is that Sam Duvall?
The Netflix Afterparty,"I loved every second of season 1, and have been eagerly awaiting season 2 for awhile now!"
The Netflix Afterparty,"This is literally just an advertisement.  The user clearly is getting paid by apple, if you look at their profile.  Downvoted and reported."
The Netflix Afterparty,let's gooo
The Netflix Afterparty,Season 1 was great except for the zoe episode
The Netflix Afterparty,"I despise Apple, but appletv is straight KILLING IT"
The Netflix Afterparty,"I don't really see where a season 2 could go, but I'll keep an open mind since I enjoyed the first one so much"
The Netflix Afterparty,The Afterparty was a hit? I thought it was mildly received.
The Netflix Afterparty,I tried to watch this but couldn't get into it after 3 episodes. Is it worth another try?
The Netflix Afterparty,♥️🍎
The Netflix Afterparty,This show was awesome
The Netflix Afterparty,Really interested to see what movie genres they do next season
The Netflix Afterparty,how didnt they cut tiffany haddish after the kid stuff
The Netflix Afterparty,Hooray!!!
The Netflix Afterparty,[removed]
The Netflix Afterparty,"I was so hoping something like that would happen and a Dave Franco bit as well, even though he was killed in the first one.  He gave his horrible character human points.  That is actually hard to do."
The Netflix Afterparty,[deleted]
The Netflix Afterparty,Getting Zach Woods in there is a great consolation prize
The Netflix Afterparty,He was the best character! the show will have to work hard to replace his energy.
The Netflix Afterparty,Me too
The Netflix Afterparty,This came after
The Netflix Afterparty,I was wondering if her recent alleged legal controversies would hinder season 2 but it doesn’t seem like it
The Netflix Afterparty,Yes. She's not a good actress
The Netflix Afterparty,"she was easily the weakest part of the show. 
I can't put my finger on it but there's something in her acting style that is just unconvincing and off putting."
The Netflix Afterparty,"They definitely had me fooled. But pretty much every murder mystery I watch has, unfortunately."
The Netflix Afterparty,"""my neck, my back, Marion Berry did some crack"" is a HOF line unless Sam improv'd it"
The Netflix Afterparty,He’s good in avenue 5
The Netflix Afterparty,"I'd say about half of this subreddit is ads, maybe more."
The Netflix Afterparty,"I love AppleTV but you’re exactly right. I was surprised because I watched Afterparty and thought it was fine, but most of the Reddit comments at the time were very whelmed. But this post would lead you to believe it was a beloved show. Clicking on OP’s account it’s clear they are either a huge of Apple TV or paid to be one."
The Netflix Afterparty,"Alright, just don’t get Apple TV+ then."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,I’ll definitely be checking this out! Hadn’t heard about it till now.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,The book and its corresponding movement have been incredibly impactful in the west. I wonder how much of that can carry into a TV show though.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,I can’t wait to watch this! That trailer alone relaxed me more than anything else these days has
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Now I don't have to pay for headspace?!?
Headspace Guide to Meditation,">A female character is flawed then she's downright unlikeable, if she's perfect then she's labelled 'Mary Sue'. A show is either 10/10 or 1/10, there's no in-between.

This has been the most obnoxious part regarding the recent Rings of Power discourse. The show isn't flawless perfection and the second coming of the Jackson trilogy? Well then, it's 1/10 the worst shit ever, Tolkien's spinning his grave, etc, etc... It just makes any discussion nearly impossible. I don't think there's a lot of people saying it's the greatest show ever but there ARE a lot of people saying it's basically a blight on humanity and I just cannot understand how that is a normal reaction for people to have."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I go through this occasionally, but I've learned to cope and tune it out. I finally broke down and learned how to do it when I discovered The Murderbot Diaries, devoured every single one of them (7 books) and sought out an online community to share my enjoyment with.

Well, apparently the entire Murderbot subculture has been co-opted by militant non-binary people who have herded together and ruthlessly smother any discussion that doesn't uphold their interpretation of what the character is all about. 

It really ruined my love of the books, until I realized I was letting them control my feelings about something I really, really enjoyed, and why should I allow them to have that control over me?"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Yeah, social media sucks"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I think the only solution is to just disengage, or limit your engagement.

Social media (including reddit, this site we're using right now) has one function: to put forward content that you will click on.

That's it. It's not a research tool, it's not a friend-meeter-upper, it's not a life coach. It'll serve those functions to a limited degree, but only insofar as it thinks you'll engage with it.

Guess what engages people? Anger. Bad opinions. Nasty serotonin from taking things down a peg, especially if they ""deserve"" it.

You really can't escape it, and you fuel it by engaging with it. Just step away. Enjoy the thing yourself, or with your friends in meatspace. Let the internet be the internet sometimes."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I think, generally, identifying surface level criticisms is easy, but makes people feel smart. If you're looking for nits to pick, you'll be able to find them. And generally, people are pretty bad at identifying why they like and dislike things, and are more than willing to be dishonest with themselves about their own motivations.

I generally like criticizing the things I like, but unfortunately that isn't the norm."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,I stopped watching YouTube reviewers long time ago for this same reason. I also have noticed that exposure to this toxic waste could hinder my enjoyment in tangible ways. I just watch the show or the movie.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"If you analyzes *everything* with a critical lens you are bound to be miserable with everything. Sometimes you just have to enjoy the ride, that's part of being a balanced individual."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Unfortunately true and something I’ve noticed has made me a lot more cynical about shows. Like damn all I want to do is discuss what happened in the latest episode and all I get are threads of people complaining about every small detail that’s not in line with their expectations.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I guess it depends on what you mean by critical. People should engage critically with the media they consume, and examine what works and doesn't, what they like and dislike, and why those things may be. But critical in the sense of overt negativity, there is far too much of that. A lot of people don't seem to grasp that like/dislike and good/bad are not synonyms. That and the level of hyperbole these days is off the charts. If ""She-Hulk"" really is the worst TV show you've ever seen in your life, then your experience with television has been quite fortunate, lol"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Well said. I think it’s because everyone needs to have a hot take. 

That’s my hot take anyway."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Fandoms become really toxic when fans see themselves as owners of the IP. 

When you base your identity around an idea and then people begin to change it without your “permission” you can lose your shit. Especially when, in your mind tampering with the IP is akin to tampering with your identity. 

If you like a thing that doesn’t mean other people who like it will like it for the same reasons. That’s why I’m happy to like things for me and leave it at that!"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"This is why I’ve had to limit how much I participate in subreddits for TV shows I like. I subscribe because there’s good discussions and memes, but I always end up getting annoyed at all the nitpicking and negativity. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with criticizing a show or talking about parts you don’t like. But some people complain to the point where I wonder why they even bother watching a show they don’t seem to enjoy. 

I was in a sub for one show the other day where someone was complaining about small inconsistencies in the show’s timeline. But the inconsistencies were so minor that I wouldn’t have even noticed them if this person hadn’t gone into painstaking detail about it. At the time I watched it,
I was too absorbed in the story to notice. 

To each their own but I watch TV to relax and be entertained. I don’t care if it’s not perfect. For me, obsessing over imperfections or parts I don’t like sucks all the fun out of it."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I think you're forgetting one major flaw... Most people that watches a show or plays a videogame aren't a part of these ""fandoms"". Off the top of my head I can mention the Final Fantasy XIV forums and subreddit as an example. Many times these places will complain non stop for the sake of complaining about anything they can and if you look at them you'd think the playerbase is a toxic mess while in reality it's one of the friendliest playerbases.  
  
Then we can look at the Nintendo Switch Subreddit as another example. I've seen people literally worship the console as if it's the most innovative thing to happen to gaming.  

We can look at one like Doctor Who communities. They're either extremely positive or extremely negative about anything and everything even remotely regarding the franchise.
  
Communities trend towards negativity because of a simple negative human factor. People want to agree with the masses not because that's how they truly feel but rather because they want admiration and validation.  
  
If I can offer you one bit of advice... Wean yourself off the need for social media and always being in the know. Enjoy your games, shows, books, movies etc. and choose for yourself what you like and dislike and remember it's okay to change your mind too! That way you'll look at media with an mostly unbiased viewpoint and base what you enjoy on your own tastes. You'll see you'll start to love a lot of things more and generally have a positive attitude!"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"The opinions\* of others in regards to art I enjoy does not affect my enjoyment in the slightest.

You dont enjoy it? Cool.

It aint gonna make me dislike something that I am enjoying.

I think it is also important to recognize that people should be able to enjoy aspects of art without enjoying it in its totality. Too much these days we see people being polarized on opposite ends of the spectrum when the reality is that it is more about shades of grey.

*edit - \*negative opinions*"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I don't get it, can't people form their own opinion based on their viewing experience?
I'm a big fan of supernatural, i know everything wrong about it and used to go to the fandom to read their opinions on how horrible it was. and you know what i did, i tuned in the next week because i love the characters.
You actually getting bothered about ""small"" details after reading about it doesn't mean their opinions ""ruined"" the show for you, it means your standards got higher and you saw their point, it means the show was infact not entertaining.
Just to clarify, i never watched rings of power and probably never will because I'm not a big fan of the universe i don't find LOTR that much entertaining."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"On the other hand, projects that add to an existing franchise should not be free from criticism *especially* because popular franchises are often used to sell things based on the name. Look at Netflix's Resident Evil. It was an absurd departure from the IP and the fans largely hated it. That's totally fair. Criticism and dissatisfaction are fine and act as a form of quality control, ***so long as the criticisms are fair and not just toxicity.*** It's up to us to filter out the fair criticisms from the garbage ones."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,[deleted]
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Decide an opinion for yourself.

There is no reason why you should substitute anyone else's opinions for your own.

Nor should you spend time looking for other's to bolster your own opinion.

It's all subjective.

It's pretty much all valid.

(And I say this as a veteran Star Wars and Marvel fan from around these parts. We like to eat our own. lol)"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Thank you for saying this. I’ve actually deleted all the lotr subs for this exact reason. I love the show and found these haters attitudes were spoiling it for me
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Get off social media.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I don't know. For me, I like an informed opinion from someone who has more info on the thing. After an episode or 3 of the Wheel of Time and Rings of Power I wondered... Is this garbage? Cause it seems like garbage. Lol and behold, people confirming things which I was just in the cusp of noticing. My hope is that more quality content comes out."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"1. Watch a television show, move on with your life.

2.  Watch a television show, read critic reviews, watch YouTube commentary about the show you just watched, make a reddit post about how you disagree with the other people posting about the show online."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,For me it’s the opposite. Over positive fans usually oversell the show and then when I watch it I judge it as below the standards that they set
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Disagree. People are free to point out the mistakes and have a negative opinion of a show. On the contrary, it seems there are a lot of people like you who want everyone else to blindly praise everything that gets put on screen. That I find much more annoying. Everyone is free to have a (negative) opinion of a show and share it."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Fandoms can be pretty toxic. The best thing to do is to watch and enjoy the content, but minimise your exposure to people discussing it online. It will leave you disliking the material."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Okay, I agree that there are a lot of upsetting parts on the internet and a lot of people that blow things out of proportion. But honestly? The opposite of what you're saying is more annoying.

What I don't understand is the amount of people jumping to defend popular shows. I didn't even watch the lotr show nor am I really interested in it, but why is everyone saying ""think of the creators"" and ""think of the studios"" and dismissing every criticism as bad faith or an attack on the creators? Think of who, the poor multi billion dollar corporation Amazon? Who cares? Why does everyone act like they have a personal stake in it?

If you like the show, enjoy it and have fun. If you hate the community, don't interact with them. Complaining that people are criticizing something you like is basically saying everyone's opinion is toxic because it's upsetting to you. 

There's so much mediocre drivel in the media and fandoms *always* just dismiss criticism the same way you did. See: Marvel. They've gotten way worse recently. But the internet's response? ""Don't listen to the haters.""

I thought doctor strange: multiverse of madness was terrible. Two hours of nonsense. As soon as people started criticizing it, you'd get posts like *this* saying they really liked it and anyone criticizing just doesn't like things, has an ulterior motive, or is just TRYING to be toxic and ruin someone's fun. Why can't you let people **dislike** something without backlash?

There will always be haters and always be blind fanboys. Be reasonable, criticizing something isn't harmful, and you shouldn't take it personally."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I'm not one of ""just turn your brain off and enjoy it"" people. Watching shows critically and judging them does 2 things:

1. raises your standards for media in general

2. decreases the number of shows you will find enjoyable

I think ""being in a critical headspace"" is a great thing. I *want* to be in a critical headspace, I want to be able to tell if a show is any good or not, and not just come away with ""I liked it"" or ""it wasn't for me"". I enjoy the discussion around media quite a bit, recently often more so than I enjoy the media in question.

>most of these criticisms are by people who hate the show for other reasons

I do not think that's true at all. Or you use Twitter, could be that."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"""Critics/fans ruined art"" isn't a new idea.  IMO the artists and fanbases/critics don't owe anything to each other.  A third party's commentary about a piece doesn't detract from the original art's value to you unless you let it.

Yes, often fandoms suck, but that shouldn't make you think less of the art, it should make you think less of humanity."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"In recent times I’ve come to the realization that the last group of people whose opinions should be respected are the diehard fandoms for which the show is made. DC and Marvel fans have no fucking idea what a good DC or Marvel movie looks like, GoT fans have no fucking clue what makes a good GoT successor, Star Wars fans have no fucking clue what is compelling about the Star Wars universe and LoTR fans apparently have no fucking idea what is boring and what is not."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Social media has allowed the voices of the few to sway the many. If you turned off Twitter and Facebook you would be left with a solid fantasy TV show with an absolutely unreal visual experience. Less posts about online hate, why do we have to give so much air time to the people online who complain all the time?"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"""if you dont like the show, dont watch it!""

""if you dont like critical comments, dont read them, no?"""
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"This is hilarious. You are mad at people for pointing out flaws in a show you like, you now don’t enjoy said show as much, it must be because of their toxic ideologies hidden away behind their valid criticism. Think about what you wrote in this post dude, you are admitting that you like a show less because it’s poor quality was pointed out. That is what a review is for my friend."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"But if we're being honest, the media also does a great job of blowing ""toxic fandoms"" way out of proportion."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"""WAHHHHH PEOPLE DON'T SHARE MY OPINIONS WAHHHHHH""

If negative reviews are so disturbing to you, don't read em. Nobody is forcing you to click the youtube videos or read the reddit posts or the imdb reviews. End of story. It's literally that easy."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Yes, fans are to blame for multi-billion dollar companies delivering subpar content. 

What definitely isn't toxic is the media branding people with criticism as racist, sexist Russian bots."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Then don't read negative opinions. If you want to only read positive takes there are plenty of subreddits that cater to that. Same if you only want to read negative comments.  

Personally, I think that dismissing most critics as ""people who hate the show for other reasons"" to be nearly as toxic as some of the people who rant about every change or accuse most people who enjoy the show as ""shills""."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Instead of writing this essay, you could probably not read the negative reviews?      
Rings of the Power sucks. Apart from visuals, everything else is absolutely atrocious, especially the writing. So the criticism is deserving and this rant is not going to change it."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"If people explaining what sucks about ashlw ruins it for you then you were the problem for not spotting why it sucks, and they fixed you.

Critical thought isn't making shows suck, THE SHOW CREATORS ARE."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Companies are monetizing fandoms. Fandoms owe nothing to companies. They are free to critize anything they seem fit, especially if the companies are as lazy as Amazon. 

Fans not being happy is not toxic, claiming they have to be is."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Seems like YOU are influenced by peoples' opinions then YOU get mad at them. This is your own toxic behavior. People are allowed to have their own opinions.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,The first 2 episodes of the show were a slog for me for me for this very reason. I kept myself from reading things about the show and then the 3rd improved substantially.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Now do the news and politics.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,I'm loving it so far!
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I absolutely agree. When someone go on a rant about why a show is bad but then list you a list of shitty little detail or scene that have no impact, how can you takethem seriously.  Oh episode 3 of rop was bad because of that 40sec of horse rinding..please."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Good God this is one of the best posts on here in AGES and I couldnt agree with it more.

Those harpies can really ruin a show for you.  Especially on reddit."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Maybe don't blindly agree with giant corporations who blame the fanbase for toxicity when they churn out a poorly written adaption.

I swear that last Star Wars trilogy just made people intolerant of criticism."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Sigh, ""fandoms"" are a community of people who like a thing, however, they don't like it all in the same way as they still remain individuals. A bit of clunky dialogue maybe a non-issue to you but could be the thing that breaks another's immersion. The show may interpret a long anticipated bit of lore in a way you're cool with but might leave another disappointed or confused, further frustrating their experience with said adaptation. So what recourse does a disappointed fan have? To vent! So they do but the problem is they do it in the same space where you want to revel and because both sides feel emotionally invested in their stances shit gets volatile. Worse yet, the Internet polarises everything so every argument becomes a dog whistle to a more sinister issue and then the true disrespect begins because everyone sees the other side as morally reprehensible.

The problem we have here is simply an inability to respect each others experiences. Much like you are frustrated by multiple posts critiquing a show you like, another is pissed when they see a post that dismisses their critiques. This isn't a fandom thing but a basic issue of socialisation that plagues all discourse. The only way to avoid it in media is really to pull a miracle and create something of near universal acclaim. However, that's something which is rarely achieved so I choose to focus on my own judgement of a thing, good or bad. If I like something I trust in that even when reading others criticisms (as half the time, the thing they're critiquing is likely the reason I like it) the reason for my enjoyment will remain consistent. Then, I try not to vilify and assume bigotry unless blatant (as to me, the assumption of moral superiority will always lead to more conflict and not less). If I hate a thing I try to vent in such a way that people understand that I'm being subjective and try not to impinge on another's  enjoyment, however, even if  I clarify that something doesn't suit my tastes someone else will eventually take offence as they feel their taste is being called into question. When that happens I try to move on cos the discussion is no longer about the story, it's now become personal.

Bottomline, is that your enjoyment of these fandoms is tied to whether there is a consensus that you agree with. When there is, those subs are fun as fuck but when there isn't your hype is dampened. That is the nature of the beast and unless you establish a personnel etiquette in how you engage that stuff  your gonna be pissed regardless if you like the show or don't."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Imagine wanting a safe space from television critics 😂😂😂😂
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Totally disagree. Its absolutely a good thing that people point out flaws in bad shows. We will never get anything decently written again from these big companies, if people are ok with terrible untalented writing like rings of power has. Toxicity if of course wrong, but valid criticism is not.

If you actually start hating rop because of the criticism you hear about it, that is a good thing."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"A lot of fandoms are shit.

But I can't imagine caring so much about some random strangers opinion on something that it would affect my opinion on that same thing."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I think the fandom just magnifies what is already there. And it just so happens that most shows are shit nowadays (sorry not sorry)

During the first 4 seasons of GoT, the fandom unquestionably stoked my fire to fall in love with the show."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Hey everyone has their own opinions and nobody's being held at gunpoint to watch videos or follow fandoms,"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Judging from a lot of the comments out there you would think that RoP is just another Amazon's Wheel of Time type fiasco, then you watch the episodes and the show is actually pretty good.

It isn't perfect, sure, but until now they didn't break the lore more than Peter Jackson did, they even added in a lot of references to the first age that only book readers can understand. Numenor is honestly wonderful, beyond imagination, they nailed it. They also nailed everything about the dwarves and they absolutely nailed everything about the orcs. 

Some of the hate the show is fueled by a bunch of youtube channels that started spreading the whole narrative that the show would be a woke propaganda disaster months BEFORE the first ever teaser came out, so there is that too.

If you think that the negativity is messing with your experience, just stay away from it. Maybe you are also looking in the wrong places? I only browse r/Lotr_on_prime, the consensus there is extremely positive while criticism is reasonable, and there are lots of new theories and discussions about the show every day so you might enjoy that."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"the risk exists, yes. I am a Nintendo fan and the subs are the most ridiculously pessimistic ones so I never read them. No big deal, I'm an adult, know very well what I like and dislike, no amount of praise or slander is gonna change my mind. 
At the same time I ain't afraid of voicing my opinion. Nothing like death threats or downright loathsome things like that, but if I think a show sucks I'll say it; that will lump me in the same hate brigade as the others, but that is inevitable


I can see how younger folks who want to be part of the community can feel disheartened though"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I think you are assuming too much innocence and naivety on the parts of the people involved in shows.

Making a show that is based on an existing IP that goes in a different direction than the initial product is a great way to attempt to make money.

It brings in the audience that initially liked the IP as well as well as the audience that likes the new direction. Naturally, this also annoys some of the fans of the existing IP and produces a negative reaction from them if the new direction doesn't land as it's hard to block out if you don't like it.

(Pretend that you like Middle Earth but, don't like Amazon's shows. You'll be hearing about them nearly constantly for at least the couple years or so whenever Middle Earth comes up. If the shows have staying power, Middle Earth may end up being primarily about Amazon's show and it's spin-offs.)

If your content is good and appeals to a wide audience, the annoyed section is going to be mostly drowned out by people that like the new content.

If the content isn't good or doesn't appeal to a wide audience, the annoyed section is going to end up being harder to drown out which leads to articles and press releases about how the people that dislike your content are bad (Let's face it if your show is being marketed to millions of people some of them will be bad.)

Amazon could have saved hundreds of millions on the IP and made a similar show to what they produced with name and visual changes while also avoiding much of the negative backlash from fans of Middle Earth that didn't want Amazon changing Middle Earth for them.

They choose not to do that because, the IP is what they feel draws people to the show not the content of the show and as a result the massive price tag for the IP was worth it to them.

This is made even more clear it's about the IP when you consider that Amazon is operating in a period of Middle Earth where the content is rather limited and Amazon doesn't actually hold the rights to all of the surrounding content.

“We have the rights solely to The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King, the appendices, and The Hobbit. And that is it. We do not have the rights to The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, The History of Middle-Earth, or any of those other books…We worked in conjunction with world-renowned Tolkien scholars and the Tolkien estate to make sure that the ways we connected the dots were Tolkien-ian and gelled with the experts’ and the estate’s understanding of the material.”"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,The show's writing is beyond bad. It's borderline average. Exposition overload. I don't need to read other people's opinions to know this.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,I quickly unjoined tbr r/Rings_Of_Power sub because of this
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Totally agree. The fandom ruined Westworld season 1 for me.

I watched 2 and 3 without reading any fans stuff and adored them. Went back and read the Reddit comments and it just looks like a bunch of seething losers with nothing better to do all jerking themselves off and other unsuspecting people being swept up in their wake.

Like there were comments I agreed with but the way most people were writing off the show while if was airing was so melodramatic and absurd. People need to get a grip. 

I'm so glad I realised what it was before I let it ruin most media for me. Everything is 10x more enjoyable now."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Some people are just negative to the point of hysteria about rings of power. Like it is unquestionably at least a decent TV show. But some people have a cult like devotion to hating it.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Very thoughtfully written and unfortunately, very true. There's absolutely no reason for a supposed fan to be so viscous. It's gotten so much worse in a relatively short time. I was mod of GoT on the former G+ and it wasn't like that then. People were very into the characters and compare the show to the books, but it wasn't nasty at all."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Has this experience with a game. The Last of us Part 2. i loved the game! It was so powerfull, moving, beautifull, fun, exciting to play! I loved the story and the characters. The story beats hit me like a truck sometimes! It was awesome! 
I intentionally kept away from reviews and trailers and anything that could spoil it for me beforehand (TLOU 1 was so good, i trusted the devs).
Afterward i finally go online to share the excitement… big mistake… 
A very loud part of the gaming community visceraly HATED the game. Hated the story. Were furious about the story decisions. They shouted at everyone who enjoyed it. 
Got sucked into it, cause i wanted to defend it… but all of that just left me exhausted and the original joy i had when playing, soon was just a memory tainted by all the things that got pointed out to me. Things i don‘t mind at all, but now i have the thought of „oh people hated this part“ when i play it and that while not destroying, still taints the experience. Wish i had just stayed away…"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Yes. The hate for the new Star Trek shows is a bit loony.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"This is how I felt after Thrones ended tbh. I really didn’t mind that ending as much as other people, but damn those GoT subs will try their hardest to make you feel like less of a human over that. Either you hate the ending or you’re scum I guess 🤷‍♀️"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"It's basically all the internet tbh, everyone is out there to make hyperbolic statements and convince you their opinion is correct. That's why it's important to find people/peoples whose opinion you respect and who actually relay criticism well. Ever since the rise of Youtube critics all those years ago it's become way to common for people to just mimic that style of ""reviewing"". Things can't just be not for me or bad, they're now horrible and the worst thing I've ever seen. It's become ""cool"" to hate things, and there is no middle ground anymore.

A few years ago I learned it's just best to avoid it all and recognize your taste and pick what you want to see based on that. I've basically just given up on paying attention to reviews. I take a quick look at the RT score and see if it's not getting ridiculously low scores and judge for myself, only after going to the few people whose opinion I enjoy hearing. It's made my entertainment experience 100x better and actually been a big help mentally to not get sucked into all the bullshit that comes with it."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"This is why i stopped reading show specific subs on Reddit; fandoms are weird and cant be reasoned with.
I just wanna enjoy my shows in peace."
Headspace Guide to Meditation," I feel a lot of what your saying. 

&#x200B;

The same thing happens with video games for me. Not naming the game but the sub was so toxic before and after release I just unsubbed from it. Because like you said it can influence you to pay attention to flaws that you would have never even noticed or even cared about. 

&#x200B;

Some subs get so hyperfocused on EVERY single possible flaw.. 

&#x200B;

I think one of the problems is not everyone is going to universally like ANY form of entertainment which is fine. But now those people have a soapbox to stand on in the form of the internet with a massive audience. 

&#x200B;

Before the internet if you did not like a movie, game or whatever. You just stopped watching or playing it. End of story."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I agree 1000%. I think social media impacts more than just pop media this way, I probably spend too much time considering what the mass opinion is of something rather than just being secure in what I think.

I also believe as I've gotten older I've become more critical and that's made it more difficult to suspend my disbelief and truly enjoy something like LotR: RoP."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Doctor Who fans were the worst at this around the Matt Smith era. They’d read the episode preview, go and write their perfect version of it in elaborate fanfictions and then get angry that the real episode didn’t meet their crazy high expectations. All because their head canon plot for one character didn’t match what the real writers had planned for a whole season of development. So they criticised every tiny detail. Tumblr was exhausting back then"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"If you only want to be exposed to an echo chamber of pure positive reinforcement about your own sentiment toward the show, why would you seek out criticial analysis at all? 

I'm more interested about why rings of power fans are so determined to go to war with the critics, who are having a field day right now because there are so many flaws. It's a losing battle, and maybe this is why you're unhappy. Focus on what you like about the show, not attacking its critics."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,I agree completely. Problem is we're often bombarded with these negative opinions without even seeking them out.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Something similar I find myself doing: I'll be enjoying a show, but then something will happen and I'll think, ""The fandom is going to hate that"" or, ""People are going to be complaining that was too 'woke' and unrealistic."" Even though I'm enjoying the show and personally disagree with the presumed fandom response, it somewhat ruins the episode for me because I'm thinking about the fandom and no longer feeling immersed in the show."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Yep, so true. I don't really read reviews or engage in too much with fandoms when something is current. My exception is Fallout 4 related stuff on reddit. I feel that since the game came out a good number of years ago, the ones that are still posting content are the ones that truly love the game (like me!) %. The toxic element is gone as those people have moved on to be toxic on a sub for a different game 😂"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Can someone send this guy all the counselors so they can give this man plenty of hugs.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"It's not even the just the fandoms. Something I've noticed especially on social media. Barely anyone knows how to legitimately criticize something. Most of the opinions boils down to ""I don't enjoy something or I disagree with something therefore it's bad and I should tell everyone."""
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Y’all internet people need help. People who have nothing to do with the show shouldn’t affect you. Log off.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Yeah this is relatable. I try to block it out and enjoy it based on how I feel.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"tangential but relevant: 

the hypocrisy that the same people bitching about 'cancel culture' are out here screaming about ""oh no there's a Black Ariel"" ""oh there are black hobbits"" etc, is exactly what they WANT us to be focused on and talking about.

I submit to you fellow Redditors that the more we point at this hypocrisy, the more nothing changes. We need to be calling these campaigns what they are: People trying to stop the long overdue surge in representation for people of color and women. That's all this is and that's all it's ever been about. Stop the debate. Stop the conversation. Point, shine a light on it, call it what it is: racism and sexism. And when they say ""oh you can't have this conversation because you know you'll lose"" or whatever 8th grade petulant bullshit they'll say, just remind them that you ""know what they're doing and I'm not playing your sick game.""

Fuck these racist chuds."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I get the feeling you wrote this because of Rings of Power, and frankly dude it's a bad look. People are so emotionally attached to these IPs that it makes you blind to how trash this show is; they don't want to admit it's bad so they try to attack the criticism by labelling it as racist or sexism or whatever."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Thanks for this. There are certain series that have been ruined for me because the fandom sucks and I feel like I can't be part of it. Or that it is over critiqued when it's just something to enjoy. 

Yes I do like listening to reviewers talk about movies/shows online whilst doing chores/hobbies ect. But only in regards to certain thing. It's just frustrating when a fandom gets super toxic and critical and it ruins your enjoyment."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Rick and Morty has been dealing with this.  You have a bunch of fans who are so obsessively-passionate about the series, but in a super critical way where they consistently tune in for new episodes and go to the comments immediately after with their weekly rant about how it's not perfect.

It's got to be so much worse for Rings of Power between the hardcore old-school Tolkien fans and the recently-emboldened racists, but I at least know a few Tolkien fans who are enjoying it so far with no gripes about lore accuracy."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"So criticizing a show hurts viewers' feelings?

Ok, Bezos, this is pretty clever.  Strong Social Media Management department you got there.

Good job.  Funny how Social Media's reactions to shows have been just peach until ROP.

Remember the final season of GOT?  The organic reaction to that was just fine."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Rings of power is fuckin awesome and all the people ranting about it can eat a bag of rancid rotten orc dicks.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I’m applying this logic to everyone saying the Netflix resident evil show was bad. I’m so sorry it wasn’t exactly like the video games, but I really enjoyed it and was keen for more. Thanks to everyone who ruined it and got it cancelled."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I'm very selective about who I watch on youtube and aggressively ""do not show me this"" the trash channels. The internet is a breeding ground for a lot of really cool things and a lot of sad people in basements and grifters. Everyone should be very firm on who they watch on youtube imo, being wound up in your downtime isn't worth it.

The culture war ""teams"" choosing every other show, film or whatever to push the barrow is punishing, and I say that as someone firmly left wing but not American (so the American ""I'm The Main Character"" syndrome in their culture war is equally grating. In ROP case, go away, Tolkien never wrote about you).

I'm a bit critical of ROP (I give it a 5/10 - middle road) because even if I accept they've thrown out all bar the broad strokes of the lore, the canon backstory and characters are more interesting and make more sense to me so it does get marked down for going its own way but not justifying it. The show is very pretty though and is entertaining enough despite trying to go wide in scope a bit too early, so while I'm a bit sad it isn't high art like Tolkien I still watch and I hope the show gets into more of a groove. Episode 3 was a lot better than the first 2. The scene with Arondir, Elf leader man and the water was really really good tension."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,This sub is pretty bad for it too recently that I've noticed. If somethings a 7/10 people will give it the most scathing criticism for not being Succession or something
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"You don’t have to interact with fandoms, if you really loved a show just watch it and do something else with your life after an episode’s over. Fandom is never forced upon anyone"
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Really good commentary. Something has gone wrong, and the Internet enabled it."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Orville fans can be huge dicks in this regard.  Sure theres plenty of fans who like the show and leave it at that, usually viewers who haven't watched 80s/90s Star Trek, but for those that have seen every episode of Trek, suddenly they claim its better than Star Trek.  They often go into vague details as to why New Trek sucks, some never bothered to watch beyond one episode.  

Also difficult to have an honest Trek tread anywhere on Reddit without 3-4 users posting about how Orville is so much better & original compared to Star Trek.  Of course when the trolls try this on /r/startrek, they quickly get banned for being huge dicks, then cry about how their rights are being violated, claiming /r/startrek is a corporate owned forum. 

Im a Trek fan and I like New Trek because its different, but I have to admit some seasons have their flaws, specifically S1 of Discovery & S2 of Picard."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I stopped being a Harry Potter fan by the time the second movie came out, for this same reason lol."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"I also think the mainstream media and the studios' responses to this stuff doesn't help the situation. Yes, some fans will react in this very negative way and quite often, those negative voices are louder than the positive ones, but look at how those negative voices are enabled. The Youtube channels and even mainstream media sites hone in on those negative voices. Their articles focus in on that negativity, resulting in enhanced attention to it. Studios do the same thing. Quite often I wonder what would happen if a studio just came out and said ""we made changes, we want to try something different, not everyone is going to like it and that's ok"" and then just leave it at that.

I'm 40 years old, I've lived through countless reboots and updates to franchises that I watched as a kid (Transformers, TMNT, G I Joe, Thundercats, He-Man, just to name a few), so I'm used to these shows making changes that I sometimes like and sometimes don't like. What turns me away most often though is how the showrunners or studios handle that feedback. For example, when I was about 6 or 7, I watched the original She-Ra and was a big fan. So I was excited when Dreamworks announced the reboot. I watched the 1st season, it didn't really click with me so I stopped watching it. However, the media, the showrunners, and the studio went with the ""old fans are bad, their just horny old men not happy with the new designs, the old studio wasn't very good at making cartoons,"" routine and they reinforced my views of the show considerably.

The same thing with Kevin Smith and his MoTU: Revelations show. I didn't like the first half of it and MIGHT have given the second half a try had he not had the responses that he did on social media following the reactions from long time fans who weren't happy with how Revelations treated the characters (I hated Teela's character but rather enjoyed Andra). Some of those responses were a bit over the top and could be considered toxic, but there were some legit criticisms about the show but those criticisms were lumped in with the toxic ones. Smith's response cemented my decision not to support part two of Revelations.  


So I agree that there are elements of fandoms that do get overly possessive, toxic, and downright hateful, and that they can influence a person's enjoyment of a product. However, I also put forth that the toxicity and negativity is often inflated thanks in part to media outlets and studios/showrunners focusing in on it with their various public relations statements and marketing. Sometimes it feels like those flames of toxicity and fanned on purpose, either to drive traffic to the articles or just to stir up buzz about the project. As the old saying goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Criticism, even loud criticism is nothing new in the online space. You could go back to the 90s and see the exact same dynamic in USENET forums. Or look at forums whenever there has been a change in D&D editions. And don't get me started on the Lost finale. The only real difference is that ""fandom"" ""nerd culture"", or whatever space you're talking about has grown exponentially so the criticisms and praise grow that much louder.   


One of the first things you learn in stats, beyond a basic grasp of the bell curve, is that engagement is almost always dominated by passionate people with strong opinions. It's like pulling teeth to get qualitative data out of the middle-of-the-road sorts. This will never change. And it probably shouldn't. It works when it's a part of a mechanism where showrunners and writers can look at the noise, parse out what's helpful and what's just weird and improve their product. It's the cost and responsibility of operating in the public sphere.   


This isn't to say that there aren't trolls and just people who hate everything, just as there are people who will blindly love whatever drivel is served up to them. But most people are genuine in these spaces and there is valuable feedback on both sides if the creators are willing to disarm a bit and let go of the defensive reflex. Either way, it's never going to really change, and the best thing to do is just like what you like and maybe realize that a decent portion of the online sphere just isn't for you, if it gets to you this much. And that's okay. Everything isn't for everybody, find the mode that works best and enjoy."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"Not all fandoms. The Good Place has an awesome fandom, as does Minecraft. I'm sure many others have too."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"While I agree with you in some capacity, I still find my self not enjoying Rings of Power at all.

&#x200B;

And I dont pay much attention to fandoms or reactionist youtubers...I like Critical Drinker reviews of movies for their comedy but I totally skip his other videos where he is just talking smack with his crew.

&#x200B;

So I consider my self impartial enough to not get carried way neither by hype or hate and with Rings of Power...I can only talk by myself and Im very disappointed.

Its not that its bad...I think it would be easier for me if it was bad, it would be like ""they are trying to do something new and its just not for me!"" but no...its boring, the pace is atrocious....their version of Galadriel is so unlikable...looking back on the books (never read the appendixes, letters, etc, but have I read silmarillion, hobbit and the trilogy) and on the movies, I could see my self not liking the show but finding it boring? That universe and lore...Im very surprised in a bad way.

&#x200B;

All this to say that eventho you are right, this show gets a lot undeserved slack BUT I do feel that it also gets some very deserved one."
Headspace Guide to Meditation,It's not even that for a while there seeing stuff on TV I think we were able to dismiss it as not being like reality but as it's become more and more like reality we now find ourselves in the mind of Mark Twain where we kind of want our fiction to have some consistency and make sense especially when we try to deal with the fact that real life often will never make sense
Headspace Guide to Meditation,Just remember every story you like was made by a person. Just like you. Just enjoy it for what it is and not try to make it some religion. And in the meantime it's ok that other people like the same story as you. But you don't all have do get in a BJ chain gang about it.
Headspace Guide to Meditation,"There’s a lukewarm take that says something like, “men are interested in the curation/collection side of fandoms, while women are more interested in the creation/collaboration side of fandoms, so that’s why men challenge women over bits of trivia to prove their ‘true fan’ status, and why women don’t have any interest in this because they’re too busy writing novel-length fanfic or hand-sewing replica costumes. You cannot measure fandom on the same scale of engagement when men perceive successful engagement as hoarding the most action figures in boxes and memorising the most trivia, while women perceive success as getting engagement with their fanart.” 

This is a lukewarm take, of course, and it isn’t really a gendered thing so much as a set of stereotypes. But what I’m getting at here is that people tend to choose very specific forms of engagement with material, and they DO NOT GET the other forms of engagement. A comic book guy who feels that spending thousands on unread back issues = rewarding is usually NOT going to enjoy a 5,000 word essay on what the character reveals about being gay in the 1940s, etc., but both are normal ways to be crazy geeky fans.

Lots of people really enjoy criticism/critique and find it a powerful and interesting way to engage with media, learn new things and build relationships. Often they use this as a way to to examine their own interests, such as improving their own writing. Others use it as a kind of ongoing learning for themselves and their philosophy, and still others make careers out of it, from writing pieces for websites to becoming professors of media studies. 

It really sounds like you don’t do well interacting with this content. That’s not a judgment, it just sounds like you can’t perceive it in a positive way. So when you spend time on sites/subs dedicated SPECIFICALLY to this kind of interaction you aren’t going to gain value, and you’re not interested in generating that kind of content or contributing meaningfully to it yourself (again, this isn’t a judgment, but you do seem to have forgotten your agency here.)

You might enjoy other facets of fandoms more. Perhaps conventions? Cosplay/design? Collectibles? Roleplay? All of these will have separate communities that don’t engage much with the media criticism side of things. Maybe you could try watching your shows with your actual friends who also like/enjoy these shows."
VINLAND SAGA,This season is going to be the biggest love it or hate it I'll have seen in a while.
VINLAND SAGA,holy fuck how are Mappas animators still alive
VINLAND SAGA,The first season of this show kicked so much ass. I can’t wait to see the new season
VINLAND SAGA,"Won't be the same without >!Askeladd. He was the most interesting, entertaining character.!<"
VINLAND SAGA,"https://vinlandsaga.jp/onair/

Season 2 of Vinland Saga will stream on Netflix worldwide except in China and Crunchyroll worldwide except in Asia."
VINLAND SAGA,I never recovered from losing the wild ass screamo music from the first half of S1.
VINLAND SAGA,"great, cant wait"
VINLAND SAGA,/u/Shimmering-Sky that dank SORE DEMO
VINLAND SAGA,"It's the same team as the first season, they just switched studios."
VINLAND SAGA,"They're killing it on Chainsaw Man, too. Just watched the first two episodes that dropped yesterday, and God damn was it nice to look at. There's a certain quality to their animation I haven't seen replicated."
VINLAND SAGA,what do you mean this is a huge downgrade from WIT
VINLAND SAGA,it's good but does become quite different
VINLAND SAGA,[At least Thorkell is there for us.](https://i.redd.it/53nfjhhtsfq61.png)
VINLAND SAGA,did they keep the netlfix dub cast?
VINLAND SAGA,"It's a bit trippy seeing this on other subs.

SORE DEMO"
VINLAND SAGA,"it still looks notabely different/worse than season 1, so did they lose budget or what?"
VINLAND SAGA,"Honestly, they even smashed it out of the park with Attack on Titan Season 4. Sure, it's not the same as WIT, but that's because it's a different style. When they've been given enough time for animations (Namely the blu-ray releases), their season looks downright amazing (Also preferred their version of the Attack Titan, too)."
VINLAND SAGA,"I've only watched the first episode, but Chainsaw Man didn't look that great. I don't know if it's CG, rotoscope or whatever, but it doesn't look as good as Jujutsu Kaisen or even the Vinland season 2 trailer. It's only the first episode so maybe the animation gets better later, but the heavy workload the studio is under probably doesn't help."
VINLAND SAGA,It's literally the same animators as season 1
VINLAND SAGA,"It’s possible Netflix and Crunchyroll will both have their own dub, so probably. I’m not entirely sure though, an anime releasing on Crunchyroll and Netflix simultaneously is kind of unprecedented."
VINLAND SAGA,Sadly no commentfaces for reactions on r/television ...
VINLAND SAGA,It looks the same as season 1. What are you taking about?
VINLAND SAGA,[removed]
VINLAND SAGA,"Did you not see the opening or that fight at the end? Yea the CG looked decently rough but the color grading, detail, and lighting were the best MAPPA has ever done, far better than JJK even in episode 2."
VINLAND SAGA,"it literally looks different don't know what to tell you

reminder of what s1 looked like https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0_MoEaS73pWQB-BYnvnKomoosFM=/0x0:1280x720/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1280x720):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23403755/11811844.jpg"
VINLAND SAGA,lol no it doesn't https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0_MoEaS73pWQB-BYnvnKomoosFM=/0x0:1280x720/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:1280x720):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23403755/11811844.jpg
VINLAND SAGA,my biggest problem is that chainsaw man himself looks rigid when in motion. is it really any better in the second ep?
VINLAND SAGA,"I don't think it's fair to judge a book by its cover or in this case, an anime by its opening intro. However, I think the two openings in Jujutsu Kaisen are superior to the one in Chainsaw Man. As much as I enjoy the film references they did, it didn't hit as hard as sleeping on a train or that intricate bubble burst animation."
VINLAND SAGA,"I watched the first episode of season 1 on a whim when I noticed it on Netflix. Over the next few days I would start doing something else, pause, and then go watch another episode instead, and then another, and another.

I've never really watched much anime, I have nothing against it, I just never really got into it properly. I watched some Hellsing in middle school because a friend recommended it, I watched Cowboy Bebop due to word of mouth, and I watched One Punch Man because I heard Bill Burr of all people talk about it on his podcast.

I fucking loved Vinland Saga, I'm super excited for season two, and I'm quite keen on checking out more anime in general. I'm always looking for new things to watch, both for entertainment and inspiration for D&D plot hooks and the like, and ignoring anime seems like a mistake when there's so much potentially great stuff out there that I'm just unaware of."
VINLAND SAGA,"A lot of people seem to dislike the farmland arc, but I for one am extremely excited to see it adapted by this awesome studio. The prologue has always been hard to beat"
VINLAND SAGA,I swear this studio been collecting those infinity stones
VINLAND SAGA,"can't wait for this, I really enjoyed the slower parts of season 1, and this eems to be a self reflection arc along with torfinn atonijg for what he's done, super hyped"
VINLAND SAGA,Haven’t read the manga but s1 was amazing and is in my top ten anime list so I hope this one won’t disappoint
VINLAND SAGA,"Can't wait for this season to completely turn off a large part of the fanbase. Don't get me wrong, I loved this arc, I think it's brilliant. But it's also like 90% about being a slave on a farm. A far cry from all the viking action the first arc was."
VINLAND SAGA,lol animation is a huge step down just like with AOT
VINLAND SAGA,"After getting into Anime with AoT/DS and MHA, my standards a jacked high tbh. Only found Spy Family to be really fun"
VINLAND SAGA,"I know you're probably getting bombarded with suggestions, but if you're interested in grounded anime, I would check out a show called 91 days. It's an excellent prohibition era mob story based in Chicago. The dub is actually phenomenal as well."
VINLAND SAGA,"Those that dislike farmland dislike it because it moves away from the more Shonen style of Manga which is very battle-centric. Lots can't understand that this is a story about maturing hell Thors literally spells it out in the beginning. ""Listen to me, Thorfinn. You have no enemies. No one... has any enemies. There is no one... that you should hurt."""
VINLAND SAGA,Really? From what's I've heard its the golden age arc of vinland and by far the best.
VINLAND SAGA,Farm arc is best arc in the manga
VINLAND SAGA,"I disliked just because I read while it was releasing and the pacing slowed down a lot, so it felt like it went on forever. I'm sure in a reread it won't be bad"
VINLAND SAGA,"Looking back Farmland Saga was fantastic, but reading it as it came out was rough"
VINLAND SAGA,MAPPA is good but let’s be real. They are no Wit studio.
VINLAND SAGA,[deleted]
VINLAND SAGA,"Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, and My Hero Academia, did I guess those correctly? I've heard good things about all three, but not seen any of them."
VINLAND SAGA,"I mean, not that high. DS/MHA are pretty bog standard shounen when it comes down to it"
VINLAND SAGA,"I'm not actually, so I appreciate it, thank you!"
VINLAND SAGA,"Depends on who you ask. I think the main gripe is that there’s not enough action, which is like the whole point lmao"
VINLAND SAGA,It's the same staff as the first season.
VINLAND SAGA,"blame the owners for cheaping out so they can keep more profit

pisses me off they won't give these iconic manga the budget they deserve

guess it could be worse, just be glad it's not Berserk level cgi I guess"
VINLAND SAGA,"Yeah you got those right but out of those three, only AOT has a good plot imo. The other two are cookie cutter shonens with surface level dialogue. Demon slayer however is worth watching if you can stomach the poor characters and writing in favor of some high quality animation"
VINLAND SAGA,"Listen, I can't recommend AoT or Demon Slayer to you.  They're very poorly written.  AoT has the benefit of a great premise but I can almost guarantee that you will be very frustrated with the over exposition.  Demon Slayer is even worse.

If you loved Vinland Saga like I did, the closest to that sort of quality of animated show on Netflix are Castlevania (not anime - it is made by an American studio) and Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Arcane is good, too, but not anime.

If you have Prime, I strongly recommend Dororo."
VINLAND SAGA,Action is the whole point of what?
VINLAND SAGA,so where did the budget go
VINLAND SAGA,[removed]
VINLAND SAGA,"I've seen Arcane and loved it, despite having zero interest in League of Legends. I haven't seen Castlevania, but I've been meaning to. Neon Genesis Evangelion is a show I've heard a lot of good things about over the years, it's on my list of stuff to check out for sure. 

One of my friends really likes Attack on Titan, so I might check it out for that reason alone. Demon Slayer is something I know nothing about, I've heard people say it's good, but I also don't pay attention to anime discussions or news at all, so I have no frame of reference, same goes for MHA really.

I appreciate the recommendations, thank you!"
VINLAND SAGA,AoT has a great story and dialogue lol
VINLAND SAGA,"Sorry I didn’t really word that correctly, I meant the show not having a lot of action is the whole point"
VINLAND SAGA,[removed]
VINLAND SAGA,"This is AoT:. ""He has a sword.  What is he going to do with it?  Is he raising it against me?  If he is raising it against me, then I should raise mine and defend!  Oh, he IS raising it against me!  We shall fight.  I see that he is attacking from the left, so I will dodge right..."" And it's like that the whole show.  Maybe I'm just too old.

I have no doubt that you'll enjoy Castlevania.  It's beautifully animated and written by Warren Ellis.  Supposedly he and Netflix and Powerhouse (the studio) are working on a Ramayana inspired story next."
VINLAND SAGA,"Oh, haha I thought this was a response to something in a different sub. All good.

I'm looking forward to less action, more character development to be honest. I'm pretty excited."
VINLAND SAGA,"That does sound like it would get old very quickly. I also haven't found it any streaming service (Crunchyroll might have it, but I haven't really looked into that yet), so I'm not too fussed about it right now."
VINLAND SAGA,It's on Netflix in the U.S. too.
VINLAND SAGA,It's also been on HIDIVE in the US for a while (no idea about Canada).
VINLAND SAGA,"Same goes for the Netherlands!

I really disliked it when this series disappeared from Prime, as it was promoted as a Prime Original. Now we know that moniker is useless."
VINLAND SAGA,"Is the show good? I'm a little tired of anime in general, too much unnecessary dialogues (I'm ok with a lot of dialogues but they have to be good and it's often not the case)."
VINLAND SAGA,It's on US Netflix too.
VINLAND SAGA,"So I watched this a while ago and I found it to be good but definety not to my tastes overall. The show is carried by the Askeladd character while the other characters fell flat for me. The season starts amazingly and ends amazingly but has a slow and sluggish middle. 

As for your complaints about dialogue, I don’t think this anime has those issues? The dialogue felt pretty realistic and there’s no big exposition dumps or characters explaining their attacks."
VINLAND SAGA,"i really enjoyed it, but then im a *very* casual anime enjoyer and also a sucker for viking stuff and revenge storylines lol."
VINLAND SAGA,"You need to watch different kinds of anime.

- Dororo
- Paprika
- Legend of the Galactic Heroes
- Perfect Blue
- Inuyashiki

Might be anime you enjoy."
VINLAND SAGA,"If anime followed manga more closely in general and they would remove all the filler moments (stand still faceshots of people dialoguing/monologing about the fight) and FILLER EPISODES, everything would be so much better. 

I get that a lot of animes had to go fillering shit, because they caught up to the manga, but there are so many others, where they would not have need for filler, but they're going for it anyway, to stretch it. And not only does it kill the momentum, but with weekly episodes, it also kills the need to actually see the next episodes when filler arc hits. 

But tdlr; it's in general all the fucking padding they throw into animes, that have turned me (and many others) off from that totally and just read the mangas. Not because I want to be an elitist fuck, but because manga has way better flow and focus on the essential stuff."
VINLAND SAGA,"I know what you mean.  I couldn't see what the hoopla was about Attack on Titan because the dialogue was always over explaining what was happening on screen.  I believe it's called exposition.  I never felt that way with this show.

Not all anime is like that.  This is a more maturely written show."
VINLAND SAGA,"Don’t watch anime. They’re all objectively bad and all the filthy weebs trying to say there are exceptions are idiots. 

Watch Donghua instead. It’s anime but made in China. Basically they’ve got the design and amazing animation of anime but with none of the drawbacks (no overexposition, no fanservice, no problematic messages). 

Give Heavens Official Blessing a try, it’s on Netflix. It’s the closest to feeling like Vinland saga, but with none of the drawbacks."
VINLAND SAGA,And UK Netflix!
VINLAND SAGA,"> As for your complaints about dialogue, I don’t think this anime has those issues? The dialogue felt pretty realistic and there’s no big exposition dumps or characters explaining their attacks.

No, I'm talking of anime in general, I haven't seen a second of this specific one. In all anime people talks and talks and talks even while jumping or taking a punch in the face or dying"
VINLAND SAGA,"Yeah I liked most of them that I saw
A fan of Satoshi Kon"
VINLAND SAGA,"Also manga rarely change ""studio"" or creator, like it happens too often in anime resulting in uneven series (One punch man for instance)."
VINLAND SAGA,"Eh overexposition is a problem in anime and manga, even in Death note that was really good was too much and at the half of the manga I gave up"
VINLAND SAGA,"> Heavens Official Blessing

Put in the watchlist"
VINLAND SAGA,"""You have another thing coming, underestimating me! I haven't even turned serious yet! Behold - the ultimate attack carried down through generations in my my family line - the five-finger lotus flower punch!"" - with a hyperspace background and while doing the punch already.

... Huh, maybe I should be an anime writer."
VINLAND SAGA,"Yeah that’s what I meant, this anime doesn’t have dialogue like that."
VINLAND SAGA,"Oh yeah, OPM season 1 did everything right (from what I remember) and then it got to the... uh really weird lack of quality. From what I remember, the studio that it got changed into, also had to rush it, but... why? The anime was so popular to begin with, how in the fuck did it change into rushjob from another company? That just makes no sense."
VINLAND SAGA,"Yeah but the difference between Vinland and One Punch Man man is that Vinland season 2 has the same team as season 1 unlike One Punch Man which had a completely different team compared to season 1.

The reasoning was because season 1's studio didn't allow the team to produce a second season so they had to move the team to another studio instead."
VINLAND SAGA,"I guess I've been lucky.  I've never really gotten into anime but the few I've watched don't seem to have this problem.  But you're right; when I explained the issue with AoT to a friend, he seemed to think it was normal.

I think the other guy is right; the shounen genre might have this issue but maybe not so much the anime for adult audiences."
VINLAND SAGA,"Haha, try reading/watching HunterXHunter! You'll need it to figure out how bungee gum has the properties of both rubber and gum!"
VINLAND SAGA,"Ok thanks, I thought I was unclear when I saw your question mark"
VINLAND SAGA,"I don't know, they whanged director, studio, everything. I stopped after few episodes and started reading the manga that went on a strange hiatus just when I started lol"
VINLAND SAGA,"The anime that tend to have dialogue with characters describing their attacks are in the Shounen genre (My Hero Academia, Dragonball, Naruto etc), so if you dislike them you should look at non-Shounen anime. 

Some really great amine: Steins;Gate, Code Geass, Death Parade, Assassination Classroom, Erased."
VINLAND SAGA,He’s lying. I stopped watching because I felt this show to be the worst offender for unnecessary dialogue and an extremely boring drawn out plot. Its like the whole show could have been a few episodes but they just dick around soooo much. The main character is always whining about his situation blah blah.
VINLAND SAGA,"> Steins;Gate

Eh, I watched until the 12th or 13th episode and for me it was really boring... I've read it that it starts late but even after the first 10 episodes I was not a big fan.

I liked mob psycho 100 and others when they are strange like kill la kill or flcl or azumanga daiho or even shounen like one punch man or that recent one with demons I don't even remember the name, but maybe I'm not for anime series (I like the movies often though)"
VINLAND SAGA,The main character barely talks.
VINLAND SAGA,I played the game which was slow in the beginning and then picked up. Then watched the anime and enjoyed it
VINLAND SAGA,Dafuq you talking about. The MC barely ever talks in the show.
VINLAND SAGA,"> I watched until the 12th or 13th episode and for me it was really boring

In that case, you probably stopped literally *right* before things kick into gear and the pace and stakes both pick way up..."
VINLAND SAGA,"The entire cast and crew return for S2, with MAPPA (Jujutsu Kaisen) taking over as the animation studio.

VINLAND SAGA,"WARNING: this thread is FULL of spoilers even though it’s a trailer for a season 6 months away, so don’t read comments unless you’ve already read ahead in the source material. Why people think it’s okay to post about future plot points I don’t know."
VINLAND SAGA,"FYI: If you're expecting a shitload of action, prepare to be disappointed. There's still gore and violence, but this arc is much more careful about using it. Farmland Saga is great though."
VINLAND SAGA,Yeah! Time for the long ass Farm Arc.
VINLAND SAGA,\[Farming Intensifies\]

My Girl,The trust fund bit was by far my favorite.
My Girl,"The whole bit with James where everyone just assumes he's gay, no matter how many times he insists otherwise."
My Girl,I love the show. So many hilarious moments. Sister Michael is fucking brilliant.
My Girl,"Watch Orla. Orla in the background, reacting, is brilliant."
My Girl,"I think one of my favorite moments is in season one when Colm is over for dinner. 

He’s going on about something and they think he’s done talking, he starts up again, and Ma Mary just goes “Jesus wept” under her breath. 

Their dry, Irish humor is just so fantastic! I know the show is focused on the kids, but the comedy from all the adults involved just cracks me UP."
My Girl,"I need to catch up on Seasons 2 and 3. Season 1 has some great lines. I like the end of episode 1 when they all get called into Sister Michael's office:

Michelle: ""Nobody actually gets expelled. Rhonda Gallagher hasn't even been expelled and she's in the IRA.""

Erin: ""I'd say that's probably why.""

Then Clare dobs them all in:

Clare: So it had nothing to do with me! Yes, okay, I was there. I admit that, but I didn't do anything. It was Michelle. It was all Michelle. I'm not going down for something I didn't do. If anyone deserves to get punished, it should be Michelle.

Sister Michael: Well I think it's safe to say, we all just lost a bit of respect for you there, Clare."
My Girl,Remember that police scene with Liam Neeson. Oh for suffering Jesus
My Girl,"James gets hate online?! He’s so nice to everyone though, I don’t see a reason to hate him. I think I teared up when he was about to leave but ended up staying"
My Girl,As someone who is Irish and grew up in the 80s/90s (80s baby) it definitely was nostalgic and brought out some big feelings and big laughs. I can related too well to some bits and cringed. Lol. But I think they also captured the troubles well and how it affected their lives.
My Girl,"The Uncle Colm with Liam Neeson scene was the best. I had never laughed this hard before. 

And the show in itself is incredibly well written. 10/10 will recommend"
My Girl,"There’s a holiday special Bake Off episode with them, it’s a must watch."
My Girl,What business have you with Seamus!?
My Girl,"""everyone keeps using the word wee for things that aren't even very small!"" 

-James"
My Girl,Orla is hilarious. Her dance act where she just stepped up onto a single step was beautiful
My Girl,"My favorite ep is when Mary ""killed"" her Aunt 😂 Almost died laughing lol

*""How's the wicked witch of the northwest?""*

Other fave quotes:

""Killing nuns now, is it?"" 

""WINKING? At your age?! Christ, I feel SICK!""

*When Erin thought Claire was into her when she came out as a lesbian* ""I'm not interested in you like that, look at the state of you"""
My Girl,"Uncle Colm is my favourite, just phenomenal dead pan. 

It reminds me so much of A Moody Christmas an Australian mini series with a similar Uncle Terry character who cannot stop giving people street directions or enquiring about which route they took to get there. Another show that captures a particular cultural ‘normal’ view of life."
My Girl,I think I like Gerry (the dad) and Joe (the grandad) the best. I think they have some of the best lines or encounters. With each other and with other characters.
My Girl,"The bit with James in the chippy is hilarious. The way he says ITS MUCH, MUCH TOO GREASY! and the faces on the other girls crack me up. I think Orla even covers her ears.

And of course Dennis' GET OUT! 

Sister Micheal is a blessing. The way she hates Father Peter. Dose!"
My Girl,"“Am I dead? Is this my wake?” 
Love that show"
My Girl,"i’ve re watched the first two seasons probably at least 20 times in the past year and a half. it’s easy to just have on repeat and play in the background. it’s short and sweet, but i’m still catching things i missed. truly an amazing show!!!"
My Girl,"Yes, the show has so much to offer. Satisfying character development, laughs abound and of course some sweet tender looks at the humanity of the family during “The Troubles”. Very unique."
My Girl,"It’s one of the best pilots of any show. 

James not being able to use the teachers bathroom. The old nun that steals from the girls and then Michelle’s mom saying “sorry I’m late they shut down the bridge. I told them to let me risk it but didn’t”"
My Girl,"Having grown up in that part of the world at that time  (I'm a couple of years older than the characters portrayed in the show) there are many wee details that are absolutely spot on.

For example, in one episode there is a mention of a kebab shop in Coleraine - Abrakebabra. Well that was a real place that a mate of mine ran...."
My Girl,Love Sister Michael!!
My Girl,"I was recently thinking uncle Colm's monologue about Tommy Duddy eating paper is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time, I was genuinely howling at that"
My Girl,"This is a fact.

It’s 3 perfect seasons - with a 12/10 finale bit

It’s wholesome and sad and funny and perfect"
My Girl,I’ve been to Ireland twice to see family and explore and during my last trip while in Derry we caught them filming the episode the president visited lol. It was an awesome experience and now whenever I show people the episode I tell them “I was right there off screen!” Lol
My Girl,"I ugly-cried at the series finale- I was totally incapacitated. The perfect blend of hope, trepidation, and just extreme sadness to realize the toll that the troubles have taken on their adolescence - a transformative bit of TV."
My Girl,Probably the best comedic written show since Arrested Development. It bums me out that I only know like 2 other people that have watched it
My Girl,truly one of the funniest and best shows in recent memory.  husband and i had to watch with subtitles on since we're american.  it managed to take a difficult and dark situation and make it absolutely hilarious -- charming and beautiful and bittersweet.  all the characters and the actors who played them were phenomenal.  i wish more of my friends would watch this so i could talk about it with them.
My Girl,I agree I love Derry girls one of the funniest shows. I binged the first two season when I was sick with Covid and it cheered me up like no other show could. Also I think Sister michael is one best characters on any sitcom ever.
My Girl,Now that it's over I need Derry Girls to become like The Sopranos where every discussion thread just devolves in to exchanging quotes because they make me so happy.
My Girl,"It took me like 2 years, but when I finally gave it a chance, it had some really solid moments, and reminds me a lot of Father Ted in the comedic delivery and hijinx"
My Girl,i want more Sister Michael.
My Girl,"I’m American, but was in High School (catholic all girls high school, even) during the early 90’s, so this show is absolutely gold to me. 

The writing is brilliant, the actors are phenomenal, and it’s just so, so fucking funny. I’ve watched the whole thing through countless times, and I always find something new to laugh at."
My Girl,"Just started this last, loved the first episode"
My Girl,Uncle Colm telling the story of having his car stolen…. Brilliant!
My Girl,Sister George Michael stole the show.
My Girl,Show is absolutely cracker
My Girl,100% agree. It's just a perfect encapsulation of time.
My Girl,Orla’s belief that lesbians were mythical creatures was one of the funniest through lines in any comedy episode I’ve watched.
My Girl,"The last season was so, so good! I'm so sad to see it go, but I think they ended it flawlessly."
My Girl,"One of the best series of the year, they are amazing, very smart way to connect the history to young audience, insanely funny and great cast."
My Girl,I love their accent
My Girl,"I agree with this whole heartedly. I saw a review for Derry Girls one that said it can make you nostalgic for a time and place you never lived, and that is so true. I've told myself ""it's illegal to be sad while watching Derry Girls,"" so it's something I've often put on when I'm feeling down as a pick me up. Reading these comments has me on the verge of tears with the desire to watch the show over for the first time, but instead, I'll have to survive with a rewatch. Uncle Colm stole the show at the police department and have used the phrase ""the wee lesbian"" soooo many times."
My Girl,Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
My Girl,Derry Girls and Father Ted are Ireland’s contributions to the pantheon of great TV.
My Girl,"It really is amazing.  A sitcom about ordinary people in extraordinary times, funny in an intensely feminine way, just very very special.  I did feel like the last season lost a little bit of the perfection of the first two, as the stories got a little zanier (>!accidentally helping rob a school, getting sent across the border to clean up a house that felt haunted, planning an elaborately fancy 18th birthday party, going on TV to get backstage passes and then a parent dying, and honestly even the letter getting to Chelsea Clinton, which was a scene that's not likely to age as well as the rest of the show!<) and it felt less like ordinary life.  Regardless, BRILLIANT show and the >!voting!< storyline in the finale coupled with music choices that echoed the first episode's were absolutely brilliant, beautiful, ending on a real high."
My Girl,"I'm Australian and get tired very quickly of most US and UK comedy shows. Will always jump onto anything from a different English-speaking country that's offering something different. The Young Offenders (another Irish comedy) scratched that itch a few years ago and I still miss it. Derry Girls was a lockdown discovery that really got to me. Grew up during the 90's, so the soundtrack was 'chefs kiss'. 

It's a very different vibe, but I strongly recommend you check out Rosehaven. If you enjoy watching the hijinx of good friends living in a land that is foreign to you, Rosehaven is a delight. NZ is kicking Australia's ass when it comes to comedy lately, but Rosehaven is a timeless classic that will warm your heart. Two best friends writing, directing and acting as two best friends in a rural Australian town. Kinda like a far less crazy Schitt's Creek."
My Girl,Love it
My Girl,I can't believe I just got into this show and now it's over.
My Girl,"ETA to correct title of a recommendation 

It’s well written and has a great ensemble cast. They work really well together.  Michelle, Uncle Colm and Sister Michael are my favorites for different reasons 

If you enjoyed it, the same writer wrote London Irish which is pretty funny as well. A few of the same cast show up."
My Girl,"I really enjoyed it. But I'd be happy if they never revisit it. It really felt like they had a story that would take three seasons to tell and they told it, which imo is a lot better than just trying to keep making more episodes until it gets shit or people stop watching.   


Having said that I wouldn't complain if they did do more. That episode on the train where they couldn't figure out who the woman is was fucking gold."
My Girl,What are ya? Some sort of reverse paedophile?
My Girl,I’m a Derry Girl!!!!
My Girl,"I went to Catholic H.S. in the late 70's/early 80's in the USA and I feel like I went to school with these girls. 

No bombs, but the nuns and such are pretty accurate."
My Girl,"The relationship between Gerry and his FIL is my favourite thing. I love how it balances the lives of teenagers and the importance of the events happening around them, like the announcement of a ceasefire happening when they’re all off celebrating their prom."
My Girl,"It's really great, I wish we got more but I'll take it."
My Girl,That's all well and good but when does the killer clown show up?
My Girl,Such a great show. Just threw on the first ep on a whim and ended up binging the whole thing.
My Girl,"I agree, this show is fantastic. A film would be a great idea!"
My Girl,I loved it very much truly heartfelt and hilarious
My Girl,Brilliant show. One of those rare gems where every single actor steals every scene they’re in. That’s a rare trick and a treat to watch.
My Girl,"I've seen the first two seasons as they came out, and I do think it's one of the best written comedies to come out in a while. Going to watch the last season soon enough."
My Girl,I just started and it's a treat.
My Girl,You aren’t wrong there. I mean the show just has absolutely no misses. Every single episode is at least a 7/10.
My Girl,"Also, if you havent seen it, please check out Detectorists. Its another quirky show thats really heart-warming and 'cozy'. I think you'll like it!"
My Girl,i’m here for any and all poetic ruminations about this amazing show.
My Girl,"Yes to everything you said!

I am not sure I'd call it the best of all time, but it definitely gets  a place in my heart.

I also love to see a show about girls being human. They're not sexualized, they're not afraid to not be sexy and ever-cool. They're just normal humans. We need more shows like that in the US, because teens absolutely model what they see on TV.

I am not part of any Derry Girls discussion groups, so I didn't know James gets a lot of hate. I love him, he's obviously such a sweet guys, even with the mercilesscondemnation for being English. But the jokes about him are hilarious."
My Girl,Agreed 100%! When they performed as the Spice Girls I lost it 😂
My Girl,"I saw the cast on the Great British Baking Show and thought they had great chemistry, so I decided to watch Derry Girls. I’m almost done but I absolutely love it! The characters are so well written and hilarious. Michelle is definitely my favorite."
My Girl,The actresses show up for a Great British Bakeoff Christmas special that's pretty fun too.
My Girl,I am orla
My Girl,"My favorite episode is the one in S3 with Orla dancing her whole way home. It just cracks me up how in her own world she is, and she creates the little dance numbers."
My Girl,"Loved the relationship between Da Gerry and Joe. At first you think Gerry's just a doormat. Then you notice he puts up with the abuse because he loves his wife and daughters that much. Then you realzie he can see right through Joe, and has the respect to allow an old, emotionally-constricted man his dignity."
My Girl,[removed]
My Girl,100%.  it's fantastic.
My Girl,"Watched it through for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I fully agree. It has so much heart and so much character. Would have loved more episodes, but that would have prob ruined the magic."
My Girl,"I didn't grow up in the 80s/90s Northern Ireland but was born in the 90s and pretty sure I knew a girl who looked nearly identical to Michelle in secondary school. My parents told me stories about growing up during the troubles, Derry girls got it pretty much spot on you just get on with it. The example I love, that my dad told me, is a song written by the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers, ""Bloody Sunday"" (released 3 years before U2 song by a similar name) which you think would be about the tragic event but no... It's about how there's nothing to do in Northern Ireland on Sunday! (No shops etc open on Sunday until I think the early 2000s)"
My Girl,"Sister Michael is absolutely fantastic, I love her dry responses to everything! 
It really does the nostalgia well. I grew up in the ROI during the 90s and 00s and remember the troubles and the atmosphere even down south was similar to the one up north.

Anyone planning a trip to Derry should go to the free Derry museum to learn about the troubles from a civilian point of view."
My Girl,"I've said this multiple times and I'm going to say it again because I just do truly mean it - Derry Girls is at the same level as The Office, one of the best shows of all time. Infinitely rewatchable and endlessly funny."
My Girl,"Wife and I loved it. Not sure who my favorite character is, though. Maybe Uncle Collum?"
Come Back Mister,S1 was very cute and i can't wait for more.
Come Back Mister,I absolutely adored this show in season 1 and can't wait for season 2. I didn't know how they would address the passing of Mike Hagerty and I think the decision to not address it is a good one. He was such a big and warm presence in season 1 that acknowledging his real life death would put a huge cloud over this entire new season. I'm sure this show will make it all work and continue to be one of the best on TV.
Come Back Mister,Yes! I loved Season 1!
Come Back Mister,I saw this randomly and binged it in one sitting. So heartwarming! Can't wait for the second season.
Come Back Mister,"I was just wondering this show last night as a browsed for some TV comedies.

That’s good news!"
Come Back Mister,   Yes! I think the first time I saw Bridget Everett was in Patty Cake$ and she was fantastic in that. Recently I just saw her  cabaret stand-up. So funny! She's a gem and this show rocks!
Come Back Mister,Terrific show!  I hope its audience continues to grow.
Come Back Mister,Is this an Everything Everything spin-off?
Come Back Mister,Loved this show!
Come Back Mister,"The thing is that SNL has always been super hit and miss over the years, people just like to fondly remember the years that *they* loved it. I was watching full episodes of mid 2000’s SNL a while back and there are some great sketches and some total shit stinkers just like there are today."
Come Back Mister,"Did it kill SNL?  No.  

Was it funny?  Also no."
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider is a stapler.
Come Back Mister,"And if somebody knows about how to stay relevant and bankable, it’s Rob Schneider."
Come Back Mister,"What has saved SNL is Youtube, IMO. I wouldn't watch a full hour run of SNL if you paid me, but I have downloaded a few clips a year that get some buzz. I doubt NBC makes much money off me doing that though.

But in the age of the internet, no way I'm watching 1 hour of SNL, which typically consists of 1 really good sketch, a couple more good ones, and the rest are average to poor. Broken up by tons of commercials and a music act that there is a 90% chance I don't care about."
Come Back Mister,I saw a clip of him on the bill maher podcast talking about how patton oswalt hates him lol
Come Back Mister,I trust comedy advice from Friend #5 in every Adam Sandler movie as much as I trust medical advice from Dr. Oz.
Come Back Mister,"It was overdramatic, but it by no means killed SNL. They get plenty of Youtube views, and all the cast members show up in movies and commercial deals. The show is doing fine.

Should the show end with Season 50 and Lorne retiring? Maybe. Or give the show to Kenan."
Come Back Mister,"Because ""Copy Guy"" was peak SNL."
Come Back Mister,"If Rob Schneider didn’t kill it, this certainly won’t."
Come Back Mister,"I personally thought that cold opener was a bit overdramatic but the show has been fine.  The idea that segment ""killed"" SNL is just as overdramatic."
Come Back Mister,Says the guy whose entire career has been riding the coattails of a successful SNL breakout star
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider derp-de-derp!
Come Back Mister,"Hey maybe no one should act like that show is some sacred cow.  It’s been watchable for like ten of the 50 seasons it’s been on.  

Rob Schneider makes his whole living piggybacking off of people way more talented than he is"
Come Back Mister,"He was recently on Bill Maher’s Podcast ‘Club Random’. I had heard Schneider was very Republican, and knowing Maher is political I thought I’d tune in to see. I have to say Schneider has the worst takes on politics I’ve ever heard. The dude is a great example of someone who believes they know everything because they read something on the internet, but when pushed to supply more information or presented with facts their beliefs backtrack and fall apart instantly. He has no idea what he is talking about, and an absolute idiot. Any ‘takes’ he gives should never be published because because anyone who reads them becomes dumber."
Come Back Mister,"Weird, it looks like to me that they have had several seasons since then"
Come Back Mister,As cringe as some of the stuff SNL does it is really hard to kill the show. It's quality is cyclical and it is an ever changing show that is an cultural touchpoint. SNL isn't dead because they did some cringe political stuff. Schneider is a right wing nutbag who was a one note joke at his peak.
Come Back Mister,"If anyone knows comedy, it's Rob Schneider"
Come Back Mister,"Breaking News: cast member from over 20 years ago,who's own career ended over 10 years ago claims show that's over 45 years old is dead due to political message that's different than his. More at 11."
Come Back Mister,He's wrong SNL sucked way before that
Come Back Mister,Pretty sure it died during the eighth “Making-Copies Guy” skit.
Come Back Mister,Who is Rob Schneider and why does he look like his cat just passed away?
Come Back Mister,Why is a Stapler talking?
Come Back Mister,I guess he would know about when things fade from popularity. What was his last major role again?
Come Back Mister,I read some blind item about how one of the former castmates had become a big time Trump supporter and was annoying all of the other SNL community with his Trump obsession. Maybe it was Rob Schneider.
Come Back Mister,"Da derpa de derpa, da teedly derpy derpy dumb."
Come Back Mister,"You know what's not coming back?

Schneider 's career."
Come Back Mister,I wish I could tell Adam Sandler this about Rob Schneider's career. He keeps trying to bring it back and it's not coming back.
Come Back Mister,I mean if anyone can identify the death of a career in showbiz it’s Rob Schneider
Come Back Mister,"It was very weird and kind of made me cringe


But sit the fuck down ROB SCHNEIDER lmao"
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider is a carrot! Rated PG-13
Come Back Mister,Yeeahh like I'm going to click on an article where Rob Schneider explains to me what is funny and what isn't. Concrete Hard pass.
Come Back Mister,Failed actor and needer of Adam Sandler handouts has opinions to please right wing host.
Come Back Mister,"When was the last time Schneider was funny?

He seems to only be doing low grade B movies and whatever Sandler can shove him in."
Come Back Mister,"I mean, there is a point in that ""where's the punchline?""

I think a lot of people pretend to be funny by just stating their political case, or giving a political presentation to an audience clamoring for self-affirmation of their beliefs. And just because people applause, doesn't mean it's real comedy. Perhaps Tragedy."
Come Back Mister,“Making copies” dude you weren’t that good
Come Back Mister,That may be. Only time will tell. But we also know that Rob Schneider is definitely not coming back.
Come Back Mister,I like how they’re pushing the idea that we should care what Rob Schneider has to say about things….🤣 you mean I need to care about Deuce Bigelow’s opinion on matters??? Cmon
Come Back Mister,Neither is Rob Schneider. No matter how many of his hot “hot takes” he vomits onto a stage where no one is waiting.
Come Back Mister,If the media thinks Anybody gives a leftward fuck about what Rob Schneider thinks then we can just disband the whole thing and shut it down
Come Back Mister,Old guy predicts SNL's demise because he got old. Never heard that one before.
Come Back Mister,"The man knows comedy. Duce Bigalow, that time he turned into a carrot, that time he said “you can do it”, or “making copies”. If only Kate McKinnon had said “you can put your weed in it” at the end of the sketch. SNL will never recover from one sketch without a joke."
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider? I think I remember him from a long time ago...
Come Back Mister,From the “you can do it” guy.
Come Back Mister,The guy who just said “Makin copies” is blaming someone else for killing SNL?
Come Back Mister,Yeah because poop humor and “you can do it!” Cameos are the pinnacle of comedy lol
Come Back Mister,"Rob is just die hard trumper, politics are only an issue for him when it's the opposition."
Come Back Mister,Since when do we care about Robs opinion? lol Adam Sandlers puppet
Come Back Mister,What a tool.
Come Back Mister,Was Rob Schneider ever funny?
Come Back Mister,Pretty sure this is code for Lorne won’t let me visit anymore.
Come Back Mister,I can’t remember the last time Rob Schneider was funny. So.
Come Back Mister,People have always said this SNL season is the worst.
Come Back Mister,And why do we keep seeing this 'story' and why do we care what Rob Schneider has to say...?
Come Back Mister,It’s all about talent.  They’ve lacked superstar talent for years now.  Rob Schneider has jumped off the deep end - but he’s right about that sketch.
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider's standup specials killed comedy and laughter and it's not going to come back.
Come Back Mister,"He has a point about late night talk shows, barring Conan, being at their absolute laziest and hackiest by milking Trump jokes nonstop for like 5 years to the point where one of Kimmel's head writers actually quit because she wasn't given much wiggle room for writing.

I would also agree that SNL suffered a similar scenario. There was no point to tuning in for the cold open because it was always Baldwin's awful Trump impersonation that got old like a day after he started doing it. 

However Rob isn't exactly in a position to be throwing stones. I'm pretty sure he's said this before when weighing on Darrell Hammond not being hired back as Trump. He's lucky that Adam Sandler still wants him as part of his entourage so he can get some of that Netflix money."
Come Back Mister,"The only good thing to come out of Rob Schneider in the last 30 years is his daughter.

I unironically love Elle King's music.

Outside of that, he should probably just stick to tagging along with Adam Sandler."
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider knows a thing or 2 about dead careers
Come Back Mister,Who the hell cares what Deuce Bigalow said on a Glenn Beck podcast??
Come Back Mister,"Because when I need deep insight on the entertainment industry and politics, Rob Schneider is always the first guy I think of"
Come Back Mister,Is he the guy who hires immigrants in home depot to choke him in the shower?
Come Back Mister,He’s not wrong about how cringy that was but saying it killed snl is a big stretch. Plus if public cringe is a crime Rob Schneider should have been locked up years ago
Come Back Mister,"Good lord, the guy that made a career off of being Adam sandler's less funny friend is trying to be the arbiter of what belongs on SNL? This is peak cringe, should have just kept his mouth shut"
Come Back Mister,"He was once on a talk show with Adam Sandler and got pissy that the host wasn’t talking to him enough. He made a comment on stage that he might as well have been in the audience.

That dude is a piss bag"
Come Back Mister,"Rob Schneider critiquing comedy is like my fat ass criticizing Christ Hemsworth for not being ripped enough in his movies. His shows have always been terribly unfunny, almost like he finds something funny and does the opposite.  He claim to fame are his stupid taglines from Adam Sandler movies."
Come Back Mister,The least funny cast member of SNL says what??
Come Back Mister,"“SNL is dead and it won’t come back,” says the guy with the career that’s dead and won’t come back."
Come Back Mister,Says the least funny man in comedy.
Come Back Mister,"Rob Schneider is a dipshit. I agree it was a bad, weird choice. I think it soured the episode. But just *that* episode. SNL will always have different writers and performers as long as it continues, some seasons will be weaker and some will be stronger, and even then that's subjective opinion. Even within episodes there are sketches I think are great right next to ones I think are lame.

Also telling that he choose this moment as the low point,  and not having Trump on as a guest, which was almost as bad as the Jimmy Fallon hair-tussel. 

SNL constantly changes, to say it's 'not coming back' is dumb as hell. Does he think we're all anxiously waiting the comeback of ""MAKING COFFEEEE"". yeah, no."
Come Back Mister,"Yea, let’s all listen to the opinion of the man who’s entire career has been sucking Sandlers dick."
Come Back Mister,"Rob Schneider is a talentless hack who had the great fortune to be cast on the show when there were SO many other talented performers to carry him.  Once he was on his own, his films universally sucked.  He has no idea what makes SNL good, or bad.  He has no idea what ""funny"" is and he says a LOT of stupid shit.  There's zero reason to care what he thinks about anything really, but certainly about comedy."
Come Back Mister,Why does anyone care what Schneider has to say?
Come Back Mister,Rob Schneider being Rob Schneider in movies killed Rob Schneider's movie career. It's not going to come back.
Come Back Mister,"He's wrong because SNL has always done hokey shit like this from time to time. It's also been an explicitly left leaning institution since it's inception (spoiler alert: much like truth, comedy and the arts will always skew left)

This is more 'I held a delusion about what SNL was to begin with and had that fantasy killed' than 'SNL is dead and never coming back.'"
Come Back Mister,"So, a guy who was [a loud and proud Republican](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2022/08/31/630ed76d22601d6b7c8b45ae.html) didn’t like when a show he was no longer a part of did a skit he didn’t like? And because he couldn’t see the humor in it half-a-decade ago when it happened that must mean the show is dead?

What a twatwaffle."
Come Back Mister,"I mean Leonard Cohen had JUST died. 

So I get it. 

Was it funny? Shit no bro but how many skits are?"
Come Back Mister,"Wait, we're listening to Rob Schneider now?"
Come Back Mister,Shut up Rob
Come Back Mister,"Rob Schneider has evolved into an insane nutbag, so..."
Come Back Mister,[deleted]
Come Back Mister,"Please. If Rob Schneider couldn’t kill SNL, one Kate McKinnon sketch also couldn’t. What a fucking child."
Come Back Mister,If Rob Schneider in his prime was in SNL's current cast he would still be one of the least funny members.
Come Back Mister,"Is SNL funny? No.

Is Rob Schneider funny? No."
Come Back Mister,And here I am thinking SNL hasn’t been at all funny since the Will Ferrell/Darrell Hammond days.
Come Back Mister,I love every SNL skit without Rob Schneider better than I like anything Rob Schneider has ever done in his life
Come Back Mister,"More importantly, why would I care about Rob Schneider's opinion?"
Come Back Mister,Schneider is an anti vaxxer dick.
Come Back Mister,Rob who?
Come Back Mister,Who cares what Rob Schneider thinks?
Come Back Mister,"Rob Schneider is the last person who should be giving out comedy advice. 

I swear he’s just Adam Sandler’s go to guy who’ll debase himself enough to do racial caricatures of other cultures. 

For example:

- Mexican in the ridiculous 6

- Palestinian in Zohan 

- Arab in Click

- Native American in Bedtime Stories

- Chinese in Chuck and Larry"
Running Man,This is the first I’ve heard of this show.
Running Man,This hasn't gotten to the states yet.
Running Man,"Curfew is like blood drive, but actually good. I'm at episode 6 and it's a damn fun watch. Don't get the low ratings either."
Running Man,I've seen 5 episode and tour description is pretty spot on. 
Running Man,"i think it great , the first episode wasn't the best  for sure but it defo improves , it's cheesy yes but its meant to be , kind of grindhousey/ running man meets deathrace 2000, with a bit of sean of the dead. love it."
Running Man,"It came to the states! I binged the whole season TODAY. So good. Hoping season 2 will get greenlit!!

US folks this is on spectrum on demand, I'm not sure about other providers as it's been touted as a Spectrum original Sky production."
Running Man,"Well, I don't think that being similar to blood drive is a good thing"
Running Man,Blood drive was great. It was silly and OTT and good fun to watch
Running Man,"Id watch a scripted show based on *the book*.

That could be amazing, but the movie was an abomination."
Running Man,"Not a fictional one, no. If reality shows sunk to the depths of flashy sport hunting for criminals,  then yes."
Running Man,Nah.
Running Man,"i'd watch 8-10 episode seasons of selected Phillip K. Dick's works (or Stephen King) - a different work each season, or 2 or 3 books within a 12 episode season"
Running Man,"Don't stray from the books  
  
movies aren't original content"
Running Man,"It already existed, it was called Spartacus."
Running Man,naw..
Running Man,"Is there anything else that can be told from a movie like that? 

I would watch /u/Jeffool version [of the show](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/4808az/the_mist_tv_series_spike_is_bringing_stephen/d0hvt0j/)"
Running Man,No and either The Truman Show. 
Running Man,"It is already a tv show. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Running_Man_episodes"
Running Man,[deleted]
Running Man,are you thinking an artsy and gritty production like *True Detective* or *Fargo* or something campy and light such as *The Office* or *GLOW*
Running Man,"> but the movie was an abomination.

Agreed!"
Running Man,"ahaha, I'm genuinely honored you remembered a random TV pitch from a year ago! For the lazy, a copy/paste of the above linked comment:



>The gist is that each episode of the half-hour show is split into two parts and intercut.

>Part A of each episode is a series-spanning story about the relaunch of the Running Man show, decades after it was taken off the air (after the film). It starts innocuous enough, following the producer, host, and government liaison that oversees it. The first episode or two is about fighting protestors and the PR battles and personal relationships.

>Part B is the in-show show. The Running Man. Each episode has a guest director. Start big by courting Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. Get Michael Bay. Eli Roth. Shane Black. Anyone who's up for crazy violent fun. Not even necessarily bloody. This part of the show follows the Runner (start anywhere from their crime to their death) through their story. They're dropped into a different part of a ruined county with a large city, water area, wooded area, and told to get from point A to point B. They never do. (L.A., Chicago, Detroit, SLC, wherever.) The Run happens in a real, albeit shitty, city (think Robocop's Detroit) and the Runner meets real people.

>In Part A our producer begins to suspect something is odd, and in the course of the series, we find out the game is indeed fixed again. The government doesn't want winners. They're using the games to publicly kill political dissidents and operate a PR genocide to encourage parents to make genetic changes in infants to make them less prone to crime. (And easier to control.) Literally cut in commercials for genetic modification companies about how no person modded has ever been convicted of a serious crime or had to Run. The end of the first season the liaison learns the producer knows. He frames the producer and she has to Run.

>In part B, each director's short film tells a whole story. They are interwoven when aired on TV, but offered as-aired, and separate, on the website when El Rey or Showtime airs this.

>Season 2 is more about the producer trying to survive the run, and running into people we recognize somewhat (less stylistically portrayed) as part B characters in s01. intercut some scenes with the other s01 behind the scenes employees, including a new producer. After the first episode, they're all presented as ""last week were left off with..."" recorded material. Final episode, the producer dies... And we find out from part B characters the new producer is aiming to take the show down.

>Season 3 is more about the behind the scenes, maybe minus a special holiday all-Running Man episode. The producer is part of a terrorist network that frames a high ranking official, maybe the network CEO, with a massive crime... The framing of the previous producer. Now, that person didn't do it. But such a scandal? They HAVE to make them run, right? And they have the genetic modifications and everything! The liaison is in a lose-lose scenario. He has to make the CEO run. The CEO reveals he's figured out the truth too, and he'll tell everyone if they make him compete. Knowing he has to stop it, the liaison kills the CEO... And the producer reveals a recording of the conversation, showing a second major crime by an engineered person, and revealing the entire plot. People riot. Politicians are killed. The genetic engineering companies are killed. Other high ranking people suspected of screwing everyone over are killed. It's all uploaded to YouTube and celebrated by this fucked up culture that lives and loves violence. And you show the download numbers of s01 and s02 episodes after the credits. Combined, just Part A, and just Part B. And let's hope the part B's aren't insanely higher than the rest. End.

>Just, WHATEVER you do, don't ask how I'd turn Source Code into a TV show. Unless you know Robert Rodriguez or Duncan Jones.

When I say I'm honored that's no joke. The truth is I always wanted to work in TV. Ah well.   "
Running Man,A completely unrelated show with the same name.
Running Man,The guy was pretty funny but the hosts were already laughing like day drinkers before they even got started talking to him.
Running Man,He could replace Taika as the voice of Korg seamlessly
Running Man,Korg did what he had to
Running Man,"Yeah this guy is a classic 🤣 I know quite a few fellas from NZ and the islands and that, & no joke they are all so similar just laid back nothing really phases em. Some of the best story tellers!"
Running Man,"We've gone mainstream, initiate protocol omega"
Running Man,"Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
Running Man,Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
Running Man,Good for Community.
Running Man,"""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
Running Man,/u/wikirank please do this every month
Running Man,Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
Running Man,"Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens —> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks —> Professor says something —> More talks about feelings —> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are —> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second —> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show’s success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
Running Man,"With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
Running Man,Ozark is so damn good!
Running Man,Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
Running Man,You’d definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I’m surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
Running Man,"Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
Running Man,The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC’s Dr Foster
Running Man,I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
Running Man,So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
Running Man,"The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
Running Man,TIL there’s a Japanese version of *Suits*.
Running Man,"Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
Running Man,*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
Running Man,Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
Running Man,Damn
Running Man,"i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
Running Man,Prior?
Running Man,First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
Running Man,Good news for a potential movie too.
Running Man,Is the show any good after S3?
Running Man,[deleted]
Running Man,I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
Running Man,Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn’t realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
Running Man,"It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Québec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
Running Man,"I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
Running Man,"in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
Running Man,Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
Running Man,It’s a dumb translation but doesn’t take anything away from the show itself
Running Man,Maybe English copyright issues.
Running Man,"""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
Running Man,"If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
Running Man,Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
Running Man,they're in their own world over there
Running Man,"I absolutely agree with you but it's interesting to see that it somehow has a very international appeal. I find their formula boring too, but I wonder if it's something else that is making it universally appealing."
Running Man,I think it's just another case of reddit living in it's own reality
Running Man,Sunk cost fallacy
Running Man,The last season of prison break takes place in the middle east...I wonder if thats why?
Running Man,"Prison Break just came onto Australian Netflix, was number 7 in Australia all last week. I imagine it's the same for a few other countries."
Running Man,And it's a year old now!
Running Man,Survivor is a TV series though
Running Man,The first two seasons are good imo. Entertaining even if a lot of things don't make any sense at all. But I think is never boring.
Running Man,"No, it's legit pretty good, not gonna win emmys, but its not trash"
Running Man,Shit yourself.
Running Man,Sim
Running Man,Depends on what you know you're getting into. I found it slow but not glacial. It's one of the few shows where I just love people talking.
Running Man,#sixseasonsandamovie
Running Man,S4 is rough but I enjoy S5 and 6 quite a bit. And the finale is really great.
Running Man,"Mindlessly browsing Netflix is a whole lot easier than Pirating. No ads, no risk of virus, just one click and you’re watching the show."
Running Man,Forget pirating..it has been on Hulu for years!
Running Man,"Pirating is when you have no money and a lot of time. When you have enough money and not enough time, you just subscribe to Netflix."
Running Man,"I would think it's a rip-off probably, if I was just scrolling through"
Running Man,"How about ""The Paper House""?

Or maybe even ""La Casa de Papel"", which I believe was actually its Netflix title for like the first week it was available."
Running Man,"I don’t think so. It’s not bad, it’s alright. But this is just measuring popularity, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s *uhmayzing*."
Running Man,"First 2 seasons were good.3rd was average and the 4th was a dissaster.

You can watch the first 2 seasons and stop there since  the series was supposed to be only 2 seasons.Maybe thats the reason why the writing started to get bad."
Running Man,"You won't get a good answer in /r/television

It is good/great TV, there's a reason its so popular. Its engaging and doesn't require much thinking on your part. Not every show needs to be a Westworld/Better Call Saul."
Running Man,"Going against almost every comment here and say that I like this show a lot more than Reddit’s favorites such as Better Call Saul. Besides What We Do In The Shadows it’s probably the only thing I have genuinely enjoyed watching while in quarantine. Last season of West World was fairly disappointing. Granted I am biased, I have been to Spain a lot and am myself Spanish. Yeah it’s not The Wire (and neither is Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad) but it is very good."
Running Man,"Season 4 was straight trash.Writing,acting,music everything.They should have stopped at 2 seasons."
Running Man,Rude
Running Man,Kkkkkkkkk percebi que ela ficou muito popular do nada aqui mas não sabia que era por isso
Running Man,"Fun fact: he said this in reference to the one-season The Cape.  I liked that show, but perhaps maybe not as much."
Running Man,If you know what youre doing there are no ads and no risk of virus also but that said I still enjoy having netflix to find new stuff I wouldnt have sought out.
Running Man,[deleted]
Running Man,"I have a private site with none of those features and everything comes on there about half an hour after it airs.

I still barely pirate stuff.

Cable costs me a dollar, Netflix and Disney plus aren’t expensive."
Running Man,In the US. Netflix added Community globally.
Running Man,[deleted]
Running Man,"I feel the same. Saw first season, and it was quite predictable. Didn't get why it was so overhyped."
Heroes Reborn,"I wanted so badly to like this. I wanted so badly for it to be good like the first season. This show is like a relationship that you stay in way longer than you should, because you are chasing the glory and puppy love that only existed early on. "
Heroes Reborn,"At this point, the only interest I'd have in seeing more *Heroes* is if Tim Kring was either replaced as showrunner or had a *significantly* reduced involvement.  I think this season has finally put to rest the question of whether or not the first season's quality was a fluke.  This miniseries has been extremely convoluted and has some of the most one-dimensional characters I've seen in ages.  It really hasn't shown that Kring learned anything from viewer feedback over the years since he's making the same mistakes all over again. 

The sad thing is, there are still a lot of interesting things within the *Heroes* universe that could be explored.  It's just that rather than focus on something like technology derived from Sylar's power or how the world adjusts to Claire's announcement, we get a season watching the Wonder Twins evade a villain so cartoonish and shallow that she might as well get a cat she can stroke menacingly and grow a mustache she can twirl."
Heroes Reborn,R.I.P. Henry Zabrowski's paycheck
Heroes Reborn,"Season 1 of Heroes was obviously a fluke for Kring. 

Everything since then that has had his name attached to it was terrible."
Heroes Reborn,"Fucking hell. Don't tell me Tim Kring didn't have a 1 season plan and was hoping for a renewal. If that's the case, then stop calling it a miniseries/limited series or whatever the fuck term is trending these days.

/endof(pointless)rage"
Heroes Reborn,Heroes Reborn Aborted
Heroes Reborn,"I loved Heroes (before the writer's strike) and was excited about Reborn because it seemed like it was going to get back to that same feeling.  

I just couldn't get into it, I don't know if I also grew up, or if it just wasn't that interesting. "
Heroes Reborn,Seems like I'm the only one who's disappointed.
Heroes Reborn,Good riddance.
Heroes Reborn,"It's OK, I'm sure in five years everyone at NBC will suffer from amnesia again and come out with Heroes: Reloaded. "
Heroes Reborn,"I thought it started well enough but it just dragged on and on. Oh and the whole ""video game"" power was horrible. Any feelings I had for the the showing being good were squashed as soon as I saw that."
Heroes Reborn,Wasn't it supposed to be a miniseries?
Heroes Reborn,"I always tell people Heroes lasted one season.  It's easier that way and if they watch it, everyone's happy."
Heroes Reborn,Heroes Stillborn
Heroes Reborn,I just don't understand why they once again felt the need to have like a dozen different stories. If your cast is getting about 7 minutes of story per episode it's time to reel it in.
Heroes Reborn,It's over. It's finally over.
Heroes Reborn,Anyone with eyes could have seen this coming.
Heroes Reborn,i thought it was a miniseries anyway so what's the point in saying it's cancelled
Heroes Reborn,"It's always sad when a TV show gets cancelled, even if it's a disappointing one like Heroes reborn. Hundreds of people are now without a job, and some of them worked really hard on this project. I get that the general opinion is good riddance, I just wanted to put this out there. "
Heroes Reborn,That was fast.
Heroes Reborn,"I watched more episodes than I should have (mostly to help Henry Zebrowski out). But I didn't have the patience to watch the whole thing. I'm sad for Henry in a way but this should free his schedule up to work on projects that are actually, you know, good."
Heroes Reborn,"So, huh... can we get some more Stargate? Please?"
Heroes Reborn,I thought it was only supposed to be one season anyway. 
Heroes Reborn,Can people stop blaming the writers strike for how bad this show sucked then because its even worse now.
Heroes Reborn,Heroes: Recancelled
Heroes Reborn,"The show was suppose to be a mini series anyway.  But I love the world of Heroes.

Hopefully another station can pick it up and drop Tim."
Heroes Reborn,"Wow. There goes all my hopes and dreams. 


Sigh 

I really loved it."
Heroes Reborn,You could sense this coming after the premiere.  At least I did...it was terrible.
Heroes Reborn,I completely forgot this was even happening.
Heroes Reborn,[deleted]
Heroes Reborn,"I wanted to see this take place in an alternative universe when they didn't ""Save the cheerleader""

But it ended up being about a girl who can enter a videogame or something stupid along those lines..."
Heroes Reborn,"A few months ago I went back and watched Heroes season 1. Only season 1. 


It's best to just watch that and keep that memory of what it was alive. Heroes season 1 is still a better show than any of the superheroes shows of today. Miles ahead of Arrow and Flash. "
Heroes Reborn,"Thank God. I was going to fall for it, but after reading these comments and that article, I'm glad to keep Heroes where it belongs, safely tucked away in my memory as the glory that was the first season, with the hilariously obvious cross-promotion with Nissan (Save the cheerleader, watch her get a Nissan Rogue for no reason!)"
Heroes Reborn,"It's such an outdated show tbh, especially in with all the superhero shows we have today and the amazing special effects they cal pull off, Heroes tries to dance around the superpowers as much as possible. And when they start using them it looks horrible and the characters and the show try to make it like you are supposed to be in awe seeing it with them, but it isn't impressive anymore."
Heroes Reborn,Noooooo....... ohh am I the only one who's sad? 
Heroes Reborn,"Yeah it's kinda the same not great quality as the last seasons of the old show.  

I expected more, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
Heroes Reborn,Yeah I had to drop this pretty hard. I just didn't give a fuck at all about anything during reborn.
Heroes Reborn, wish someone would do the series justice. The show has too much untapped potential that is constantly getting pissed on. I had hoped so bad that we'd get to see something more in tune with the first season.
Heroes Reborn,"
I would be really amazed if Tim Kring receives anymore offers or further ideas from him get greenlit.  As was proven with the later seasons of the original Heroes, and now this mini-series, Tim is a terrible writer and storyteller.  His characters are either one-dimensional cardboard cutouts or too complex for their own good.  And his plots sound like they're made up on the spot instead of preplanned.  I trudged my way through Season Two's lethargic pace and jumped ship near the end of Season Three because I was tired of the constant twists and turns that made no freakin' sense to anyone that wasn't Tim Kring.

Season One of Heroes was a fluke because the majority of it had been molded by people more talented, and competent, than him.  What does it tell you when Bryan Fuller pens a later season episode that bumps the dismal ratings back up then, once he departs for good, they sink even lower and the quality rots further?

Tim Kring had three chances to prove himself:

The Original Heroes Series.  Strike One.

Touch.  (I never watched the series but wasn't surprised when discussing it with a friend who followed the story arcs, that it felt like he was making it all up in Season Two.)  Strike Two.

The Heroes Mini-Series.  Strike Three.

"
Heroes Reborn,"Going against the grain, but I found Reborn to be fairly watchable, except I've *hated* the stupid video game girl plot and the show would be three times better if that idea had been left on the cutting room floor. And yes, the show could have been handled better in almost every way, and the main plot's been a boring drag that's taking too long to get to the point, but it's had some decent elements. Not really sorry it's gone, though, we're gonna have far too many hero shows soon anyway if Disney has its way. It was... well, it was a time filler.

Amusingly, now that I'm thinking more about it I'm hating more and more elements. Luchador Batman and his entire supporting cast have done nothing to justify their sideplot yet, the only things he's done could have been given to someone else. That's TWO entire side arcs that could have been cut. And I'm trying not to just cut every arc that doesn't involve a returning Heroes castmember. Zachary Levi's character and plot have been fine! Noah's arc? Fine! I was actually satisfied with how things turned out with Claire and Mrs. Petrelli and Hiro. Other than hating the alignment change, Evil Parkman's been kind of a neat badguy. The Haitian was cool in his two or three appearances. This really should not have been thirteen episodes, though. Maybe eight."
Heroes Reborn,I think Sylar made the first show. How can you have a show called Heroes without a good villain? The main villain in Reborn is not interesting or compelling at all. She's just a huge bitch.
Heroes Reborn,Huge fan of the original series.  I barely made it through the first episode of Reborn. Just garbage!
Heroes Reborn,How is this news? Wasn't it only supposed to run for 13 episodes anyway?
Heroes Reborn,"Ended about as expected before it started.  I just couldn't get back into this after the first go around went off the rails.  I loved this show the first season of the original, then it got way off track fast."
Heroes Reborn,Heroes ReCancelled
Heroes Reborn,Heroes Stillborn
Heroes Reborn,"Every time a show I do not watch gets cancelled, I feel a twinge of pride. I did that. You are welcome."
Heroes Reborn,"Every time a show I don't watch gets cancelled, I feel a twinge of pride. I did that. You're welcome."
Heroes Reborn,Big surprise.
Heroes Reborn,So sad at what Heroes has become. 
Heroes Reborn,"They're already coming out with a sequal, Heroes Recancelled."
Heroes Reborn,This show would've been so much better without the stupid computer game character.
Heroes Reborn,"and the world yawns...


season 1 is television history, the stuff of legends. historians will remark upon it when they study our culture. 

the rest of the show is so bad it would be a war crime to use it as an enhanced interrogation technique. 

the writer's strike and w.e happened to george lucas with star wars probably happened to the guy who made this show, tim kring or w.e"
Heroes Reborn,"Thank God, they need to quit whilst they're slightly ahead. The possibilities of the heroes universe is infinite and they've created a simple childish show. Real shame. 

A bit like my ex girlfriend, useless and disappointing. "
Heroes Reborn,**Sense8** is the perfect example of how I imagined first season of **Heroes**. And the fact that in **Sense8** they don't have any special powers but being mentally connected is like adding an insult to a wound to **Heroes** writers. It is not perfect and it's quite naive but I loved every episode of that show and especially the finale of the first season which is exactly as I wished it to be. Imagine something like that with Heroes!
Heroes Reborn,"I feel bad for Heroes fans about how shitty the whole thing has turned out.

But I also feel good that I'm not a Heroes fan."
Heroes Reborn,Heroes Unborn
Heroes Reborn,"Not too surprising.  I've been watching it this season out of boredom, and the plot seems to not really be going anywhere.  It's super aggravating too, because Tim Kring had an amazing opportunity to learn from past mistakes, and make this into something awesome, and yet he completely squandered it. "
Heroes Reborn,The vast majority of my friends all loved season 1 and 2 of Heroes when they came out... I don't know of anyone who hasn't given up on Heroes Reborn.
Heroes Reborn,I couldn't pay attention to the most recent episode 
Heroes Reborn,Is Levi in this show enough to make it worth watching or no? He was really the only thing that made me interested in the first place
Heroes Reborn,Whaaaaaaaaaaaa.............Noooooooooooooooooooo!
Heroes Reborn,"NNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! How will i get my Heroes fix now, such a cool universe... :("
Heroes Reborn,"I was so hyped for the original series. Great concept, bad execution. Didn't bother with this one. "
Heroes Reborn,"So, predictably, the show that people didn't want to see anymore when it was originally on came back and no one wanted to see it. Color me shocked! "
Heroes Reborn,"Honestly, when I saw the poster for this show in the subway, I just had a feeling it wasn't going to last xD"
Heroes Reborn,I really tried to enjoy it but every character was bad and hollow. It was such a generic series. Maybe if a company like netflix worked on it. Sorry for the fans but it will hardly be missed.
Heroes Reborn,"I REALLY liked the first episode of Reborn.  The style it was shot, the story it told, it was great.

Then the 2nd episode was nothing like the first.  And the 3rd was even worse.  And....that was about that.  I don't know what happened.  I want the show they had in the first episode.  If they made that show, I think it would have done much better."
Heroes Reborn,"How is this a surprise, or news??"
Heroes Reborn,"Abysmal writing, boring characters, ridiculous storylines makes this definitive proof Season 1 was a one-off/fluke.  I'd like to say ""R.I.P. Heroes"" but this series has been so bad all I can say is ""good riddance now f*** off and never come back""."
Heroes Reborn,Sylar was the one of the only reasons I watched Heroes before.  This reboot was just horrible.  I didn't care about a single character.
Heroes Reborn,Lol season one is being advertised right now in the U.K.
Heroes Reborn,The moment the japanese chick entered the video game I noped the fuck out. Felt like an early 90's after school special meant to warn of the dangers of playing too much Nintendo.
Heroes Reborn,Reborn should've been a reboot.  The idea is great.  Just start over for fucks sake. 
Heroes Reborn,I got so hyped for this because I loved Heroes... hearing that Zachary Levi would be in it excited me even more. Just now I've finally gotten around to watching it and couldn't even finish episode four; I really wanted to get into it but it's way worse than Heroes ever was. Then I go on this subreddit and am pretty okay with it being cancelled. But at the same time not because this show had so much potential...
Heroes Reborn,This show was good at creating some good powers but they seemed to have no clue what to do with them.
Heroes Reborn,"Wasn't that bad imo. Wasn't s1 ofc, but I'm still watching and will finish the series. Quentin and Phoebe are fucking awful characters though, and I have no idea why they have such a prominent role."
Heroes Reborn,at least there's a video game coming
Heroes Reborn,Wasn't it ordered as a 1 time miniseries in the first place?
Heroes Reborn,The writer's strike really sealed the fate for the show. It hasnt been able to recover since. 
Heroes Reborn,If you want another normal person superhero show try out alphas. Its oretty awesome. Only the ending is such a cliffhanger
Heroes Reborn,"Good riddance.  Dammit, I tried so damn hard.   Saw all of the original, saw all of this one...I don't even know why,  I felt some kind of unexplained loyalty.  There was such a charm about people suddenly having powers and trying to figure out what to do with them/about them.  But it just became this dumb drivel. 

I'm really sad,  but at the same time relieved.   I hope this design space is given to shows with more coherent  ideas.

Personally, what I hated most about this is Matt Parkman's completely shit character.  I feel terribly sorry for Greg Grunberg, and am happy he is in Force Awakens.

AMARequest:  Greg Grunberg

What was it like working off such a shitty script?"
Heroes Reborn,It was a fairly unoriginal idea anyway. It's the X-Men 'mutant' concept but without having to pay any money to Marvel for it. Then just made poorly. The most interesting character in the whole series was Noah Bennett. They totally could have revolved it around him and it would have worked much much better.
Heroes Reborn,"I really tried to get into it, but all of the characters were completely uninteresting along with the plot being a direct rip-off of X-men down to having a fake Cerebro...

Reborn made the original Heroes look like a masterpiece in comparison."
Heroes Reborn,"Reborn was never going to be a ""series"", as it was never advertised as anything other than a 13 episode, mini-series event. One and done."
Heroes Reborn,"I was out the second I saw those video game world scenes.

Those were so laughably bad it was unbelievable."
Heroes Reborn,They went way way too big on this show. It should have started small like Heroes. Too much information too fast.
Heroes Reborn,Whaaa?!! NBC cancelled something? *noooooooooo*
Heroes Reborn,yay. less capes.
Heroes Reborn,Heroes Stillborn.
Heroes Reborn,"Nice!

I'm about halfway through [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), which feels like everything I wanted that shitty show to be."
Heroes Reborn,"> The one-season revival was always meant to be a finite story

So why is it on my frontpage?"
Heroes Reborn,[deleted]
Heroes Reborn,I didn't even know it had started yet. 
Heroes Reborn,***Heroes Aborted***
Heroes Reborn,"I feel sorry for the show but indeed the script and the new characters were terrible. 

No good guys, no badass characters (maybe Noah), no great villains.

 Actually I was thinking how they did such a bad job with a second chance."
Heroes Reborn,Slightly disappointed that it's being cancelled but as long as they close the book on the story i'll be fine with it.  
Heroes Reborn,"This show was beyond awful.   There were sooo many things wrong with it that I don't even know where to begin.

Just a giant clusterfuck of a TV Show.  It didn't even have the potential of the original series to build upon.

It's like the writers were handing in first drafts, and the producers were like, ""Yeah, good enough.  Let's rush this into production.""

What is obvious is the fact that NOT EVEN THE PRODUCERS CARED ABOUT THIS SHOW.  That was blatantly obvious.  They were totally willing to rush unfinished shit-fart first drafts into production.

If the producers don't care about the show, why the fuck should I care about it?  Why the fuck should I waste my time watching it??  

NOTE TO NBC:  Please don't waste your audiences time with stupid bullshit like this ever again.  They will hate you for it, and eventually give up on your entire station if you continue to pull this bullshit.

I can guarantee that Heroes Reborn was the result of a cliquey echo-chamber style production staff.  

If NBC's goal was to lose money with this show, they did an awesome fucking job.  Bravo."
Heroes Reborn,"To me, this love for season 1 of Heroes is incredibly revisionist. The show was pretty terrible from Day 1 by current standards. The thing is, rose-tinted glasses may be understandable if only because the quality of serialized, story-heavy TV shows has increased in orders of magnitude since Heroes was a thing. Still, it had its hardcore fans right up to the end. I always said it was the most poorly written popular genre show ever... until The Walking Dead."
Heroes Reborn,"That makes sense. 

Reborn was such a slog until the actual plot kicked in. It took what? Eight hours to do some more time travel shit and realize that the teleporter and the girl with the weird life/weather/plot powers were the key and then they go into the future and Chuck is moping around for some reason.

They go on break and come back for what? 3 episodes? How are they going to finish this plot? How are they going to start tying together the forty five characters they introduced like Mexican Batman who is hanging out with who? Inviso Mulsim and Fat Parkman? 

And WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE HEROES!? Just because someone has super powers doesn't make them a hero. No one has fucking saved anyone. So far it's just been people crying and whining. "
Equinox,It kept my interest but I did not care for the ending.
Equinox,It’s great up until the last 5ish minutes. A lot of it goes completely unexplained.
Equinox,3 episodes in and I love it. Watching it with family too. There is a sex scene in episode 2 if that is a concern.
Equinox,"Good premise. Good atmosphere. Good tone. Good acting. Creepy and unsettling story. Solid writing until....the last two episodes.

What a letdown. I mean, they just threw all the unanswered questions aside and rushed to the finish line.

*Guess we'll never know*: 

*Spoilers*
----------------------------------------
Who were Astrid's parents. 

Why was Astrid so ""special"". 

How Lene made that pact. 

What and how much did Dennis know. 

Why did Astrid's friends inexplicably turn on her. 

Why did Jakob tattoo the date of his death on his arm. 

What was the point of those gravestones with the Equinox symbols. 

Why was Emelia screaming. 

Why her father said she had it coming. 

Did Jakob kill himself or not. 

Why did Astrid refer to her mother as Lene. 

Why drop Info that Ostara was connected to blood in the river when Astrid and Ida weren't sisters. 

It's maddening. 

And why did Astrid suddenly turn on her ex husband and abandon her daughter? Why did the subtitles refer to her daughter as Vera and Viola? And why was Astrid turned into a completely unsympathetic character towards the end? 

And why did they use the themes of yellow and three throughout the series? Homage to Dark? 

And so on....

Just.... frustrating. You just can't introduce all of this and then leave the audience hanging."
Equinox,"Somewhere by the 3rd, 4th episode i knew it was going to shit. Too many storylines not being told properly. You can tell there's been a whole lot of discussion in the writers room so they tried to keep a bit of everything.

And then that ending was completely stupid. Yes its supernatural but even according to their laws it doesn't make sense.

I cannot believe the nerve to compare this to dark. It doesn't even come near Dark. Dark told multiple timelines and storylines masterfully.

Equinox couldn't even tell 2 timelines normally."
Equinox,"So after the bunny god impregnated Ida during the island ritual, he decides to return to the school to continue to teach and proctor oral exams!?!"
Equinox,Such a captivating build-up for it to have one of the worst endings I’ve ever seen. I feel like wasted my time.
Equinox,"I have not watched it yet, but the podcast audiodrama its based on was amazing."
Equinox,"I thought I would love Equinox but the first episode was a total dud for me. I gave up on the show, and after reading how it ends, I'm frankly glad I did.

Just my opinion -- again, based on one episode -- but Dark is vastly superior."
Equinox,"Just finished it and I agree with most of the comments here that it was great until the ending, which was a pretty big let down. Honestly though I’d still say it’s worth a watch if you are into this type of show. It has similar vibes to the German show Dark and the French show Black Spot (IMO the best and least known of the three, highly recommend although I think they are still working on the next season?). The ending isn’t exactly unexpected but just doesn’t tie it all together well and leaves a lot unexplained, even after reading various explanations and looking into the folklore more. So if that is something that really frustrates you, don’t watch lol."
Equinox,"It's like a combination of Dark and  Midsommar, but with a terrible ending"
Equinox,Just watched the trailer. Looks interesting I’ll give it a whirl
Equinox,"Was a great show, until like last 15 minutes..such a Shame"
Equinox,Just finished it. It kept my attention up until the last episode. It ended rather terribly.
Equinox,Where did they get Astrid?  Why did they get Astrid? Who did they get Astrid from? Was the das in on it?
Equinox,I want those 6 hours back.  I found (adult) Astrid to be such an unlikable character.  The ending was ridic too.
Equinox,I've just finished watching it. Found it engaging BUT the ending let me down. Its supposed to tie in with a folklore tail but there's plot holes that really stand out that kind of ruin it for me.
Equinox,"During the ceremony on the island, did anyone notice a woman with a large straw-like head covering? Almost like a long turtle-neck up the side of the head. Thats the only way I can describe it. I'm almost sure it was Lene and she particpated in and witnessed everything."
Equinox,It gave me more The OA vibes than Dark I just hope they follow up with more season to get viewers attention and not just take years for a second season like The OA just for it to be the finale.
Equinox,Came here to agree with the general consensus! Show was great for the first few episodes - phenomenal acting and the dub was actually bearable which is SO RARE. The mood and everything of the show was great. That ending though? Made no sense. I want answers to all the questions below! The thing that irked me the most was her friends turning on her ? And Jakob sleeping with Emelia (Amelia?) and so on and so forth. Hope there’s a season 2!
Equinox,"Kept watching till the end hoping it would make sense... I was so wrong... Absolute pile of garbage. In the end absolutely nothing matters. Every single detail was irrelevant.

Completely opposite of Dark, a show were everything was there for a reason and every detail mattered."
Equinox,It's not a family friendly series!
Equinox,"So, I came here to find more “proof” for my husband that it was all in her (Astrids) head and what the true story was...

I though the series was telling the story of a (mentally disordered) mother and daugther that made up stories for coping with the grief. The clues were some of the things we saw being true, but were taken out of context in the Osara story: The story of Osara being told by her father, that vase in the kitchen with the orange water that looked just like the orange world, Ida taking off her necklace before leaving whilst Astrid saw it in “the hole”, Jakob telling he stole the book from the teacher and it was missing (Astrid took it so she could make up all these stories about Amelie taking it etc.). 

And that it was something like the teacher got her pregnant in his house whilst she must’ve been laying there staring at the mask because she did like a dead stare with Jacob too.  And Astrid could sense the love, like with the 10 for graduation. And the mother told the teacher about the pregancy/abortion, genuine concern and Astrid saw that too...

Anyone else feel like this?"
Equinox,Starting it tonight....my most anticipated show of the last few months .
Equinox,"Had this crap not been compared to Dark, no one would have watched it. Then, it’s actually an insult and disgrace to fans of Dark."
Equinox,Watched the first two episodes so far and is ok to pretty good. I’m interested. Not hooked but will finish. The lead actress I immediately recognized. Liked her in another danish show called “Warrior” and also in a really good Norwegian show “Nobel”.
Equinox,"Finished it a couple of days ago. Don't understand the 1* reviews on IMDb. Thought it was a well written, well acted, great show. Paced well. Was hoping they'd build on for a 2nd series, but it seems to get a lot of hate. Not sure why. I thought it was great!"
Equinox,Kept my interest but and watched it in a row as I am currently locked to my bed due to an injury but it is nothing alike shows in the same genre. The main character's performance is bearing the whole series but there is a lot of bad writing during the whole thing with conversations seeming very odd especially when being a native Danish speaker.
Equinox,"i'm going to watch this today! it looks really good but according to several IMDB user reviews the ending is pretty bad (i don't know in what way it's ""bad"" since i didn't want to read spoilery reviews)."
Equinox,Did you know what the ending meant  just very confused does the last cutscene open up to a new season
Equinox,r/equinoxtvseries
Equinox,"Small sample size, but I find it funny I have family in Denmark who haven't even heard of any of these shows - this, Borgen, Bron | Broen, Forbrydelsen, your popular Nordic Noir, yet I know of them like the moment they are out."
Equinox,"Anyone seen Borderliner? That will always be the worst ending. Equinox managed to bring it to a close in a way that felt like an ending. Yeah we don't know everything we want to know....but I love NOT being spoon-fed. Does Tea Lindeburg have any other shows out or in production, cuz I will watch. Have seen Chestnut Man...this was much more satisfying. Btw....anyone see my fave Danish show ever Rita? After seeing this....I'm SO glad she didn't get it on with Jonas."
Equinox,"It didn't hold my interest initially but after reading all the spoilers and the easter eggs (heh) hidden throughout the episodes and how they play out later, I'm giving the show another go. 

On episode three where it really picks up, and despite knowing the direction it's headed to, I'm really enjoying it."
Equinox,"Same, I was pretty disappointed by the ending."
Equinox,Ending was terrible. They needed 1-2 more episodes.
Equinox,Won't they make a season 2??
Equinox,"What do you feel is left unexplained? I just saw it and I'm left with a overall pretty good impression and don't feel like i have much unanswered. Sure, there is stuff left to interpretation, but that's good imo"
Equinox,"Yeah. So many unresolved questions. As much as this series had a slow burn to it, it could have used more episodes. Too many unanswered questions."
Equinox,Is it same as Dark ?
Equinox,"It's not much of a concern, but thank you for telling!! Looks like we're gonna enjoy it as well."
Equinox,"Lol I totally forgot about that tattoo on Jakob’s arm, what was that even about? This series is a mess and leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I really liked the vibe, but the story and ending make no sense at all"
Equinox,"Astrid father was probably bunny king so half sister to Ida.

Shared blood from fathers side.

Emelia was also damaged just as falke and the bus driver she used the book to cope and her cult/commune Astrid used medication.

Calling your parents by there name is common in the Netherlands I guess in Denmark as well I say dad to my father but use my mother's name for her.

Jakob is a mystery but I think he was pushed by Emelia Jakob found the book which helped him mentally and Emelia was using it as well Jakob death was already predetermined with he's tattoo and he was in the equinox cult using there symbol on he's headstone as well.

They were sister same father.

She was clearly mentally broken and obsessed and had stopped taking meds weeks or months ago when she got that call in the radio station. 
And as the book stated a willing sacrifice was needed or ALL will suffer and Astrid's daughter would also be a blood relative of the bunny king thus she could be the next one to get ""visions"".

Never seen dark so no idea."
Equinox,"I’m with you and you’ve said it well.  I quite liked Equinox throughout the first half, but the latter half got muddled and the ending was nonsense. 
Maybe it had an initial DarK-like vibe, but no where near the masterful level of that series."
Equinox,"I had to hand-draw genealogical trees and timeline schemes to keep up with the Dark, and I have not started the final season yet..."
Equinox,Calling something shit because it's not as good as Dark is setting a pretty high bar. Most stuff is shit compared to Dark.
Equinox,"Yup. Makes perfect sense. Plus, quietly wait and bide your time waiting for the mysterious younger step sister with anti social tenancies, to eventually meet up with you in the forest at the end."
Equinox,"Thank you, saved me a comment to explain my feelings about it."
Equinox,Good to know that!
Equinox,"You did right! I kept watching till the end hoping it would make sense... I was so wrong... an absolute pile of garbage.

In the end, nothing mattered and every single detail was irrelevant. Equinox is the opposite of Dark (a show where everything happened for a reason and every detail mattered)."
Equinox,Agree. Black Spot is a gem. Equinox felt more Black Spot in tune than Dark.
Equinox,Yeah. Hear you Astrid was just a... terrible person.
Equinox,Agree
Equinox,I swear the mom was there too
Equinox,You're giving the writers too much credit i think. The themes of dealing with grief were there but i think the supernatural was very much real
Equinox,Me too. 😅
Equinox,"It's bcause the show left too many unanswered questions, inexplicable character motivations that made little sense, and an ending that felt rushed.

That's why many including myself were put off. And it's really too bad because the first half of the series was actually quite good., 🤔"
Equinox,"Everyone in denmark knows borgen and broen and forbrydelsen, for sure. Most people who follow movie-related sites knows about equinox as well."
Equinox,your family must live under a rock
Equinox,Really? I feel like here in Sweden most people definitely know Bron.
Equinox,I live in Denmark most people know or have watched Broen and Forbrydelsen.
Equinox,"Haven’t seen the ending or read about it or anything of the sort, but I can say that it seems pretty hard to end a tv show in a way that pleases every viewer. As an example I was reallly not crazy about the ending of dark while most people seemed to enjoy it... game of thrones also comes to mind. I’m sure there are plenty of other examples and I’m sure there will be many future disappointments with regards to tv show conclusions. All we can do is enjoy the ride and hope for the best."
Equinox," 

A lot of this is probably nit-picky, but it seemed like the logic of the show and characters was completely wacky toward the end.

\[Spoiler\](Why on earth would someone make a deal to obtain two children only to give them away and presumably never see them again after age 18? Was the dad on board with this? That seems completely outside of his character. And after Ida aborted the baby, the bunny man got her back after all (via the bus crash), so why did he also want the protagonist to join his bunny world? Also, if the bunny man just wanted Ida back, why did he involve the guy with the skinhead haircut, Amelia, and Falke at all? Couldn't he have just crashed the bus and taken Ida? Why did he make the class disappear but spare three students and the driver? Where was the class the whole time? And what was up with that shot where they implied that the orange world that the protagonist went to was actually just the inside of a glass planter in the dad's house? What did Amelia lose as part of the prophecy? Why was she screaming randomly while the protagonist was in Marakesh?)

\[Spoiler\](Also, the bus driver was in the crash, in a coma for 3 years(?), came out of it seemingly brain damaged, lived like that for like 18 years, then had a seizure(?) after circling the teacher's face on a picture, then went brain dead, then spontaneously awoke from being brain dead (after his wife said they were going to pull the plug) with ALL his cognitive faculties regained and no brain damage? Was the bunny man controlling his brain? What exactly caused all this nervous system havoc and why did he recover overnight?)

\[Spoiler\](And also the protagonist straight up just abandoned her daughter to go die with her sister? The show made it seem like she had a strong bond with her daughter - it just seems so out of character to leave her kid to go die and hang out with her sister and a bunny demon.)

\[Spoiler\](Also, when they were at the island prancing around with the cult people, there were two shots where they zoomed out and no one was there except the four kids. Were the other people in the cult a hallucination? How come they all went back to school and treated it like teenage drama instead of anyone acknowledging that Ida banged a bunny demon on a mystery island? And the investigator said they went to the island and there was no one there, so was the bunny man cult a hallucination? Did they go to another universe or something?)"
Equinox,No way near as good as Dark. I thought it was kind of cheap.
Equinox,"Like Dark: it's Danish, has multiple timelines (2), involves some disappearance, has some WTF scenes. But it's supernatural, not SF, and way easier to follow than Dark."
Equinox,I don't think so. But it has the same vibe. I read a review that it's some kind of a mix between the German Series Dark and Midsommar (Film).
Equinox,"Same vibe as DARK, but not nearly as good."
Equinox,Yeah. Equinox had a really good vibe to it. Solid acting and atmosphere. But .... just too many weird and unexplained character motivations and unanswered questions.
Equinox,"I don't think this or any other explanation really fills in the plot holes, and unanswered questions in this series.

There was no info provided, that suggested Astrid was conceived under the same circumstances as Ida's child. There's no evidence that suggests Astrid had any blood relation to Ida at all.

Lene said they got her when she was two weeks old. Her parents' identity is a complete mystery. There was a lot convenient events and moments where information was dropped, but didn't really add up.

I don't know if was the writers' way of setting up for a possible second series, or they just couldn't write their way out of this story properly."
Equinox,Lene said to Ida that Dennis is not her father in the house during the grad party. So they didnt have the same father. I am also curious how Amelia came to know that Ida and Astrid were not true sisters.
Equinox,"The premise was good, the material was there, the actors were good but the execution was terrible. Even strangers things handled their upside down so much better."
Equinox,I had to prep by watching several youtube recaps before watching the 2nd and 3rd season. The last season is amazing! You should def watch it!
Equinox,I'm curious what kind of ending would you have preferred? Her killing the bunny man?.
Equinox,"So true! And the crazy thing about Dark is, despite all the twists and turns, the premise is ultimately very simple at its core. I can explain in one or two sentences why everything happened and how it was all resolved."
Equinox,"Yes, you’re probably right... Well, it was amusing either way. 
Started watching Dark after it, because of the comments in this thread. I’ve found myself a fantastic story, thank you Reddit!"
Equinox,"There's a difference between a bad ending for you, and a bad ending for the story. Dark had a amazing ending for the story, but you personally didn't like it. Got had a incredibly horrible ending for both the story and audience. Equinox wasn't bad i just think it didn't live up to its full potential."
Equinox,"Thats happens in almost everything, even in games, for exemple the last of us2, they cant always make the perfect ending because not everyone wil be pleased"
Equinox,you are pretty much spot on about everything. too many plot holes..
Equinox,"Spot on General!

The only question I can try to answer to is the one about the kids being kidnapped: \[SPOILER\] ( it's probably a way of Bun-man to say ""you didn't give me what you promised? Now I'm taking 22+1 people in hostage until you do"". Which is why we see the kids reappearing. The driver waking up was probably a glitch in Bun-magic, or a glitch in screenwriting. )

The other questions are indeed very pressing. They cannot be justified (if not very partially and by a long stretch) by the supernatural nature of the show and the *suspension of disbelief*. I am happy to believe a Bun-man exists but I cannot possibly find Astrid's behaviour in the last episode credible. 

It felt like the writers took it very easy throughout the whole show until someone walked in saying ""hey guys, you do realise that you have **one** episode left, right?"". So they had to cram all they could in one hour of TV."
Equinox,"I don't think these were plot holes I'll try to explain from my view.

The mother was desperate and seemed to already be deep in the spiritual world I believe Jutta the one that brings young Astrid in trance was probably the one to bargain the deal or give her the idea, she also did alter the deal not expecting it to actually work. 

Father probably knew about it (shadow puppets with Astrid) but was not a believer.

The friends all attended the ritual they also used the book to reveal there futures, I also believe the book itself had some powers and that Amelia used it to make her own cult/commune.

After it all went tits up he needed a way to get Astrid to willingly come and sacrifice herself and he decided to use the survivors. 

Amelia lost herself her family is now estranged best friend and as she said herself Amelia died long ago. 
The screaming is cause part of her is still in that bunny world I think all the survivors can see into it when they sleep like Astrid some go nuts like Falke some are driven to suicide and Astrid got medication to suppress it and Amelia used her cult and that book (it also calmed the skinhead down when he found it) to cope with it. 

The bus driver was just a puzzle piece to lead Astrid to the bunny king he was the only one who saw him directly on the road and could identify him when the time was right (21 years) and yes he was the reason he was damaged as the driver said he was trapped in the other world after Falke told Astrid to visit the driver knowing he was the next link he killed himself knowing he had done he's part. 

Yep she did abandon her family she saw what happened if you do not sacrifice yourself willingly all shall suffer like Ida's friends and mother and Astrid herself she is also obsessed and probably psychotic. 

I think the island is the bunnies holy place as it were a place where they gather and worship but also where the walls with he's world are thin and merge during the equinox, those other people were already trapped in he's world perhaps the previous sacrifices from other deals? 

They acted like stupid teenagers cause they are, they experienced something they didn't understand and tried to blame her perhaps laden with guilt cause they did nothing but watch.

I believe there were 2 things the bunny king wanted a willing sacrifice and he's book back.

He used he's position to influence the skinhead and make him part of he's cult  I think he already made a deal with the bunny King remember that magic trick? remember the equinox symbol on he's tombstone letting him take the book knowing it would lead them to he's island, he left it with them on the bus after the deal went bad and started sending visions to he's other daughter Astrid.

The book I believe is part of the ritual the only way to cross over to he's realm on that island like a key as it were.

This ofc is just how I saw things and I could be completely wrong."
Equinox,"All of these- there was a lot unanswered and the end felt a bit lazy. I literally just binged all of it today and was really loving the theme, the mood, all the witchy shit, and the acting. It may have benefitted from another two episodes to properly tie everything together. Even though the ending was dumb, I enjoyed the other episodes!"
Equinox,"> And after Ida aborted the baby, the bunny man got her back after all (via the bus crash), so why did he also want the protagonist to join his bunny world?

THIS. This is something I wanna know. The 3 kids were used to take Ida to the Bunny demon dude. And then again they did the same to take Astrid to him. But why Astrid if he already had Ida? And why were the classmates taken?

Edit: Also who was the lady who lived with Henrik? His wife? Did she know he is Bunny man?"
Equinox,"(Spoiler) I totally agree with everything! I think it was very confusing who was the 'bird' and 'Ostara' in the end. It did not make any sense at all, given the premise of the original folk-lore told by Dennis..."
Equinox,"> How come they all went back to school and treated it like teenage drama instead of anyone acknowledging that Ida banged a bunny demon on a mystery island?

This was my biggest gripe."
Equinox,"Also, during the cult circle was led by Astrid and Eda’s mother’s friend! Why didn’t the mother just ask her friend, “hey what happened to my daughter that I sent to meet you?”"
Equinox,"At least with the driver, he did not have any stroke or any infraction that could possibly have cause any loss of blood flow to the brain. In aftermath, causing loss of brain function, he could have aspirated when he was having that seizure but overall clinically that was fine. I guess my only thing was that why was his body left in the real world when his existential self was back in the cave, why could that not have been done for all the other students. However, I would assume it would be the sequence, that 21 students taken, Jacob dying on the 22, then her birthday being on the 23. Everybody that was left was there to get Astrid back to the cave? However, the mom said she brought Astrid back to her house 2 weeks after her birth but she is a equinox baby. Her mom keeps on saying shes special but what does that mean? I think there was the other ritual where Ida was probably conceived by Henrik and another women and the same can be said about Astrid but it was saying that cycle is 20 something years apart however they don’t have that age gap between them? But they are both equinox sisters?? If anybody could explain more of that equinox solstice etc that would be great. Its the circle of life for Henrik what must be given/born must be taken/gone at some point as well. However, what are his intention with them?"
Equinox,"I would also like to know Astrid's background and if that figured into the whole plot. They seemed to be trying to say bunny man wanted her as a partner or she was destined to be, thus the erotic dream she had about Henrik.

Maybe the other kids were involved so it was a process Ida came to naturally? Who knows. Lots of frustrating questions."
Equinox,"Yeah i got so many questions, was anything even real? I could see it like her taking her life at the end...but then we saw the missing students?

The driver came back after Folke took his life, did the missing students return now once our girl(already forgot name) finaly gave hers at the 21th day?"
Equinox,"Ok literally just finished so here is my two cents. The four finding the island and the ceremony is not expected I think, at least not to the kids. What was expected is that the ""bunny man"" sorry I just have to say that, was going to take Ida once she had an abortion. And yes mom made a tremendously shitty deal here, but I don't think she even told dad. I mean adoption v deal with a demon? I dunno i'd take adoption but hey.

Ok so bunny man wants ida and he's going to get her. I think, and this is just filling in some major plot holes that he basically kind of led supernaturally Jakob to take the book and to lead them to the island. This way he can ""claim"" ida somehow (kinky bunny sex). Now as to why the three where spared? Ok this is my take again. The bunny man wanted Astrid. He knew in 21 years that it would happen again. He spared the driver and the other three so that they would lead Astrid back to him with the book. And guess what, that's exactly what happened. Through all her visions, her running into Falke and the other girl and the driver, finding out Jakob killed himself, etc. EVERYTHING led her back to the island and her own meeting with Ida and her sacrifice. The only one who knew all this would happen is the bunny man, who if the folklore is to be believed, is a symbol of spring.

So what's the final idea, why the equinox and the return of Astrid and the sacrifice? The bunny man represents the inevitablity of nature. It will take what it wants and if you try  to cheat it it will take even more (the other kids) until it what needs to happen happen. The entire time you think you are watching Astrid ""solve a mystery"" when in reality she is just fulfilling her destiny. But yes the ending is way too short, could have used at least one more episode to work stuff out. Felt very rushed.

That's my take, anyway."
Equinox,"True in a way. The esthetics, acting, cinematography, and tone were well done. However, how the story was handled especially towards the end, leaves something to be desired.

That ending was so unsatisfying. Did not like."
Equinox,Is it that bad xD
Equinox,Dark was a German show
Equinox,Dark is German. Equinox is Danish.
Equinox,Interesting. I loved Dark so that's good enough for me
Equinox,I've never seen a more appealing premise! Gonna watch it tonight.
Equinox,"I ment the bunny king being the father of both of them, I think they were both given to them. 

Amelia knowing is simple Ida and Astrid are about 9 years apart so when Astrid got adopted Ida was already 9 years old, enough to know but keep it a  secret from Astrid she prolly confided it to Amelia being best friends."
Equinox,"Yep, totally agree!  I liked the premise, actors & their performances, but the storyline unraveled starting with E5."
Equinox,">handled their upside down

I feel like ""upside down"" is a kind of trope and has more meaning, can you explain what you mean?"
Equinox,Wrapping up at least some of the major questions others have asked her would have been nice
Equinox,That would be a way better ending.

Best Leftovers Ever!,That's my all time favorite episode of any TV show ever in the history of television.
Best Leftovers Ever!,Everyone who enjoys TV as a medium should watch the Leftovers. Fantastic show.
Best Leftovers Ever!,The theme song for season 2 of the show is literally “let the mystery be.” You will not get “answers.”
Best Leftovers Ever!,\*Plop\*
Best Leftovers Ever!,Try any episode of Twin Peaks the Return. Weirdest 18 hours of television you'll ever see
Best Leftovers Ever!,"I feel like the show was pretty clear from the beginning that it wasn't going to provide answers and that wasn't really the point. Unlike Lost where from the way the mysteries were presented made getting answers more integral.

That said the show actually does provide a good answer to at least the main mystery at the end. It's ambiguous if the answer is true or not, but you could just choose to take it at face value."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"i thought you were talking about the boat episode (look out for it in s3), but yes, International Assassin is pretty trippy too."
Best Leftovers Ever!,OP im watching this for the first time too and just finished s2. what a show
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Just watched this for the first time, holy shit. 

The season finale was so fucking good too I straight up cried at the end which is rare for me."
Best Leftovers Ever!,this episode was trash. idk what these folks are talking about
Best Leftovers Ever!,I came in here fully expecting you meant good weird not bad weird! That episode helped cement the series as one of my all-time favorites. The moment Kevin >!has to select a suit!< I knew it was going to be everything I could want in a television episode.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"The Leftovers never interested me when it aired on television, but man watching it years after it’s possibly one of my favorite television series of all time."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"I am torn by The Leftovers. To me it has many of the Lindelof list of sins. It's a good show but insists upon itself. This episode, to me, feels like Lindelof showing off without caring much whether or not it serves the story or its characters. All three seasons of The Leftovers had three episodes I didn't like. This is one of them. I hated the three final episodes from season 2. Careful plotting and character building go out the window to bend characters out of shape to have a batshit crazy ending. Nora acting stupid when she is far from it. Characters not making phone calls and a long list of plot devices. I hated Assassin because it feels that it's weird just for weirdness sake and many plot devices were written without an endgame in mind (like Lost did), writting yourself into a corner, if you will. 

I have no problem with weird shows and episodes. I love Mr. Robot and I feel the weird season two episodes work within the universe of the show. Not for The Leftovers. To me is Lindelof showing off. Again, this is a guy we know well bungles his writing for having no endgame for many of the things he writes. This is the guy behind Lost and Prometheus... a movie that clearly had characters acting dumb, introducing mysterious things without knowing what it all added up to and adding mythos that didn't need to be added and changing lore that didn't need to be changed. Watchmen is amazing but I think it has to do that the source material is batshit crazy to begin with."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"You won't get answers, I felt the same way than you but you have to change the mindset that the show isn't about getting answers but how the people live and cope with what happened."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"It's not really that hard to figure out. I'm not trying to sound like a dick here. 

But if you've been paying attention to what's been going on with Kevin the whole season, I think it's a very straightforward episode. 

And the surreal elements are fairly tame compared to some of the stuff you get in other shows like Twin Peaks."
Best Leftovers Ever!,Absolutely. Fucking. Brilliant.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"I avoided this because Lost was such a let down. I generally don't like mystery boxes and it sounds like 18 hours into it and you still aren't getting any answers. Like lost. Some of the shit will never make sense or be answered I would fear, and that has kept me from watching this show.  


SO, how much like lost is this mystery box show?"
Best Leftovers Ever!,If you’re gonna jump the shark you better do it with style.
Best Leftovers Ever!,You spelled “best” wrong!
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Lol, it's an achievement in television. Probably isn't the show for you."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Its amazing. And it's bookended perfectly with Homeward Bound, in think episode 10. 

I adore that show."
Best Leftovers Ever!,You’ll get enough answers to have closure.
Best Leftovers Ever!,It only gets weirder and leaves more questions open on S3.
Best Leftovers Ever!,Doom Patrol.
Best Leftovers Ever!,The Third Day...
Best Leftovers Ever!,  This show reminds me of wonderful Sunday night's watching this and Penny Dreadful.  The sub reddits were great too for both shows.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Fantastic direction from Craig Zobel, check out Mare of Easttown for more from him if you want.  Also co-created Homestar Runner, interestingly enough. Also directed a fantastic episode of Westworld

He also did The Hunt, written by the very same writers as the episode he directed. I thought it was a funny movie, enjoyable at least"
Best Leftovers Ever!,"C’mon , what about when Jesus gets his head ripped off by a lion on the Tassie ferry

Bob Dylan lyrics level existentialism played out in live action that one"
Best Leftovers Ever!,lol i realized that they never gonna unveil anything about those missing people just after the first few episodes so i stop there
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Thanks for warning; if it even resembles the nonsensical plot lines of The OA even in the slightest, I think I will stay away."
Best Leftovers Ever!,Lost
Best Leftovers Ever!,Just keep watching seriously- it’s so worth it
Best Leftovers Ever!,Are you talking about International Assassin? That’s my favorite episode of any TV show ever.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Well this is a month late, so I'm assuming you already decided to continue or not. But I'd say keep going! Ep 9-10 were truly spectacular, and I'm just getting into S3 myself.

I really haaaaaate dream episodes, so International Assassin didn't do much for me. But I'm glad I toughed it out to get to the rest."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"A perfect episode of a perfect example of a show that went off totally off the rails.

Season one had so much promise and they scrapped practically everything they were building just to make a jaunt through the funhouse. This show was a spectacular disappointment.

This is possibly the most hit-or-miss show I’ve ever seen. If you like continuous storytelling where plots aren’t dropped at the side of the road for the next weird thing: this show probably isn’t for you.

Edit: took the downvoters a minute, but there you are in all your pathetic fragility. God forbid any of us have an opinion and we don’t just stroke it to the circle jerk. I wish you all understood that I don’t write this to criticize your taste. I’m telling the next likeminded sucker not to buy all the gushing, like I did. It absolutely isn’t for everyone and many will be left incredibly disappointed."
Best Leftovers Ever!,It was a boring show.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Season 2 is overrated. Lindelof crawled up his own ass a bit, fortunately he crawled down before season 3 and it turned out excellent."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Hahahahahaha, just you wait for season 3’s reboot of the literal Bible. Definitely keep watching ;)"
Best Leftovers Ever!,wait until you get to 3-7
Best Leftovers Ever!,I am not a fan of weird bottle episodes but dang The Leftovers is sooooo great. I didn't understand International Assassin and the hotel until season 3. It was worth it.
Best Leftovers Ever!,It's my favorite tattoo I have also. My favorite episode of TV ever.
Best Leftovers Ever!,Dude I think about this episode all the time
Best Leftovers Ever!,"I'm so glad they changed the theme song, cause that song was perfection"
Best Leftovers Ever!,"It is International Assassin, and I'm right there with you. In a vacuum, it's probably my favorite episode of TV. It's so damn emotional, creative, brilliantly paced, and makes you care about characters that have only existed in the space of that episode. 

I'd kill to experience The Leftovers for the first time again. IYKYK."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Lol. I knew it had to be that episode. 

I need to rewatch that. Just an absolute brain fuck. 

The first season was wild, but then it went off the rails, in the best possible way in later seasons. 

I don’t think they could have continued such a dour show without going bonkers with it."
Best Leftovers Ever!,Also might be my favorite episode of anything ever.
Best Leftovers Ever!,What do you mean? Lion Cult Sex Boat was totally normal.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Yeah that is probably the weirdest episode of TV ever made, and I loved it.

I also loved International Assassin."
Best Leftovers Ever!,So we're just naming the greatest episodes of TV ever huh?
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Was listening to a podcast(the watch) where lindelof was on, and he spoke alot about how much he loved Twin Peaks so maybe that's connected"
Best Leftovers Ever!,"> If you're looking for answers you're watching the wrong show. The Leftovers never intended to give answers, it's about characters having to live with the inexplicable and thrives in that.

*♫ Let the mystery be ♫*"
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Exactly. The show is a study of the human condition and it does so impeccably. Showcasing how people react to things that don’t make sense would be undercut having some kind of logical explanation to it all, in the end."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"I generally hate mystery box shows, but The Leftovers is a big exception because it ends the show so brilliantly, IMO (trying not to spoil anything)."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"It is a better execution of the same (or similar) concepts Lindelof was aiming for with Lost.  The problem with Lost, in that respect, is that it leaned too heavily into the mystery, where Leftovers kept things a bit more focused."
Best Leftovers Ever!,It does give enough answers though I think. I never bought the theory about Nora lying.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"> The Leftovers never intended to give answers

""I don't understand what's happening.""

""Me neither ... ... it's OK."""
Best Leftovers Ever!,I've always enjoyed that a show specifically about characters having to deal with not having answers is most commonly criticized for not offering answers
Best Leftovers Ever!,"I mean the intro music for the last two seasons was ""Let the Mystery Be"" they clearly wanted to tell the audience they were not going to get all the answers to the mystery of the sudden departure. The show (along with other Lindelof shows like Lost) was more about the characters and as to whether or not they got their stories resolved."
Best Leftovers Ever!,And don't look in a mirror or metallic surface
Best Leftovers Ever!,You're not alone! Top-to-bottom the best season of TV I've ever seen.
Best Leftovers Ever!,">FYI, the show isn't about the ""why"" of the Departure.

I think this is the issue many viewers that had negative or disappointed views of the show had.  The show sets you up with a hell of an amazing premise, but it takes you in a different direction than what many expected to find out.  You either went with it, or you didn't"
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Yes, International Assassin."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Stylistically it's similar, but The Leftovers is much better than Lost, imo (and I was a pretty big fan of Lost).   It's been a minute since I watched the Leftovers, but there's not a bunch of dangling unfinished story threads hanging all over the place, like Lost, if that's what you mean.  

There's mystery that's unexplained sure, but not a ton of loose ends (that I recall).

The Leftovers is among my very favorite shows of all time."
Best Leftovers Ever!,">Season one had so much promise and they scrapped practically everything they were building just to make a jaunt through the funhouse. This show was a spectacular disappointment.

See I'd say that season one had a great foundation but was entirely too grim to be a multi-season success. The path the show takes in the next two seasons is what makes it incredible."
Best Leftovers Ever!,I’m with you. Hated the show and it’s exactly up my alley.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4550868/?ref_=tt_eps_top

It's the highest-rated episode of the whole series and one of the highest-rated TV episodes on IMDb with a 9.6/10."
Best Leftovers Ever!,I also liked the varying opening credit songs for season 3.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Totally agree. Have never felt the emotions I felt from that episode, from visual media before. It was like a poem. I fucking love that show."
Best Leftovers Ever!,Watching that show during Covid lockdowns was quite an experience
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Easily one of my top 5 episodes of television, a really exceptional journey"
Best Leftovers Ever!,I remember this episode being one of the first times I caught myself standing up as the episode unfolded due to the emotional response it evoked in me.
Best Leftovers Ever!,You guys are about to sell me on the show
Best Leftovers Ever!,I've seen bots and pieces as my wife was watching it when it came out but I never finished it because she watched a bunch without me and I couldn't be bothered to try and catch up. Worth a watch? I don't remember anything about it other than the basic premise
Best Leftovers Ever!,The interaction between Matt Jameson and the Guy claiming to be God was amazing in that episode. (I think thats when that happened)
Best Leftovers Ever!,Twin peaks influenced pretty much all of television that followed it. It’s like having a film director say how they love citizen Kane
Best Leftovers Ever!,"International Assassin aired 2 years before the Twin Peaks episode, and as far as I know Lindelof isn’t a time traveller"
Best Leftovers Ever!,But why were the teenage girls running around the woods naked at the beginning of season 2?
Best Leftovers Ever!,"That's because the show is about the box, not what's inside it.

(I can't tell if this is profound or totally vacuous, sorry.)"
Best Leftovers Ever!,I just finished watching it 2 hours back and glad I did not get spoiled this time. So weird and yet so amazing.
Best Leftovers Ever!,"To be fair to Lindelof when The Leftovers was first airing he explicitly made clear even during promo interviews the audience should not expect answers! If the creator outright tells you that, I see that as fair."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"Also Lost is trash, though.

Watched all of both."
Best Leftovers Ever!,"It doesn't matter if she lied, what matters is that Kevin believed her"
Best Leftovers Ever!,Neither did I. But partly because that was my theory the whole time. So for me she just confirmed it. Never considered she might be lying until I looked online
Best Leftovers Ever!,Not to “why?”
Love and Redemption,HBO has a western series: Deadwood.
Love and Redemption,"The problem with a Red Dead adaptation is that the plots are just pastiches of like, every big western movie ever. They'd really have to steer into an over-the-topness to avoid just seeming like an endless string of cliches, but that isn't really the game's vibe."
Love and Redemption,"Not sure how Red Dead's story, while awesome (one of my faves) would prove upon all the amazing western movies that already exist.

I think they should create a show based on Bully."
Love and Redemption,Then there would be a red dead show on HBO
Love and Redemption,I’d rather have Blood Meridian
Love and Redemption,That's what Westworld season 1 felt like to me
Love and Redemption,Are people at Rockstar up for an adaptation? I've read that they denied multiple chances at turning GTA into a show or movie. Maybe it's the same for RDR.
Love and Redemption,"I don't really care about where shows come from, I just want shows I enjoy.

If they made this and it's good then sure, more western shows would be cool."
Love and Redemption,i want more stuff like arcane personally. something new. i don't have much interest in only these cinematic games also being shows/movies.
Love and Redemption,An original story set in the rdr world? Sure. A 1:1 adaptation of the games? Fuck off.
Love and Redemption,It would literally be a western though with mean-humor?  TLOU has supernatural horror edge though.
Love and Redemption,Or maybe just maybe watch some of the old western movies? Most of the stuff from the game is basically references from popular westerns of the past. Try some of the gritty Spaghetti western or if you want some comedy the Trinity trilogy with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill.
Love and Redemption,Doable. They'd just need to change the story a bit. Take out the big western cinematic set pieces and bring in some original ideas. Red Dead is better as a game though.
Love and Redemption,"The film and television industry loves to follow trends. If The Last of Us remains a hit, there will be more video game adaptations. Not sure if a western is the best genre, though."
Love and Redemption,It would have zombies.
Love and Redemption,Red dead 2 has a pretty clunky story that has to twist established lore to fit. Although that probably wouldn't matter in an adaptation.
Love and Redemption,"It could certainly make a good show if it was done well. However the Red Dead Redemption games would be *much* harder to adapt than The Last of Us. The story is much longer and more meandering than TLoU, which is pretty tight as games go, both thematically and narratively."
Love and Redemption,"Red Dead was already made over 50 years ago before.

Essentially Clint Eastwood cowboy movies are the ""go to"". Not to mention Italian western and Japanese westerns.

And if you seen Hell On Wheels... yes that's basically Red Dead."
Love and Redemption,It's called Deadwood
Love and Redemption,Sooo all those dumb yellstone shows?
Love and Redemption,We dug coal together
Love and Redemption,"People have often made a similar statement how awesome a Sleeping Dogs movie would have been, but in reality, no, it wouldn't. The game is likewise a pastiche of major HK triad movies and themes, it would be extremely derivative. They're clever and fresh when you're not aware of them, but if you've watched a lot of movies from a given genre of film, not so much."
Love and Redemption,"Yeah, as much as I loved *playing* the games, I don't think they'd make very good TV, as is. Nothing much original in the narrative or characters.

I see people suggest a GTA show too, and for the same reasons, no thanks."
Love and Redemption,"I agree with you but still feel with a great cast, score and action pieces that would be enough to carry the show even if the story is simple and done before.

There are plenty of emotional scenes where the actors can showcase their talent. As well as many cool action set pieces that in an ideal world would be amazing to see live.

Agree it might not be the best adaptation material but I would be first in line to watch it not gonna lie."
Love and Redemption,"It’s not about a red dead show being a badass western, it’s about telling the story, which is absolutely brilliant.

The last of us isn’t just your ordinary zombie movie, it’s a story. Red dead isn’t your ordinary Wild West shootin game, it’s a freakin story about a cowboy who has grown to regret the life he lived."
Love and Redemption,"I guess the only adaptation they've ever done is Max Payne with Mark Wahlberg. And since nobody here really remembers it, makes sense why they haven't done anymore adaptations."
Love and Redemption,"This is it. The Last of Us the game for me was an interactive movie. So the idea of it being televised wasn't something I was super hype about. But I stand corrected with how good the first episode was. 

But do what they did with Arcane. Take the characters from the game and give them stories, flesh them out, make us understand how they came to be in the place they are in the game. Arcane stands as the best video game adaptation of all time, but it's not really a adaptation, it has just taken the world and characters and made it it's own thing. Which is what I wish for every other adaptation to do."
Love and Redemption,"Wrong show, what you're referring to is Justified. Another show starring Timothy Olyphant."
Love and Redemption,[deleted]
Love and Redemption,"I hear you.

But TLOU is basically zombie movies and TWD shows. 

I mean... let's  not kid ourselves."
Love and Redemption,like if they did a bioshock adaptation i wouldn't really want it to be about jack but rather rapture in general.
Love and Redemption,"I know, I just like Timothy Olyphant."
Love and Redemption,Always know if the juice is worth the squeeze.
Love and Redemption,"Not to tell that RDR actually does some unique stuff in the Western genre. Cowboys and outlaws in snowy mountains, tropical Caribbean islands, Southern swamps and big cities or using cars isn't a common sight in Western AFAIK. RDRII's story barely even take place in the actual deserts of the West"
Love and Redemption,"You're not wrong.

I mean, on the most surface level, it's *exactly* that genre. But that would be like saying Game of Thrones is just a show about dragons and swords. Shows and video games surrounding those genres are definitely not new.

What made the game, and hopefully this series, different is the approach, not the setting.

It's a story about relationships and choices, ones where moral black and white doesn't exist. Where your perspective can make you the good or bad guy. Where the choices a person makes doesn't easily define them as such, where you are forced to see things from different perspectives. (esp TLoU2)

Most TV forcefeeds you this on a spoon. These are the bad guys! They do bad things! These are the good guys! Everything they do is right! While TLoU makes it obvious that things are not so cut and dry. I really hope the show captures that aspect of the games."
Love and Redemption,Fuck yeah. Jack is not the only one in Rapture. Focus on the other aspects and characters. Make the actual lore and world the character.
Love and Redemption,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Love and Redemption,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Love and Redemption,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Love and Redemption,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Love and Redemption,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Love and Redemption,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Love and Redemption,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Love and Redemption,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Love and Redemption,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Love and Redemption,[deleted]
Love and Redemption,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Love and Redemption,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Love and Redemption,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Love and Redemption,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Love and Redemption,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Love and Redemption,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Love and Redemption,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Love and Redemption,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Love and Redemption,Travelers is a good time travel show
Love and Redemption,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Love and Redemption,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Love and Redemption,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Love and Redemption,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Love and Redemption,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Love and Redemption,Love this show so much.
Love and Redemption,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Love and Redemption,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Love and Redemption,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Love and Redemption,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Love and Redemption,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Love and Redemption,"great show
always recommend it"
Love and Redemption,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Love and Redemption,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Love and Redemption,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Love and Redemption,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Love and Redemption,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Love and Redemption,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Love and Redemption,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Love and Redemption,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Love and Redemption,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Love and Redemption,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Love and Redemption,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Love and Redemption,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Love and Redemption,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Love and Redemption,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Love and Redemption,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Love and Redemption,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Love and Redemption,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Love and Redemption,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Love and Redemption,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Love and Redemption,Someone must have never seen futurama
Love and Redemption,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Love and Redemption,[deleted]
Love and Redemption,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Love and Redemption,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Love and Redemption,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Love and Redemption,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Love and Redemption,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Love and Redemption,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Love and Redemption,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Love and Redemption,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Love and Redemption,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Love and Redemption,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Love and Redemption,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
A Love So Beautiful,I seriously hope this series isn’t cancelled in the future. It has some of the best short movies I have seen.
A Love So Beautiful,This episode reminded me a lot of that “100 artists created an animation from the same template” when she’s dragging the corpse behind her
A Love So Beautiful,it's moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,"The Moebius art style was really well used, too. It looks deceptively simple, but moments like the figure falling into liquid were absolutely spectacular to watch. 

The short story it's based on has none of that Moebius vibe, but they tweaked it just enough to lend it a kind of dreamy existentialism that benefits from it.

This is one of my favorite short form stories in a very long time, I think it's the best thing LDR has done so far, and I hope to hell Netflix gives them another season."
A Love So Beautiful,I had a septoplasty done the day this season dropped. I was on hydromorphone watching this episode. It’s cemented in me now.
A Love So Beautiful,What episode is this?
A Love So Beautiful,its morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,"Good and interesting, yes.  Most beautiful, nah.  It's maybe top ten but my vote goes to Ice from season 2."
A Love So Beautiful,Bad Traveling is one of the best things I’ve seen hands down
A Love So Beautiful,This show is fucking epic
A Love So Beautiful,"I disagree. I thought it was Night of the mini living dead. And I mean that whole heartedly. The rendering was gorgeous. That is if we are talking season 3 only.

Pop squad has some of the most incredible images in animation I’ve seen."
A Love So Beautiful,Jean Giraud’s inspired illustrations influenced so many artists including me
A Love So Beautiful,Definitely my favorite artsyle in the show
A Love So Beautiful,"I just heard about this series on Corridor Crew’s YouTube channel last night and checked it out…

Utterly PHENOMENAL!!! I highly recommend it to anyone who’s a fan of animation and/or short-form storytelling."
A Love So Beautiful,"I heard it was the first episode that made over a hundred moebillion dollars.

Edit: first one to make a morbius pun and it’s gets out-morbed by lazier comments :("
A Love So Beautiful,"thought so , sweet"
A Love So Beautiful,"I didnt like this 1...why was it so popular?

Edit, the ship 1 with the crab was by far the best this season imo."
A Love So Beautiful,I just saw this episode. It was fantastic.
A Love So Beautiful,someone say morbius?
A Love So Beautiful,"My favorite episode, possibly of the whole series, and I love the Moebius influence.

I like that this season has leaned into some comic book style storytelling, with this and the bear episode."
A Love So Beautiful,"I have the ~~incel~~ Incal out of the library and need to read it. 

Edit: wow that was a weird typo/autocorrect"
A Love So Beautiful,Definitely Heavy Metal movie influence see the aspect in the art 1980 movie
A Love So Beautiful,"It's crazy how one French man inspired or help visualise so many iconic sci-fi movies.  Blade Runner, Alien, Tron, The Fifth Element, The Abyss."
A Love So Beautiful,"If I’m going to die, might as well do it high … 😎"
A Love So Beautiful,"That was definitely my personal favorite however tied with Jibaro.

I loved the spiritual element of the character coming to terms with the totality of their death that was assuredly coming in the context of the ecosystem around them done in such a fantastical way. 

Also the animation and the warping environment was just jaw droppingly poetic and beautiful."
A Love So Beautiful,Its morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,"Most beautiful? I really can't agree with that, there are a lot of beautiful episodes of this show. I also found this episode to be quite weak, probably bottom 5 of the entire show."
A Love So Beautiful,If was eh imo. Cool but nothing crazy
A Love So Beautiful,No it isn’t.
A Love So Beautiful,This one was my favorite as well.
A Love So Beautiful,Love the art
A Love So Beautiful,This entire season had some excellent episodes. The final episode was some of the most gorgeous cinematography I’ve ever scene.
A Love So Beautiful,She has a grief trip while losing her love.  It was well written but like… no.  It’s on par with the others
A Love So Beautiful,[deleted]
A Love So Beautiful,"I got heavy vibes of Andrei Tarkovsky’s ‘Solaris’, anyone else?"
A Love So Beautiful,This was the worst episode of the season imo.
A Love So Beautiful,This episode is the perfect example of a plot that will do well in a novel but bad in other media.
A Love So Beautiful,"I don't understand why people write articles with titles like these about a show that is so vastly different episode to episode, and which clearly divides people who watch it.

I don't remember all the episodes, but I found that one pretty unremarkable, and definitely not the most beautiful."
A Love So Beautiful,Agreed.
A Love So Beautiful,Nothing beats that first season
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius?
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius
A Love So Beautiful,Crazy how Morbius tends to inspire so many people around the world!
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius* haha silly typo in the title
A Love So Beautiful,Stand back! Im gonna morb!
A Love So Beautiful,Yes. I also though it said Morbius. I need to cleanse my brain… with another viewing of the hit masterpiece Morbius.
A Love So Beautiful,Watching this episode and Jibaro when I was high was the weirdest beautiful experience ever and I didn’t even realize what I was watching after a while
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,"I don't know, I stand by 'beyond the aquellen rift'. Man, that's a good one."
A Love So Beautiful,"I don't really enjoy this season. too much 'monster and alien' type of episode for me. I prefer when they actually explore scifi concept like Pop squad, Snow in the Desert or when it's just artist having a blast imagine scifi concept like The Witness.

That being said I really like this episode more than I though I would. And the fact that this is the only episode that quenching my thirst for scifi make me enjoy it even more. My favorite of this season easily. (That and David Fincher episode because duh it's David fucking Fincher.)"
A Love So Beautiful,PSA: not everything has to be a “love letter” ffs
A Love So Beautiful,"I watched it this week as my first viewing experience of the show and I was not impressed, to say the least. Very little substance and the awful, pretentious poetry didn't do it any favours.  I picked this episode based on several top 10 episodes rankings where it showed up. If this is the best this show has to offer, I guess it's not for me."
A Love So Beautiful,When Morbina says “i think we should Morb” I lost my mind. Beautiful episode indeed.
A Love So Beautiful,"My favorite part was when she started dragging the body and said ""It's moebin' time!""."
A Love So Beautiful,"You misspelled Morbius, but ok"
A Love So Beautiful,It’s meobin time
A Love So Beautiful,"Mobius, Moebius. But we all know the best one is Morbius."
A Love So Beautiful,"For a sec I thought It said ""a love letter to Morbius""




.....Worst part is I got super excited..."
A Love So Beautiful,It's Moebin' time.
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin’ time
A Love So Beautiful,time to morb 😂
A Love So Beautiful,Why does everyone love Morbius?
A Love So Beautiful,Moeb sweep
A Love So Beautiful,It’s morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,"No, no I don’t think so."
A Love So Beautiful,"I greatly appreciated the poetry of casting Mackenzie Davis as an astronaut trying to improvise a way to survive alone after an accident strands her on Io, after she previously played the tech who realized Matt Damon was alive and trying to improvise a way to survive alone after an accident stranded him on Mars."
A Love So Beautiful,"Netflix made one mortrillion dollars off this episode alone, it’s true, I’m the CEO"
A Love So Beautiful,This season was pretty good. All the episodes were good. My personal fave was the zombie apocalypse one
A Love So Beautiful,"Gave me Solaris vibes, specifically the Soviet version of the film"
A Love So Beautiful,"I thoroughly enjoyed this episode, but in now way did I see as deep into it as they are describing"
A Love So Beautiful,Jibaro left me feeling uneasy to say the least.
A Love So Beautiful,"My favorites were bad traveling, masons rats, and jibaro."
A Love So Beautiful,I really appreciated the one by David Fincher. A love Letter... was visually very nice but the story didn’t really catch me
A Love So Beautiful,"Agree to disagree. It was lovely, but defo not the most beautiful."
A Love So Beautiful,"This is series is so under appreciated and i love that people continually keep on ""discovering"" it.   It's sort of a spiritual successor of MTV's Liquid Television, which i loved back in the day."
A Love So Beautiful,They should just animate the Incal for a few of the episodes
A Love So Beautiful,I disagree. I think Jibaro was the most beautiful episode.
A Love So Beautiful,"Didn't really care for the plot of this episode but the visuals were top notch. If you like this art style check out the game ""Sable""!"
A Love So Beautiful,morb
A Love So Beautiful,"Yeah, but there were no men in it, so it's the weakest episode of the season.


-Every halfwit on the internet crawling out to review it."
A Love So Beautiful,It's morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,A love letter to Morbius :)
A Love So Beautiful,It's Morbin' time!
A Love So Beautiful,It’s morbin time
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius🗿
A Love So Beautiful,They spelled morbius wrong
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius*
A Love So Beautiful,"Sorry, misread that as “Morbius.”"
A Love So Beautiful,It's Moebin' time
A Love So Beautiful,Love letter to Morbius? Nice
A Love So Beautiful,It's moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin’ Time!
A Love So Beautiful,I thought this said “a love letter to Morbius” and now I am very disappointed.
A Love So Beautiful,It’s Moebin time
A Love So Beautiful,Morbious
A Love So Beautiful,Imagine how great it could have been as a love letter to Morbius…
A Love So Beautiful,Wish it was a love letter to Morbius.
A Love So Beautiful,Morbius? ITS MORBIN TIME!!!!!!
A Love So Beautiful,This show is like a  cyberpunk fantasy for stupid people
A Love So Beautiful,A love letter to morbius
Evils Wave,The show is filled with plotholes and lazy writings. I was trying to count and I found atleast 17.
Evils Wave,"Sir, this is a Wandys"
Evils Wave,"I loved the finale but can understand where people may have had problems

White Vision felt a little shoehorned in. I appreciate that it was there to set up a possible future story for Vision and I enjoyed the dialogue between them but it did feel rushed

Some of the lack of screen time for side characters in the finale was due to Covid I believe. I read somewhere that the credits had the name for a ""Darcy double"" which makes me think Kat Dennings wasn't available because of Covid restrictions and had to have her face digitally inserted into the scene

The one part I completely disagree with you on is your claim that Wanda's grief just ""ends"" in the finale. She knows exactly what she has done and what she has lost and it is incredibly clear that her story isn't over (something I would say if we didn't even know her upcoming return in Doctor Strange 2). She knows that before she can deal with anything head on, she needs to learn more about herself and her powers. Her powers being natural also more closely align with her mutant origin from the comics"
Evils Wave,"You seem to have misunderstood some elements of the story.

Wanda didn't really have a backstory for them to ruin. She almost died to a stark bomb as a kid, was exposed to the mind stone and got powers SOMEHOW. Even in the movies and tv shoes that came before no one understood HOW Wanda got her powers from the mind stone cause it killed EVERYONE. 

secondly, the Agatha all along bit wasn't establishing that Agatha did everything. It sort of implied but the ending makes it very clear, Wanda set up the town, Agatha found it and infiltrated it and began manipulating Wanda to steal her power.  The Agatha All Along element was that Agatha was the one disrupting Wanda's perfect life.

The final battle was pretty meh and the fact that Wanda was let off the hook for kidnapping and torturing a town is really weak. Also the Peter reveal was pretty uninteresting so they definitely dropped the ball on some important elements."
Evils Wave,"THANK YOU!!! I felt like I was crazy seeing so many praising the finale. Which sucks bc I genuinely loved episodes 1-7.

 However I had many of the same problems. Mainly with this episode being dedicated to Visions farewell, except that he got the Loki and Gamora treatment and is now still out there... Weird vibe.

Also probably super unpopular opinion but the Monica Rambo scenes felt so out of place with the rest of the show. I also did not understand how her powers work. Or how she got so incredibly powerful just from Wandas magic. Very random element to me, not a huge Capt Marvel fan to begin with"
Evils Wave,"I largely agree with you, though perhaps not in extent.  I'd stop short of saying the last 2 episodes *ruined* the series, but they were, to me, quite a letdown.  I largely expected to be disappointed though.  It's really hard to coherently pull back the curtain for the grand reveal on a weird, wonderful, mysterious series, as was built up in the first half of the show.

The thing that *did* ultimately work for me was Wanda's feeling of loss resonated.  She had lost so much in the MCU, this was how she coped, and once again she was going to lose everything.  I totally understand if the show had already lost you by that point.

I was, like you, really disappointed that Agatha was in fact the big bad.  I personally hate the [she-planned-it-all-along trope](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan).  It can work, if done carefully, which was certainly not the case here.

Monica's demonstration of her powers was so slapped on, such a ham-fisted, obvious hinting at future MCU expansion.  It felt like something Zach Snyder would do.  

I don't know that Wanda got away from all this disaster without consequence for her actions.  It's really left up in the air what the ramifications are."
Evils Wave,"
>The strong and almost unarguable implication is that Agatha’s switch to being a villain is Wanda’s work

That's not the implication at all. They clearly show Agatha coming into Westview and transforming herself to fit the aesthetic. She's in Wanda's bubble but she is in control of herself and since Wanda doesn't really understand or is in denial about what is happening that gives Agatha the ability to manipulate her and the situation to get what she wants, which is Wanda's power.


>that she is some kind of super-witch, immune (somehow) to Wanda’s powers, who created and controlled Pietro (maybe), and even killed her own dog for some reason

It's shown in the show that Vision can break the spell for people in the world. It's not hard to believe that Agatha would be able to protect herself from it.

She killed the dog to stress out Wanda. Her entire goal was to get Wanda to give up her magic. She is using Wanda's grief and desperation to feel whole to get it. By causing chaos and turmoil in Westview that pushes Wanda further into desperation making it more likely for Agatha get what she wants.

That's as far as I got in this. I would like to read it all but this post is just too long."
Evils Wave,"As far as Heyward tracking Vision, he said he was tracking the vibranium signature. It's explained that Wanda's powers literally change reality, so she created a vibranium Vision."
Evils Wave,"Just finished the series and although I only read the initial paragraphs of the OP post about Agatha, that subject is why I came online to see if I was somehow the only person who thought this way. I am a casual Marvel fan and have seen most of the films and I enjoy them and the interconnected universe they set up. Even though I knew the basic premise of Wandavision before watching, I really enjoyed how it developed and how it turned out to be Scarlet Witch basically dealing with her grief and the sinister prison that she'd created, the implications of that and the challenge for Vision and the outsiders to try and free people and get through to Wanda. 

Only, like the OP says, for the intriguing storyline to get completely thrown out the window from episode 8. Exactly as the OP says I was convinced the Agatha scenes were Scarlet's subconscious creating a villain to blame it on. I thought the Agatha ancient witch scene was a comedy style TV parody of how villainous witches are made, another interesting change in direction of the fake TV Wanda had been created. But as it went on I started to realise with absolute disbelief that this was the actual plot! Its so stupid, its so forced, it completely undermines everything the show had built up to that point. What's most disappointing is how it took such an original idea and just turned it straight back into the generic Marvel fare. What a joke, made even worse that we actually thought it WAS a joke until it... wasn't.

Its such a shame as there was so much potential for real tension at the end, emotional  resolution with Vision, the plight of the townspeople, and so on. I don't read the comics and so don't give a damn about artificially inserted witches storyline. I haven't seen the Dr Strange movies but for me the magic side of the universe just doesn't work in the setting they've created through the other movies, its so jarring. But that's a side note, the main issue is the last two episodes just destroy all the tension, mystery and emotional potential from what had been an enjoyable show up to then. Also the addition of the scenes of the lady who passes through the barrier and somehow has powers was so confusing - after reading up it seems she is a bit part character from Captain Marvel or something, But for the average viewer why would you think she had powers or understand wtf is going on there. It's just so random.

Great concept and commendable for most of it, with a, terrible, terrible ending. What a shame!"
Evils Wave,"*Nailed* it. I feel almost exactly the same way.

It was all over a period of just one week, though, not months."
Evils Wave,"I think the show was very very good and it just missed the landing. And that's ok. I have my complaints about it, but I still enjoyed it and thought it was a worthwhile watch. And, I'm sure that as phase 4 gets fleshed out more it will make more sense. But, for now, we are kind of just sitting on a pile of red herrings that went no where."
Evils Wave,"Hard agree. The ending reminded me completely if game of thrones...an amazing ride that was rhetroactively invalidated by a horrible ending. If your fanbase comes up with a better ending than the professional workers, then the audince is going to feel let down. 

Fore the biggest insult was the peitro fake out. Teasing a multibillion dollar movie tie in, only to half heatedly undo it felt like I was being robbed. 

You have exactly 1 mutant in the avangers. You are a company that just bought the x-men IP. You are between phases, having just completed a decade+ long plot arch. You have a show entirely about the one character that could bring it all together...and you just...pretend? It was infuriating. She was long considered the daughter of magneto for Christ sake. Imagine if Ian mckellen had walked in during end credits."
Evils Wave,"I can't imagine being so disappointed by a show, movie, or book that i would write so much about it."
Evils Wave,Some people take marvels too seriously
Evils Wave,Tldr
Evils Wave,QQ

Evils Wave,"And this is why this place sucks for actual substantive conversation. If you're not sucking off Parks and Rec, Barry, Mr Robot, Brooklyn 99, Community or more lately Warrior then you might as well not expect any replies and even then it's just fucking memes and catchphrases. ""Streets ahead"", ""Britta'd it"", ""Cool cool ciool cool cool"", ""Noice"", ""It's Nikolaj"", ""I swear I'm saying it right, ""hello Friend"", etc. Come to an actual place to discuss a TV program, get told basically to shut up and go away with a meme. As if this comment is on topic or contributing anything to the actual discussion. Fucking ridiculous. 

Shit let's just post The Racial Draft of Charlie Murphy;s True Hollywood Stories for the milluionth time so everyone can just post ""UNIIITY"", ""Game, Blouses"" and all those lines that get posted in every thread on this site even in places that don't discuss TV like /r/worldnews

Heaven forfrend anyone post anything thought out and comprehensive to explain their views and in turn expect anything worth a fuck in response."
Evils Wave,"> Some of the lack of screen time for side characters in the finale was due to Covid I believe. I read somewhere that the credits had the name for a ""Darcy double"" which makes me think Kat Dennings wasn't available because of Covid restrictions and had to have her face digitally inserted into the scene

That make sense. It was clearly a problem the flmakers had to address. But their solution was still lazy as anything."
Evils Wave,">I also did not understand how her powers work. Or how she got so incredibly powerful just from Wandas magic.

they didn't explain it in detail, but they said that going in and out of the hex so much was altering her DNA."
Evils Wave,I suppose that could explain how but not why. Or why he was keeping his tracking a secret. In the end the fact he was tracking Vision was entirely pointless.
Evils Wave,"Amazing! I thought I was the only one. Welcome to the club, person of taste and culture."
Evils Wave,"Seriously! SWORD apparently started the week disassembling the most complicated piece of technology ever constructed, and had completely mastered that tech AND rebuilt him perfectly by the end of the week."
Evils Wave,"I don't blame them for not being able to wrangle Ian McKellen as well but I do blame them for wasting what they did have. Evan Peters was one of the best things about Fox's X-Men and to just utterly waste him like that? They've got the actor, they've got the rights, they'vs got a good justification for bringing him into the MCU permanently, and then they just discard all that. I can't imagine what they were thinking. If Feige cant place him just yet at least leave open the possibility of someone using him in a Phase 4 film."
Evils Wave,Someone TLDR this for me?
Evils Wave,They explained more than once I believe that the vibranium that makes up Vision is worth several billion dollars. Would you not want to know where several billion dollars worth of something was just kinda hanging out?
Evils Wave,Didn’t they have a throw away comment in a previous episode about having torn him down and rebuilt him five times?
Evils Wave,"Tdlr; unless your circle jerking a select few shows, your roof to fuck off for trying to have a real conversation.

It kinda devolves briefly into some tangent about Tv shows being discussed more on other subreddits but it circles back around to being angry at this sub for its lack of discussion.

I disagree hard with this, I think this whole OP post was baiting, so to respond with “this is a Wendy’s” is appropriate imo"
Evils Wave,That could be true. There were so many throwaway lines it's hard to keep track of them.
Evils Wave,Wandys*
Evils Wave,Big Little Lies is fantastic and my favorite show this year. There is just nothing bad I can say about it. Great show from start to finish.
Evils Wave,"I find _Sneaky Pete_ above Good/Enjoyable.

List is also missing one series that I really liked, _GLOW_. It's not astonishingly good, but it can make the cut into Good/Enjoyable."
Evils Wave,I can't figure out of Patriot is actually good or just part of a stealth marketing campaign. It never seems to be on any lists outside of reddit.
Evils Wave,"I liked that show ""Downward dog"", it's already been canceled tho. "
Evils Wave,"I adore Patriot. The writing is extremely tight, with subtle but impactful character development, intertwining storylines, and excellent set up and pay off. The unusual combination of drama and off-kilter humor felt surprisingly compelling and genuine, thanks in large part to the cast's great performances across the board. In addition to the purposeful and visually interesting camerawork and style, there's also some pretty spectacular scene choreography, such as in the long, single-take rock-paper-scissors game and pipe sequence.

I could see the show having a similar viewership trajectory to Breaking Bad, in which it slowly builds up steam for the first few seasons through acclaim from its small fanbase before reaching critical mass and becoming a hit."
Evils Wave,"I am in the middle of episode 8 of Gypsy, and I cannot wait for this piece of shit series to end. I wouldn't rank it as the absolute worst series I've seen this year, but it's near the bottom."
Evils Wave,I thought The Good Fight was really good. CBS obviously did to make it their first series on their new streaming site. 
Evils Wave,"While I can understand leaving it off the list, ""Brockmire"" has an undeniable charm, although I find its uneven tone to be a bit hard to handle. I am glad it was renewed as I think it has legs."
Evils Wave,">Audrey Plaza

Aubrey* Plaza"
Evils Wave,"I completely disagree on Taboo. It was by far my favorite show of the year. The script, acting, plot, production value and directing is amazing. I don't think it moved slow at all but I guess I understand why others do.








I would switch Taboo and Legion. Legion was great film making and the visuals/tones were really cool and innovative but the plot was lacking and the last episode especially was pretty underwhelming. 



Also, no thoughts on the leftovers and BCS?"
Evils Wave,"**TL;DR** - in case it's too lengthy (well, it obviously is lol) or you didn't understand the layout. Here's a ranking of the 25 new shows (that I've seen) of 2017 so far.

2. Big Little Lies

Evils Wave,"i love the mick. anyone expecting kaitlin olson to create a ""just like IASIP"" show is gonna be disappointed. but the mick is hilarious on its own, and the actors who play the kids are amazing. i've rewatched the episode about [sully the clown/ben's birthday party](https://giphy.com/gifs/26xBxo80vzmY4xigw/html5) multiple times. "
Evils Wave,"I would add a category of ""shows that showed promise but were killed after their first season"" and put Emerald City in there. It's a bizarre reimagining of the Oz story with the delirious visuals characteristic of Tarsem Singh's work. 

Unfortunately, I think that they missed the right tone for the Wizard (even though he is Vincent D'Onofrio) and *specially* for Dorothy, who is that kind of protagonist that we couldn't care less for."
Evils Wave,Twin Peaks? 
Evils Wave,"You should check out The Son on AMC.  My favorite new show of the year, by far."
Evils Wave,"Two comedies I really enjoyed that premiered this year on NBC: Trial & Error and Great News.  I'd put them in the Good/Enjoyable category, they aren't part of the greats quite yet, but they both found their comedic voices and rhythms pretty quickly and have casts with great chemistry.  I'm really looking forward to seeing their second seasons."
Evils Wave,"I would take 13 Reasons Why out of the overrated category and put Legion there. I don't think people were making 13 Reasons Why to be anything special but just really showed affection for some characters like Clay, Jeff while detesting some other characters. Legion however I see as wasted potential, it has to have some of the most under-developed characters I've seen(I hardly ever notice things like this) and super weak world building. 

I'm going to stop criticising Legion at this point because I still have  3 episodes left but based on what I've seen I think it's vastly overrated, especially on this sub."
Evils Wave,"American Gods is definitely in the overhyped category to me.
It looks nice but is absolutely boring to watch for me."
Evils Wave,"Great description on American Gods. Loved the book and was pretty skeptical about it being adapted to a TV show. It ended up having fairly obvious small problems as you described, but very enjoyable still. Excited to see where they take it now."
Evils Wave,[deleted]
Evils Wave,"Thanks for this list! Ahaha it used to be in like 2009 there were maybe 4 or 5 *good* shows to keep up with, now I have to be picky even with the cream of the crop, so this is very useful.

One question about Legion, is there anything else I have to watch before this? Do I have to be super familiar with other Marvel shows and movies? I've seen a few of the X-Men movies, and Logan, and I haven't really kept up with Marvel since the Avengers."
Evils Wave,"I disagree with the negatives for The Handmaid's Tale about the flashbacks and modernization - that personally really made it feel real to my wife and I. 

[spoiler](#s ""The scene where the first shots are fired too, was one of the best and scariest scenes of innocent civilians being attacked that I've ever, *ever* seen. It was terrifying and felt real despite the slow motion effect. I think a lot of that content is vitally important to what happens in the present of the storyline, and they do a good job of setting up the flashbacks."") 

Offred is an unreliable narrator, and so are the others, but you can genuinely feel their anguish when you compare their current lives to their previous lives, and contrast both to their time at the Red Centre."
Evils Wave,"I feel like both *Legion* and *American Gods* are overrated. Both are good shows, but they both have glaring issues. 

EDIT: I pressed send too quickly :/

I have more issues with American Gods overall so i'll start there. I read the books, and upon learning that it was going to be adapted into a series I immediately wondered how they were going to make Shadow compelling. He's fine in a book format, but even then he was kind of just....there. Luckily, the show instilled some life into him. But, the actor wasn't good at expressing it. He was decent but he was so clearly out of his depth compared to everyone else it was hard to watch at times. Also, the decsion to instill some life in Shadow backfires in that he just looks past way too many weird things without seriously questioning them. With book Shadow, he's so blase that it's easily forgiven. It's not the same for his TV counterpart. 

I also hated how slow the plot moved. I didn't know how they were adapting the books when the series started. I assumed this would either be a 2-3 season adaptation of 8 episodes, or they were going to expand a lot. I guess we got something somewhere in the middle, but even then the plot moved excruciatingly slow. Ironically enough, however, my two favorite episodes were the stand alone ones :/ Oh, and something has to be done about that damn music. I literally muted my TV during that Vulcan episode because the music was so obnoxious. 

As for Legion, I don't remember as much about it since it's been a few months since i've watched an episode. I do remember thinking the plot moved slow for the sake of moving slow though. They stretched out the mystery farther than they had to and it only served to annoy me. Tying in with that, the whole thing was a blue ball. The slow moving plot was one thing, but we NEVER got to REALLY see the extent of Davids powers. When it seemed like we might get the chance it's either not as big as the tension and buildup suggest or it's avoided or masked in some way. I also thought the show went so far with the quirkiness and unconventional style that it ended up coming off as pretentious at times. Oh, and that was probably the most anti-climatic ending coupled with a infuriating cliffhanger i've ever seen.  "
Evils Wave,"Really great list. Gonig to give Legion a try as I'd completely written it off.

You should take a look at SS-GB. Fantastic 5 part mini-series.

It's a look at the world if Germany/Japan won WW2. "
Evils Wave,"Legion - gave up after 3 episodes because the deliberate weirdness and obfuscation made it a chore to watch.  
  
American Gods - quit after the pilot episode because I had no idea what the hell was going on and frankly, didn't care at all.  
  
Crashing - it's better than just OK"
Evils Wave,"I just can't believe someone thinks Anne is uninteresting and irritating. A better explanation is that maybe you don't get the story or you don't like it. If you watch, it has an amazing story, acting, writing and directing. "
Evils Wave,Master of None???
Evils Wave,"Taboo is a lot better than ""overrated"" and Legion was let down by Noah Hawley getting carried away with himself (the 6th episode in particular was appalling)."
Evils Wave,"I would add Master of None S2 to Outstanding. Found S1 to be very good and S2 tops that like a mother fucker!

edit: Aah, just saw the 'new' shows part but I am gonna leave this anyway."
Evils Wave,"And the **13 Reasons Why** bashing continues on this sub. Over-rated? That certainly isn't true here. 

And yes, the series definitely has Perks of Being a Wallflower beats but let's not pretend that's a perfect movie either. Changing the writer would not necessarily be an improvement. "
Evils Wave,"Your list doesn't include Powerless, the single worst sitcom of all time."
Evils Wave,"I'm glad to see *Dimension 404* mentioned, because that's how I felt about it, too.  I thought the ""Bob"" episode was exceptional, though.  It had Tom Noonan and Megan Mullally who are always awesome, but I thought Constance Wu knocked it out of the park.  

Before that episode I only really knew her from *Parallels*.  I really liked the character she played in that, mainly because I thought it was a very cool concept.  Now I think I also liked her in it because she's really that good."
Evils Wave,"Agree on Taboo being disappointing. It took me almost two months to watch the whole thing, even though I started over halfway through its run. It was like every time the show was gaining momentum, it petered out and went off exploring something else. Hardy was great and I liked how dirty and depraved London looked, but it all became a bit ridiculous and convoluted by the end. A more personal narrative would have been more compelling, in my opinion. It was too spread out and none of the threads amounted to much. I just kind of shrugged my shoulders after the finale and wondered what the point was."
Evils Wave,"American Gods should be on the good section, so does patriot and completely agree with Taboo, the best thing about is the acting which is most carried by Hardy."
Evils Wave,Big Little Lies and The Handmaid's Tale are my fav tv shows this year so far.
Evils Wave,"Having never watched Always Sunny, I loved The Mick and want to see Kaitlin Olson play a crime boss/evil mastermind in a movie.  I just imagine those eyes staring at a goon/good guy as they killed horribly, I think she would be great as an evil genius, etc."
Evils Wave,"over the holiday i just binged season 1 of a bravo show called 'imposters' - clever, enjoyable in the 'guilty pleasure' category, though smarter than that moniker implies.  very much looking forward to season 2."
Evils Wave,"I agree with your list with the exception of taboo. Iron fist, you are right worst of the Marvel-Netflix. And I binge-watched Big Little Lies, such a nice show, thank you hahaa :)"
Evils Wave,"This is a very strong list, and I personally agree with almost everything. I'd put Dear White People in my Top 10 and Big Little Lies as my #1 (haven't seen Legion).

But I cannot cosign the inclusion of Dimension 404. It felt like a very bad Nickelodeon version of Black Mirror, I only got halfway through the 3rd episode before I had to stop."
Evils Wave,"If you read the book The Handmaids Tale show is atrocious. 

The changes they made completely take away from the themes of the show. 

Girlboss was atrocious too. The main actress is disgustingly annoying. 

13 reasons why was very good for a teen drama show. Good acting. Good story. It's also for the most part the most realistic portrayal of high school. And compared to shows like riverdale the actors look high school ish."
Evils Wave,[deleted]
Evils Wave,"Legion and The Handmaids Tale outstanding? Legion was a mess and The Handmaids Tale seemed like chapter 1 (the boring chapter) of a long book.

Sure, The Handmaids Tale explores an interesting setting but that's about it. Where's chapter 2 where she actually attempts to escape?

To me best shows from the list so far are:

1. Dear White People

2. American Gods

3. Taboo

Though haven't seen a bunch of them."
Evils Wave,Big little lies is half desperate housewives and half   lifetime movie
Evils Wave,The Leftovers. Vastly overrated.
Evils Wave,Iron fist is better than half these shows. Haters gonna hate
Evils Wave,"I wrote it off as not my thing, but that description sounded better than I expected."
Evils Wave,Nicole Kidman: The Tom Cruise Years was apparently a rejected title for the show
Evils Wave,I didn't think it was interesting enough. Like not a lot of drama or mystery. 
Evils Wave,"God damn GLOW was fabulous, hopefully a s2?"
Evils Wave,I binged GLOW all in one day. It was charming and hilarious. 
Evils Wave,"Its just not a great list overall. American Gods was a really fun book, but the series was kind of a disappointment. 

GLOW on the other hand, was a surprisingly good show. I also think The Mick might deserve to be ranked higher."
Evils Wave,Please just watch it. It's just as good as you've heard. 
Evils Wave,It's fucking great.
Evils Wave,"I loved it, but as soon as I finished it I thought ""Crap, I have no one to talk about this with and the fact that it's on Amazon means that very few people are going to see it"".

I also think that it's one of those shows which might turn a lot of people off with its quirks. It reminds me of Wes Anderson, in a way, and while I love Wes Anderson I get why other people might not."
Evils Wave,Amazon's shows don't seem to be well-known. I bet there's a sizable proportion of Prime subscribers who don't realize they have access to some good TV.
Evils Wave,It's legitimately good especially if you like dark awkward comedy. As the OP described it's kinda like Fargo meets a spy drama. Completely ridiculous but super entertaining. 
Evils Wave,I think it's pretty good. It's definitely not for everyone though. It sucks that it's getting swept under the rug. It just isn't flashy and doesn't have big stars to grab people's attention and with quality shows coming out the woodwork something isn't going to get the love it probably should.
Evils Wave,Same.  I avoided it for awhile as I thought it would be a dumb comedy but it was amazing!  I binged the entire series in a few days and was sad to find out it ended on a cliffhanger.  Hoping season 2 comes out soon.
Evils Wave,binged watched it yesterday. I even made a post about how bad it is lol. I had to force myself through those last couple episodes.
Evils Wave,"I thought it started out promising but it soon became clear that the faults of the early episodes would just get worse, not better with time. So many characters and stories devolved into caricatures. They basically take stories and characters that seem to be designed to fit in their previous comedy Braindead and planted them in a drama setting that takes itself way too seriously for what it is. It just doesn't work."
Evils Wave,it's left off the list because I didn't watch it lol 😅
Evils Wave,"I really *wanted* to love Brockmire, but I was *sooo* disappointed with the trope filled meltdown at the beginning of ep1 that it lost me and i never went back.   "
Evils Wave,oh shit I keep spelling her name wrong mad bad 😩
Evils Wave,I personally loved legion but you havent seen the highest rated episodes or any of the climatic stuff. Not saying you wont feel the same way after you finish it but its usually a good idea to finish something before labeling it overrated 
Evils Wave,The list is only new shows so no Leftovers or BCS. Also Taboo really blew.
Evils Wave,"I can't wrap my head around how you can rate Taboo so low on your list, to me that show was exceptionally well crafted."
Evils Wave,How do you find the time to watch so much TV?
Evils Wave,No love for Kate Walsh on 13RW? She had the most heartbreaking scenes on that show and she nailed the role.
Evils Wave,"The Mick is good, but it falls into the same trap as a lot of modern sitcoms of trying to redeem the characters in the third act of every episode.  

It makes me miss shows like Malcolm in the Middle that let the characters stay true to themselves and didn't always try to shoehorn in an ""aw shucks"" moment."
Evils Wave,The little kid eating the birth control was hilarious!
Dewi,"Hal doesn't work a blue collar job, though.  They also didn't ""decide"" to have any children, either, it is explained in the show.  They have a condom baby, a pill baby, a rhythm method baby, an abstinence baby, and I think Jamie is a vasectomy baby."
Dewi,Nobody tell this kid about shameless
Dewi,"I think the families we see on TV are often above the median in terms of wealth. I don't think it's suffering to share rooms, share a single bathroom or wear hand me downs.

I had to share rooms and wear hand me down clothes. I never thought of myself as poor, though, and my parents always had time and patience for us."
Dewi,"As hardships  go, sharing a room, a bathroom, or clothes doesn't seem like a big deal."
Dewi,"What? They live the way many in America do. Sharing a bedroom is common and many people live with  one bathroom and never think anything of it. If they didn't want to be married with kids they wouldn't have been, but they did it, and kept having kids, because that's what was more important to them than youthful ""ambitions""."
Dewi,"Wow, I cannot believe how one-sided these comments are. I can relate, OP. I grew up in a house that was financially stressed, and it did not bring out the best in my parents. Just started therapy to deal with almost 20 years after I left. I have 2 kids of my own now, and I want to give them the world but at least I can give them a comfortable, stable life with access to an excellent public education, nice clothes, and calm, loving, engaged parents. 

It’s not about whether only the rich should have kids. It’s about only having the kids you can give a stable life to. It’s not about the right to have kids. It’s about the conditions in which you’re shaping someone else’s LIFE. How are we empathizing only with the parents here and not with the kids? Did none of you have a shitty, painful childhood? Did none of you grow up in poverty or one tiny hiccup away from poverty? Did none of you experience being made to feel lesser than by your peers? 

Yes, the system is broken and we should all work toward changing it. I do. But right now, it’s what we’ve got and I’m not going to have more kids for the sake of having them if I’m not equipped to give them some dedication and basic financial stability."
Dewi,"Just a thought, maybe look at the larger socio-political situation that means that raising a family of 4 is a massive reach. I think the comedy is well timed to show the fallout as a result of the post-Industrial era of Capitalism. 

Hal is basically a pretty good guy crushed by work and Lois is forced into a dead end job where she is clearly smarter and better at certain things than people like Craig who I believe got promoted over her. 

It's been years since I watched the show and I never bothered to undertake a really deep analysis of it, but most of what you have written here is blaming Lois and Hal, when it would be better directed at examing the capitalist culture that orders their lives and over which they have very little control. 

>But I can't ignore just what a shitty situation this family is in, all because the parents made the decision to have a gaggle of children that they can't afford. 

This is the key part of your argument it seems and is the point I'm zoning in on. Isn't it a pretty shitty economic system which increasingly makes having a family be a goal beyond the reach of many? In previous eras Hal would of had a job that paid for his house and children all by itself ... yet he is clearly struggling, whilst Lois is also working to help the family and it's just enough to get by barely ... this fact also leads to them not being able to devote long periods of time to supervising and educating their children, which you could argue is a large source of disfunction and drama they find themselves in during each episode. So we can see how being forced to work so many hours means they are forced to neglect their children which has longterm consequences for society.

Again, I haven't seen the show in years, this is mostly from memory, but I bet on a rewatch my point would stand ... don't blame them as individuals, blame the shitty economic system they are a part of."
Dewi,"One bathroom!?!?!? How horrific!


 Get your head out of your ass."
Dewi,Have you seen the last episode? One has to watch the show first and that ending was so fucking good and it hits hard. It does show how shitty things are and you wonder why it has to be like that. But the ending was one of the best of not THE best ever.
Dewi,r/Childfree is leaking again.
Dewi,"I was the middle of two brothers growing up in a poor house - MitM is a fantasy about an impoverished family failing upwards. 

In the real world, maybe one son is a genius level talent, Francis doesn’t land a sweet ranch management gig, Reese ends up with PTSD from his military stint, one of them ends up in jail, and Malcom doesn’t get anywhere near Harvard.

Oh, and they learn from the one consistent part of their childhood, knock up women too young and too often, and get trapped in the cycle with their own children. 

MitM is a fairy tale about how kids can give zero shots through childhood, have every card in the deck stacked against them, and still come out way ahead for no good reason."
Dewi,"The bad parenting is done for comedy, but there's nothing about having all those kids and two blue collar jobs than *requires* bad parenting to result.  There's nothing about kids sharing rooms that is unbearably awful.  There's nothing about wearing hand-me-downs that is inherently bad.

As long as they had a roof over their heads, clothes on their backs, and food in their bellies (and those things were reasonably secure)... the rest is just crap you've been raised to believe is necessary.  

And yeah, I know that sounds like tree-hugging hippie crap and that's exactly what I would have called it 30 years ago, but it's ultimately true.  I grew up with a dad who was never around because he was working, and a mother who had to do the 9-5 thing because my dad's job wasn't enough.  I wore my older brother's clothes, played with my older brother's toys, and even had some stuff my dad built from scraps because buying new wasn't an option.  Yet here I am.  I didn't even know I was 'deprived' as a kid."
Dewi,"I took it as less that Lois and Hal are bad parents than the kids are very wild because Hal is a wild man and Lois is keeping him from acting on his wild man impulses.

The kids aren't deprived they are just working class.
Having your own room with more than 2 children in the family and multiple bathrooms wasn't that common until relatively recently. Only the children of people in the top 1/3 -1/4 of earners (at least in my town) had that when I was growing up. They don't miss meals and have clean clothing, the family has 2 cars. They're not poor just struggling to keep it together from time to time like many working class families do when unexpected expenses happen. 

If they hadn't sent Francis to military school the family would be doing better financially but Francis probably would be in jail. Francis was a wild man just like Hal until he got married to Padmia."
Dewi,"Wow you have an unhealthy obsessions with this topic, you should really consider trying to find a way to move past it on your own."
Dewi,[removed]
Dewi,"Your argument about the shitty economic system makes sense. But actions have consequences. If someone is disabled or is in a bad situation for no fault of their own, then they absolutely deserve assistance. 
But why should the system bear the burden of children that Hal and Lois chose to have. I'm willing to bet their their lives would have been much better if they stopped at Reese. By continuing to have kids, they deprived their children of resources that were already scarce. 

Nobody forced them to keep procreating. It didn't happen due circumstances beyond their control. They brought it all upon themselves and their kids."
Dewi,"This argument boils down to 'only rich people should have kids'. It is their own fault that they weren't born into riches or with incredible talent that scored them high paying jobs. They need to live with the broken system and accept it. This way of thinking stops any progress. If having kids is a privilege instead of a basic right than you create a precedent for basically everything broken to stay as it is.

Can't afford education? Work better with what you have. Can't afford a car? Look only for jobs that don't need one. Employer exploits you? You can always change your job.

If the society and the government can't be held accountable for anything bad because you can always chose to not do a thing. If you can only chose between bad and worse it's not really free will. Not everybody starts on the same square in life. Yes actions have consequences but if this means the consequences are different based on money or birthright it is not OK."
Dewi,"I forget the episode but an important one would be how the writers narrate their having children.

As far as I recall Hal was very successful, driving a nice car, had just bought what at the time was a nice house and over the episode each child just made their situation worse and worse.

Sure they should have been using birth control or whatever, but I'd need to get a look at the whole series again to see how their arcs are presented to make a detailed analysis. 

But my gut instinct is shifting blame onto Hal and Lois, probably isn't a good call, even if some of their actions aren't the best."
Dewi,I agree.
Dewi,"I never said only the rich should have children. All I'm saying is that if you struggle to provide for your kids' basic needs , you should stop having more children.  


This isn't the same as not having enough money to pay for college.  If you're poor and need help with paying for tuition, you deserve it because it would lead you to get a degree , a better job and help you become financially stable. 


Having more and more children that you cannot afford doesn't improve your life in any way. Nor does it improve the kids' lives. 

What would you say to a person who  was poor and wanted to buy a Mustang, that s/he cannot afford to pay for, but felt like they deserved it simply because their rich friend had one?  Would you advise them to live within their means or would you advocate that the government should pay for it?



I have two dogs and two cats. They bring me great joy. If I had the means and the space is would have many more pets. But I'm not going to get more pets because I know I won't be able to give them the life that they deserve.  Shouldn't the same apply to having children? 


If you keep having kids while you're living in poverty , then you're being selfish. Because you're placing greater importance on your desire to have more children, than on your kids' needs for stability."
Dewi,"Actually, they were using birth control, but still managed to have kids while using contraception"
Dewi,"What is the difference between the first and the third kid? If you can't afford the first kid you also shouldn't procreate?

You compare a mustang to a kid. That in itself shows me that you value a kid as a privilege not a basic right. In addition to that you can get pregnant on accident even with preventive measures. Are poor people than obliged to abbort the baby cause they can't afford the kid? Or are shouldn't they have sex in the first place if they can't afford another kid? You don't buy a car on accident.

It all comes down to what the society sees as having kids. Is it a basic right like education, food or housing than the government/society must support the people to an extend (the amount of kids must be limited but that is something that differs from culture to culture). If procreation is a privilege than your argument stands. But than there should be free protection and abortion or else you can't argue that only people that are well off enough are entitled to sex."
Dewi,I agree
Dewi,I believe bringing a human being into this world is a privilege that should have to be earned. And I completely support free contraceptives and abortions.
Dewi,"Than you agree with the sentiment 'only rich people should have kids' in the form that you need to have enough wealth (acquired, inherited, etc) to procreate. Rich in this case is a big variable because of location and cost of living but it also entails that kids are not entitled to education, food or clothing. If a kid is a privilege the one created it must have all means to support it. It is a really hard topic because of this slippery slope that surrounds it.

In my opinion it should be a basic right but there is no real answer how it should be supported because then you need to put a price tag on a human life... There are a lot of countries that do that but it doesn't create perfect living conditions for children either."
Dewi,I agree.
My Only One,"Will steal the show nonetheless. I mean even the director and the showrunner were hyping up his appearance so I assume if it's just one episode, it will be an impactful one."
My Only One,Sure glad I got to read it here and not see it on the show.
My Only One,They sure mined a lot of PR points out of that single episode. For the number of articles about it you'd think he was costar of the whole damn production.
My Only One,Isn’t that a spoiler in the title of the post?
My Only One,"Iv been on the fence about watching this, should i start it?"
My Only One,"final episode....he pops up in the last 30 seconds and says ""I hear you're a pretty good lawyer.....my friend matt Murdoch needs your help"""
My Only One,That’s fine with me. At least Charlie is reprising the roll. That’s all the matters to me.
My Only One,Slightly related question — can I watch Daredevil season 3 without having to watch The Defenders?
My Only One,"By confirmed they mean ""we have interpreted this single sentence from an interview"" They could be right but it is very much an assumption on their part."
My Only One,"it's like this dude is stuck in perpetual cameo.

bring murdock and fisk back their series already."
My Only One,Show she hulk is all about cameos???
My Only One,But Matt Murdock is in 5.
My Only One,"Am I the only one who hates articles like this?

I didn’t wanna know he shows up in the show until he actually shows up."
My Only One,It's treason then
My Only One,Daredevil is only in one episode. That doesn't specify anything about the multi-episode arc where Jennifer has to argue against Matt in court.
My Only One,"There's definitely a lot of hate for this show for some understandable reasons, but I really like the episodic format here. This is the only Disney+ mcu series other than wandavision that makes sense as a series rather than just feeling like a movie that got cut up into a series"
My Only One,"Holy crap, can we just wait and watch. 

Things were so much better when we could actually be surprised."
My Only One,"More Cox is always a good thing. In fact, we must have more Cox."
My Only One,no reason for season 2
My Only One,Well that was a fucking lie
My Only One,"😭 this is devastating news to me. With how the showrunners had gotten my hopes up in pre-release. They all talked about how they used Matt a lot and were surprised they were allowed to do so etc

One episode hardly seems like using him a lot"
My Only One,Any TV blog that hasn't written something about She Hulk yet? Their PR team is really putting it out there. Getting everyone involved.
My Only One,Can we get Charlie Cox's daredevil back for the love of Jesus.
My Only One,"She hulk as to be one of the least interesting, poorly written super hero shows ever and that's saying A LOT."
My Only One,"Makes sense. It's her show, he's there to remind people Daredevil's now in the MCU and they work for rival law firms."
My Only One,upsetting :(
My Only One,I’ll watch the cameo on youtube. Not wasting my time with that abomination of a show
My Only One,Anybody else tired of hearing about she-hulk?
My Only One,"Oh weird, on the IMDB it says 5 episodes. Must be constant flashbacks to his one appearance.

Edit: lol why downvote this, I'm not imdb *the person,* I'm just saying what it said yesterday."
My Only One,You know the show is underperforming when the marketed highlight is a *guest appearance from a character of a different show*.
My Only One,Then it's the only episode I'll watch
My Only One,But how many episodes is Matt Murdock in?
My Only One,Hopefully he’ll make it out unscathed and not emasculated but I wouldn’t bet on it
My Only One,"I haven't even watched the episode yet, way to spoil shit. Regardless of whether he's only in one episode or whether there's suspense of him showing up again in another episode. 

Just literally no reason to confirm or deny something like this mid season."
My Only One,Good. I thought I had to start watching that show for a minute.
My Only One,That show is terrible…my wife and I made it ten minutes before turning it off.
My Only One,But do they SMAAASH?
My Only One,Can’t wait to see how the show will ruin his character.
My Only One,All the cameos and costars in the world can't save this turd.
My Only One,Why spoilers in the title? 🙁
My Only One,They overhyped it because they knew interest in this show was relatively low compared to the others. I’ve watched for the cameos so far but they’ve all been disappointing for me. I really just don’t like the tone of the show but that’s fine.
My Only One,The only episode worth watching
My Only One,I'm still raging about episode 4 ruining the Sporanos for me and now I get hit with this too.
My Only One,Are people watching this dumpster fire still?
My Only One,Theyll ruin him
My Only One,"Show is so terrible, he could have his own episode that revolves around Daredevil and I still don’t think I could go back to it. Even the CGI is shit and that’s Disney’s thing."
My Only One,oh nonononono
My Only One,"Dam
Rumors were for him to be in more episodes 

Kinda sucks"
My Only One,Boooo
My Only One,I bet he’ll only appear for a one liner at the end of an episode so they can get viewers up for the week and break the fourth wall again to talk shit to the “toxic fans” lol
My Only One,This show sounds pretty terrible. People are either just bored or they have horrible taste to be raving about this show 🤷
My Only One,"Thank god. They can only do so much damage in one episode, right?"
My Only One,Thanks for the fucking spoiler OP....
My Only One,That’s plenty of time to butcher his character
My Only One,The show is so bad that they’re doing all this to get a little hype smh mcu is dead
My Only One,Serious question why do people demand to know this info? Isn't it a spoiler to know theres no follow up? To know limitations?
My Only One,Watch him be ruined in a manner of seconds.
My Only One,Lame. Lame. 🥹
My Only One,But is that enough time to deconstruct him? 🤔
My Only One,Thank Christ himself. I can’t imagine the damage this slog of a show is already gonna do in the 5 minutes of screen time they give him.
My Only One,I can say i am in an episode too. Cause no one will ever watch it to find out if its true or not
My Only One,[Single Female Lawyer! Fighting for her client! Wearing sexy miniskirts and being self reliant.](https://youtu.be/VKiHx53WR08)
My Only One,"It'll be okay, he's got his own show again soon anyway"
My Only One,I’m trying my best to ignore cgi complaints and enjoy the show but I can’t help but feel like she-hulk is an grown up version of titan go - a lot to do about nothing in a short period of time. I’ve completely forgotten what the main arc was or what they’re trying to build up on
My Only One,Maybe they wont have time to destroy the character from the best Marvel tv show ever.
My Only One,"Well dam that's a spoiler, it would have come as a huge surprise seeing him randomly in the show. Really disappointing tbh."
My Only One,At least it's only one episode. Less time for the show writers to ruin his character.
My Only One,"Man it’s seems that Disney is really going to waste daredevil, huh?"
My Only One,"Oh so absolutely 0 reason to watch the show then? Beautiful! Thank you for letting me know and saving my sweet, disapating time."
My Only One,"Give this man a movie!!!
Bring back Dewey and Karen!"
My Only One,He must know he’s not Wong.
My Only One,Do they bang?
My Only One,"Lazy. Carol Burnett was in like 3 times that many episodes of BCS. And she's like 80.

Are you telling me you can't work as hard as an 80 year old lady, Chaz? Really breaking the illusion, man."
My Only One,The incel energy is strong in here lol.
My Only One,"Man this shows is really using cameos to carry it lol, though I’m not complaining - abomination, Wong, and daredevil are all stronger characters than she hulk so far 😂"
My Only One,"I like the show!

It doesn't try to be anything other than what it is"
My Only One,"why you spoiling shit on this pleasant sunday morning, spoiler mcspoilman"
My Only One,[removed]
My Only One,cool spoiler
My Only One,"Makes sense, lawyers don't make friends with each other"
My Only One,#bringbackdaredevil
My Only One,Since she likes to break the 4th wall and has mentioned cameos in the last one I wonder what she'll say to us when Dare-fkn-Devil shows up!
My Only One,imagine being an adult and watching this
My Only One,Thanks for the spoiler
My Only One,Then I’ll watch that one ep.
My Only One,Yet he is credited on imdb for playing Matt Murdock in five episodes.
My Only One,"Good, She Hulk sucks ass. Would be happier if it would just ruin its own show and not other franchises."
My Only One,"Best bet would be to can the less than impressive (and that's being generous) She Hulk and greenlight more DareDevil, that is if they want some better ratings!"
My Only One,"lol.

Can someone just DM me when it's his episode? I can't stand this show. I just want to see DD."
My Only One,"Makes sense, they should actually team up more often which you would expect."
My Only One,Aw
My Only One,:(
My Only One,Makes sense. Matt Murdock probably isn't licensed to practice in law in California anyway.
My Only One,Could be in 2. He says with her in 1 307.9:3.
My Only One,Buttf*ck!!!!!!!
My Only One,Okay but how many episodes is Matt Murdock in?
My Only One,But he IS in one!!
My Only One,Sounds like a trick!
My Only One,BUT LAST ARTICLE TOLD ME TWO
My Only One,"Hell yea! Super glad they kept him! Daredevil was such a good show, really disappointing when Netflix cancelled it"
Find Me in Your Memory,"Murray Bartlett is quickly turning in to one of my favourite tv actors. What a huge transformation from his white lotus role. Amazing work. Nick Offerman, as usual, is an absolute god damn treasure."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Phenomenal. The reveal of Bill as a prepper with a Fleetwood Mac blues song is one of my favorite character reveals of all time. The whole episode is much different from the game obviously but this is how you tell a story. It’s so fucking beautiful. I’m almost mad I ruined it for myself because when Frank was talking about his plans for his last day, I said if I were Bill I’d just kill myself too. So it softened the blow but doesn’t take away from how incredible that whole hour was"
Find Me in Your Memory,🍓
Find Me in Your Memory,"Although I really missed the banter between Bill and Ellie from the game, I was amazed at how they created that entire backstory for Frank and Bill just from the letter they found with his body in the game. I watched this episode twice and then followed it up listening to the HBO podcast.   
The writing on this show is amazing and I hope other video game adaptions follow suit."
Find Me in Your Memory,"For those interested in how Frank and Bill's story played out in the game:  
  
>!Bill's alive when Joel and Ellie arrive, but Frank has left. Bill tells Joel that he used to take care of someone, but not anymore, says it only would have gotten him killed. You pick up hints throughout the level that Frank got tired of surviving without actually living and left. Bill never softened up like he did in the show, and he and Ellie but heads a lot. Bill warns Joel that Ellie will probably get him killed, but eventually acknowledges she can handle herself.!<  
  
>!After escaping some infected, they find Frank's body hanging by a noose in a building with a suicide note. Frank got bit soon after leaving Bill. He says in the note that Bill was right that he couldn't take care of himself, but he was still glad to be gone because he always hated Bill's guts. Bill is obviously saddened by this but doesn't want to admit it. As Joel and Ellie leave, Bill asks Joel if they're square, and when he says yes, Bill says ""Now get the fuck out of my town.!<  
  
[Frank's note.](https://i.imgur.com/W5b39xF.png)"
Find Me in Your Memory,Ron Swanson gets to be Ron Swanson in a completely unrelated show. You couldn’t ask for a better casting role. “You new world order bastards.”
Find Me in Your Memory,"It was definitely a divergence from the source material but this was SO much better. That part of the game works fine in the game, but this was an really excellent way to adapt the source material. Though I kept being worried Bill was gonna not grant Frank his wish and he was gonna take off and do it himself (somehow). It wasn't until he downed that glass of wine that I was able to relax a bit.

Also, as a gay man, though it's becoming more common, it's still rare to see great gay love in media that isn't just trauma porn. This could easily have become trauma porn... but it wasn't? Tragic, but also very sweet. And seeing two men grow old together is even MORE rare. It was all just really nice to see and I like how they tied it into Joel's feelings for Tess.

EDIT: Just editing my comment about trauma porn to make it clear I'm saying this episode was not that, since I can see how it might've been vague."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Without any spoilers.

I am assuming the episode is lower rated because of review bombing due to certain relationships being presented with Bill? And not that the episode itself is actually bad?

If I go now on Imdb it has a 8.4 out of 10. There are 5,642.. 1 STAR reviews. The 1 star reviews make up 20% of the overall reviews. There were 1 star reviews for the first 2 eps, but they made up less than 1% of the overall reviews.

Which, leads me to believe that this is just a bunch of homopbhobic people lashing out about the episode."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Finally a network not afraid to give us the hot, gay Nick Offerman sex scenes we all have always wanted."
Find Me in Your Memory,"This is why all that talk of adaptations needing to stick to the source is not entirely correct.

You just need good writers that respect the source, don't have to follow it 100%.

Also very good to know that Craig Maizin can write some good old ""classic"" drama. He's not just an ""end of the world"" expert."
Find Me in Your Memory,It’s refreshing for apocalypse show to talk about how important love is to survival. Usually they go into just kill and betrayal so much but never much into why it’s worth to fight to survive
Find Me in Your Memory,"My daughter played the game. I knew nothing about it, but watched with her because she seemed very excited and I was curious. I’m glad I did. Same as the game or not, that episode was incredible."
Find Me in Your Memory,Two amazing performances in this episode. Wow. I was mesmerized the entire 80 minutes.
Find Me in Your Memory,"I woke up this morning and decided to rewatch it while I did my morning jog on the treadmill. Went ""It won't be as sad the 2nd time, I got this.""

Did you guys know jogging is extra difficult when you're crying?"
Find Me in Your Memory,"This has to be one of the best cases of how deviating from the source material can make the new medium better. I played the game, I knew Bill, but I did **not** expect this whatsoever. But it's so good, it makes perfect sense for television.

Also, Andor has now gotten mentioned numerous times in this thread, it's on my list but it seems like I need to watch it ASAP!"
Find Me in Your Memory,"Oh my God, I started crying as soon as Frank stated what he wanted for his last day!"
Find Me in Your Memory,"""I like you old. Getting older means we're still here.""

Hits a lot harder when you realize that these two men lived through the AIDS epidemic, too."
Find Me in Your Memory,"You NEVER see movies or TV shows where gay men grow old together. Let alone in a big budget entry in a massive genre IP.

It's usually two hot bisexual women played by two straight actresses one of whom dies two episodes in to make the other one sad."
Find Me in Your Memory,"It felt to me like a strong episode of The Leftovers, and I can't give a show a higher compliment than that"
Find Me in Your Memory,Anybody who liked this episode would probably get a lot out of watching the series Station Eleven.
Find Me in Your Memory,"I think this is going to be the episode people mention when talking about the show. LOST had ""The Constant,"" The Leftovers had ""International Assassin,"" and TLOU is going to have ""Long, Long Time."""
Find Me in Your Memory,"What's hilarious to me are the people who dislike it saying ""it didn't move the story forward!"" as if the Bill's Town section of the game wasn't just mostly a character development filler arc to get a car, all of which was accomplished in the first and last 20 minutes"
Find Me in Your Memory,Cried my damned eyes out. Beautiful episode
Find Me in Your Memory,"Honestly I think we can start to move past judging this show as just a ""Game to show adaptation"". It's absolute top tier television, period."
Find Me in Your Memory,I wonder if the “jackboot fucks” line was an intentional callback to Nick’s role in Fargo
Find Me in Your Memory,"I really like the different directions the show has gone from the game. The expanded back stories of smaller characters, the early days of the fungus, etc. A shot for a shot TV show wouldn't add anything, IMO the whole point of recreating a story in a new medium is to add to it or portray it in a way they the other medium could not. Frankly, I don't know what you could do differently in a TV show from a game, they're both visual and the game of course has cutscenes, so expanding the world is an awesome way to differentiate the show from the game and make it worth watching."
Find Me in Your Memory,"I really thought it would be one of those overhyped/overrated episodes but it was more special than I expected. It feels like 3 maybe even seasons worth of what Walking Dead is trying(but failed) to tell. If Euphoria can win acting awards for hype alone, then this one deserve it even more."
Find Me in Your Memory,"It was a great episode. Great setup of the theme of finding purpose in a world so utterly hopeless and bleak, which we get to observe now in Joel and Ellie's story."
Find Me in Your Memory,Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett absolutely deserve award nominations for their performances in that episode. Beautiful!
Find Me in Your Memory,"I'd say there's been some equally good episodes in recent memory:

* **The season finale of Severance**; I've never felt that much tension watching a TV show. I'm not even as in love with the series as most people; I thought it was merely OK. But that last episode, man, is transcendently good.

* **House of the Dragon, episode S1:E8** The old King ascending the throne for the last time and the dinner party afterwards, in particular.

* Maybe a bit long in the tooth now, but that **third episode of Arcane** is still sticking with me. I used to play the game. I knew about the plot twist going in, and it still floored me.

With honorable mentions to the last episode of Better Call Saul, a few episodes of Attack on Titan, and For All Mankind in general. I feel like the Boys, Invincible, Andor, and maybe even the most recent episode of Vox Machina (S2:E6) should be in there as well.

And I bet a bunch of episodes of shows I don't watch. There's a lot of good television these days."
Find Me in Your Memory,"All I could think at the beginning was ""Uh oh Ron Swanson"" but Offerman turned it around and became emotional and tender. Needed this episode to show that love didn't die off with the end of civilization."
Find Me in Your Memory,"I didn't expect to cry half the episode. After Bill got shot and they showed Frank in a wheelchair I was holding back tears and got choked up a couple times because I thought I knew where it was going. I didn't expect a double suicide.

I cried more this episode than I did with Sarah's death in game and on the show, I didn't think that was possible."
Find Me in Your Memory,"45 year old man here. That scene with the rings brought me to tears. The games brought me to the show, but performances like this episode will keep me watching for sure."
Find Me in Your Memory,I love that Bill got a happy ending with Frank!
Find Me in Your Memory,I thought it was brilliant and on par with Andor's prisonbreak scene within the past year
Find Me in Your Memory,"Didn't expect it to be that good.   
It hits so hard when the episode ends too. Damnn!"
Find Me in Your Memory,I got Leftovers Season 3 vibes from this episode. That is a good thing. A very good thing.
Find Me in Your Memory,"almost brought me to tears when Ellie was reading the letter out, and i know nothing of the game /  story.

&#x200B;

masterfully written and acted. got to care for 2 old guys in the space of 45 mins more than you do for most character in an entire series"
Find Me in Your Memory,I like how they changed up the way the relationship ends in the show than the way it played out in the game.  They made Bill likable!
Find Me in Your Memory,[removed]
Find Me in Your Memory,"Absolutely amazing episode. The acting, the music, my tears. So much heart in one episode."
Find Me in Your Memory,Would i enjoy this knowing nothing about the game?
Find Me in Your Memory,"The episode was amazing for san many reasons, with the portrayal of Bill and Frank's love obviously being the frontrunner, but one of the things I don't see is how it breaks so many rules in the postapocalyptic genre we have now. As soon as we meet Bill, it's made very clear that he has nothing to offer. Frank knows, seemingly, just about everything in the damn world and when Bill gets a chance to show off as the heart to counter Frank's mind at the piano, we see that Frank's emotions run about a mile deep too. Now, the two tenants in play for the genre are 1. It's about what you have to bring to the table, and 2. If you haven't suffered to the point of breaking and becoming something new, you're not done suffering. The whole episode I was waiting for Frank to train Bill, or Bill having to take up the survivor mantle after Frank dies, or at the very least for the uneven power dynamic to come into play since Bill can't pull his weight. Surprisingly, it was none of that, and I think it showed the bravery of Bill and Frank to not stop hoping they could live the lives they want, without reservations, and the bravery of the show to say ""They deserve love because they want it. And that's the only reason they survive as well as they do."""
Find Me in Your Memory,I could not stop crying. So beautiful
Find Me in Your Memory,"Fantastic episode and academy award level acting. 

A wonderful, touching description of diverse, different gay men - Neither falling into cliches and caricature of gay men which is the Hollywood standard.


Bravo. 👏 Bravo!"
Find Me in Your Memory,"I haven't seen a realistic depiction of masculine gay love in any form of media worth watching in I don't know how long. I'm a straight, married, cisgender father and this episode not only made me tear up, but made me have so much more appreciation for Nick Offerman than I have had for any actor in the last decade. Amazing performance, writing, and directing. 

If this doesn't win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance , or a Golden Globe, everything is wrong with both bodies."
Find Me in Your Memory,"They made it a bottle episode. Compare to TNG's ""Inner Light"", The Magician's ""A Life In The Day,"" or Adventure Time's ""Puhoy.""  They're all tearjerkers."
Find Me in Your Memory,I didn’t expect such a beautiful love story in a show about surviving in a post apocalyptic world filled with fungus zombies. They were both brilliant  and there was so much chemistry between them!
Find Me in Your Memory,"Everyone: Episode three of this show will blow your socks off


Me: Oh there's probably shitloads of zombies and shooting and explosions


TLOU: *Hehehehehe*"
Find Me in Your Memory,"Wow it's almost like if you follow the script of the game and add to it but don't take way from it then it becomes an amazing tv series. 


Holy shit who knew."
Find Me in Your Memory,"I didn’t get to see the episode until last night, unfortunately on Sunday night I saw a couple of reactions to the show online that slightly spoiled the episode for me which was a bummer. But even with that I still cried. Very emotional episode and really well written. Experiencing a relationship from start to finish that sparks and ends during what is essentially the end of the world felt pretty unique and was handled so tenderly."
Find Me in Your Memory,"As a gay guy, I enjoyed seeing a gay relationship on a show that is *not* a queer show. Usually when i see a gay male couple, its often in a show directed toward a queer audience. I was really glad to see such an authentic depiction of gay romance without being a satire, or part of a punchline. Perfectly done."
Find Me in Your Memory,I watched this last night and my partner and I can’t stop talking about it. Was one of the best I’ve seen in a long time.
Find Me in Your Memory,Lots of butthurt dudes in threads popping up around Facebook
Find Me in Your Memory,"Oh good, this wasn't bleak enough without me being sad for dead gay Ron Swanson.

*sigh*

Amazing episode, 10/10. Only real problem I have with it is it feels *real* early in the series for a kind of a break from the main cast, especially since they haven't had a lot of time to develop the Joel/Ellie relationship. I feel like this would have fit better as an EP5-6 but I'm getting from the other replies that this was a super early game character and they kind of had a ""window"" to do anything about it. Still works, just not where I'd put it if I could get away with it."
Find Me in Your Memory,I need to go back and rewatch it from a different perspective.  I just finished playing the chapter with Bill in the game and enjoyed it so much I was looking forward to that Bill in the show.  I was disappointed in the representation of him as his game persona was still ingrained.  I’m sure I will enjoy it much more if I’m not expecting the video game character.
Find Me in Your Memory,Yupppppppp.
Find Me in Your Memory,"Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' was the violin song if anyone was wondering. Also featured in Shutter Island and Arrival. 

Such a goddamn slapper of a depressing tune lol."
Find Me in Your Memory,[removed]
Find Me in Your Memory,"Why was Bill standing in the middle of the street with a sniper rifle shooting at them instead of behind cover, what did that scene serve?"
Find Me in Your Memory,"I balled my eyes out. and I said the same thing to my wife. For me, It was on par with the San Junipero episode of black mirror."
Find Me in Your Memory,it was good but this is silly
Find Me in Your Memory,"I’m sorry but y’all say this every time something good comes out. Y’all said the same about mando , said the same thing about bcs. Can we please go back to using realistic measures not everything is “one of the greatest tv episodes in recent memory”"
Find Me in Your Memory,"I wonder if the writing went this route for a secondary reason as well.  The writers had a difficult decision.  I'm sure they started off with the concept of Bill from the game and I was really looking forward to this portrayal.  The problem is the more back story you create, the more unlikeable ellie's relationship with Bill becomes.  As the show runners want Joel to gradually like her and become her protector, they also want the viewers to do the same.  It can be a struggle to get viewers to like precocious young girls.  There was no need to make it harder.

>!If Bill is alive when Joel/ellie arrive, her comments to a grief stricken and broken man would take her character backwards.  Stealing items from him and making fun of his gay porn might make viewers hate her.  Bill allowing Frank to change the town’s vision was the only real change.  The rest of the episode was the alternate universe result of that decision.  In both the game and the TV show,  Joel has a decision point as well.  He can wallow in the past or move forward  !<

Both universes exist and they are the ideal result in their individual worlds.  I wonder if those who hate the episode are missing the point of both stories."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Stop using ""subvert our expectations"" as a catch-all term for offshoot storytelling/world-building."
Find Me in Your Memory,"It was such a brilliant episode and fantastic alternative to the story we already know, the only thing I'm sad about is that we didnt get to see bill and ellie's banter."
Find Me in Your Memory,Exactly my thoughts. It's been a long time since something hit me this hard.
Find Me in Your Memory,"Oh, need to tune in soon on this one.🫢"
Find Me in Your Memory,"It was good. Felt a bit overly familiar though, especially with that Max Richter music which is so overused."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Had me tearing up, very rare occurrence. Bravo."
Find Me in Your Memory,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKAtM9xS-fA&ab\_channel=ConCherry
Find Me in Your Memory,They took a hard left with Ron Swanson lol
Find Me in Your Memory,Absolute masterpiece of an episode
Find Me in Your Memory,That was a masterpiece. Watched it again and find it even more beautiful. 10/10
Find Me in Your Memory,"It's been a few years since we've gotten a great ""watercooler"" show. We live in a golden age of television, but this is special in my opinion."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Honestly, Last of Us is weird, because I enjoy the show a lot, but I have so much less interest in Joel and Ellie than in the prequel sequences."
Find Me in Your Memory,"I hope this means we'll also get an episode following Ish, whether it be in this season or Season 2. I don't think we ever find out what happened to him in the game, but I remember going out of my way to try and find all of the notes, so it would be really to see his story played out."
Find Me in Your Memory,It was a very welcome deviant from the game story with how the expanded on and changed the outcome for Bill and Franks story. Though Andor prison episode is still up there for greatest episode in recent memory for me lol.
Find Me in Your Memory,This episode made me cry😂😂 I haven’t cried in years!?
Find Me in Your Memory,Well said & beautifully expressed…. Totally agree….
Find Me in Your Memory,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Find Me in Your Memory,Totally agree! This episodic was touching and so well done.
Find Me in Your Memory,I’m just blown away how good this show is.
Find Me in Your Memory,"That was an outstanding bit of writing, directing and acting."
Find Me in Your Memory,"thought it was a really great episode of TV. would I have liked to see the set pieces from Bill’s level played out in live action? Hell yeah i wanted to see Pedro hanging upside down headshotting infected. But that isn’t what the creators of the show are trying to do. They’re doing something different and it really works. Besides, I can always just play the game if i want to experience that!"
Find Me in Your Memory,Yes it was
Find Me in Your Memory,I just watched S1 White Lotus and had no idea that was Armond in that hole!
Find Me in Your Memory,This is the most beautiful and moving episode of tv I’ve ever seen. It reminded me a lot of The Magicians episode A Life in a Day.
Find Me in Your Memory,"This episode turned me into a crying, snotty mess. It hit really hard."
Find Me in Your Memory,Definitely my favorite episode so far
Find Me in Your Memory,There was a personal reveal on watchmen that was better IMO. But yeah this was damn good.
Find Me in Your Memory,"great ep, craig mazin should make all the game adaptations"
Find Me in Your Memory,I don't think iv cried like that in a TV show on years. Unexpectedly touching
Find Me in Your Memory,"It was great, even made my eyes misty at times, but no it's not one of the greatest TV episodes it recent memory.

People need to chill out with their tlou hyperboles lol"
Find Me in Your Memory,"I was sat in my front room at 6am crying like a baby.  I'm 47 years of age.

&#x200B;

It was one of THE great episodes of television."
Find Me in Your Memory,"Disclosure, I didn't play the games

I thought the episode was pretty good but IMO it is a little too self contained that I felt like the writers went out of their way to make me feel sad and emotional with no payoff or relevance to the overall story. I would have liked if Bill somehow continued to live on and ran into Joel and Ellie and Joel got to see/learn from a person who managed to find love and joy in such a bleak world. That's my only criticism of it though, the episode was very well made and memorable."
Find Me in Your Memory,Sobbed. Ugly sobbed. What an episode.
Find Me in Your Memory,"Another week, another post about the greatest episode of TV in recent memory.   I think people around here have no long term memory."
Find Me in Your Memory,Meh
Find Me in Your Memory,"Never played the game (or really any other game besides like pac man and tetris); i’ve never owned a video game system. Don’t recall ever having seen a video game adaptation, but i’ve been watching Last of Us and enjoying it.

Last night’s episode was gripping and emotional; i just loved it."

And I bet a bunch of episodes of shows I don't watch. There's a lot of good television these days."
The Desire,"All I could think at the beginning was ""Uh oh Ron Swanson"" but Offerman turned it around and became emotional and tender. Needed this episode to show that love didn't die off with the end of civilization."
The Desire,"I didn't expect to cry half the episode. After Bill got shot and they showed Frank in a wheelchair I was holding back tears and got choked up a couple times because I thought I knew where it was going. I didn't expect a double suicide.

I cried more this episode than I did with Sarah's death in game and on the show, I didn't think that was possible."
The Desire,"45 year old man here. That scene with the rings brought me to tears. The games brought me to the show, but performances like this episode will keep me watching for sure."
The Desire,I love that Bill got a happy ending with Frank!
The Desire,I thought it was brilliant and on par with Andor's prisonbreak scene within the past year
The Desire,"Didn't expect it to be that good.   
It hits so hard when the episode ends too. Damnn!"
The Desire,I got Leftovers Season 3 vibes from this episode. That is a good thing. A very good thing.
The Desire,"almost brought me to tears when Ellie was reading the letter out, and i know nothing of the game /  story.

&#x200B;

masterfully written and acted. got to care for 2 old guys in the space of 45 mins more than you do for most character in an entire series"
The Desire,I like how they changed up the way the relationship ends in the show than the way it played out in the game.  They made Bill likable!
The Desire,[removed]
The Desire,"Absolutely amazing episode. The acting, the music, my tears. So much heart in one episode."
The Desire,Would i enjoy this knowing nothing about the game?
The Desire,"The episode was amazing for san many reasons, with the portrayal of Bill and Frank's love obviously being the frontrunner, but one of the things I don't see is how it breaks so many rules in the postapocalyptic genre we have now. As soon as we meet Bill, it's made very clear that he has nothing to offer. Frank knows, seemingly, just about everything in the damn world and when Bill gets a chance to show off as the heart to counter Frank's mind at the piano, we see that Frank's emotions run about a mile deep too. Now, the two tenants in play for the genre are 1. It's about what you have to bring to the table, and 2. If you haven't suffered to the point of breaking and becoming something new, you're not done suffering. The whole episode I was waiting for Frank to train Bill, or Bill having to take up the survivor mantle after Frank dies, or at the very least for the uneven power dynamic to come into play since Bill can't pull his weight. Surprisingly, it was none of that, and I think it showed the bravery of Bill and Frank to not stop hoping they could live the lives they want, without reservations, and the bravery of the show to say ""They deserve love because they want it. And that's the only reason they survive as well as they do."""
The Desire,I could not stop crying. So beautiful
The Desire,"Fantastic episode and academy award level acting. 

A wonderful, touching description of diverse, different gay men - Neither falling into cliches and caricature of gay men which is the Hollywood standard.


Bravo. 👏 Bravo!"
The Desire,"I haven't seen a realistic depiction of masculine gay love in any form of media worth watching in I don't know how long. I'm a straight, married, cisgender father and this episode not only made me tear up, but made me have so much more appreciation for Nick Offerman than I have had for any actor in the last decade. Amazing performance, writing, and directing. 

If this doesn't win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance , or a Golden Globe, everything is wrong with both bodies."
The Desire,"They made it a bottle episode. Compare to TNG's ""Inner Light"", The Magician's ""A Life In The Day,"" or Adventure Time's ""Puhoy.""  They're all tearjerkers."
The Desire,I didn’t expect such a beautiful love story in a show about surviving in a post apocalyptic world filled with fungus zombies. They were both brilliant  and there was so much chemistry between them!
The Desire,"Everyone: Episode three of this show will blow your socks off


Me: Oh there's probably shitloads of zombies and shooting and explosions


TLOU: *Hehehehehe*"
The Desire,"Wow it's almost like if you follow the script of the game and add to it but don't take way from it then it becomes an amazing tv series. 


Holy shit who knew."
The Desire,"I didn’t get to see the episode until last night, unfortunately on Sunday night I saw a couple of reactions to the show online that slightly spoiled the episode for me which was a bummer. But even with that I still cried. Very emotional episode and really well written. Experiencing a relationship from start to finish that sparks and ends during what is essentially the end of the world felt pretty unique and was handled so tenderly."
The Desire,"As a gay guy, I enjoyed seeing a gay relationship on a show that is *not* a queer show. Usually when i see a gay male couple, its often in a show directed toward a queer audience. I was really glad to see such an authentic depiction of gay romance without being a satire, or part of a punchline. Perfectly done."
The Desire,I watched this last night and my partner and I can’t stop talking about it. Was one of the best I’ve seen in a long time.
The Desire,Lots of butthurt dudes in threads popping up around Facebook
The Desire,"Oh good, this wasn't bleak enough without me being sad for dead gay Ron Swanson.

*sigh*

Amazing episode, 10/10. Only real problem I have with it is it feels *real* early in the series for a kind of a break from the main cast, especially since they haven't had a lot of time to develop the Joel/Ellie relationship. I feel like this would have fit better as an EP5-6 but I'm getting from the other replies that this was a super early game character and they kind of had a ""window"" to do anything about it. Still works, just not where I'd put it if I could get away with it."
The Desire,I need to go back and rewatch it from a different perspective.  I just finished playing the chapter with Bill in the game and enjoyed it so much I was looking forward to that Bill in the show.  I was disappointed in the representation of him as his game persona was still ingrained.  I’m sure I will enjoy it much more if I’m not expecting the video game character.
The Desire,Yupppppppp.
The Desire,"Max Richter's 'On the Nature of Daylight' was the violin song if anyone was wondering. Also featured in Shutter Island and Arrival. 

Such a goddamn slapper of a depressing tune lol."
The Desire,[removed]
The Desire,"Why was Bill standing in the middle of the street with a sniper rifle shooting at them instead of behind cover, what did that scene serve?"
The Desire,"I balled my eyes out. and I said the same thing to my wife. For me, It was on par with the San Junipero episode of black mirror."
The Desire,it was good but this is silly
The Desire,"I’m sorry but y’all say this every time something good comes out. Y’all said the same about mando , said the same thing about bcs. Can we please go back to using realistic measures not everything is “one of the greatest tv episodes in recent memory”"
The Desire,"I wonder if the writing went this route for a secondary reason as well.  The writers had a difficult decision.  I'm sure they started off with the concept of Bill from the game and I was really looking forward to this portrayal.  The problem is the more back story you create, the more unlikeable ellie's relationship with Bill becomes.  As the show runners want Joel to gradually like her and become her protector, they also want the viewers to do the same.  It can be a struggle to get viewers to like precocious young girls.  There was no need to make it harder.

>!If Bill is alive when Joel/ellie arrive, her comments to a grief stricken and broken man would take her character backwards.  Stealing items from him and making fun of his gay porn might make viewers hate her.  Bill allowing Frank to change the town’s vision was the only real change.  The rest of the episode was the alternate universe result of that decision.  In both the game and the TV show,  Joel has a decision point as well.  He can wallow in the past or move forward  !<

Both universes exist and they are the ideal result in their individual worlds.  I wonder if those who hate the episode are missing the point of both stories."
The Desire,"Stop using ""subvert our expectations"" as a catch-all term for offshoot storytelling/world-building."
The Desire,"It was such a brilliant episode and fantastic alternative to the story we already know, the only thing I'm sad about is that we didnt get to see bill and ellie's banter."
The Desire,Exactly my thoughts. It's been a long time since something hit me this hard.
The Desire,"Oh, need to tune in soon on this one.🫢"
The Desire,"It was good. Felt a bit overly familiar though, especially with that Max Richter music which is so overused."
The Desire,"Had me tearing up, very rare occurrence. Bravo."
The Desire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKAtM9xS-fA&ab\_channel=ConCherry
The Desire,They took a hard left with Ron Swanson lol
The Desire,Absolute masterpiece of an episode
The Desire,That was a masterpiece. Watched it again and find it even more beautiful. 10/10
The Desire,"It's been a few years since we've gotten a great ""watercooler"" show. We live in a golden age of television, but this is special in my opinion."
The Desire,"Honestly, Last of Us is weird, because I enjoy the show a lot, but I have so much less interest in Joel and Ellie than in the prequel sequences."
The Desire,"I hope this means we'll also get an episode following Ish, whether it be in this season or Season 2. I don't think we ever find out what happened to him in the game, but I remember going out of my way to try and find all of the notes, so it would be really to see his story played out."
The Desire,It was a very welcome deviant from the game story with how the expanded on and changed the outcome for Bill and Franks story. Though Andor prison episode is still up there for greatest episode in recent memory for me lol.
The Desire,This episode made me cry😂😂 I haven’t cried in years!?
The Desire,Well said & beautifully expressed…. Totally agree….
The Desire,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
The Desire,Totally agree! This episodic was touching and so well done.
The Desire,I’m just blown away how good this show is.
The Desire,"That was an outstanding bit of writing, directing and acting."
The Desire,"thought it was a really great episode of TV. would I have liked to see the set pieces from Bill’s level played out in live action? Hell yeah i wanted to see Pedro hanging upside down headshotting infected. But that isn’t what the creators of the show are trying to do. They’re doing something different and it really works. Besides, I can always just play the game if i want to experience that!"
The Desire,Yes it was
The Desire,I just watched S1 White Lotus and had no idea that was Armond in that hole!
The Desire,This is the most beautiful and moving episode of tv I’ve ever seen. It reminded me a lot of The Magicians episode A Life in a Day.
The Desire,"This episode turned me into a crying, snotty mess. It hit really hard."
The Desire,Definitely my favorite episode so far
The Desire,There was a personal reveal on watchmen that was better IMO. But yeah this was damn good.
The Desire,"great ep, craig mazin should make all the game adaptations"
The Desire,I don't think iv cried like that in a TV show on years. Unexpectedly touching
The Desire,"It was great, even made my eyes misty at times, but no it's not one of the greatest TV episodes it recent memory.

People need to chill out with their tlou hyperboles lol"
The Desire,"I was sat in my front room at 6am crying like a baby.  I'm 47 years of age.

&#x200B;

It was one of THE great episodes of television."
The Desire,"Disclosure, I didn't play the games

I thought the episode was pretty good but IMO it is a little too self contained that I felt like the writers went out of their way to make me feel sad and emotional with no payoff or relevance to the overall story. I would have liked if Bill somehow continued to live on and ran into Joel and Ellie and Joel got to see/learn from a person who managed to find love and joy in such a bleak world. That's my only criticism of it though, the episode was very well made and memorable."
The Desire,Sobbed. Ugly sobbed. What an episode.
The Desire,"Another week, another post about the greatest episode of TV in recent memory.   I think people around here have no long term memory."
The Desire,Meh
The Desire,"Never played the game (or really any other game besides like pac man and tetris); i’ve never owned a video game system. Don’t recall ever having seen a video game adaptation, but i’ve been watching Last of Us and enjoying it.

Last night’s episode was gripping and emotional; i just loved it."
Baptiste,"I love Gaiman’s design philosophy behind his version of Death. edit: he wrote Death to be the Death he wished to meet, “a death who is practical, a death who is sensible and above all a death who is kind.”"
Baptiste,[deleted]
Baptiste,"KHB has been stellar in multiple smaller parts over the last couple years, The Good Place, Barry, Veronica Mars, Infinity Train. Hope she lands a lead somewhere soon."
Baptiste,The episode Death played a central role in really stuck with me.
Baptiste,All of the Endless must be such fun to play as an actor
Baptiste,"I actually can't wait to see how they show Delight. She can take different forms. In comics, they showed that by having her drawn in different styles all the time."
Baptiste,"Death, Lucifer, Dream, John Dee and The Corinthian all are so insanely well acted and well cast it's scary how accurate they portray the characters."
Baptiste,"The performance of Rhea Seehorn on the last BCS episode Waterworks destroys any other performance this week, well this year!"
Baptiste,"All the Endless actors have been great. Dream, Death, Desire, they all killed it."
Baptiste,"When she picked up the little baby.... 

I'm afraid that's all your going to get...."
Baptiste,"For me the scene that illustrated her masterful skill was the baby. For all the genial aplomb she shows to most of her ""clients"" the baby really hurt her and you could see it without any outward demonstration of grief. I kind of wish she and Unity had a scene together in the final episode but given the level of unrealness they were dealing with at that point putting her in the scene probably would have been muddled and weird."
Baptiste,"Honorable Mentions:

* Li Jun Li - Evil
* Aaron Paul & Aurora Perrineau - Westworld
* Carol Burnett - Better Call Saul"
Baptiste,Every time I see her name I think of her Australian accent
Baptiste,"She was so likeable that I was able to get over my extremely sensitive death-anxiety and literally enjoy watching death on the screen for... Like half the episode, then the panic set in and I had to switch to something a bit lighter.

Still great performance."
Baptiste,I truly just wish Dream had been given some black contacts so he would look a little less like a guy.
Baptiste,So is this show worth resubscribing to Netflix to watch?
Baptiste,"As a sad old goth who cried buckets over the comics over 20 years ago and idolised Death the character (I am a perkygoth), she nailed it. There’s a tenderness to her portrayal that I really loved."
Baptiste,"She is so captivatingly beautiful, physically and just her energy."
Baptiste,Her acting is great but I do wish they goth'd her up a bit more. I miss the curly mascara from the graphic novel.
Baptiste,Over the performance Rhea Seehorn gave this week?
Baptiste,"Neil's Death is to me THE version from any fiction. Don't laugh but my 2nd favorite is Death from Supernatural. He's not mean or nasty, but he sees everything else as not even worthy of his time or acknowledgement. He's so old things like a individual life mean nothing. Sort of a complete 180 of Gaiman's Death"
Baptiste,Paul Walter Hauser as Larry Hall should have at least got a shout out?! Wtf
Baptiste,"She was incredible. She embodied the role beautifully. She had all the charm, charisma and compassion that the comic character oozes. Really wonderful."
Baptiste,"I thought that she was excellent, though I do have one complaint. She nailed Death's kindness and compassion, but she lacked Death's quirkiness, which I missed. It could have been an attempt to make her less Manic Pixie Dreamgirl. It could have been considered to be too dated (who would understand supercalifragilisticexpialadocious in today's world?). This is just a personal issue though and a change that I *do* understand... I do think that Kirby Howell-Baptiste could have easily handled more quirky material. After all, it's her role in The Good Place that convinced me that she'd be a great Death."
Baptiste,"Episode 6 is just Dream reconnecting with his sister and old friend, and it might be my favorite of the season."
Baptiste,"Hard agree, I'm lukewarm on the series so far (context: at episode 8, never read the comics), but fuck me the whole Death part was *extremely* well acted, she felt so genuine and did an amazing performance, pulled me right into the show, and if there's not more of her in the last 3 episodes, the show is lesser for it"
Baptiste,I just wish they kept her single defining design trait. The goth make-up. Would a little eye liner and black lipstick have killed them? If it wasn't for the Ahnk she'd be completely unrecognizable as Death.
Baptiste,"She was good, I really liked her episode."
Baptiste,"I had no clue what this was and then I saw Neil Gaiman's name on it and first thing I did when I got home was watch it. It is really really good! Reading the comic now and it's very source accurate, at least as far as I am. 

Can't wait for season 2!"
Baptiste,"I just finished the series a few minutes ago. So often I felt as if it _were_ the comic (graphic novel, really,) because of the incredible visuals. As far as wonderful actors and their characters so far, obviously, Death, but equally the Corinthian, Lucifer, Fiddler’s Green, Lucienne, Unity Kincaid, Rose Walker, Gault, Hal … really, it’s everyone, isn’t it? And Morpheus, not to forget the King.  

This may be an unpopular opinion, but I thought the best single episode, the one that engaged me most, was Hob’s story. It was perfect, in part, I think, because there was no cliff hanger, no foreshadowing was necessary. It just seemed complete, not that I wouldn’t like to see Hob again. How wise might you or I become in 500 years?"
Baptiste,She played a major role in the best episode of a great series. And she was awesome as death
Baptiste,"I’m like 50/50 on her, growing up goth in the 90s I’ve seen enough Death cosplay. I’m surprised how accurate the dialogue was but came off hallow. Just would love to see her again but add more."
Baptiste,This episode made me cry
Baptiste,"Edit: wow thx for the downvotes. Remind me to never bring up technical issues in this sub ever again.


I loved her acting, she genuinely gave some wholesome feeling performances, and she/this episode left a lasting impact on me. I really like this show.


NOW, from a technical perspective, Sandman stands out from 90% of other TV shows because it's not *shot* like a normal television show, in fact it's basically shot like a movie, or closer to prestige TV. If you haven't noticed, they shoot Sandman primarily on anamorphic lenses (Lens type primarily used in movies), but the specific lens they use is kind of weird, and distracting, and I couldn't help but REALLY notice it in the pilot and this episode. 


Specifically, the vignetting in some shots is HORRIBLE (The edges/sides of your TV screen is darkened compared to the rest of the screen/center), and is very noticeable. This attribute can be very noticeable in some anamorphic lenses, and serves to be distracting for viewers. There also seems to be a ton of anamorphic distortion in some episodes, where you'll see characters ""squeezed"" appearing slimmer and taller. Not sure if they desqueezed the footage incorrectly (Which would make the cause of the strong vignetting in some shots make more sense), but it does not seem to be intentional or play any real roles which leads me to believe it's a mistake.

I'd would have loved it if the distortion, vignetting, and DoF were all really strong in The Dreaming, but normal on Earth, but it was all really random, and would vary from shot to shot. If anyone has anything else to add on this, it'd be much appreciated, because the only thing I can surmise from this is ametuerish mistakes (Which again is weird because EVERYTHING else about this show is soooo damn good.)."
Baptiste,"Can I say I find her to be a gorgeous woman? I think it's great that so many Black Brits and Asian actors got plenty roles in The Sandman. As a Black man, I think it's fantastic. Minorities are getting a lot of strong roles in the TV fantasy and sci-fi genres. As long as they're well written people shouldn't have any problem (ST: Discovery is a poor example). If they wanna shout ""WOKE"" who cares!"
Baptiste,"What I was hoping for was a similar feeling to when I first read this sequence between Dream and Death over 20 years ago.  A warmth. A rapidly developing sense of love and familiarity.  Like we've always known her.  I hope when my day comes I can simply sigh and say ""ok, let's go.""

Edit: left out that they totally. Fuckin. Nailed it! I wept during ""The Sound of Her Wings""."
Baptiste,"His death is so humane and decent. 

It’s the respect they show that makes me feel almost compassionate about this show."
Baptiste,"I also felt a lot of the footage of the ""Desire"" character was cut. He/she/they (?) had an amazing set and costume which was just wasted. In fact Death, Desire, Satan could have had their own shows easily...."
Baptiste,Best episode. Death spin-off please!
Baptiste,I think I'm the only one who didn't like her performance. I thought she was a misfit. Especially when they nailed characters like Desire.
Baptiste,"Look, this whole ‘woke’ thing is getting ridiculous. I’m a devoted fan of Neil Gaiman, and despite being white and English, he writes beautifully for a variety of nationalities. However, I started watching and discovered that Dream’s white male butler called lucien, is now a butch black female called Lucia. This cultural ‘box checking’ should be offensive to all. Remember how they made Do robots Dream of Electric Sheep into a movie (Blade Runner) and deckard was presented as an octogenarian Chinese woman, because to stick to the story would be racist? No, neither do I.

Why didn’t Betty White get the gig to play Shadow Moon in Gaiman’s American gods? Because Neil wrote that character as a thirty(?) year old African American! Stop fucking with canon just because it allows you to prove how ‘woke’ you are. If production companies want to make a difference, then get involved - seek out the next Spike Lee and fund the shit out of them. Stop messing with the classics just because it plays well in deferring attention from your wonky corporate culture. Before you aim for artificial ‘racial equality’ in your products, look inward and be sure racial and sexual inequality doesn’t exist within you company and your industry."
Baptiste,"My only issue with Kirby Howell-Baptiste portrayal of death is that after watching a Brand New Cherry Flavor, I thought Rosa Salazar would have made a great death.  He costumes in that show were very close to how Death dressed in the comic, and I am pretty sure there was a scene were she even had the neckless.

Besides the issue of fan casting Death before seeing the show, I thought she did a fine job.  She was a bit more somber than I remember her being in the comics, but I thought it worked."
Baptiste,"Definitely deserved. Like many of the casted members, she was perfect for her role."
Baptiste,"I’m surprised they didn’t sneak her into a second episode.

I wonder if Netflix might approve spin offs for Death: The High Cost of Living and The Time of Your Life?"
Baptiste,"I have been very disappointed in the show itself. Bland, slow and woke to the point of being ridiculous. Just my opinion. But I liked her interpretation of Death."
Baptiste,Waiting for that line about her turn off the lights and closing the door on the universe.
Baptiste,Fucking *loved* the series and how it was portrayed on Netflix. Salutes to them for not fucking it up!
Baptiste,She’s so freaking pretty
Baptiste,"Seriously the casting in this was phenomenal overall, but Death was especially good."
Baptiste,She was so good...her performance is to die for!
Baptiste,I hope im not the onlyone who think this was one of the best episodes of the show
Baptiste,None of the Endless in the Sandman show truly captured how they should be. They all just seemed like regular ass people.
Baptiste,My favorite episode.
Baptiste,She was barely in it though. One episode.
Baptiste,Her performance was fine but nothing special. Was there really no one better this week?
Baptiste,"She was amazing, fight me if you disagree"
Baptiste,She’s so foxy
Baptiste,She was wonderful and she’s also a legit 10 so that helps…
Baptiste,"Remember when all the “fans” of the comic freaked out because they cast a black woman in this role (ignoring that the Endless are canonically perceived differently by every person). 

Pepperidge farm remembers."
Baptiste,"I’ve seen so much criticism of the Sandman’s Death and Kirby’s performance and I don’t understand a bit of it. I found Death to be beautiful, sympathetic and the performance exquisite. She had me in literal tears on the subway and that’s not an easy thing to do"
Baptiste,"I remember when the news broke that she was cast and my first thought was of her smile in The Good Place, and I immediately said, “Yes, that’s the best choice!” Did not disappoint."
Baptiste,"Nope. TV Line confuses great writing with a great performance.   
In a week of standouts, three of which they even mentioned at the bottom of the article including Aaron Paul in WestWorld, this wasn't one of them."
Baptiste,"Yep, she is oh so charming and spot on in there! A no-kidding star of the outstanding series!"
Baptiste,Best episode. And she was fantastic.
Baptiste,"Her performance was excellent!! Death only had a brief appearance in this show, but she really made it count"
Baptiste,Her episode and performance was the peak of the season for me.  The rest of the eps were weaker.
Baptiste,"She’s awesome. She’s got the same spirit as the comics character, which, given how what we see can change depending on expectations, is all any of the show characters need. Great casting!"
Baptiste,If this website keeps fucking Rhea Seehorn over. We riot.
Baptiste,"Death was okay, would have been better with an Australian accent."
Baptiste,I just watched the episode where Dream hangs out with Death. It was laughable how cheery she was alongside Dream’s suffering emo act.
Baptiste,Her and the lady that played rose walker ran away with it. Would have liked to see male protagonist for Constantine and maybe tension w Dream but eh otherwise not a bad adaptation.
Baptiste,"Having lost a child, that scene can go fuck itself very hard. 
Otherwise a phenomenal performance. Eventually I'll be able to skip the rest of that scene and finish the series."
Baptiste,"I wasn’t sure how they were going to change her, but this woman was great and also she’s super hot."
Baptiste,Meh Lucifer and Death still feel out of place for comic fan. Mayb next season she starts to wear alt-culture stuff and behave like Death.
Baptiste,How is the show? Feel like I haven’t seen anything about it
Baptiste,she is stunning
Baptiste,"Performer of the week, so how many died?"
Baptiste,Is she hot asf? Yes. Is she crazy talented? Absolutely. Solid performances every time
Baptiste,"The only thing I didn't like about her version of Death in the show was the lack of twirly eyeliner. Otherwise, pretty much exactly how I imagined her."
Baptiste,Is that an angel?
Baptiste,Loved her as Simone
Baptiste,She has been killing it since yellowjackets.
Baptiste,Can't wait to see her doing Seasons of Mists
Baptiste,That episode absolutely floored me. So well performed.
Baptiste,She was okay.
Baptiste,Yeah the death episode made me cry like my eyes were hurting holding back tears idk I just look at death differently now that my father passed and I don’t believe in god or an afterlife. Let’s you appreciate the time you have with yourself and others more at least for me
Baptiste,Honestly it was the best ep. The whole episode was just perfect
Baptiste,"Me: ""Thanos fell in love with Death? That's ridiculous, even for comics.""

Me after watching Ep 6 of Sandman: ""Yup, that makes perfect sense."""
Baptiste,"Patton Oswalt's character is the jar jar Binks of this series and it's hurting it so, so badly. I can't stand him."
Baptiste,She was perfect!  So happy with her performance!
Baptiste,I absolutely loved their version of death. In all honesty it made me fear death less. I hope when my time comes it is a similar experience.
Baptiste,She is fantastic in the role. Great inspired casting.
Baptiste,Sandman deserves all the emmys this year
Baptiste,She’s wonderful in this role. The idea that death is warm and loving is revelatory. She’s a sublime actor.
Baptiste,"Love the character. But damn, she was definitely the worst acted one in the entire show. Stilted and soullessly read dialogue from a script.

Is this just a ploy to try counter all the criticism she got?"
Baptiste,"Yes. But the fan base are fans. And they like the source material because it's the source material they like. So if you do something else, you risk alienating the fans in a monumental scale. It's not Batman if he's now a news reporter in a yellow trenchcoat with a pet bat

- Neil Gaiman"
Baptiste,She’s hot
Baptiste,A bIt ToO pOlItIcAl.
Baptiste,"She was wonderful.  And great writing, too.

Edit:  Not to kvetch, but does anyone care to explain the downvotes?  Clearly people disagree with me, but why?  Was she not wonderful?  Did the writing suck?  Ehh?"
Baptiste,She slayed it. I love her now.
Summer of Rockets,Thanks for this! Also two of my fave actors!
Summer of Rockets,"This is the only time I’ve ever disliked Toby Stephens’ acting, and I’ve watched pretty much everything he’s been in."
Summer of Rockets,Poliakoff is great.
Summer of Rockets,"You seen Stephens in [The Tenant of Wildfell Hall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115387/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)?  
Hawes in the first two seasons of Spooks?"
Summer of Rockets,"You dislike the acting, or you dislike the character?

He's playing a very uptight russian who is desperate to appear as an ""english gentleman""  
I think he does it very well  
I especially like his accent work - where he is always striving for ""posh brit"", but bits of russian cadences leak through (especially under stress)

I must watch Perfect Strangers (2001) soon. (Same writer)"
Summer of Rockets,The studio politics surrounding this slow moving trainwreck must be fascinating.
Summer of Rockets,[everyone disliked that]
Summer of Rockets,"No one will ever top Trebek but Jennings is a naturally funny guy and he's grown into the role. He's already good and he'll be even better in a few years, this whole thing is fucking asinine."
Summer of Rockets,"Read the room, Jeopardy producers"
Summer of Rockets,God Ken is so much better at being charismatic and ad-libbing additional info on the fly. This makes no sense to me unless there's some unbreakable contracts in place.
Summer of Rockets,She waits waaaaaay to long to respond if the answer is correct or not. The look on the contestants face to knowing they got it right has to be obvious to the producers lol.
Summer of Rockets,"I’ll take “She’s boring as shit, for two thousand.”"
Summer of Rockets,BOOOOOO
Summer of Rockets,[removed]
Summer of Rockets,How can creators be so blind to fan demand?
Summer of Rockets,"""Gretchen, stop trying to make Mayim Bialik happen! She's never going to happen!"""
Summer of Rockets,Guess it won't be a Jeopardy summer for me
Summer of Rockets,Are they trying to kill the show off?
Summer of Rockets,"Its like Mayim has dirt on the producers, so she's blackmailing them into making her host more often than Ken."
Summer of Rockets,"I liked her as Blossom. But as host of Jeopardy she is stilted, awkward, unfunny, and forced."
Summer of Rockets,"Christ, why?"
Summer of Rockets,I hope he returns. He's the best of the two
Summer of Rockets,"I’ve watched growing up and I still watch every time I go visit my parents while eating dinner but we don’t watch a single episode that she hosts.

She’s truly ruining Jeopardy for us, and I’m sure a lot of other people feel the same. I refuse to support the show while she is the host.

Ken or nothing, and it seems they want nothing."
Summer of Rockets,"Does anyone like Mayim Bialik? I've never seen anyone compliment her appearances as host and the couple times I've caught snippets I really wasn't impressed, so I have to wonder what those producers are smoking."
Summer of Rockets,"lol everyone saying it was ""essentially confirmed"" that Mayim was only doing tournaments last time this got brought up on this sub. Nailed it."
Summer of Rockets,"With Ken they literally couldn't have built a better Jeopardy! host in a lab.  Why do they continue to force-feed us Mayim when she is pretty universally disliked and objectively subpar?  Oh, well, more free time for us during the summer months I guess."
Summer of Rockets,That is…………………………………….. horrible.
Summer of Rockets,BOOOOOOOOOO
Summer of Rockets,What the fuck. Why are they so insistent on shoving her down the viewers' throats when the viewers clearly don't want her?!
Summer of Rockets,"I enjoy Ken best, but I've heard he doesn't want to move his family from the Seattle area. So there needs to be another host since he can't host full time. I liked Buzzy when he hosted.  


I do not like Mayim since she admitted that she did not watch Jeopardy before she got the gig. She also does not do a good job hosting and breaks up the flow of the game. I was okay with her hosting of the celebrity version of the game, but Ken keeps the flow of the game, puts the contestants at ease, and is a warm presence. Mayim is coming off as a cringey actor."
Summer of Rockets,"What I don't get is that this may have been the easiest decision for a hosting change ever. 

Once Alex announced his cancer diagnosis, we all knew the clock was ticking, whether they wanted to admit it or not (plus he was already older). 

Ken has everything the show wants: witty, funny, knows the game well and is THE most famous contestant.  As long as he didn't screw it up during his trial run of hosting, which he didn't, the job should have been his. 

Maybe it's a male v female thing but I don't understand why Ken isn't full time. It almost seems like there is something else we don't know."
Summer of Rockets,Then I will stop watching April 28. Wtf are they doing?
Summer of Rockets,Just fucking keep Ken
Summer of Rockets,Literally no one likes bialik.. what the fuck are we doing here?
Summer of Rockets,"I’ve been watching Jeopardy for forty years but if Bialik becomes the primary host I’ll be moving on.
Signed,
Team Ken Jennings or Bust"
Summer of Rockets,Looks like I'll be taking some time off from Jeopardy this year.
Summer of Rockets,I can’t even watch when she hosts
Summer of Rockets,HORRIBLE NEWS
Summer of Rockets,Booooooooo
Summer of Rockets,She’s terrible
Summer of Rockets,I thought he was the new permanent host and she was doing celebrity jeopardy? It’s complete bullshit that they keep yanking these people around. Just let it be!
Summer of Rockets,I was a long time Jeopardy Fan but not anymore
Summer of Rockets,"I started watching jeopardy only in the past few years so I'm not some Alex die hard, but even as a newer viewer watching Mayim is very hard. I'll honestly just watch reruns with trebek."
Summer of Rockets,"UGHHHHHHHHHHHHH

That is all.   


Nope, I lied. SHE IS THE WORST. Her timing, her little jokes that aren't funny, her pacing, her voice....I just hate all of it."
Summer of Rockets,I don't even watch jeopardy and this headline made me cringe just from what I've learned about the fiasco on here.
Summer of Rockets,This is a matter of likability. I really don’t understand the person who keeps “jeopardizing” their own career in an attempt to get Bialik to lead the show. She clearly is unliked by most viewers and she also isn’t particularly good as host. Why the “daily doubling down” on this?
Summer of Rockets,Hoping everyone stops watching as soon as Kens run is over. If they won’t listen to fans they will listen to the ratings and money they lose from advertising
Summer of Rockets,I’ll be watching old episodes any time she hosts.
Summer of Rockets,It’s going to be sad when the show gets cancelled because the producers can’t figure out that Mayim is the wrong choice.
Summer of Rockets,Tracy Morgan should host the show
Summer of Rockets,"Is it true, that viewership drops, when she hosts the show? Is she *that* unpopular?"
Summer of Rockets,!remindme may 1 cancel DVR series record of jeopardy
Summer of Rockets,"Goddammit Blossom, just take your bucket hat and go."
Summer of Rockets,Booooooo
Summer of Rockets,Yuck.
Summer of Rockets,"If I were Ken, I would just be like ""You know what, I'm out. Have your fun.""."
Summer of Rockets,"I don’t believe that there’s some grand conspiracy by the Jeopardy producers to keep pitting these two against each other. I feel safer assuming it’s something with contracts, angling for exposure with a different audience who knows who she is, or just trying to balance the production schedule in a different way. 

All that said, Ken is the far better host for the regular show. Mayim is adequate for the special events but not dynamic."
Summer of Rockets,What is: Worst idea?
Summer of Rockets,Has there ever been a more tone-deaf group of producers than the current ones in Jeopardy?
Summer of Rockets,Boooo.
Summer of Rockets,"This is the worst news as a Jeopardy fan. It's becoming painfully obvious that the studio is hellbent on Mayim. I can't stand her random giggles and constant pauses.

Another cringey aspect to her personality is how she evidently feels threatened by real doctors. She is always rude to anybody with a PhD and  once even told the audience that an anesthesiologist is not a real doctor. It just shows how absolutely massive and fragile her ego really is. She wants to be the star of the show, how dare the contestents steal her limelight."
Summer of Rockets,"So desperate to make fetch happen. Tsk, tsk. I guess the publicity is just too enticing..."
Summer of Rockets,"I remember being okay with Mayim's run during her like ""audition"" phase. But after slogging through episodes with her, her faults stand out and irritate me enough to make the show unenjoyable. 

""...IT'S A DAILY DOUBLE!""  
""OH MY GOSH A TRUE DAILY DOUBLEEEE""  
\*takes a second to confirm it's the right answer\* ""..That's correct."" I think this one goes down to preparation. I think I remember a BTS of Alex reading the clues and everything ahead of time. I can't remember all of it, but he was familiar with every inch of that board every night I feel like. Same with Ken. 

Ken has the same respect for the game that Alex did, but Mayim just doesn't have the hosting chops. The same way I don't think Ken would be a decent actor."
Summer of Rockets,Nobody likes her
Summer of Rockets,"Why do they insist on jerking Ken around?

imo Ken should tell them that unless he gets to host all the daily episodes, he's not coming back.  I'm guessing Sony would fucking love seeing their ratings go into the ground after that."
Summer of Rockets,[Fuck ‘em.](https://youtu.be/WZnKJkgmvhI)
Summer of Rockets,Absolute travesty that he doesn’t get the spot.
Summer of Rockets,well - it's nice of them to let me know when not to watch at least.
Summer of Rockets,Can we just get Hugh Laurie to play House hosting jeopardy and call it a day?
Summer of Rockets,"Ugh, I hate Mayim Bialik. Ever since that idiotic millenial advice video I just can't stand her. Especially because she ""apologized"" in such a lame way, like it was written entirely by her pr person. Fucking barf."
Summer of Rockets,"Bialek must know the public sentiment that she's not a good host, right?"
Summer of Rockets,im sure they'll just scratch their collective heads when viewership goes down in May.
Summer of Rockets,"not a fan of Mayim as a host. I like her as a person but she doesn't have very good conversations with the contestants and a lot of her corrections/responses are awkward. Ken is natural, witty and comfortable"
Summer of Rockets,Jeopardy! is dead to me on April 28th.
Summer of Rockets,"they have such a great recipe if they want it.

him for the regular jeopardy and her for celebrity and the one-off's, like the current kids tourney going on right now. the guy is just dialed in and mayim is perfect for the random ones especially the celebrity jeopardy.

i don't understand why this is such a difficult problem to solve."
Summer of Rockets,RIP Jeopardy
Summer of Rockets,why do they hate us? we want ken.
Summer of Rockets,"Watching ""Jeopardy!"" commit suicide to placate the Mayim Biyalik contingent is beyond hilarious. LOL! Not exactly helping with ""bought & sold, completely and utterly out of touch Mainstream Media"" narrative either, is it? 

The dumbest move in TV history.    

What is not giving Jennings the job from day one, for $1000, Alex?

Correct!"
Summer of Rockets,"Well, I'll be travelling for six weeks from June 10 to July 21, so I'll miss most of her run. 

My GF just got back from two weeks in Hawaii, and we watched the Teen show tonight together (I haven't been watching while she's away). In the middle of the first round, my GF says ""It is so annoying!"", and when I asked 'what?', she says ""that pause before she says it's correct."". I noticed it as well, and I've read other people's comments about it. 

Leave her the Celebrity Jeopardy and the kid tournaments; leave the real games to Ken."
Summer of Rockets,SNL should do a skit with this as a subject. Two hosts fighting over who presents.
Summer of Rockets,The only reasonable reason for me would be if Ken doesn’t want to do it year round.
Summer of Rockets,It's kind of insane that the producers did not have a contingency plan or another person in mind to permanently host in the event of Alex Trebek dying/leaving the show. It feels like they just thought he'd be on it forever and/or wanted to kick the can down the curb and deal with that problem when they got to it.
Summer of Rockets,"Does Ken Jennings secretly eat babies or something, and the producers are afraid this will be discovered and they get canceled? I can't understand why they are so insistent on refusing to make the obvious choice."
Summer of Rockets,"Ugh, that stinks. I don't think I've seen them finish an entire round (without running out of time) on any episode she's hosted. Her timing is terrible."
Summer of Rockets,Then I will stop watching on April 31st.....*no wait?*
Summer of Rockets,"I have a not-so-implausible theory that the show execs know exactly what they’re doing. To have Ken on full time would mean a slow fade back into the obscurity that Jeopardy! Was before Trebek got sick. 

But now they’ve got two people they bring on back and forth to stir endless controversy and gain sporadic attention. They will only have Jennings on full-time when this Schtick plays out and we become bored of seeing an ET! Article every few months recapping how much people hate Mayim and love Jennings which boost ratings temporarily."
Summer of Rockets,"Damn, watching from Australia and Ken is brilliant. Mayim needs some help, she just can’t break away from sounding like a video game. A few times I’ve seen contestants have mini freak outs because she’s too slow after answers to affirm them or not."
Summer of Rockets,The 2 second pause before she confirms or negates an answer is infuriating.  I cannot watch.
Summer of Rockets,"Continuing to fuck up a slam dunk obvious decision has definitely put a stain on the continuing Jeopardy legacy. I don't think it's enough to destroy the show (I sure as hell hope not), but it's just a bad look all around. Ken is so much better than Mayim that I don't think it's much of a debate. Maybe they should let the two play Jeopardy and the winner gets permanent host. Ken could spot Mayim $15,000. That would sure make for interesting television."
Summer of Rockets,Nooooooooooooo!!!! Ah dammit
Summer of Rockets,"Train wreck is the right word, why won’t they consider what the people want? It’s a microcosm of what’s happening in society these days"
Summer of Rockets,Fuck this headline again.  Tired of this story
Summer of Rockets,Guess I’ll stop watching again.
Summer of Rockets,Boooooo
Summer of Rockets,"Bummer this teen tournament has been a snore and celeberty was bad too 

Ken's finally getting into the groove now too"
Summer of Rockets,This is crazy. I legit loved Joe Buck- can he do her weeks?
Summer of Rockets,"ugh, well I guess a summer break will do fine."
Summer of Rockets,Oh for FUCKS sake
Summer of Rockets,But WHY
Summer of Rockets,What a fucking train wreck the show has become.  How could they fuck this up this bad.....
Bridgerton,"Kind of a weird issue the show will face, which is every book focuses on a different sibling and then their story is done, meaning the actor will have nothing to do for another six or seven seasons. And since actors want to act, there's the risk they'll keep losing cast members. 

They're supposed to give Anthony and Kate a storyline this season, so we'll see how it goes."
Bridgerton,"Well her story was basically over after Season 1, so it's not a huge loss"
Bridgerton,"I mean expected cos aside from The Duke and I, which was s1, Daphne is barely in besides as a background character"
Bridgerton,"Okay so earlier Ruby Stokes left her role in Bridgerton to star in Lockwood and co - a netflix adaptation of books by Jonathan Stroud. 

And Phoebe Dynevor will also be playing the lead role in another of Stroud's adaptations - The Outlaws Scarlett and Browne (movie)"
Bridgerton,As someone who liked Downton Abbey but doesn't really watch period dramas is there a chance I'd like this?
Bridgerton,Isn't season 3 already filmed
Bridgerton,"I know her character is barely in the books after the first one anyway, but I never understand this kind of move - you're really SO BUSY that you can't film for like one day once a year for this show?"
Bridgerton,[deleted]
Bridgerton,[deleted]
Bridgerton,Cancel the show
Bridgerton,Because Season Two was dog splat that flew hard under the radar after the only reason people watched left. Phoebe needs to give her manager a raise for that sound advice.
Bridgerton,"Which is stupid since cameos provide a lot of free time for actors. This seems like burned bridges, similar to Rege Jean page"
Bridgerton,"Yeah, I get it, but I'm a little surprised Netflix can't snag the actors with ""finished plotlines"" for a few cameos here and there, to at least make the world feel like those elder siblings who are now married don't just stop existing."
Bridgerton,"Thanks for that, maded me look up Garth Nix as well and see they have sequel out soon.   Stoked.


Cheers!"
Bridgerton,Oh I like strouds books will have to check out.
Bridgerton,"If you liked gossip girl, you’d like this, because this show is Victorian era gossip girl."
Bridgerton,"As the other poster said it will depend on what you liked about Downton. I would probably classify bridgerton more as light hearted rom com historical ""fantasy / alt reality"" while downton is squarely period drama. There are down moments in bridgerton but it never hits downton levels and is more aimed at the romance happily ever after type stuff.

After that I would say S1 and S2 if Bridgeton are different types of romance because of the characters they are focused on. Personally I prefer S2 the characters fit better together and it is more a rom com hate to love and them actually building a relationship. While S1 is clueless inexperienced virgin learning about sex. I haven't read the books but from friends who have it makes sense in that the season 2 characters are basically heads of the house and constant while the other characters slowly vanish as they get married off.

Either way not going to say it is the best tv by any means. But it is something a bit lighter, short and easily binge able when you need a break from the constant the world is on fire mess."
Bridgerton,"Maybe? I really really didn't like season 1 but season 2, while still being more Gossip Girl than Jane Austen, at least had some Pride and Prejudice vibes and seems to use its fantasy England setting more appropriately."
Bridgerton,"Bridgerton is based on a series of romance novels and the show has really leaned into the fizziness that a good historical romance can give you. It is not historically accurate, it's not that realistic and it's not trying to be. It's largely a romantic fantasy with period trappings and some fun family squabbles to boot. If you would like that, then definitely check out the show. I've enjoyed both seasons but I read the novels so I went in knowing what to expect. It's not like Downton and it's not going for that vibe or tone at all."
Bridgerton,still being filmed but close to ending i might assume
Bridgerton,If they're committed to other projects filming for those takes priority. They're not going to plan an entire production schedule around it
Bridgerton,"The books series is basically set up to make the TV series in an anthology format. Each book focuses on the romance of a new Bridgerton sibling with the others just playing small supporting roles, making cameo appearances, or no appearance at all. 

It is a typical romance book series format which does not tend to gel with serialised TV shows where folks expect the same cast for the duration of the series. Which is why folks are shocked the leads from previous seasons are not returning for later seasons. Their stories are done."
Bridgerton,"no, she just doesnt have a story anymore after s1, same with RJP, they become background characters as each book focuses on someone else"
Bridgerton,"Locks them up for ages and takes them away from other potentially successful projects. For a couple of seasons at its peak Downton abbey had the mortality rate of a medieval village going through the Black Death, as everyone was trying to break out into movies"
Bridgerton,Have you ever watched TV before?
Bridgerton,Makeup exists
Bridgerton,You’re surprised actors are attractive?
Bridgerton,Lmfao what? Is this your first time ever watching a tv show?
Bridgerton,I actually thought the girls in the show were pretty ugly. In fact i can’t think of one attractive woman in the show
Bridgerton,"""cancel one of your most successful shows""

Genius stuff"
Bridgerton,Depends on the contract for the actor really.
Bridgerton,Rege Jean Page knew that signing on to other shit instead of making cameos on this show was the move. You have like 10 minutes to capitalize on your fame and that’s it. Sticking around would only hurt your career.
Bridgerton,"Those actors are probably moving on to other projects, where there would pay likely be scheduling conflicts."
Bridgerton,Keeping them in contract for x years get expensive. Most actors also want to move to other roles without being pigeonholed to one for too long.
Bridgerton,Surely by the last season there will be no background characters if everyone follows their lead?
Bridgerton,"Funny you say that, as it seems to be Netflix’s current strategy."
Bridgerton,"They all had the same contract, so not really"
Bridgerton,Netflix behaves like old Hollywood studios with regular players. Popular actors in their shows tend to get opportunities in other Netflix shows/movies when they stick around.
Bridgerton,What is he doing now?
Bridgerton,"they'll continue making stories for background characters if their character wants to stay, like the featheringtons"
Bridgerton,It seems like the literal opposite of their strategy
Bridgerton,I swear half of this sub are either Netflix hating bots or just stupid
Bridgerton,Alright and in your opinion which one of their ''most successful shows'' have they cancelled exactly?
Bridgerton,"Not really. In order to NOT get canceled at Netflix, you have to be as big as Wednesday, Stranger Things, or Bridgerton. Netflix constantly canceled niche but really good shows that might take a season or two to catch on, and Netflix terminates those shows too fast. What you’re talking about was never a Netflix complaint and I think you misunderstand the issue with Netflix cancellations in general.    
Or you’re trying to be funny in which case haha very good"
Bridgerton,"What do you mean? 

You said cameos provide actors with a lot of free time. I said that depends on the contract. If she renewed, that would mean she may have been committed to Bridgerton the entire time it filmed. We can’t really know what her contract would have stipulated"
Bridgerton,[deleted]
Bridgerton,He’s in the new Dungeons and Dragons movie.
Bridgerton,The Dungeons and Dragons movie.
Bridgerton,"Oh I’m sorry, were you present in their strategy meetings??"
Bridgerton,Shut up Netflix shill
Bridgerton,"The Babysitter's Club

The OA

Glow

I Am Not Okay With This

Santa Clarita Diet"
Bridgerton,"This just isn’t true the recruit , Lincoln lawyer , Emily in Paris , bunch of the Korean shows , Tim robinsons show , dead to me , all of the reality tv shows alll got renewed because people watched them and completed them so the budgets were justified it’s a business I don’t know how this isn’t understandable Netflix makes hundred of shows and movies a year we only ever focus on what gets canceled and then just ignore what gets renewed the sandman isn’t anywhere close to Wednesday viewership and it got renewed"
Bridgerton,YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING
Bridgerton,"Millie Bobby Brown, Noah Centineo, Julia Garner, Simone Ashley"
Bridgerton,lol. Imagine leaving a hit Netflix show for that movie.
Bridgerton,"They literally just had an interview with the CEOs talking about their strategy.

You can also look at what they've renewed and canceled and get an idea of how successful things are with their top 10s."
Bridgerton,No I have issues with Netflix Netflix fucking sucks at marketing movies and shows I think Netflix is stupid for not doing theatrical releases and Netflix is terribly inconsistent on content especially movies but just lying and spreading shit about how they cancel everything and you have to have stranger things or Wednesday numbers is untrue and makes people like you look bad
Bridgerton,Glow was because of Covid not because they didn’t like the show costs just went up too much
Bridgerton,I'm not seeing any of these among any top lists going by released numbers. Sucks but seems they didn't do  well enough.
Bridgerton,"That’s getting deeper into it, yeah. I was just explaining the very basics of the Netflix hate argument related to what he was saying. There’s lots of factors like completion rates, budget, fan reception, popularity, views, individual views, etc to get into. I’m not a Netflix hater despite my comment sounding like one."
Bridgerton,The trailers for the movie have been well-received.
Bridgerton,Oh so they will just keep 10 shows and fuck the rest
Bridgerton,">Netflix fucking sucks at marketing movies and shows

It's like when they released Archive 81 in January when it would have been a perfect Halloween show. I remember it was just there one day when I logged in. I never saw anything promoting it.

They have the ability to make a lot of their content more successful but they don't care. If something doesn't become a hit on its own, they just start over and try something new. Rinse and repeat."
Bridgerton,"Same troll appearing in multiple threads and y'all keep feeding him, smh."
Bridgerton,Your logic: “oh two good shows are still on” hurrrr durrr
Bridgerton,"Oh, were you there when they cancelled it??? Were you in the meeting room????"
Bridgerton,Youre blind
Bridgerton,Yeah my bad got heated at the other guy sorry
Bridgerton,It’s gonna bomb though.
Bridgerton,"I just spit water all over my iPad. Well received by WHOM? DnD fans were trashing it even before the OGL apocalypse, and Normies have been as indifferent to it as any other late winter/early spring release.   
Opening weekend might not be horrible thanks to Chris Pine fans, but after that it's toast."
Bridgerton,"They will keep shows that have the right audience for their budget while trying out new shows to reach people and cancelling what isn't working.

The same as every TV distributor ever since the beginning of TV"
Bridgerton,Yep agreed marketing is a perfectly fair place to criticize some of these people just say they cancel everything and it’s not true a lot of these shows they do cancel might be successful with better marketing I will admit though
Bridgerton,My mistake didn’t even realize was same person
Bridgerton,We’re you ? No grow the fuck up https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/glow-season-4-canceled-netflix-1234793186/amp/ quick google search shows every major credible publication reporting on it
Bridgerton,"Listen, I agree they're doing too much content at the same time and are thus forced to cancel a lot of things. It sucks.

But these shows in particular are not any of their ''most successful shows''.

Also, Bridgerton apparently did even better than The Witcher and Stranger Things season 3. It's a massive hit."
Bridgerton,"I’m also very tired of this Netflix circlejerk. They aren’t even getting their own arguments right anymore, although pretty sure that dude is a troll and doesn’t mean it"
Bridgerton,"If the movie is a flop, but gets decent reviews, the industry will blame Chris Pine, not Regé-Jean Page.

Because Regé-Jean Page isn't an established movie actor.

If the movie is a succes, he'll get a bunch of job offers out of that.

He was never going to play a big part in the second season of Bridgerton."
Bridgerton,"By people who saw the trailer and commented on it.

Get out of your bubble.

Yes, some people are unhappy about whatever, and many people don't care. 

But the movie has received its share of attention and the reactions are mostly positive.

Whether the movie is successful or not remains to be seen, but my argument wast that taking a sizable part in a big budget movie is better than a very small part in a television show."
Bridgerton,You are so patronizing.
Bridgerton,So cranky
Bridgerton,"Eh, if the movie is forgettable and he hasn't signed on more since, he too will be..."
Bridgerton,"What, really? They are patronising for spelling out the truth? No, really. You can say that netflix is cancelling 'good' shows. But they certainly aren't cancelling 'successful' shows. Note that success depends not only on the number of viewers, bug also the budget. The viewership needs to justify the budget. 

I'm not saying they're entirely correct on this, as many shows require a few seasons to garner significant viewership, and also ending shows that ended in cliffhangers is also poor decisionmaking"
Bridgerton,You are being a dick  head to me and other users and I’m correcting you not being cranky if you don’t like being corrected don’t say bullshit and then whine when you get called out for it
Bridgerton,"I listened to the audiobook. It was ok, though not as good as I expected based on the reviews. I could see Xolo Maridueña as Mateo. Not sure about Rufus."
Bridgerton,Is one of them named John?
Bridgerton,"Could be really good as the story spans 24 hours pretty much. Perfect for Netflix to conclude the story told in the book in one/limited season.

The article doesn't say, but if for some reason they plan this as a multi season show it'll be difficult for me to get excited given the high odds it'll be cancelled before the story is complete."
Bridgerton,"um spoilers, what the hell

I also never would have guessed Bridgerton's creator was a man."
Bridgerton,Figured HBO Max passed on the  JJ / Bad Robot version of this since it's been radio silent since it was announced
Bridgerton,Is this an emperor’s new clothes situation?
Bridgerton,It is a new Netflix experiment; they spoil the ending in the title due to the likelihood of the show itself never reaching the planned conclusion!
Bridgerton,"Well she does fit the show's general criteria of ""impossibly, ethereally good looking"""
Bridgerton,I’d kill for some more Jessica Parker Kennedy too. She’d do great in this genre.
Bridgerton,I'll be in my bunk.
Bridgerton,I think she will be Benedict’s love interest
Bridgerton,"She's a good actress and I think she'll fit in Bridgerton, but I absolutely hated Eleanor in Black Sails."
Bridgerton,Well fuck. So i need to watch this shit show now?
Bridgerton,Oh man. Let’s get it
Bridgerton,Just as long as she can still play Emma Frost when the X-Men come to the MCU...
Bridgerton,"What the fuck is that headline, I have no idea what is going on."
Bridgerton,"If you haven't seen Black sails, you should."
Passionate People,They literally spent the entire summer making the search for a new host a big deal.
Passionate People,This statement is going to be viewed as very tone deaf. “I didn’t realize people cares about who was the host of the show I’m doing”. Like what.
Passionate People,"Maybe if Mayim and/or Sony want to slow down negative feelings about Mayim hosting Jeopardy, they do something to get those Neuriva ads with Mayim off the air? They are airing DURING Jeopardy, and showing all day long before and after Jeopardy as well. It's like Neuriva is capitalizing on Mayim's bigger on-air presence since she started hosting Jeopardy. Hmmm, crazy ain't it? Meanwhile, Mayim's rep goes into the toilet for selling snake oil (same as Dr. Oz)...and using her credentials as a neuroscientist to do it! Bit of a problem there. It's almost as if her controversies aren't totally in the past. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
Passionate People,"""Who knew""

Everyone. Everyone knew."
Passionate People,Mayim Bialik should host a masterclass on just having the worst takes.
Passionate People,Alex Trebek was a national icon. Maybe don't take the job if you don't understand the size of who you're succeeding?
Passionate People,[deleted]
Passionate People,"classic Mayim response.  this girls head is so far up her own ass how could she read let alone anyone hear the *answers*.

she has always been this way.  who the heck is her agent.  give that person a prize for turning that in to gold"
Passionate People,"You know, for having a PhD, she sounds pretty fucking ignorant."
Passionate People,"Who saw her op Ed on Harvey Weinstein’s victims “asking for it” and thought “yeah, she’ll be a perfect replacement for a universally beloved man!”"
Passionate People,Literally any Jeopardy! fan understands why people are passionate about the show.  It's one of the few shows left with integrity.... and losing it quickly.
Passionate People,"People ARE passionate about the host of Jeopardy, the fuck do you mean? You're literally replacing Alex Trebek, a man who has hosted Jeopardy for *35 years*. Don't act like people won't take it seriously."
Passionate People,She's so unlikeable.
Passionate People,Just give Ken the job already for fuck’s sake. He understands the importance of filling Alex’s shoes. She clearly doesnt
Passionate People,Exactly why she shouldnt host
Passionate People,[deleted]
Passionate People,"Imagine having a PhD and being a tone deaf, antivax, moron.

Edit: She's not anti-vax anymore, but I believe the point still stands.

Edit 2: not anti-vax, but does shill essential oils so yeah, fuck that."
Passionate People,is she for real
Passionate People,"So when Mayim Bialik said yes to the job she was thinking, ""this is great, no one gives a shit who hosts jeopardy. What a glorious opportunity for me that no one else will care about."" Right before reading the job description and going ""Alex who?"""
Passionate People,"I don't care about Jeopardy, I don't want Mayim Bialik to get any job in the public eye basically"
Passionate People,The clues you’re getting are that NOBODY WANTS YOU
Passionate People,This response highlights exactly how unlikeable she is
Passionate People,"I’m Irish and have never set foot in the states. Yet, even I consider Alex Trebek to be an inspiration and an Icon.

Yes, people take the host of Jeopardy! seriously. It’s not because of the show, it’s because of Alex.

And an Alex, Mayim is not."
Passionate People,Legit the best reason to not hire her. Well aside from the anti-vax stance.
Passionate People,God forbid she be criticized for things she's said and how she performs a job that is literally dependent on public approval.
Passionate People,"Wow, she really sucks. She can't even address the controversy. She's just deflecting."
Passionate People,Shit hosts are shit
Passionate People,"“Who knew people were so passionate about who hosts Jeopardy”

Besides anyone who has seen a single minute of the show or?"
Passionate People,Someone who wants to host Jeopardy should probably know you’re reading “Answers”.
Passionate People,"I have been watching Jeopardy for 25 years. It was a daily thing with my family. My parents and I would sit and shout out answers. 

I know it's just a show, but finding the right host is important to me."
Passionate People,"wooooow, she did Alex dirty with this statement"
Passionate People,"“Who knew?” - what kind of idiot says this? The entire country only spent 2 years praying for Alex and collectively mourned his death…but yeah just let someone read the clues, it’s no big deal…

Her publicist should have prepped her better"
Passionate People,You're not close to being half the host that Kebert Xela was
Passionate People,She is so unlikable. I hate it when I see her ad on tv
Passionate People,I can’t fucking stand her
Passionate People,"Sounds like she needs more ""brain supplements""."
Passionate People,"Jesus Christ, is she Rob Manfred’s kid or something?"
Passionate People,"I think it's more about protecting the legacy of the great Alex Trebek more than about ""just letting you read the clues"""
Passionate People,"They totally tried to monopolize Alex’s death by making it some half assed reality show, which just turned into a shit show"
Passionate People,"It’s not just jeopardy. It’s family feud. It’s the price is right. We are very particular about our hosts and jeopardy is probably the hardest one to fill.
Acting like it’s not a big deal or hard, and acting like you automatically deserve this spot is not cool. 
Alex gave his life to Jeopardy.
She treats it like a gig."
Passionate People,"""While having the viewers appreciate her hosting job is one thing, what’s important is that she appreciates the job as well.""
Yeah, yahoo? She appreciates the job? After she shit on it? Make it make sense. Who the fuck actually wants her to host that knows more about her than she played a role on one of the most boring sitcoms to exist"
Passionate People,"...didn't...you...LOBBY for this job, Mayim?!

You WANTED to be there, and probably grinned a Grinchy grin once Mr. Executive Blandman was fired (I already forgot his name), but now that you've got it, it's just an ""uh whatever!"" disposable gig for you?

Sure, Big Bang Theory Lady, sure."
Passionate People,"Article's clickbaity and trying to cash in on the controversy.

The full interview's TLDR is that she wants it more about the show and the contestants rather than the host. That's one way to take it and it isn't necessarily bad. Quite a few game shows work like this and Ken Jennings is less of a personality than Trebek so she isn't completely off the mark here. 

The article comes across as incredibly holier than thou, taking quotes out of context without understanding the tone and intent and very clearly trying to get views on their god forsaken site. Typical tabloid journalism. 

**That said** Mayim Bialik has enough baggage and controversy on her plate that we shouldn't need to resort to giving trash websites clicks regardless while also expressing disapproval over being the host of Jeopardy."
Passionate People,"Anti-vaxxer selling fake medicine during the show? Why on earth would we care about that???

She needs to fuck right off with her anti-Science."
Passionate People,"So basically her response is “Let’s just ignore all my controversies, just let me read the clues.”"
Passionate People,And we're one step closer to Aaron Rodgers hosting...
Passionate People,Not the smartest thing to say in this situation
Passionate People,"I can’t speak for anyone else, but I basically want the Jeopardy host to be someone who almost fades into the background. And that really isn’t possible when I know the host has shitty opinions and/or is basically a snake oil salesman. 

I don’t think the host should be anyone who’s currently in the public eye to any degree, because anyone who’s famous is inevitably going to bring a bunch of baggage to the role."
Passionate People,That hole just got a bit deeper.
Passionate People,Everyone knew. Trebek was a fucking legend.
Passionate People,"I’m a bit of a critic of Mayim but I still watch jeopardy. Until they hire Jack the Ripper, I will watch. Also we have a new Ken Jennings in the making rn.

I don’t like her. I don’t like her hosting, but I do love watching Jeopardy."
Passionate People,"Nah someone else should read the clues, you’re not entitled to this, nor anything else"
Passionate People,What an asshole
Passionate People,"The more I learn about Mayim Bialik, the less I want to learn anything more about her."
Passionate People,"A. That’s why you shouldn’t be host. Cause you just don’t get it.      
B. You don’t just get to read the clues. You gotta earn that shit"
Passionate People,This is the worst take about this she a could’ve had. Just nuts. Only actual smart person on Big Bang theory is very dumb. Poetic.
Passionate People,"Alex made being smart/knowledgeable something that was cool, and he didn't do that just by reading clues. If you don't understand the weight of the shoes you're filling then you shouldn't be the one to fill them."
Passionate People,"At the risk of sounding dramatic, Bialik taking over Jeopardy is a nightmare. Out of all the people in the world, out of all the game show hosts, entertainers, journalists and sportscasters, why did it have to be this annoying woman and WHY did it have to be a friggin' anti-vaxxer while we're in the midst of a pandemic.

And yes, Mayim Bialik IS an anti-vaxxer. You don't get to spread vaccine conspiracies for 15 years, repeat those conspiracies and misinformation in your book(s), talk about it in interviews, and then instantly shed the label of anti-vaxxer with one tepid apology in which you ***still*** repeat nonsense about vaccines.

The damage has already been done, cumulatively, over many years. And the fact that Bialik is all over TV, smiling as she uses her neuroscience degree to sell snake oil brain pills, makes it even worse. Either she's outright lying when she says she's ""impressed by the science"" of the pills, or she's so ignorant that she doesn't know how to evaluate scientific literature despite holding a PhD.

I'm pretty damn sure it's the former, and she simply doesn't care as long as she lines her pockets. F the executives at SONY for making this woman the host, and for sending her on this late night talk show attempt at rehabilitating her image."
Passionate People,Get rid of her.
Passionate People,"Things not to say for $2,000"
Passionate People,"I get what she means, but the way she phrased this kind of reeks of entitlement.

EDIT: clarified what I meant"
Passionate People,Such comments are disrespectful to Alex
Passionate People,"Equally telling is how shitty the studio handled this situation. Maybe not all Americans watch Jeopardy. However, most of them know damn well that it's a cultural institution.

You're never going to recapture the magic of Alex Trebek, I get that. But the least you could do is choose people that understand and honor his legacy and respect the show. That's a reasonable prerequisite."
Passionate People,"She's a terrible person.  If google maps can read me directions, it should also be able to read Jeopardy clues"
Passionate People,God she’s annoying.
Passionate People,"God, for a woman who played a nerd she really is a fucking moron."
Passionate People,Blossom doesn't seem as smart as she's touted to be.
Passionate People,"TRANSLATION: I want to be the jeopardy host without the consequences of the fans being upset.

Delusional."
Passionate People,No. For this exact reason. You suck.
Passionate People,Listen y’all. My life is so privileged that I don’t have to give a fuck about my viewing demographic.  Let them eat potpourri
Passionate People,So then don’t do it. Don’t they need her on some shitty hamfisted remake or reboot of that awful science show? Let ken Jennings do it full time and this chick can fuck off and collect her Big Bang money
Passionate People,Give it to LeVar Burton and let's be over this shit already. He's the only person I can think of who has the personality and integrity to fill those giant fucking shoes.
Passionate People,"Not that I agree with the reasoning, but the executives will hire her. Mark my words and mark your calendars, because in a few months the announcement will be made public.

Look what happened the last time. Sony went with a non-intellectual unknown who made crude, anti-Semitic and misogynistic comments. The best way to fix it? Hire a Jewish female Ph.D. who acted in the most popular sitcom of this century (not that any of these characteristics should be used for or against a host). It illustrates a massive overcorrection to an issue that could have been avoided had they not gone ahead with Mike in the first place.

I don't expect any controversies from her past to come back to disqualify her because Sony simply does not care about those things. They weathered a storm with Mike Richards for a few weeks since the rumors of his hosting started to swirl, and they believe they will be able to do it again."
Passionate People,Some person with an ego who is out of touch? I'm shocked. shocked.
Passionate People,What a childish response. I doubt she’d be wondering why people are passionate about Jeopardy if they were fawning of her performance.
Passionate People,Shes sucks
Passionate People,"Yeah I'm sure she had no idea people felt strongly about it, given how much it's talked about.

She really is insufferable."
Passionate People,"Wow….   Way to announce you’re out of touch with the fan base of the show you’re about to take over.  She might as well say, “I’m a poor choice for this job.”"
Passionate People,My hot take is that she’s taking the job and her brand she’s pedaling is giving them a shit load or money for ads then they know she’s shit and will be shit so they can replace her in a year or so with an actual really good person.  You can’t go from Icon to Icon unless you’re the 49ers or packers.
Passionate People,"How dare people care about their favorite show? Look I'm not a huge fan of jeopardy and this very clear example of cancel culture for originally dismissing Mayim as a candidate due to her preference for homebirths and waiting to get her kids vaccinated until they were outside the autism window, but I actually find her kind of insufferable and this dismissiveness toward others' ""passion"" is exactly the lack of empathy and charisma that you would want in a host. Plenty of people can ""read the clues"", what exactly does she bring to the table then?
It's kind of bizarre they couldn't have found someone decent from the contests, it doesn't have to be Ken, but certainly that would have seemed more fitting."
Passionate People,">Wait, people care about this dumb show, who knew?  I'm just here for a paycheque. 

Real classy, Mayim.  Your passion for the job really comes through."
Passionate People,Who knew people were passionate about a show that’s been on for decades? Maybe she’s not had access to the internet ever
Passionate People,Proof she isn't fit
Passionate People,"Reddit's paradox: upvote because she's an idiot, or downvote because she's an idiot."
Passionate People,Bad actress
Passionate People,What is “a response that makes everything worse”?
Passionate People,I never understood why she is an actor
Passionate People,She sucks and has always sucked.
Passionate People,Yeah who knew that after a beloved host died that people watched for years they’d care if their replacement had any charisma and could do more than just “read clues”.
Passionate People,I’m from the U.K. and I can tell you the host of Jeopardy is a big deal.
Passionate People,The main criticism of her is that she doesn’t “just read the clues” and she is always interjecting dumb bullshit
Passionate People,Doubling down on the stupidity I see.
Passionate People,"Also, ""Buy my brain pills!"""
Passionate People,Whelp what a shitty thing to say lol....get her off TV for the love of god
Passionate People,Who the fuck even suggested her? Fuck off blossom.
Passionate People,I can’t imagine she’d be happy if the producers made that argument when negotiating her salary.
Passionate People,Well.....   Guess the ratings will ultimately tell the tale.
Passionate People,jesus christ that's the worst way to respond to it
Passionate People,"Why do they keep trying to put such toxic, vapid creeps in that position?  Just cancel the show if that’s the end goal.  Otherwise, listen to the fans.  

Let there be one thing that isn’t a club for mommy and daddy’s special little rich boys and girls.  The whole everything everywhere isn’t only for you incompetent monster fucks.

Damn it.  Next the show will be used to flim flam essential oils and chakra magnets."
Passionate People,"I mean...she seems pretty concerned with who hosts it.

""Who knew Mayim Bialik was so passionate about who hosts Jeopardy?... Just let someone else we actually like read the clues!"""
The Husbands,Capaldi gave the role 110% pretty much his entire run. The fact that he was such a big fan of the show growing up really makes it special.
The Husbands,"These actors had such great chemistry. On the whole, I never really connected with the River arc, but a big part of that was that I felt her and Matt Smith never really clicked. This was the only time it felt like the characters were actually attracted to each other.

I wonder how River and the 13th Doctor would have been."
The Husbands,That speech by Alex Kingston (River Song) was a masterclass in acting... and it was wonderful to watch Capaldi's face while she spoke.
The Husbands,Such an amazing Doctor!
The Husbands,12's run definitely had its issues but man I loved this moment.
The Husbands,By far one my least favorite characters. She felt like some sort of weird self-insert oc from a badly written fanfic.
The Husbands,One of the all-time yummiest Doctor Who scenes.
The Husbands,"I know it’s an unpopular opinion but I prefered Capaldi’s doctor to Matt Smith. 

The writing was better during Matt Smith, but the performance was better with Capaldi."
The Husbands,He was horrible and boring and old lol. I don’t understand why anyone would think he did well but I see others agreeing with you so I guess I’m the weird one.
The Husbands,"yeah, I really wish River Song and Peter Capaldi had way more episodes together"
The Husbands,"I don't think it's so much an unpopular opinion anymore. As time has progressed (and I think a direct comparison with Chibnall's run on the show has helped) people seem to be realizing on revisits that Capaldi's run (and specifically his run post-Clara) is some of the best Doctor Who, period. 

The reappraisal of Capaldi happened pretty soon after he was gone, and it's been mostly positive."
The Husbands,"I wanted to, but he never grabbed my attention, I did like his suit a lot tho"
The Husbands,"It's the attack eyebrows

They're very intimidating at first look"
The Husbands,who frowned him that face!
The Husbands,"*""Oh go on, crack a smile, I want to see if your eyebrows fall off.""*"
The Husbands,I know they only had this one episode together but I thought River was way better with Capaldi than with Smith... They had really great comedic timing too.
The Husbands,"Was shame Tennant didn't get more episodes with her, I feel like they could have played well off one another. The whole episode with Hydroflax and everything was great."
The Husbands,"Always loved River, the basic concept of how her life worked was such a good one for a show about Time Travel. They may have used her a bit too often causing the novelty to wear off, but when she was played for emotions like this episode, she was great."
The Husbands,Now go back and watch Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead.  Hits different this time around.
The Husbands,"The layers to their relationship, beautiful concept!"
The Husbands,FUCK I miss Capaldi like I genuinely can't deal with it.
The Husbands,Never seen any of Doctor Who since it was revived with Eccleston but that was a lovely scene.
The Husbands,I watch this scene on YouTube like every 3 or 4 months. Hits hard. Hits perfectly.
The Husbands,Still the best Christmas special imo.
The Husbands,"Never liked the character, couldn't stand the actor. Kudos to those who did and could though."
The Husbands,"She will always be symbolic of the lowest point of the show. When Moffat decided to throw out the universe Davies had set up and introduce characters with forcefully quirky names and *catchphrases* instead.

Here's hoping when Russel T. Davies returns he does the exact same thing to Moffat's kids-show universe. Would love to see Tennant, Piper or Agyeman return with no mention of River Song and the goofy doctor ever again. Maybe we could even get Captain Jack back in the mix?"
The Husbands,"There was something about River and Smith that didn't work for me. He seemed way too childish, meanwhile, she was just madly in love with him. It came off as...odd."
The Husbands,"You know that River Song's first apperance was under RTD? RTD rubber stamped the name and the character.

Captain Jack was also like River Song a Moffat creation under RTD. And he came back under Chibnall and probably won't ever reappear now because of Barrowman's behaviour."
The Husbands,"I mean, I think you'll be pretty disappointed. I sincerely doubt RTD has any interest in rehashing himself or disparaging the writing of his good friend and chosen successor."
The Husbands,"> forcefully quirky names and catchphrases

Are you sure you aren't mixing up the two writers? RTD is the one who's guilty of this more. He's the one who introduced Doctor using a catchphrase in the first place LMAO. 

Also, Captain Jack was literally in the last episode that premiered - the 2021 new years special. Thankfully, he isn't returning because actor's sexual harassment stories resurfaced. Good riddance."
The Husbands,">Here's hoping when Russel T. Davies returns he does the exact same thing to Moffat's kids-show universe. Would love to see Tennant, Piper or Agyeman return **with no mention of River Song and the goofy doctor ever again. Maybe we could even get Captain Jack back in the mix?**

Pretty much already has happened since Moffat hasn't been doing the show for 4 years."
The Husbands,"I think with me it's also the age difference, there's about a 20 year difference between River and Matt Smith, but only about 5 years between Capaldi and River."
The Husbands,"I think part of the problem there was they were always playing around with the whole different time lines thing, meeting in the wrong order and all that and it really made the chemistry for them be rather inconsistent. They had moments here and there but yeah mostly just bit odd"
The Husbands,"To be clear, I havent watched Dr. Who in ages, not since it went downhill. Last I knew of Captain Jack we all loved him and I hadn't known about his harassment. Also didn't know that River Song was a creation of Russel T. Davies, seems odd. Was pretty sure he left the show for personal reasons and then River Song showed up some time later, being just awful.

Others, feel free to keep viciously mob downvoting my opinion for differing from yours: ""Your boos mean nothing, I've seen what makes you cheer."""
The Husbands,"Had stopped watching after sometime around River Song stuff happening, I think just after. Did catch episodes here and there and it was pretty rough, I recall something about Clara and computer babble."
The Husbands,"Yeah, that too. Capaldi seems more like an actual *partner* to her rather than...well River looks like could be Smith's mother."
The Husbands,"River Song is Moffat's character that first appeared in RTD's era, in a very beloved and acclaimed two parter written by Moffat ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead"". 

Captain Jack was RTD's creation, but his first appearance was in Moffat's two parter in s1. Captain Jack ain't exactly great when he's not written by those two guys, and his last appearance is a good example of that.

RTD left the show because he did what he planned to do, but it's also a very hard and thankless job, it's not very healthy doing it for long. Moffat is his good friend, and the whole handover was what RTD wanted and not some bloodbath some people want it to be. No one loves Doctor Who more than them. 
Though he left Torchwood later because he had to take care of his husband, so maybe you're thinking of that. 


Actually, the stories about Jack's actor (John Barrowman) were pretty well known, there was that apology in 2008 for whipping his cock out all the time on set (he kept doing it, as well as kept apologising). Recently there was a big story that Noel Clarke who played Mickey Smith (big recurring character in RTD's era, somewhat forgettable though) is a sexual predator. He was accused by 20 women of harassment (some of it happening on the Who set). The stories about Barrowman resurfaced because there are videos of Clarke saying Barrowman gets a pass for harassment because he's gay. Barrowman in general is a huge prima donna and puts on an act when he meets the fans, but treats his crew like shit."

The Husbands,"That’s exactly how the book is (loved it back when it came out and loving the show). It pulls such a great narrative trick. I have been waiting for this episode. I knew people would get frustrated by the one sided barrage and this episode would completely flip it. Love the book. It demands a bit of patience to reveal its nature but if you stick with it, brilliant."
The Husbands,"I totally agree, but I did enjoy the series before this episode. I also loved the book so I knew this was coming but Claire Danes’s performance was just so haunting and raw that it totally wrecked me. Her pain felt so real and that her collapse could happen to anyone."
The Husbands,Series has been fucking stellar and episode 7 only took it up another notch. Danes stole the whole show amongst a cast of stars.
The Husbands,"Episode 7 was just so heartbreaking and struck close to home. I watched an ex go through a nervous breakdown a few years back and it was horrifying to come in after she had been spiraling for days and just see all the wreckage. 

Also, the line about how Libby can’t quit smoking because she’s trying to remember who she was when she was younger rung real true. Been feeling very nostalgic for my 20’s recently and have been struggling to quit. Think that line was very true."
The Husbands,[deleted]
The Husbands,"That episode was amazing and so needed to balance things out.  Earlier in the series I was thinking, why isn't he worried about her?  Whatever he thinks about her, not hearing from someone for weeks, having them not show up when expected - and then someone says they saw that person napping in the park?  His character had zero empathy or compassion.  They clearly had a bad marriage, but gees.  And then when Libby clues him in to what is really going on, and his response?  Oh my god.  What really irks me is having gotten to the end of the series and having no idea what happened to her.  She could be dead for all we know - there was literally no one around to care about her.  I was really hoping Libby would come back and help her out."
The Husbands,"I cried so much. Being a woman who has gone thru sexual abuse, parents getting divorced when I was young, getting hurt, feelings of being lost, being married, dealing with aging, and so much more. When episode 7 ended I was a mess and suddenly stopped hating Rachel and instead felt her pain. 

The one quote: 
“that was the moment that the Fleishmans understood that a divorce was an earthquake for two people who used to be in love. But it was a chronic condition for the children who had to somehow survive it.“ 

hurt so much. 

Absolutely amazing series."
The Husbands,"Oh my God. I watched this and thought it was a decent show. Started reading this thread and everyone was talking about how good the Claire Danes centered episode was and I couldn't really picture it. 

Turns out, I finished episode 6 and because there were no more episodes left, I assumed that was the end of the series. I'm such an idiot lol. I remember thinking that it was an interesting albeit uninspired ending to the series. Turns out Ive got more show to watch!

So thanks for the post!!"
The Husbands,"I haven’t read the novel but this 
~~season finale~~ penultimate episode is brutal and I kinda wish it had come with a TW because the hospital scene (and what happens next) is so very relatable for many people, and it’s rarely discussed — except in hushed tones. 

Claire Danes is such a good actress so that’s part of it but for anyone who has a vulva/given birth and has juggled family, relationships, and all of life’s other responsibilities it’s a powerful indictment on the pressure modern society puts on women."
The Husbands,Libby is so underrated
The Husbands,"I just started watching it (episode 1)  and am having a hard time believing his character would be so popular with women.  I mean, had they chosen a better looking lead I might buy it.  Maybe he'll grow on me."
The Husbands,"The ending didn't hit as hard for me, for a couple reasons.  Spoilers!

1.  I knew there was a twist coming.  I didn't know what it would be, but it was obvious it wouldn't be just what we're shown through his perspective.  Aside from the fact they were constantly telegraphing the importance of perspective throughout the story, it was also just absurd watching his character handle this and rationalize away that his ex-wife fell off the face of the Earth.  I don't care how bad a relationship is, if the mom of your children disappears, you're not going to be satisfied with ""Well, she's probably screwing some other guy.""
2.  They didn't explore/resolve her problem.  It felt like they were trying to hint at it being just a ""nervous breakdown"" following the trauma of her birth.  However, I don't think that was the case at all.  There were clear signs that she had some early issues with how much her personality changed from the time they originally met as she started pursuing her career.  And that nervous breakdown was huge.  It was definitely indicative of a serious mental condition, something she was likely living with for a while.  The trauma of giving birth likely exacerbated the condition, but it was still a noticeable and gradual decline.  So the fact it didn't follow up on her doctor's appointment was disappointing."
The Husbands,I grudgingly started watching this show with my SO and got hooked soon after…I thought it had a very “Woody Allen” feel right off the bat
The Husbands,"As someone who has a long term partner I think I am sensitive to women’s needs and experiences but this episode expanded my mind and heart plus crystallized so much. One thing that begs at me is why did the women in the park reject her? They all had babies together and avoided her. That looked overly harsh. I wonder if it is a critique of snobby upper east sisters or else how not just men but women, too, can be crappy to other women. The end was precious and she was not alone. That was so good to witness."
The Husbands,Claire Danes seems to only do one type of character now a days but god damn does she do it amazingly lol
The Husbands,"The entire premise of the show seems so boring, I just don't think I can bring myself to try it. I literally cannot think of a topic more boring, at least that is how the commercials make it seem."
The Husbands,They could have cut way back on whats his name though. I was way more interesting in everyone else.
The Husbands,I love this show
The Husbands,"I've loved the show from the start, but this episode was incredible. It moved me to tears. Claire Danes deserves an Emmy nom for this episode."
The Husbands,I've been raving about this episode and Claire Dane's performance for a few days now. I can't get over how amazing it was.
The Husbands,That hour was amazing. The gradual fall into her mental breakdown was perfectly written.
The Husbands,"The show did a great job of showing how every character was feeling. We get to see a lot of things through the lens of most of the main characters, and we are even privy to their relationship blind spots / biases. 

For example, Libby found it audacious when Toby said Adam was a great husband. And then later on Toby found it audacious when Libby was telling him that Rachel deserved leniency. 

I honestly really felt the most for Adam. I know he was acting bitter but I mean… his partner went AWOL and he was left to just deal with things alone."
The Husbands,Was it that mind blowing? She got over stressed from work and didn't answer her phone for three weeks? Did I miss something?
The Husbands,How can a show with that name not be a Northern Exposure reunion special?
The Husbands,"Is this just a miniseries or is this supposed to be an ongoing TV show? Because that sounds awesome, but I don't think you can sustain another two or three seasons of a television show after you've done something like this, not unless something really crazy get set up for season 2."
The Husbands,"I rewatched episode 3 after episode 7, now I guess I should rewatch the first"
The Husbands,"I’m on episode 4, and just watched the ‘beef lo meinnnnn’ scene with Seth Rothberg. OMG I love this show"
The Husbands,More woman good man bad bullshit
The Husbands,"“I don’t want to spoil anything, so I just want to tell you that something amazing happens in episode 7 that makes the entire show worth watching. So you will be waiting 6 episodes to get to this non spoiler that I shared”

🙃"
The Husbands,She’s still a shitty and selfish person. Mental health is no excuse to act that way. The show tries hard to victimize her but fails miserably as nothing that’s happened to her is even that extreme
The Husbands,I agree 100%
The Husbands,[deleted]
The Husbands,"You've ever ""scene""? How the f do you kids keep coming up with new ways to get everything wrong? Seen, as in you see it with your eyeballs. Seen. JFC!"
The Husbands,"That’s exactly how my wife and I felt. By the end of Ep5 we were getting tired of Toby, Ep6 Libby was a welcome break, and Ep7 was like the first 5 episodes crammed into one heartbreaking story."
The Husbands,"I've not watched the series yet, but I've read the book. This is when youre like, oh shit, and realize the Fleischman who is in trouble is not Toby."
The Husbands,Her doing the screaming at the yoga retreat thing and her breaking down with her support group.  Just wow.
The Husbands,"Yes that affected me deeply - you don’t realise you want have that time and freedom, that it goes.

I found it amazing."
The Husbands,I am confused why she & Toby keep saying her husband is great. He has been a whiny Ahole the entire series? I felt her pointing about longing & desire when she said you can’t get the thing you want. Once the longing is gone the thing looses what made it great.
The Husbands,"Yeah! I totally felt the same way, Toby's self centered attitude was starting to get insufferable and after ep 7, I was hoping the show would give us closure on Rachel--the fleishman who actually lost everything! Her discovered star, her family, her mental sanity, her friends. It just sucks that we only get an episode of her PoV and then she's just gone."
The Husbands,"I know I loved this episode.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen a show that so perfectly captures what it’s like to be a mom, a working mom, the desire to be ambitious, the shame of being ambitious for women, the unique kind of experience for women of the gen x/older millennial generation. I love the juxtaposition of Rachel’s experience with Libby’s and even Hilary Clinton."
The Husbands,Wait?  It's the finale?
The Husbands,Not enough Libby! I wish there was more
The Husbands,He's a doctor.
The Husbands,Yeah. It was her perception of things and it maybe true and it may be not. I felt deeply for her this episode as someone with social anxiety and constantly think that they don’t belong. This episode really hurts me because I’ve never seen a show depict the mindset of an outsider growing up and constantly trying to fit in like this one.
The Husbands,"I had a baby in 2004. Joined a ton of mommy groups. Rejected from every one. 

Women can be relentlessly cruel to other women sometimes. Sad but true."
The Husbands,[deleted]
The Husbands,I think they knew she didn’t come from money and they presumably did
The Husbands,I think it was a continuation of the theme of her desperation was what was isolating her. The other moms could tell she was so desperate to be friends so they were turned off by her.
The Husbands,So uninteresting you’re in a Reddit thread commenting on it? How do you approach the shows you enjoy? lol
The Husbands,I'm pretty sure it's a miniseries.
The Husbands,That is a good question.
The Husbands,Clearly didn’t watch the first 6 episodes
The Husbands,[removed]
The Husbands,"I got 3-4 episodes in and didn't want to watch two unlikeable people muck about any longer with problems I don't care much about. I am glad it's being well-received though, it's not for me."
The Husbands,"Exactly. I can sympathize with how she felt during the birth and how she has felt abandoned her whole, but this doesn't excuse you from being a good person. She may very love her kids but she cheated on her husband who suggested therapy multiple ways as we see Toby pushing for as a couple and individually for her. I don't feel this overwhelming empathy that everyone else has. What if the roles were reversed and Toby had disappeared, was career driven, and had cheated. It's an episode trying to ratoonalize her absolutely abhorrent behavior. I feel bad she popped but she had a supporting husband the whole time that she ignored for money."
The Husbands,This doesn't take place in the present; it takes place in 2016.
The Husbands,"I think in the final episode you see that her husband has actually been pretty patient and steadfast while Libby tries to figure things out— the point is that we only see Libby’s side at first in her marriage (sort of like we only see Toby’s side at first!), so when her friends say her husband is great, or she does, we don’t see if because she isn’t showing it to us… because she doesn’t feel it at that point.

But like… imagine you’re a lawyer and you’re working lawyer hours and commuting and taking care of your kids while your wife complains about your house and friends, smokes weed all day, then goes out with her friends all evening? You would probably be a bit of a drag too at that point! 

Like she says later, you have to work to remember the things you like/love about each other, and what your relationship felt like when you decided to get married in the first place."
The Husbands,"Life is all about choice. After the rush of falling in love passes (as it inevitably does) it ultimately comes down to making the conscious decision to be with the one that you love, even if sometimes you have to remind yourself why you love them.

I see it as the more spiritually mature outcome, as it is the conscious choice to move in the direction of love and truth even though it means sacrificing a degree of freedom. There are still infinite possible futures, but the choices made at every moment restrict the future possibilities to a different, more limited infinity.

To focus only on longing means to avoid the risk of growth out of fear of commitment, when commitment, truly choosing something, is the only way to live a fully conscious life."
The Husbands,"Nobody is perfect.  But he's a far cry from a bad husband.  He's probably put up with more than he should have, and it's also not his fault if she wanted more from life than what she chose to have with him.  I think a lot of the source of his own disappointment is in having to carry on with the life he wanted without the partner he was promised.  She wasn't there, but he didn't take it out on her or leave her.  He may have resented her, but rarely expressed or acted on that resentment, but instead just tried to keep living his life for himself and the kids until she ""came back"" which she finally did."
The Husbands,"Agreed. What I always glean from any sort of media or entertainment that’s able to capture the reality of being a mom is: you’re fucked no matter what. SAHM? Pfft. *Glorified maid and/or wealthy bitch.* Mom with a career outside the home? *frazzled and harried or type A wealthy bitch.* The truth is it’s often much more nuanced and there’s a ton of variation from mom to mom but that’s rarely acknowledged. And what *we carry in secret deep in our souls* are the assumptions wholly determined by the  chosen (or fallen into) roles we find ourselves in after becoming a parent. 

There are so many expectations piled on (even if it’s just the mom piling it on themself) and my guess is only a small percentage of moms, regardless of their lot in life or whether they work outside the home, feel like utter failures more often than not. Add trauma or health issues to the mix and it’s any wonder why more of us don’t spontaneously combust."
The Husbands,Hilary Clinton! The timing of this series—I want to know how these couples respond to the election results and trump presidency!
The Husbands,"No, there's one more episode."
Astro Boy,You should really post this on r/anime.
Astro Boy,I binge watched this once and it was so good!
Astro Boy,The Canadian dub has attained holy grail status in some quarters of the fandom.
Astro Boy,https://astroboy.fandom.com/wiki/Astro_Boy_(1985_Canadian_dub)
Astro Boy,Wow that’s hilarious. I haven’t heard of this but I also don’t think I’ve seen the whole American dub.
Astro Boy,"All Astro Boy animes ever made were heavily edited and censored in the western dubs. I explain this better in the OP. In fact, Osamu Tezuka's work has historically suffered lots of accessibility issues in the West. At least over half of his work on manga and anime has never been translated from japanese."
Astro Boy,I just read the OP all the way through this time. That’s actually really sad when content like that is snuffed from existence all while people are claiming to be “saving the children” what is akin to burning books like in Fahrenheit 451 to me lol. But really it is tragic.
Astro Boy,"Even after Tezuka's death, Astro Boy continued to suffer with censorship. The 2000s anime, made around 20 years after his death, had key plot points cut. For example, the whole reasoning for Astro to be built is that Dr. Tenma wanted to replace his dead son, Tobio. When the 2000s anime tells that story, it is censored in the american dub so that it seems like nothing more happened after Tobio ran away. Which means that Dr. Tenma in the american dub just gave up and didn't even try to look for his son who ran away. It makes no sense at all for Tenma to not have even tried to find his son. Instead, he just built a robot!

I can give you in a chat or PM in reddit some recommendations of where to find both the 80s and 2000s animes uncensored if you want."
Astro Boy,The 80s series is on YouTube lol. They also changed Atlas from having being a human that died and was recreated as a robot to just being a robot the entire time.
Astro Boy,I'll believe that when it's out. (eyes the last two reboots that were announced and never materialized.)
Astro Boy,"You may not recognize the name, but you'll recognize his work. He dubbed Astro Boy, Gigantor, Kimba the White Lion, his company colorized old Looney Tunes cartoons, he was everywhere in the animation industry and was a true pioneer."
Astro Boy,RIP to a genuine legend
Astro Boy,"Soaring high in the sky, I just threw up my apple pie, Astro boy Astro boy"
Astro Boy,"Speaking of old school anime, Billie Lou Watts was one of the first American voice actors to voice dubbed anime. Such as voicing Astro Boy and his sister Uran/Astro Girl and the titular character Kimba. Her last role was voicing Eustace's Mother in Courage the Cowardly Dog.

Heck Barbara Goodson (best known as Rita Repulsa in Mighty Morphin Power Ranger and Laharl in the Disgaea franchise) is one of the earliest American voice actors that became a regular in English dubs of anime throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Such as voicing [Unico the Baby Unicorn](https://theasiancinemacritic.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/unico8.jpg?w=660) in ""The Fantastic Adventures of Unico"" and ""Unico In The Island of Magic"" (both by Osamu Tezuka and Sanrio), and [Baby Chirin](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/6/65/ChirinLamb.png/revision/latest?cb=20191119220512) in the 1983 English dub of ""Chirin no Suzu"" (Ringing Bell) by Sanrio Animation. Goodson is still active in English dubs of anime, but is mostly active on video games roles and some animated shows (such as Marianne Lenoir/Backwarder in Miraculous Ladybug).

Even well-known voice actors got their starts dubbing anime. Such as Cheryl Chase (Angelica Pickles) voicing Beezle the demon of solitude in ""The Fantastic Adventures of Unico"" and Gregg Berger (Grimlock, Odie, Orson, The Gromble, and Ripto) who voiced Chirin as an adult in ""Ringing Bell""."
Astro Boy,"Goodson is also the dub voice of Naota in FLCL, one of her most well known anime roles. Great voice actress and I love seeing her in anime dubs."
Astro Boy,"While people are more familiar with Goodson's voice roles mostly being elderly women. I loved when she uses her ""younger and cute sounding voice"" as heard in the english dub of ""Katy La Oruga"", ""Chirin no Suzu"" and the Unico movies. She's still able to pull of this voice in some of her recent roles such as voicing Reu in ""Mugen Souls Z""."
Astro Boy,"The Simpsons came out in 1989 so going back now and watching is way different than being a teenager and seeing it in real time. Believe me, it was all anyone wanted to talk about. It was a fucking revelation."
Astro Boy,People are busy and there are so many choices. If it doesn't grab you fast enough you should move on.
Astro Boy,"I'm not going to tell anyone else how to or how not to watch TV, but the ""Three Episode"" rule makes a lot of sense to me in the world that has a glut of content.  I could see giving shows a longer try if we were back in the days of three networks churning out linear programming content without much competition, but that isn't how things are today.  When you have some very good series being made by streamers, and almost the entire history of Television available to binge, why would you waste time slogging through a show after three bad episodes?  You have too many other great shows you could be watching instead."
Astro Boy,My personal kind of rule of thumb is usually around five episodes before I give up on something (although I've become much less consistent with that in recent years)
Astro Boy,Welcome to the streaming and binging ERA my friend
Astro Boy,"I feel like it’s situational for each individual. Me personally, with work and my kids, My free time is pretty limited, so if a show doesn’t grab me in its first episode, I don’t feel inclined to keep giving it opportunities to win me over. There are simply other things I’d rather do."
Astro Boy,"Did I say anything wrong in the title or in the OP? Are these people already downvoting me even bothering to also read the OP and my arguments? It seems like every discussion post here, even the most harmless ones, gets downvoted to hell."
Astro Boy,"A lot of the shows you praise were bound to merchandise sales due to kids targeted TV networks strike deals to sell toys and what not. If a ""kids"" show with strong fanbase aren't buying merchs, they don't see it as profitable thus pulling the plug on it. 

Which has changed with the streaming networks where they actually can see the money pouring in through subscriptions and monitoring users."
Astro Boy,"If a show is in a genre I tend to love and I'm interested in the story, I'll likely stick with it.  If the show isn't something I generally would watch, I'll give it an episode to impress me.  If a show just outright offends me in the first episode, I won't bother continuing to watch it at all and will stop mid-episode.  Many shows people praise have had moments in the first episode where I've just said ""nope"" and let it be right there.   That's the beauty of knowing what you like and don't.  I'm tired of people saying to stick with a show because it gets really good in the second season or 10 episodes in or whatever.  If it's not enjoyable in the first episode at least a little then I'm not missing anything by letting it go and saving myself suffering through tripe to get to the good stuff.  Ok, yes you can point to dozens of great shows that have mediocre first seasons, but even those shows (like the US version of The Office)... I still laughed during those early episodes.  The show just got better from there.  I still enjoy every episode of Seinfeld and Newhart.

I watch shows I enjoy.  Life is short.  Focus on what you enjoy the most in tv and let the rest goes.  I don't care what is popular or if other people just hate what I'm liking.  I have no hard rule for long season traditional shows... if I like it, I'm going to pretty much enjoy the whole season... and the great shows I'm still going to rewatch every episode at whatever pace I want.  There are no rules except the ones I decide to go with.  Some shows I like to space episodes out to one a day or week... other shows I'll binge a bunch of episodes and finish the short season in a couple days."
Astro Boy,"Almost every show that starts bad never gets better. Sure, there are a very small number that buck that trend, but on the whole if the first episode is bad overwhelmingly the rest of the show is bad."
Astro Boy,Manga hxh is the ONLY perfect story I know
Astro Boy,Yezzzir. I remember everyone at school talked mg about it after the Tracey Ullman show debut.
Astro Boy,"I don't doubt that, and I think people are often way too harsh on The Simpsons' first season. Same thing for a lot of great shows really, like Avatar."
Astro Boy,"I get there really is too much ""content"" now to a fault. Instead of feeling pressured to watch all said ""content"", I would rather choose one thing to fully commit to, while being relaxed and not expecting a masterpiece, just a decent enjoyable flick instead.

I guess that I'm making this thread because there are so many shows, I would say most shows ever made, that take really long to become truly great, like Star Trek The Next Generation, and The Simpsons to a less drastic extent. And even then, they are inconsistent because seasons used to be far longer. There are lots of amazing old TV that I really would love for anyone to experience, like Twilight Zone.

And I feel sad whenever someone drops a show I love before it actually got great. I always say ""please, at least get to episode number x, if you can't enjoy it, then it truly is not for you"".

Also, when I say people are often too harsh on a show's first season, I mean amazing shows whose first season is clearly inferior, but still far from terrible, and yet people will often look down upon the first season, and even say it is almost unwatchable! I've seen many criticisms of the first season of shows like The Simpsons, Justice League and Avatar being so harsh and dismissive, calling their first season almost unwatchable even! And it's sad to see even fans acting like that."
Astro Boy,"Older television shows weren't meant to be binged. If you try to binge even the greatest old TV shows, they will come across as repetitive and inconsistent. Binging is a wrong way to watch them."
Astro Boy,"But you know that ends up being really unfair to a lot of amazing shows that take a lot longer than 3 episodes to fully find their footing. Specially older TV shows made before this streaming and binging era. The best to watch a show is to be relaxed and not rush. Watch whenever you can and feel like doing so, without a clear programming."
Astro Boy,"Is that rule for live-action shows? Live-action shows have episodes lasting one hour even, but animated shows generally have each episode lasting only 20 minutes."
Astro Boy,It's a really long winded meandering essay with a flawed premise about a basic topic and an accusatory tone. I could tell you were the kid show guy right away.
Astro Boy,"This is valid, but what show is BTAS?"
Astro Boy,Stop caring so much about downvotes. It'll make you enjoy life(and reddit) more.
Astro Boy,Don’t take it personally everything gets downvoted. You put a lot of thought into this be proud! I agree that things are judged way too harshly and pacing yourself can change entirely how you see a show
Astro Boy,"If the show has something that truly offends you in the first episode already, that's another matter. Not really the type of situation I'm talking about."
Astro Boy,"I get there really is too much ""content"" now to a fault. Instead of feeling pressured to watch all said ""content"", I would rather choose one thing to fully commit to, while being relaxed and not expecting a masterpiece, just a decent enjoyable flick instead.

Astro Boy,"I'm not saying every show deserves lots of patience, specially when you hate it. I'm mainly referring here to shows that already ended, people love them, but those shows still take a long time to get good for people watching them for the first time. That's where I'm asking patience. That's where I find so many criticisms of the first season of shows like The Simpsons, Justice League and Avatar way too harsh and unfair."
Astro Boy,"That’s right, I almost forgot it started as those shorts on Tracy Ullman… which was after or before Married With Children. Another classic for our age but probably outdated today."
Astro Boy,"Well, if they can't be binged, they aren't worth watching imo.  Linear TV is yestertech.  Those shows can't stand up to binging because they are fundamentally flawed, and only the flawed nature of Linear TV saved them."
Astro Boy,"> ... being really unfair to a lot of amazing shows ...

*unfair*? I am not in a relationship with them."
Astro Boy,"I don't really care.  Most shows don't get better, and it isn't my job to suffer through shows hoping they will get better.

If a show eventually does get better, I'm sure I'll hear about it from word of mouth.  If it gets cancelled, oh well, I doubt I'll miss it because there really is so much good content available now, I don't really have time for it all as it is."
Astro Boy,"Yeah, usually - I don't want a lot of animated stuff, but I'm often willing to give it more time to settle"
Astro Boy,"What is the flawed premise? Can you actually give constructive criticism? I worked hard in writing this essay, put great care and attention into it."
Astro Boy,Or ATLA?
Astro Boy,Batman - The Animated Series
Astro Boy,Thanks!
Astro Boy,"Seasons were far longer, and the constraints of time and budget were really bad. The Twilight Zone is one of the greatest TV shows of all time, many of its episodes are absolute peak TV, but you couldn't expect brilliance every episode. It could be really inconsistent because each season is over 20 episodes long, and had to be produced with insanely small budgets and time that would unthinkable nowadays. To the point that the fact that the show managed to produce so many amazing episodes under those hostile conditions of 50s and 60s TV is a testament to the genius of Rod Serling and all the show's writers."
Astro Boy,"Also, weekly watches have a special magic and attachment that gets lost when you binge a show. When you watch it weekly, it becomes part of your life for even years, and you get attached to the characters as if they were family. It becomes forever part of your life, and the there is greater hype, anticipation and speculation between episodes."
Astro Boy,"You can definitely be unfair towards a work of art, make unfair complaints, or even say total bullshit about it. 

We should always try to make life as fair as possible."
Astro Boy,"its not even about finding the footing for me.

Its like if in 3 episodes you can not get me curious about something then I am out.

Like for example with stargate,  first episode solid banter between the maincast   instantly more into the show.
full metal alchemist brotherhood sets up an intresting mystery.

all those three episodes need to do is give you a slight hook.

Hell Jujustsu kaisens main hook for a few episodes was its amation was beautiful"

Astro Boy,">A masterpiece for me is not necessarily something near perfect, it's about the effect it has on me, the highs it has, how much I care, what I emotionally get out of it, that's the difference between anything being decent or a masterpiece

Your first sentence boils down to 'it's a masterpiece if I like it' which is a valid opinion but not one that promotes critical discussion. 

'people are too hard on first seasons' is just wrong. The majority of shows that start bad stay bad. You list a bunch of exceptions, but they're just that- the very few that actually got better. Most don't, and we don't have time to give every show a chance. The beginning is the most important part to get right. 

Look at how many of your wall of text paragraphs begin with *and* or *also*. It's exhausting. If you're going to post this many words, they need to be good ones. I'm not your English teacher but try a few editing passes before you post on the internet. 

You clearly have a specific, unusual taste in television and you're frustrated that nobody shares your passions. You think they're wrong for not liking the same things as you (or at least it comes off that way in your writing). And coming from an explicitly anti-critical viewpoint as per your first post, nobody has any reason to take your opinion seriously."
Astro Boy,"why would you assume people know this?
    
ATLA?"
Astro Boy,"It's a testament to the saying, ""Even a Blind Squirrel finds an acorn from time to time"".  You crank out enough episodes and a couple of them are going to be pretty good, even if you make much more bad episodes than good."
Astro Boy,"Well, glad you enjoy it.  The world of linear TV needs people to watch it since so many are fleeing to what they believe is the massively better experience of streaming."
Astro Boy,"If by fair you mean I should spend my time watching them, then no.

If you have to pay by watching time, how much are you willing to spend to be fair?"
Astro Boy,"Exactly.  If you haven't given me some reason to care about watching a 4th episode in the first three episodes, I have much better things I could be doing."
Astro Boy,"But I see many cases in which the first three episodes of a series give the viewer a hook, and yet some people will still say it doesn't, and then drop it."
Astro Boy,"As I said in my first post, I'm not going to tell you what to watch, and you should feel free to commit to anything.  

Personally, I just think instead of committing to a show, I'll just cherrypick the truly great shows that have been made across all times.  It's not my job to suffer through hundreds of hours of TV hoping it will get better, it's the job of the producers, directors, showrunners, writers and actors to figure out a way to get me interested and keep me interested."
Astro Boy,"First, I'm not a native english speaker. I'm proud of my english now in comparison to even just three years ago. My english used to be godawful, and it improved MASSIVELY.

Second, art is too subjective, and we should never be judgmental over the emotional impact something can have on another person. There is no work of art that everyone will love. If you want to get a far better written analysis of this subject, and what makes a masterpieve, I recommend this thread I made. Please, take a look. I think this is my best writing on the matter.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/q2a48c/on_the_topic_of_overanalyzing_our_prejudiced/

How do I have an unusual taste in television? I mentioned acclaimed shows. My point is that even the best shows often stumble and take a good time to find their footing. If people love something, and/or I'm really interested in it, I will commit to it, while being careful to not have high expectations, be relaxed and only expect decent enjoyment. To not be pretentious and too demanding.

Also, when I say people are often too harsh on a show's first season, I mean amazing shows whose first season is clearly inferior, but still far from terrible, and yet people will often look down upon the first season, and even say it is almost unwatchable! I've seen many criticisms of the first season of shows like The Simpsons, Justice League and Avatar being so harsh and dismissive. And it's sad to see even fans acting like that."
Astro Boy,I should have fixed it. But the show is so popular that I thought the acronym would be easily recognized.
Astro Boy,Avatar The Last Airbender
Astro Boy,"Have you ever watched The Twilight Zone? There were many amazing episodes, and certainly far more good ones than clunkers. It is one of the greatest shows of all time, and Rod Serling is one of the greatest writers and TV creators of all time."
Astro Boy,"Have you ever watched Twilight Zone? I won't ask anymore, but I would love an answer."
Astro Boy,"You know even streaming services are releasing episodes weekly, right? Streaming is not killing the classic weekly model release, and many TV creators, fans and writers nowadays strongly advocate for it. Disney released Wandavision weekly in Disney+, for example."
Astro Boy,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/scnd8i/classic_theatrical_cartoons_from_the_golden_age/
Astro Boy,"My point is that there are lots of truly fantastic shows that take some time to fully find their footing. In fact, I would say that almost every show does not start great right away, almost every show has a fairly rough first season.

I'm not saying you should be watching something that you are hating, that it is making you feel miserable while watching it. I don't either. I need to like something, it can't be complete trash.

Please, read this comment whose link is below, and you'll see what I mean.

I trusted this friend and we share allot in common media wise

but after like episode 12 I just couldnt anymore"
Astro Boy,"you forget everyone is a different person

what might hook you might not hook them
and what might hook them might bore you"
Astro Boy,"Don't worry, I don't commit to random shows. It's either really acclaimed shows, or ones that satisfy some particular niche I love. 

And I'm NOT saying you should suffer through hundreds of hours of hours for any specific show. When I ask for patience, I don't mean to that level. I mean morenlike being understanding that a first season of any show, even the best ones (hell, maybe specially the best ones) can have its flashes of brilliance, but be far inferior to what comes after, and have many bad episodes. I gave examples in the OP, like The Simpsons, Avatar, Justice League to show you what I mean.

Ultimately, do what puts less pressure and stress on you. Don't have high expectations for any show, don't have a rigorous watching schedule, just expect a decent flick, so your enjoyment of the greatest masterpieces will also be more natural, and you won't burn yourself with hype backlash (which is always unfair to a show and its fans)."
Astro Boy,"Good on you for learning a new language. I failed out of Dutch class, myself.

>Second, art is too subjective, and we should never be judgmental over the emotional impact something can have on another person.

Criticism of a work isn't judgment against the fans. You're allowed to like what you like, there's nothing wrong with that. Criticism is basically an attempt to describe *why* you did or didn't like a thing. Why did it have an emotional impact? What did the directors or actors do specifically to effect that emotion? When you've seen enough shows or movies, these things start to stand out. You'll notice when a show uses cheap tricks to spark false emotion and when they've gone much deeper to create a more genuine satisfying emotion. Like cooking, you can load up on sugar and fat to make anything taste good, but a nuanced blend of specific spices will make something far, far better. The more good food you eat, the worse sugar and fat will taste.

When something is considered unwatchable, that's only because we have seen so much *better* tv that we recognize the sugar and fat, and it tastes bad.

>How do I have an unusual taste in television? I mentioned acclaimed shows

You really like children's television."
Astro Boy,"Batman - The Animated Series from 30 years ago?!
    
i've probably seen every episode but it's crazy to think you can use an acronym for anything so dated"
Astro Boy,"Yes, it's OK.  Kind of uneven episode to episode. However, I think we're done, because I really don't care about your opinions.  Enjoy your old dead television and linear TV."
Astro Boy,"If you have to pay by watching time, how much are you willing to spend to decide if the show is for you?"
Astro Boy,"How long is each One Piece episode? And did you skip the filler?

12 episodes in animated shows are much less time than 12 episodes in a live-action ones. It's far easier to watch many episodes in an animated show"
Astro Boy,"I don't forget that. I could never forget that. But I know how a lot of so-called ""flaws"" are just personal taste. And I always try to keep an open mind and not be judgmental. I recommend this thread.

Astro Boy,"My english can improve a lot (and my spoken english is terrible), but I'm good enough to have good natural written conversations in the internet and watch YouTube videos.

Critical analysis can be a great thing. And God knows how much I have heavily analysed and critiqued the shows I love, and why I love them, and what their debatable flaws might be too (and I'm under no delusion that what I love must perfect, perfection is ""overrated"", and that's the only time you'll ever see me using the word ""overrated""). But there is so much bullshit, destructive, prejudiced and judgmental criticism out there too (children's shows are often a victim of said criticisms, which I adressed in a recent thread called ""Adressing some of the most common unfair complaints against kids' shows""). 

https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/s7szwq/adressing_some_of_the_most_common_unfair/

And ultimately, the love for any piece of art won't ever be fully explained by logic. I really go into a lot of detail about this in the thread link I shared to you in the previous reply. I honestly think that OP is the best text I ever wrote. I'll think I might repost it someday in this subreddit.

I'll also ask one thing: do you really think that the ""almost unwatchable"" label is fair to throw at the first season of The Simpsons, the first season of Avatar, and the first season of Justice League? Because believe it or not, I've seen people being THAT overly harsh."
Astro Boy,It's still massively popular
Astro Boy,"I can almost hear you arrogantly saying ""the future is now, old man"" in your last phrases.

Ugh, I'm done with you too"
Astro Boy,"Let's straigth things up, I apologize for my overly passional, angry and rude tone."
Astro Boy,"You don't have to pay. End of story. I won't indulge in your silly question and ridiculous analogy (and I pirate everything I watch anyway). Please, read my comment and the link."
Astro Boy,people are allowed to have their own standards.
Astro Boy,Passional isn’t a word. Just fyi
Astro Boy,"I apologize for my tone also, but I do think we know where each other stand, and I don't think there is much benefit in continuing the discussion."
Astro Boy,It is not an analogy. It is a question quantifying the value. And we just find out how much your fairness is worth to you.
Astro Boy,"I would rather use the word ""tastes"" rather than ""standards"". The word ""standards"" can be really judgmental.

I don't forget that. I could never forget that. But I know how a lot of so-called ""flaws"" are just personal taste. And I always try to keep an open mind and not be judgmental. I recommend this thread.

Astro Boy,"Thanks, I'm not a native english speaker"
Astro Boy,"I just think we both went overboard and too extreme in our opinions and tone. Let's just forget that, it's not worth it."
Astro Boy,"And it does not make sense because we don't need to pay money based on watch time! Jesus, you put this discussion off the rails! Please, read what I linked to you and adress that!"
Astro Boy,"No worries!  You should say “apologies for my overly *passionate*  argument”

Hope that helps"
Astro Boy,"He's saying you pay with time. My time does have value, and I'm not looking to spend it watching TV I'm not enjoying. 

To your point about being fair to art, i would agree that we don't need to go shout out that things are shit just because we don't like them. Something isn't bad just because I don't like it.  But at the same time I am under no obligation to like something just because others do."
Astro Boy,Thanks
Astro Boy,"I'm NOT saying you should suffer through many of hours for any show when watching said show makes you feel miserable. If I'm truly hating something, I won't invest a lot of time watching it, nothing against the show or who loves it.

When I ask for patience, I don't mean to that level. I mean more like being understanding that a first season of any show, even the best ones (hell, maybe specially the best ones) can have its flashes of brilliance, but be far inferior to what comes after, and have many bad episodes. I gave examples in the OP, like The Simpsons, Avatar, Justice League to show you what I mean.

Ultimately, do what puts less pressure and stress on you. Don't have high expectations for any show, don't have a rigorous watching schedule, just expect a decent flick, so your enjoyment of the greatest masterpieces will also be more natural, and you won't burn yourself with hype backlash (which is always unfair to a show and its fans). You are not obligated to like or disliking anything. What is more important is to be respectful and non-judgmental of others. I want a world in which art is as diverse as possible, including art that is not for me."

Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,This was a great read.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Delta state was the shit!
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,It was on both actually
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Amazon will over pay for everything except writers.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,This guy is obviously a racist.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Both the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are basically adventure stories. They follow a limited cast of characters through their short-term adventures.

I don't believe this was the correct approach to take with Rings of Power. The Second Age is a long-term story primarily about politics and intrigue. They had to go out their way to introduce 'adventures' - and none of those adventures are particularly compelling or (within the context of the larger story) meaningful."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I think you are trying to pass off poorly substantiated personal opinions as being some kind of break from ""the storytelling textbook.""

For example you claim we learn nothing meaningful about Galadriel at the beginning. We do, about her relationship with her brother. You simply dismiss this by saying ""well I personally don't like this kind of plotline.""

Or another example:

>Finding Sauron’s mark in the cave, also doesn’t change Galadriel. She was obsessed with Sauron before, and she’s obsessed with Sauron after.

This is a completely nonsensical standard. The character was *just* introduced. This is the first set piece in the show. Why on earth should her character *change* in one of the first scenes? Her character needs to be established first, which is what the scene is clearly doing. What screenwriting book says a character should change in their first big scene in a *pilot*?"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,[deleted]
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"If it wasn’t for Galadriel it would at least be watchable. Whether you’re coming from the books or just the movies, they butchered her character worse than any adaptation of a preexisting character I’ve ever seen"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Small spoiler for episode 4  
>!There was a moment in the 4th episode when Galadriel fled and the guards were screaming while looking for her ""THE ELF ESCAPED, FIND HER"", like they were just running at random up to that point. Like no shit.. she escaped and you are currently looking for her, why do you need to reiterate it for the viewer, we saw what happened.!<  


That moment I knew that the writing were beyond bad."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I like it
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I've enjoyed it so far but there's problems.

Not everything is bad because its not 10/10 imo"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I disagree with you almost entirely. I saw all the hate online, so I watched the first episode. Wasn’t a fan but I decided to watch all of the main movies before I judged so I watched all extended cuts of the movie. I do dislike allot about the show but I think your points are weak.

“Three hours of set up is a bit much” 
Brother the first movie is between 3 and 4 hours depending on the version you watch and is pretty much all set up

“We don’t get an established status quo”
I completely disagree with your take here. It would take another entire movie series to properly tell the story that was paraphrase at the beginning. And I think you dislike RoP because that’s the story you wanted. 

The status quo was pretty well established in that paraphrase flash back. Elves go to war to help middle earth, her brother fights in that war, he dies and she’s clearly out for revenge more than anything. 

Nobody wants to see a soap opera or high school drama about what her life was like before the war. She was living a life of luxury in the elf land, who wants to really see that. That’s not what Lotr is about.

“We don’t get a convincing inciting incident”
What?? Elves went to war to help humans because they saw a threat spreading. They went out to prevent that threat from being able to ever get to their doorstep. 

Then her brother died like you mentioned yourself. Having your family member killed is enough motivation to seek revenge.

“Finding the mark in the cave doesn’t change her”

Why would this change her? She went there looking for a sign that he was back….and she finds a sign that he’s back which solidified she’s right to continue searching despite her all her comrades telling her it’s over. Which establishes a reason for her be conflicted with doing as she’s told or going against the powers that be and doing what she knows is probably the right thing to do. And goes rogue.

“Unnecessary conflict”
I disagree as mentioned above

“Too many storylines”
I disagree, a hand full of story lines that converge at the end is standard LoTR just based on the main movies.

“It doesn’t feel like lord of the rings”

I say this as someone that genuinely doesn’t give a fuck about this IP. I can take it or leave it. I had never fully watched any of the movies in 20 years until the show came out. I WATCHED ALL OF THEM BACK TO BACK over the course of a week or so just to be able to properly judge this show.

There’s plenty to hate about this show. I definitely hate less about it after watching the other IP because there was allot I didn’t understand going into it. However….

Saying that this show isn’t LoTR tells me that the other IP isn’t fresh in your head. This show is very LoTR. If anything it’s allot more focused then main movies. 

I think you have issues because you wanted a different story, a different timeline or something because this show has everything in it that it should have. The travel on the road is happening just separately right now. She’s traveling with a companion and building a friendship. The harfoot(?) is traveling with a friend and building a friendship. The only one that’s alone is the other Elf. And I would 100% bet they’re all going to come together and form a party at some point for a common goal.

Everyone’s entitled to their opinion but I think mfers that say this isn’t LoTR is just hating on shit just to hate"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I was lukewarm on the show for a couple episodes but I'm absolutely enjoying it now. I think they're making a fine series.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Totally agree, there is not much of a story, just glimpses into unconnected events and gorgeous visuals.

I think the whole season is meant as a setup. Maybe we get an inciting incident in the season finale, but the goal is to stretch the story out over as many seasons as possible. And when cancellation looms they'll wrap it up as fast as possible, if we get lucky.

But as I mentioned before: gorgeous visuals."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Somebody made the point that this will likely fail. Simply due to the fact that it's near impossible for Amazon to make THAT much money back per episode.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"The funny thing with blaming the writing is that it's so subjective, it's an easy foil for anything else.

I enjoyed episode 4 immensely. Things had been a bit fast and unfocused before then, but the show is finding its footing."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Good post op. Good job not ranting, I liked your points"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Rings of power is a miss for me. When Tolkien said that ultimately the epic story of LOTR is a catholic one, any non canon extensions of this story will be anything but garbage. After watching a few episodes- I was far removed from the Middle Earth universe that Tolkien created. You cannot add or take away anything from a master classic epic."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Yall’r racist cmon now, the shows great and your intolerance is showing 🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Do we know how many seasons of the show are for sure coming out?
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Great writeup. Agree with everything you said. 

There is no audience hook other than this world being set in Middle Earth. That's the only thing keeping me watching - I'm obsessed with Tolkien so I consume anything relating to his world... Even if it's a 5/10 like RoP"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"It's actually showing how badly written it is, especially the 4th episode. The visuals are no longer enough to hide its terrible writing. Maybe wait for another episode, but I still doubt there is going to be improvement.

Amazon is willing to overpay everything except its writers, i guess."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Excellent piece. Thank you. I also appreciate your take from story telling perspective, specially folktale perspective. Using suggestions like yours, the story in rings of power would follow a similar template as LoTR and Hobbit in a deeper level."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,[deleted]
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I'd say on average the show is...fine. I'm a visual person and Numenor is just how I imagined it. The pacing and structure are not great. I think the acting is good, especially Elrond and the original characters like Arondir. But I super super wish there wasn't so much jumping around. They have not spent enough time developing Galadriel, which seems to happen all the time with main characters? I wouldn't call it butchered but they should have hired MUCH better writers."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Lengthy subjective judgments grow no more weighty when wrapped in  an overlong post. Get a life.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Same with Wheel of Time. As well as directors, cinematographers etc.

I'm praying that they at least listened to the feedback and try to stick to the story from now on. Don't fix what isn't broken.

What was the point in cutting out so much only to make up new material instead?"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,They paid for the downvotes on this post lol. The internet manipulation is off the charts
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Gennifer Hutchinson
Justin Double
Jason Cahill
Stephanie Folsom
Helen Shang

Please look up these new and stop being ignorant"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"ya hes probably sexist, anti- semtic, and other fashionable trending words of hatred."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Like Arondir is exploring some place, and then he gets captured by orcs, and some stuff happens, but then the bad guy just lets him go, and then he goes back.. and does any of this matter? Does this matter to the larger story of the show or did they just need to show us some stuff through a plot for this character they invented? Is this really what the show should be about?"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,">  We do, about her relationship with her brother.

We had one short scene with here brother. So one scene with her as a child other then that we know nothing about the brother. And the scene with here brother was very, very strange philosophical talk (that might make sense to some people but didn't make much sense to me).

Then it was just used as the most basic 'revenge trope' narrative ever. There is nothing very interesting here. 

> This is the first set piece in the show. Why on earth should her character change in one of the first scenes? 

I agree with this."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"We learn that Galadriel was a child and had an older brother.

That is not meaningful information.

This is the first set piece in the show. Why on earth should her character change in one of the first scenes? 

I'm talking about motivation.

Her motivation should change. Not the character."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"OP is just spouting bunch of nonsense. Half of what they are saying is about how the films do things differently than the series. They are two different mediums and work in completely different rhythms. 

Luckily real world isn't as circle-jerky as r slash television."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"The reason I find all these criticisms so tiring is because people make all these obviously biased or just dumb as hell points and then act like they aren't obviously stupid to everyone who reads them.

It's what separates bandwagon hate from normal discourse."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Yes I think beautiful but soulless describes the issue pretty well. Its seen as outdated now, but the fact is Tolkien was a serious Catholic who created an ordered moral universe where it feels like every action has meaning because it is connected to the struggle of good vs evil. Not to mention a professor who wove in themes as diverse as WWI, language, life in rural england, and the industrial revolution. Audiences can sense all this. It reminds me of one of those graphics card demos where the light effects are cool but there is no story."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I like what they're trying to do I theory. Making her a badass warrior. But where is her magic and wisdom? She's brash to the point of stupidity. Why is some 20 year old dude able to give her advice?
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,You can pull up a cops episode and see that happen irl. Also lines like that are typically for the audience anyway. What a weird thing to complain about.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,[deleted]
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Yeah it’s awful. The writing almost seems like a parody at some points as the characters are actively explaining things and emotions that don’t need to be explained. Tolkien’s lore regularly ignored throughout. Visually it’s nice but that’s to be expected in this day and age especially with a production with its budget. Complete snooze fest.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,I chose to believe it as comedy to cut the tension lol.
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,Is...is this a joke?
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,[deleted]
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"It's bad because it's a 2, maybe 3 out of 10.

You have the sound turned on right? Like you listened to the words coming out of the actors mouths, and heard the pure nonsense spouting non stop? I sure did."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"For real. Drives me nuts that everything has to be either a masterpiece or worthless trash now. It's not great, but I mostly like it"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Conversely, not everything is good because it's not 1/10"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Yes. I think people who love Tolkien's work are disappointed it's not even good or great. It's very poor/mediocre writing, characterization, plot... With 10/10 visuals (outside of a few hiccups where it's clearly set in a stage) and music"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,">“We don’t get an established status quo” I completely disagree with your take here. It would take another entire movie series to properly tell the story that was paraphrase at the beginning.

That... has nothing to do with presenting a status quo..."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Or maybe they know what they are missing. I see this comment all the time, that they are just hating to hate. I really want this series to work. But..  frequently I find myself tapping my fingers and the thought pops into my head, ""they are wasting time on this storyline! It adds nothing to the story except dullness and is boring!"""
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"I don’t think Rings of Power was ever meant to provide a direct return on the money invested

Amazon wanted to have a proper prestige hit show that would elevate Prime to the upper echelon of TV content producers, increase long term subscription numbers and hope the people that buy Prime for RoP and up watching other shows and staying with it"
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"It’s possible that Amazon realized this from the start, and was willing to take the loss, as long as it pays off in the long run. Hard to say at this point tho."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,">The funny thing with blaming the writing is that it's so subjective

It isn't. People have been writing stories for thousand of years and collectively we have worked out what works and what doesn't work.

What you are talking about is enjoyment. That is indeed subjective."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"> it's so subjective,

Bulshit. There is nothing subjective about bad writing."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Coherent writing is subjective? 

This is truly 2022.

The lines are sometimes even not connected to what is happening on the screen..."
Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"OP posted critique not mentioning race once.

You then idiotically bring up race. Get the fuck outta here"

Joanna Lumleys Silk Road Adventure,"Don't be such a negative Nancy, Allen. Some of them are good but they are not the best they could have gotten. Also didn't Folsom's show just get cancelled the other week by Amazon lol? Loved the comics but that adaptation was a train wreck. 

You know would have been great in the writing room. Bruno Heller. Also you might [need this.](https://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/commas.asp)"

Joanna Lumleys Japan,"So they can cancel it after one season?

Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Lol!!!! Interesting choice of title when Netflix has become notorious for pulling the plug on good shows after one season. Yea you aren’t fooling me again Netflix! It’ll have terrible viewership because nobody wants to waste their time getting invested into any more Netflix shows that get cancelled after season one. Which will ultimately lead to it being cancelled after season one … see how that works Netflix? You are unknowingly, preemptively tanking your own shows, alienating and punishing your customers for your own failures, and you’re too stupid to realize it."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Fool me once, I'm mad. Fool me twice, how could you. Fool me three times, you're officially that guy, okay? You know him, you know the one. You go up to the bar and he's like, ""This suit is, uh, officially it's a Giorgio Armani, ech, my dad knows him."" Fuck you! I aaaaain't havin' that sh*t!"

Joanna Lumleys Japan,"It's literally an 8-episode limited series, so I mean I guess if you consider ""we only ever intended for one season"" to be canceling it after one season then sure."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Fuck em, I’ve already been fooled…."
Joanna Lumleys Japan,"Quite fond of the first series of this, but something about the second series didn't really click for me."
