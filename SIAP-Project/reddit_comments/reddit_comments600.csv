The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,He was so good in that skit. I wonder how many takes it took‚Ä¶Jerry is ready to bust up at every turn.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,I've got a flash for you joy boy!
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Like an ice cream man named Cone.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"‚ÄúWell, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says ""New York Public Library""? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot. Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior. Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better? Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy: Party time is over. Y'got seven days, Seinfeld. That is one week!‚Äù"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Rip bookman
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Rock was never my bag.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Seinfeld was an amazing show, however the titular character was so bad at acting, lol. Everyone was running circles around him."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Everytime he does a dramatic point or turn Jerry looks like he's going to crack.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Jerry was always about to bust up lol
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,You and your good time buddies.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,How did this show even exist.  There's never been a comedy since that even remotely had this level of writing!
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,That's part of the joke.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Yes, that spin and point. Jerry‚Äôs not usually semi cracked up, which makes me think they must‚Äôve said, this is as good as we‚Äôll get today lol"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Hall nearly broke when he said joy boy.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Oh it was flagrant lol. 

""What kinda name is 'Todd GACK'?""

""I think it's Dutch""üòÅ"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,What about Curb which is **literally** the same writer.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Larry was not the sole writer of Seinfeld.   Curb is great of course, but I don't think it's ever had something as inspired as Bookman, or numerous other Seinfeld scenes."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Was this a book first? If so I‚Äôll read it before it starts

Edit: ooo Adelaide Clemens! She is not in enough, only seen her in that Edie Falco ‚ÄúTommy‚Äù show, which was standard broadcast television 

One of my favourite characters and actors from rectify."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Lot of shit coming this and next month.  Sort of crazy,"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,April 28th for those wondering.

The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Poggers
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Hulu? So will it be on Disney+ for us non-Americans?
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Yes, the book was excellent."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Yeah it‚Äôs a nonfiction book by the excellent Jon Krakauer. It‚Äôs very graphic and disturbing but also super informative and interesting
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,The book is fantastic! Highly recommend. I‚Äôm so excited for this show
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,yes! its really informative and interesting. cannot recommend it enough.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Yes.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Number 12 on 1 copies at my library now, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they picked up more copies with a show coming out"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,It‚Äôs a pretty old book.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"So was the first wheel of time book, only had one copy when the show came out, now it has 24 copies"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Never heard of that book. I will check it out. Thanks

The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Love that open‚Ä¶ You might appreciate this one too.

The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,[deleted]
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,I have never skipped Daredevil and Black Sails' intro. They were great too.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,I always thought the [intro to American Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBkoG-8E-2w) was underrated.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"It is in my top 3 for sure, but Twin Peaks has one that is essential in my opinion. It immediately forces you to slow down and puts you into such a specific vibe, just sets the show up perfectly.

&#x200B;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFMaEIHIrGw"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Game of Thrones has lost a lot of it's lustre due to it's crappy finish but it's opening theme and animation are still amazing
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Probably my four favourite openings. In any order. Red Swan is definitely more for people who are watching the show though. Otherwise, it might not seem on the same level as these others.

The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Such a mesmerizing song as well‚Ä¶even on the second binge of Season One I never skipped the open‚Ä¶
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,The intro to Mary Hartman Mary Hartman is so cool that it inspired Twin Peaks' ouroboric ending. It's so cool that Ornette Coleman had to cover it. That's cool.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Whole different era with different capabilities, but I always thought the intro to The Equalizer was a great integration of editing and music https://youtu.be/g87nDBIyqeU"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Nobody in here gonna mention Dark?
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,The Doom Patrol intro is pretty sick if you ask me. https://youtu.be/yK5oeV_JYy0
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Loved this one: https://youtu.be/bHo3Vg5U67c
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Can‚Äôt believe no one has shared the Key and Peele theme where they parody this. Absolute perfection.

The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Black Sails
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,[Raised By Wolves ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHyq5UCVh4w) really stood out to me.

The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,[Only Murders in the Building has a fantastic intro.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rljU2-GUIJ4)
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,The intro fits the vibe of this show so perfectly. Everything about this show is amazing except ending was kinda boring
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Check out the Daredevil intro if you‚Äôve never seen it. Pretty sure done by the same ppl as this intro and music is amazing
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,I loved the second seasons theme as well
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Mindhunter also had a good opening
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Little less known than others, but Warrior was always excellent for me. &nbsp;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Anf2riXFw"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,How many days are you going to post this?
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"I'm very partial to:

1. What we do in the shadows
2. Highlander: the tv show"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fPgIIB67bw
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Dude! Fucking sick.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Haha this almost makes me want to rewatch GoT. Almost. I‚Äôll rewatch TD instead
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,My favorite show intro of all time! Gives me chills. It‚Äôs probably the only intro I‚Äôve never once skipped.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Wow that was really good. It makes me want to watch Carnivale. The only reason I haven't is bc it got canceled but I've always meant to get around to it
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,What  happened to S9s intro?
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Oh man, black sails. I usually watch an intro a couple of times and then start skipping, I think I watched that like 3/4 of the time"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"American Gods has one of the most surreal, mindfucky intros and its amazing. I only watched S1, always held off on S2 because I've heard it's not... great. Still, S1 was so good."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"I love this song, so calming. Even though I know too much."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"The Dexter intro is one of my favorites as well. I always really enjoyed how the one coffee bean spins across the screen for some reason.  

Edit: Cowboy Bebop and AoT are on my list also."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Whoever did the CGI fuckin' nailed it. Goes great with the heaviness of the song.

Had to add it to spotify, The Handsome Family ""Far From Any Road"""
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,my.... heads..... spinning....
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Carnivale is one of my favourite shows. The good news is  that even tho show didn't reach it's conclusion, it was planned as 3 arcs 2 seasons each with time skips between them so it does have great final episode that ties a lot of plot 
together. I  cannot recommend this show highly enough for it's atmosphere, performance and mythology."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Don't do it. Of all the shows that got cancelled over the years this is the one i absolutely mourn, for a lack of a better word. So much originality, stellar cast. I watched it when it originally aired and that cancellation was an absolute gutpunch."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Ugh that show sucks lol. Sorry, I agree with the cancelation. I wanted it to be good but lacked any focus and was better at atmosphere more that substance."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Didn't know that, I'll check it out"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"I'm like 7 episodes in, I'm fucked already"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,That intro is good though
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Weak trolling.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Hope you enjoy it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs brilliant.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Dude, enjoy. Easily in the top five of all shows i've ever watched and i watched way too many."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Not trolling, that show has some TERRIBLE acting and the story was WEAK"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Finished the first couple episodes and I'm totally hooked
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Dust bowl carnival was never appealing to me but the atmosphere is so good
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"That‚Äôs awesome Paul, enjoy!"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Such a stellar show. Best two leads I think Ive ever seen.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"The transition with the daughter was rough!

Such an excellent scene in such an excellent season!"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Glad I‚Äôm not the only one who though that
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Yeah some of the writing might be lightly plagurized, however I maintain that this specific season has some of the best camera work and acting that HBO's ever done."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,There‚Äôs nothing lightly about the plagiarism.
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"> The series is being written by *Band of Brothers* alumnus [John Orloff](https://deadline.com/tag/john-orloff/) and [Graham Yost](https://deadline.com/tag/graham-yost/), who are also co-executive producers. Orloff is writing the series. 

That's reassuring"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,[deleted]
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"True Detective season 1 is still one of the best seasons of a show that I‚Äôve ever watched. 

I can‚Äôt wait to see what he does with this."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"I could have sworn there was a teaser trailer made for this, like years ago. I figured it either never happened or just fizzled out."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Holy fuck finally.

This has been in development hell forever."
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"Wasn't Cary supposed to direct the Kubrick napoleon script as an Hbo mini series? Wonder what happened with that, either way I am excited for whatever he does next, dude is great"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,Maniac was pretty good too. Guy is talented
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,"I swear, I just finished Band Of Brothers for the first time yesterday, of course, it's a masterpiece and then I found that this was greenlit, but the only article I found was from 2019 and nothing since, so, I was hoping there would be some news on the show and then this popped up. Can't wait. (I know about The Pacific, it's my next watch.)"
The Millionaire Detective - Balance: UNLIMITED,OMG OMG OMG OMG It's HAPPENING! It's been so long since The Pacific.
Brews Brothers,"I see where they are trying to be like The League. Except the cast is a lot less talented. This show really isn‚Äôt very good.

Is this show made like The League where the actors improvise much of their dialogue?"
Brews Brothers,It's like there were no jokes.  it's like they just tried to be as gross as possible and make a ton of peepee poopoo jokes. Was this writtwn by middle School students? It's embarrassing that this was ever made.
Brews Brothers,Horrible show
Brews Brothers,This is the worst show I've watched in a while. To be fair the Netflix trailer is pretty accurate: the show is as bad as it looks.
Brews Brothers,"As a person in craft beer industry - it truly pains me to watch. If no one has any idea of how a brewery operates they might actually believe this. It‚Äôs
not easy, it‚Äôs tiring , it takes tons of knowledge in both mechanics, science , business. It was outright appalling and a slight to our industry as a whole. 

You would think Netflix (or anyone else ) would spend at least a single day in a brewery to see how it operates. Some of these scenes were downright dangerous - even for the actors. 

Two thumbs way down."
Brews Brothers,Thought they were bringing back ‚ÄòEasy‚Äô for a split second reading the title. :(
Brews Brothers,This show blows and everyone on it should feel bad.
Brews Brothers,I hope the show gets cancelled. Chuy is fucking garbage and annoying. The preppy brother can fuck off and that stupid pussy of an owner can eat shit. The ok one in the show is the girl and that‚Äôs still pushing it.  The shows annoys the fuck out of me. Tried for 3 episodes. It can go straight to hell.
Brews Brothers,"Thought it's a spin-off from Easy, another Netflix series,  which also feature characters of brothers who make brews and Dave Franco stars as one of the brothers."
Brews Brothers,Mike Castle is hysterical; glad he's getting more exposure.
Brews Brothers,Missed opportunity to not have a Dan Aykroyd caneo
Brews Brothers,"So sad that show is over, I would have watched ten more seasons."
Brews Brothers,"As much as I agree with a lot of this list, I feel San Junipero needs to be on there somewhere."
Brews Brothers,"Great list. I probably would have some things different in my top 10 (The Americans for certain, WW higher), but I love every one of those shows."
Brews Brothers,"my top episode is definitely '**San Junipero**'. One of the greatest hours of television i've ever saw. 

Interesting to see you picking 'Juneteen' over 'The Club' or 'B.A.N' for Atlanta tho. And also you pick the 3 uncut shot episode of You're the Worst over ""Twenty-Two""

Besides that there's nothing i can argue with. fantastic list"
Brews Brothers,Silicone Valley huh? That would be....an interesting show 
Brews Brothers,"Good list but with three glaring omissions. People vs OJ, The Americans and stranger things. "
Brews Brothers,"""Kissing Your Sister"" was a great episode but if Veep must get the top spot then ""Mother"" was definitely the superior episode for me. I don't usually find Veep very laugh-out-loud comedy but this episode hit every single fucking note right and was exactly what Veep should've been all this time, instead of the inconsistent mess it often becomes."
Brews Brothers,"Stranger Things isn't on your list, therefore it is invalid."
Brews Brothers,Was The Leftovers in 2015? Or have you just not seen it?
Brews Brothers,"I would add Stranger Things, just because that was great entertainment. I would drop Westworld which I didn't even finish. I tought to myself after a few episodes. Five seasons of this? How long can they stretch this out? You said yourself the fans figured it out before the end and you don't know what's going to happen next season. Not a good combo. Other than that I would put GOT and Bojack 1 & 2. Great year for TV, huh?"
Brews Brothers,My top episode this year is *return 0* from Person of Interest. Few shows have had endings as good as PoI's.
Brews Brothers,San Junipero was truly amazing. Definitely my favorite Black Mirror episode and a contender fr best of the year. It was interesting to see an episode that was uplifting for a change.
Brews Brothers,"1. Westworld
2. BrainDead
3. The Americans
4. Peaky Blinders
5. Game of Thrones
6. Bojack Horseman
7. It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
8. Mr. Robot
9. Black Mirror
10. Banshee"
Brews Brothers,"I am very shamed to say that I have yet to watch The Americans. I am currently watching Mad Men for the first time, The Americans is next on the list."
Brews Brothers,"Atlanta had so many good episodes and aftr watching them all several times ""Juneteenth"" rose to the top for me. It was a cool and funny way to explore the relationship dynamic of Earn and Van.

""B.A.N"" was an honorable mention in my heart because of Brian Tyree Henry's powerful acting."
Brews Brothers,Have not seen People Vs. OJ or The Americans
Brews Brothers,I really really loved Stranger Things. I ran through the whole thing twice when it first came out. When I sat down to make my list it was definitely a hard one to leave out but these are just my opinions 
Brews Brothers,Leftovers was 2015. I'm actually doing a rewatch right now. Incredibly compelling television 
Brews Brothers,Season 2 of Leftovers was as good as it gets.   
Brews Brothers,"Yes, and it ended in the middle of December in 2015, so it was close. "
Brews Brothers,"I would recommend finishing Westworld, I think it does a really good job of somehow both wrapping itself up and setting up for a second season."
Brews Brothers,"I guess the way I worded it sounded bad. The fan theories were a fun way for the community to analyze the episodes after watching for clues. The reveals felt rewarding rather that disappointing because of all the hard work we put in.

As for the ending, I was saying that Season 2 has so many possibilities and currently I don't know which one they will go with."
Brews Brothers,[deleted]
Brews Brothers,"Similarly I've only seen first 1/3 of Mad Men (the perils of trying to binge with roommates), but overall, The Americans might be my favourite show period."
Brews Brothers,"They have 5 planned out at least. If the rest are any like this one, then HBO won't cancel it."
Brews Brothers,Seems like this week is the week for shows that didn't get promoted and are there just to fill in slots. Hopefully there are a few gems that stick around for quite a while!
Brews Brothers,"Watched the Super Fun Night pilot.  It was really rough.  Rebel Wilson was struggling with the American accent the whole time, and there were a couple out-of-place, incredibly dark jokes that just killed the tone of the scene they were in.  Skip it."
Brews Brothers,Ironside: a guy in a wheelchair and three models pretending to be cops get *street justice*.
Brews Brothers,[deleted]
Brews Brothers,Have I Got News For You is the only one I'm looking forward to.
Brews Brothers,I actually enjoy Murdoc Mysteries and it will be bumping Hostages from my OTA PVR recording list. Can't wait to fast forward through the CBC commercials.
Brews Brothers,I just saw the trailer and you know what they say when you try to market something by capitalizing on your past work and name dropping. 
Brews Brothers,"Hey, I cannot find the typo, can you point it out for me?"
Brews Brothers,It's Have I not I Have.
Brews Brothers,fixed
Brews Brothers,"Undergrads was a lot of fun. Was a shame it was a one season wonder. 

You might want to check out Resident Advisors on Hulu. It's a college based sitcom about living in the dorms. Not exactly Undergrads, but it has its moments"
Brews Brothers,"Creator Pete Williams had some kerfuffle with MTV and DHX over the years because of funding issues and does not have the legal rights to the series he created but he's not giving up to this day. Apparently, he was working on a film script treatment last year."
Brews Brothers,Are you really asking where cartoon people are now?
Brews Brothers,"Or Community.
Or Undeclared."
Persona 5: The Animation,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up ‚Äî and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he‚Äôd typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland‚Äôs colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they‚Äôd hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt have seen him in weeks, and then you‚Äôd see the car come in, which was insane.‚Äù Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fianc√©e, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. ‚ÄúIt was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,‚Äù says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a ‚Äúreally creepy‚Äù text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to run it up the flagpole,‚Äù says one of the sources, ‚Äúand then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.‚Äù

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland‚Äôs involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he‚Äôd take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show‚Äôs writers room, even when it‚Äôs been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show‚Äôs leads. ‚ÄúHe knew the power of being the voices,‚Äù says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he‚Äôs simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show‚Äôs third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Persona 5: The Animation,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Persona 5: The Animation,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Persona 5: The Animation,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they‚Äôll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Persona 5: The Animation,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I‚Ä¶

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry‚Äôs most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

‚Ä¶while also‚Ä¶

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Persona 5: The Animation,Why is he Sonic
Persona 5: The Animation,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Persona 5: The Animation,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Persona 5: The Animation,"A tale as old as time: ‚ÄúWe were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn‚Äôt want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.‚Äù"
Persona 5: The Animation,"It‚Äôs amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Persona 5: The Animation,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Persona 5: The Animation,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Persona 5: The Animation,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Persona 5: The Animation,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though ü§û"
Persona 5: The Animation,"As a fan of the show (who‚Äôs used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs so obviously Dan harmon‚Äôs show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Persona 5: The Animation,Never meet your heroes
Persona 5: The Animation,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Persona 5: The Animation,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Persona 5: The Animation,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Persona 5: The Animation,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Persona 5: The Animation,"‚ÄúMore recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven‚Äôt heard from him in years, and when they have, it‚Äôs been unpleasant.‚Äù

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I‚Äôm not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I‚Äôve always felt like he‚Äôs been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I‚Äôd be curious to see what else he came up with, but it‚Äôs always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that‚Äôs the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Persona 5: The Animation,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Persona 5: The Animation,"‚ÄúI turned my self into a felon, Morty! I‚Äôm WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!‚Äù"
Persona 5: The Animation,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Persona 5: The Animation,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn‚Äôt show up to work and thinks he‚Äôs the hottest shit for the work he doesn‚Äôt show up to anymore"
Persona 5: The Animation,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Persona 5: The Animation,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Persona 5: The Animation,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Persona 5: The Animation,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Persona 5: The Animation,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Persona 5: The Animation,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Persona 5: The Animation,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Persona 5: The Animation,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Persona 5: The Animation,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Persona 5: The Animation,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt worry about that‚Äîof course, it‚Äôs natural‚ÄîI‚Äôm saying‚Ä¶Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Persona 5: The Animation,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Persona 5: The Animation,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there‚Äôs been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it‚Äôs true.
Persona 5: The Animation,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Persona 5: The Animation,Never go full John K
Persona 5: The Animation,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn‚Äôt right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Persona 5: The Animation,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Persona 5: The Animation,"It‚Äôs always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Persona 5: The Animation,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the ‚Äúmethod acting‚Äù behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Persona 5: The Animation,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Persona 5: The Animation,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Persona 5: The Animation,"Someday, maybe ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Persona 5: The Animation,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Persona 5: The Animation,Can‚Äôt trust someone in thin glasses
Persona 5: The Animation,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago ü§î"
Persona 5: The Animation,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Persona 5: The Animation,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Persona 5: The Animation,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It‚Äôs no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Persona 5: The Animation,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Persona 5: The Animation,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Persona 5: The Animation,Ah geez üò≥
Persona 5: The Animation,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Persona 5: The Animation,100 years
Persona 5: The Animation,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Persona 5: The Animation,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Persona 5: The Animation,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Persona 5: The Animation,"I guess it‚Äôs not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure most people that weren‚Äôt totally disgusted by it were thinking ‚Äúholy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff‚Äù. Fast forward and‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Persona 5: The Animation,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Persona 5: The Animation,"I‚Äôve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a ‚Äúparted ways‚Äù statement on standby."
Persona 5: The Animation,How is this a surprise. He‚Äôs a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn‚Äôt help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Persona 5: The Animation,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don‚Äôt impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Persona 5: The Animation,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Persona 5: The Animation,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Persona 5: The Animation,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Persona 5: The Animation,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Persona 5: The Animation,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Persona 5: The Animation,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Persona 5: The Animation,But Elon Musk said he‚Äôs the heart of the show!
Persona 5: The Animation,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it‚Äôs always been. I‚Äôm sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Persona 5: The Animation,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Persona 5: The Animation,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Persona 5: The Animation,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Persona 5: The Animation,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Persona 5: The Animation,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn‚Äôt the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to ‚Äúshut the f‚Äî- up‚Äù when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Persona 5: The Animation,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Persona 5: The Animation,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they‚Äôre not bias or clickbaity."
Persona 5: The Animation,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the ‚Äúwe are successful now so we must change‚Äù turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Persona 5: The Animation,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Persona 5: The Animation,Incoming netflix docuseries
Persona 5: The Animation,Yoga
Persona 5: The Animation,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Persona 5: The Animation,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Persona 5: The Animation,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Persona 5: The Animation,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Persona 5: The Animation,It‚Äôs always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. ü§¢
Persona 5: The Animation,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Persona 5: The Animation,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It‚Äôs a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Persona 5: The Animation,"He‚Äôd get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn‚Äôt an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Persona 5: The Animation,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Persona 5: The Animation,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Persona 5: The Animation,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Persona 5: The Animation,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That‚Äôs when it all went downhill quality wise
Persona 5: The Animation,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Persona 5: The Animation,"I first became a fan of Justin‚Äôs when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He‚Äôd even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he‚Äôd come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he‚Äôd come back as Justin and usually say it‚Äôs just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about Justin‚Ä¶ Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it‚Äôs just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Persona 5: The Animation,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
Persona 5: The Animation,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don‚Äôt need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
The Circle France,I don‚Äôt know what this means; but I‚Äôm pretty sure I hate it.
The Circle France,‚ÄúStars‚Äù
The Circle France,I‚Äôll give it a chance‚Ä¶seems like a rip off of Are You The One
The Circle France,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
The Circle France,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
The Circle France,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
The Circle France,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
The Circle France,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
The Circle France,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
The Circle France,That teaser has a low-key creepy vibe that I really like.
The Circle France,[deleted]
The Circle France,"Excited for the 2nd season, though I think I'm hestitant about the cast. So much of what I like about season 1 were the performances by Murray Bartlett and Jake Lacy.

Still, great to see Coolidge return. I usually don't find her very impressive, but I really liked how she played this sort of strange and ethereal woman who seems to have become entirely untethered from reality by a lifetime of obscene wealth; a character that you find yourself feeling sorry for one moment, and despising the next.

That wasn't an easy role and I think she played it very well."
The Circle France,I'm so pumped for season 2! It is indeed an experience
The Circle France,"I ran into a bunch of the actors for this coming up season while I was visiting Sicily. It was crazy. One after another 3 of the actors came near where I was eating. Took a picture with Theo James and chatted with Michael Imperioli for a few minutes outside of the restaurant. Also chatted with F. Murray Abraham. All of them were very nice and took the time to talk about the restaurant we were at. Side note, all of them raved about the restaurant Osteria Santa Dominica. If you are ever in Taormina, eat there."
The Circle France,"Sicily is so beautiful.

I'm excited to see them showcase its beauty while making clear these rich assholes don't deserve it."
The Circle France,"Coolidge was my least favorite character of season one, sad to see that she‚Äôs the only one returning"
The Circle France,Really hyped for this since s1 was the best show of last year. Very curious how this is going to play out and what the music will sound like.
The Circle France,"Underrated show!!!

‚ÄúMy love life is a ruin.‚Äù - Tanya Mcquoid"
The Circle France,"Enjoyed nearly every minute while watching the first season, but when it ended, I knew I'd been had.

The murder story was a pointless tack on, with just a couple minutes at the beginning and the end.  Then Mike White admitted he just added it on when executive notes said their research is that murder shows get way better engagement.  Ugh.  I wasted a season looking for clues that were never written nor shot, because there never was a murder plot in the first place.

Secondly, hate the messed up social message that White hamfistedly tried to force.  

He tries to sell that the people of color and the hospitality workers are all noble but oppressed, and the the white guests were all born bad due to their demographics.

Hooray!  It's another unoriginal lesson. 

But worse, the lesson doesn't match the reality.

The white guests are all actually pretty polite and patient and thoughtful.  They know their privilege, it shames them a bit, and they try not to exploit it.  They make their own forms of attempt to learn, to understand, to reduce their own impact and influence.  The father is clueless about the social diaspora, but he *knows* he is, and he's open to being taught.

The mother and daughter and father are all open and kind and considerate to all the workers and people of color.  And so are the other guests.  Even the guest who has a room issue is remarkably patent considering how he's being treated.

On the other side, the PoCs and service staff are all objectively horrible people.  They lie, steal and denigrate every guest.  One sexually exploits his young employees, and worse.  One exploits a vulnerable guest and tries grifting her.  Viewers are supposed to be sympathetic when her attempts fail.  The others range from listless to larcenous to outright violent.

The local worker commits unprovoked and needless violence.  The daughter's friend is a selfish and surly and ultimately dangerous criminal, yet Mike White expects us to exalt her based on her skin color.  

How anyone watched it and came away thinking the guests were the baddies leaves me shaking my head.

Now, the least interesting and more superfluous character is the one that somehow lands in the second anthology?  Why?"
The Circle France,"In the voice of Courtney Gains: You shit on my suitcase, man!"
The Circle France,I can see that.  And as someone who knows nothing about this show nor has any idea what the first season is about it leaves me wondering ‚Äúwhy would I want to watch this?  It just seems like a fake ad‚Äù
The Circle France,The Hawaiian chorus music they used was hauntingly beautiful.
The Circle France,"Agree, though she makes the most sense as a returning character."
The Circle France,"Yes I do t get the rave reviews for her performance. I preferred Sydney, Alexandra far better and Connie Britton as the bitch mom as well

Coolidge was annoying and her scenes a distraction"
The Circle France,I don‚Äôt think you understood any part of the show at all
The Circle France,"Wow, you wrote all of this just to miss the point of the whole thing. Impressive."
The Circle France,That there exists a person who says Belinda was trying to swindle Tonya is mind-blowing. I‚Äôm speechless üòÇ
The Circle France,"I get what you're saying, but I didn't think the intention of the show was so black and white (no pun intended). I think it's no accident that a lot of the ""privileged"" characters have plenty of good qualities, and I felt like the show was pretty open about interpreting them any number of ways. I really disagreed with the concierge's character, but I didn't feel like that was outside the scope of the show."
The Circle France,First season was just basically a crazy week at a 4-star hotel. Insanity that could actually happen.
The Circle France,"Well, it ain‚Äôt for you then."
The Circle France,"Yeah that‚Äôs fair. Hopefully she‚Äôs limited to a cameo for a scene in one episode, rather than another unimportant plot line tertiary to the rest of the story"
The Circle France,"She is a different character in this one, I believe."
The Circle France,It's clear you didn't.
The Circle France,"Yeah, that money meant nothing to her /s"
The Circle France,"I loved watching to see who would snap first, the concierge or the entitled newlywed."
The Circle France,5star*
The Circle France,I guess not.  Just surprised they wouldn‚Äôt try harder to lure those in who haven‚Äôt given it a chance yet.
The Circle France,same character!
The Circle France,"I mean, if the vibe of the promo is not sparking anything, the whole thing won‚Äôt‚Ä¶ so I guess they are just being honest in not trying to trick you."
The Circle France,[deleted]
The Circle France,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
The Circle France,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
The Circle France,"How you pick what to watch? I‚Äôm overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn‚Äôt much write-ups or reviews in English."
The Circle France,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
The Circle France,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
The Circle France,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"
The Circle France,"What did Frank Ocean say that one time? ""I got two versions. I got twooo versions‚Ä¶""

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
The Circle France,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
The Circle France,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
The Circle France,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
The Circle France,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
The Circle France,"1. She hulk

3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man

The Circle France,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
The Circle France,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
The Circle France,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
The Circle France,üôÇüíï
The Circle France,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
The Circle France,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
The Circle France,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
The Circle France,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
The Circle France,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
The Circle France,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
The Circle France,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
The Circle France,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
The Circle France,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
The Circle France,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
The Circle France,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
The Circle France,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
The Circle France,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
The Circle France,Too bad those mystery boxes were made out of clear glass... Everyone saw those reveals a mile away.
The Circle France,"I was so bothered that the numenor just left. After all those debates, sailing, saving that town, witnessing the creation of Mordor, and they just immediately go home. With their princess now blind. That expedition was an incredible disaster. They accomplished absolutely nothing, then just went home. That entire story line could just be cut.

And why was galadriel so upset with Sauron pretending to be the king, that was *her* idea. She decided entirely in her own he was the king, then she went around introducing him as the king to people, then gets mad when she finally double checks the bullshit she's been spreading, and blames him? What an insufferable person"
The Circle France,Alloyed? More like annoyed‚Ä¶ by the misdirected that no one believed.
The Circle France,What a painfully forced title.
The Circle France,its this compliment?? mystery box is outdated.
The Circle France,"Yeah, I think they should have left Numenor for season 2. Instead they should have focused much more on the elves and, possibly, the dwarves. Make us fall in love with them like LOTR made us fall in love with the Hobbits in the first half an hour or so! 

Even though the pacing was slow, RoP did very little world-building. What are Eregion and Lindon to the audience other than some generic elven cities? Why does everything seem to revolve around four elves (Galadriel, Elrond, Celebrimbor, and Gil-Galad)? Why do these cities seem depopulated? 

And if they didn‚Äôt have humans in season 1 they could have had a huge time jump between S1 and S2 because they wouldn‚Äôt need to worry about human characters dying in the meantime. 

There was so much potential for RoP and it‚Äôs sad to see that it turned out to be a train wreck."
The Circle France,"> What an insufferable person

That's one of my biggest problems with the show. There are plenty of amazing show where most characters are objectively bad or unlikeable, let's take Succession for example - no one there is a good person and I don't really find myself rooting for any of them, but they're all compelling to watch and think about. Meanwhile Galadriel isn't just unlikeable, she's downright infuriating every time she's on the screen and it's a major problem when your main character makes me want to skip ever scene she's in"
The Circle France,">That expedition was an incredible disaster. They accomplished absolutely nothing, then just went home. 

They were routed. They didn't just go home, they retreated. Does the story only matter if the good guys win?"
The Circle France,Not as forced as everything about this show
The Circle France,">‚ÄúAlloyed‚Äù brings down the curtain on the premiere season of The Rings of Power, but it also demonstrates the big structural issues with this eight-episode run.

No."
The Circle France,"Agree, there was no need to introduce Numenor at all. Meet the sailors, see the colonies, but leave it as something to anticipate later. Like a certain sleeping someone should have been..,"
The Circle France,‚ÄúHow can you be here?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHow can YOU be here?‚Äù
The Circle France,"They could have shown anything of the land. There was a supposed kingdom, where is it? Where are the cities of men? The lords, armies, and guardsmen? 

You can say they were routed, but what were they actually going there to do? They didn't seem to have any plan."
The Circle France,"No, but you could have just had Gladriel go back to Linden and demand an ""army"" of 30 elves for the exact same Southlands fight and not had wasted 2 episodes and $100 Million of your CGI Budget."
The Circle France,"Somebody mentioned Pelargir, that's where Bronwyn and Arondir went, I think. That is, in the source material at least, a Numenorean settlement. I thought it was weird that it never come up before that, and that the Numenoreans didn't ever go there?"
The Circle France,"What is the point of your comment? Just do the same thing on a smaller scale, TV budget? It's Bezos' money. If he wants to spend it on blockbuster level spectacle, that's not automatically a bad thing."
The Circle France,"They wasted money, they wasted entire episodes on characters they didn't have to. If they focused on the elves there would have been a bigger ""oh fuck we need to get help from Numenor too"" and could have spent the second season on that instead of 2 episodes that grinded the show to a halt when they have to convince Numenor to come back and help again next season. 

It's all just a fucking waste that led to the show having excruciatingly poor pacing for a pay off of ""oh they're going home now""."
The Circle France,"Substuting one boring thing (rallying Numenor) for another boring thing (rallying Elves), and pushing the former to season 2, probably wouldn't fix the problem you had with it."
The Circle France,"The point is it would have had far fewer characters to juggle and we could have much greater scrutiny of those that were important. The show starts with Celebrimbor wanting to build his tower, but it‚Äôs never mentioned again and Mithril becomes the focus. We get Elrond laced through episodes but the titular story is a back plot to the Southlands. The fact that Galadriel disobeys her king and arguably gods is ignored apart from one conversation in this finale episode.

I think the Southlands plot could have been way stronger if Galadriel was the one discovering the deserted villages etc.

How would the elves of Lindon have reacted to hearing orcs are gathering in great numbers and displacing men? Would they be willing to raise a host? Would they argue to hasten their retreat given the corruption they‚Äôre seeing?

I think it would have been way more thematic.

As it stands though, why are the elves not marching immediately to quell the orcs."
The Circle France,"You know except for the part where they just fuck off to their safe island kingdom in the end. 

Elves would need to fight to get back and ready defenses which sets up a better conflict for a season finale."
The Circle France,"Good grief, did you not pay any attention? At the end of E7, the queen made a vow: ""Our enemies do not know what they have begun... Numenor will return."" 

If you don't like it, fine, but stop spouting this disingenuous claim they ""fucked off back home."" It was a retreat."
The Circle France,"This show is like an American's daydream of a life in Paris. The hot French chef is so drawn to you that he cheats on his great girlfriend, you win over the French marketing firm with your ""American values"" that surprise even the most experienced employees, and you get hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers by posting the most basic photos of your breakfast. 

And you know zero French."
The Circle France,So basically season 2 is no different than the first season.
The Circle France,It‚Äôs fairly amusing seeing people get so worked up and confused about why this show is so popular
The Circle France,"Show caters to audience, not critics; critics in shambles"
The Circle France,"And thats why we love it , shallow escapism to France."
The Circle France,"I laughed so much watching this show, sometimes even when the writers intended me to laugh.  It‚Äôs the goofiest, dumbest thing ever and I love it"
The Circle France,"Yeah, but those eyebrows are amazing"
The Circle France,[removed]
The Circle France,"The funniest thing is to see redditors rip on this show and then talk about how good and original the new marvel movie and tv shows are lol.

Also this show routinely reminds me of how Reddit is not reflective of the population. It‚Äôs reflective of nerdy introverted males who spend most of their time on the internet."
The Circle France,It's like those Hallmark Christmas movies just enjoy it for what it is. A great chance to escape our crappy lives and jobs !
Sakura Wars the Animation,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up ‚Äî and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he‚Äôd typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland‚Äôs colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they‚Äôd hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt have seen him in weeks, and then you‚Äôd see the car come in, which was insane.‚Äù Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fianc√©e, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. ‚ÄúIt was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,‚Äù says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a ‚Äúreally creepy‚Äù text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to run it up the flagpole,‚Äù says one of the sources, ‚Äúand then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.‚Äù

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland‚Äôs involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he‚Äôd take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show‚Äôs writers room, even when it‚Äôs been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show‚Äôs leads. ‚ÄúHe knew the power of being the voices,‚Äù says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he‚Äôs simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show‚Äôs third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Sakura Wars the Animation,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they‚Äôll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I‚Ä¶

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry‚Äôs most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

‚Ä¶while also‚Ä¶

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Why is he Sonic
Sakura Wars the Animation,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Sakura Wars the Animation,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Sakura Wars the Animation,"A tale as old as time: ‚ÄúWe were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn‚Äôt want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.‚Äù"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"It‚Äôs amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though ü§û"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"As a fan of the show (who‚Äôs used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs so obviously Dan harmon‚Äôs show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Sakura Wars the Animation,Never meet your heroes
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Sakura Wars the Animation,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Sakura Wars the Animation,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"‚ÄúMore recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven‚Äôt heard from him in years, and when they have, it‚Äôs been unpleasant.‚Äù

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I‚Äôm not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I‚Äôve always felt like he‚Äôs been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I‚Äôd be curious to see what else he came up with, but it‚Äôs always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that‚Äôs the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."

Sakura Wars the Animation,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn‚Äôt show up to work and thinks he‚Äôs the hottest shit for the work he doesn‚Äôt show up to anymore"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Sakura Wars the Animation,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Sakura Wars the Animation,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Sakura Wars the Animation,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt worry about that‚Äîof course, it‚Äôs natural‚ÄîI‚Äôm saying‚Ä¶Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Sakura Wars the Animation,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there‚Äôs been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it‚Äôs true.
Sakura Wars the Animation,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Sakura Wars the Animation,Never go full John K
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn‚Äôt right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"It‚Äôs always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Sakura Wars the Animation,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the ‚Äúmethod acting‚Äù behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Sakura Wars the Animation,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Sakura Wars the Animation,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Someday, maybe ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."

Sakura Wars the Animation,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Sakura Wars the Animation,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It‚Äôs no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Sakura Wars the Animation,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Ah geez üò≥
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Sakura Wars the Animation,100 years
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Sakura Wars the Animation,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Sakura Wars the Animation,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I guess it‚Äôs not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I‚Äôm pretty sure most people that weren‚Äôt totally disgusted by it were thinking ‚Äúholy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff‚Äù. Fast forward and‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I‚Äôve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a ‚Äúparted ways‚Äù statement on standby."
Sakura Wars the Animation,How is this a surprise. He‚Äôs a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn‚Äôt help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Sakura Wars the Animation,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don‚Äôt impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Sakura Wars the Animation,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Sakura Wars the Animation,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Sakura Wars the Animation,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Sakura Wars the Animation,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Sakura Wars the Animation,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Sakura Wars the Animation,But Elon Musk said he‚Äôs the heart of the show!
Sakura Wars the Animation,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it‚Äôs always been. I‚Äôm sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.

Sakura Wars the Animation,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn‚Äôt the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to ‚Äúshut the f‚Äî- up‚Äù when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they‚Äôre not bias or clickbaity."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the ‚Äúwe are successful now so we must change‚Äù turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Sakura Wars the Animation,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Sakura Wars the Animation,Incoming netflix docuseries
Sakura Wars the Animation,Yoga
Sakura Wars the Animation,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Sakura Wars the Animation,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Sakura Wars the Animation,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Sakura Wars the Animation,It‚Äôs always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. ü§¢
Sakura Wars the Animation,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It‚Äôs a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"He‚Äôd get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn‚Äôt an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
Sakura Wars the Animation,He stopped showing up around the Third season? That‚Äôs when it all went downhill quality wise
Sakura Wars the Animation,This show is has been a minefield for its staff. I find it weird that few articles are mentioning the sexual harassment instances with Harmon as well.
Sakura Wars the Animation,"I first became a fan of Justin‚Äôs when he started his podcast way back in 2010. Generally he came off as a good person, with a crazy sense of humor, quirky ideas, and love for his friends and fans. He‚Äôd even get deep talking about his childhood, sense of paranoia for the future, and depressive episodes. Sometimes he‚Äôd come off as somewhat controlling, but it was his show after all. Just like in Rick and Morty he also did characters that went on comedic rants that were over the top, overtly sexual, scatological (lol), and just straight up funny and weird. Even if he responded to fan mail as one of these characters going on a lewd rant, he‚Äôd come back as Justin and usually say it‚Äôs just for the shock comedy and he loves his fans. Fast-forward to today and I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about Justin‚Ä¶ Worst case scenario, he was always an abuser deep down and it‚Äôs just finally come to light. Best case is he spiraled out of control under pressure becoming the personalities he always portrays in characters. Of course neither are excuses. I hope any victims get justice. I hope Justin gets therapy. And I hope the friends and family of everyone involved are doing ok."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"TBH he kind of sucked and all his 'projects' were him just him riding the coat tails of Rick and Mortys success, and doing the same characters again and again."
Sakura Wars the Animation,"Rick and Morty fan here, and I hope most other fans can agree with this next statement, fuck this guy, we don‚Äôt need him, just find other people to voice his characters."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"I dont really agree with most of these choices, but that‚Äôs what opinions are for.

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It‚Äôs been overlooked and it‚Äôs an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Do you ever get bored about watching shows featuring race, gender, privilege, or journeys of self-discovery? Seems to be every show on this list just about.

Sing Yesterday for Me,People mad OP didn't put more mainstream and US shows. It's so stupid. Anyway I watched very few shows on your list ZeroZeroZero was so good I was surprised it didn't get discussed more. I didn't watch the second season of L'amica geniale but the first one was amazing
Sing Yesterday for Me,I feel like Dispatches From Elsewhere would be a good addition to this list. It didn't get a lot of pub but it was one of the most earnest and heartfelt shows I'd seen in a while.

Sing Yesterday for Me,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
Sing Yesterday for Me,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
Sing Yesterday for Me,is OP a feminist?
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Great list, keep up the great work"
Sing Yesterday for Me,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."
Sing Yesterday for Me,Bad list is bad.
Sing Yesterday for Me,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
Sing Yesterday for Me,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Pretentious, but not as pretentious as av club."
Sing Yesterday for Me,You need to branch out A LOT.   You have some very odd tastes but I guess that‚Äôs just what you like.
Sing Yesterday for Me,"*Tower of God* but no *Re:Zero*? Damn. 

Even if I very much disagree with Re: Zero being left on any list. I‚Äôm glad to see one without *Lovecraft Country*. That show was such a dumpster fire I‚Äôm not sure how any competent person could watch it and says it‚Äôs good, let alone one of the best of the year."
Sing Yesterday for Me,Do you tell people that you own many leather bound books?
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Hey, have you watched: Alex Rider, Alice in Borderland, Someone Has to Die, The Flight Attendant, The Great, To the Lake? These have all been released this year so I was wondering if you'd watched them. I've been reading some of your reviews and you write pretty well, although I don't necessarily agree with all your opinions."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"I wasn't aware that Juno Temple was in another project titled Little Birds, so I thought you randomly threw a 2011 film on the list. I will have to check that out, as well as a few others."
Sing Yesterday for Me,Sounds like you would like Suburra on Netflix based on this list.
Sing Yesterday for Me,Part of why I love end of the year lists is that I often discover shows (or movies) I never knew existed and/or am given a reason to try a show I might have skipped.  Your list definitely inspires that.  Bonus points for articulating why the shows worked for you.
Sing Yesterday for Me,Tower of god (webtoon) is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. The anime isnt that great imo
Sing Yesterday for Me,What a great list. But please refrain from adding Japanese shows. No way that any is worthy of the top 25.
Sing Yesterday for Me,"> the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters

What show do you mean?"
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Haven‚Äôt heard of zerozerozero but it sounds right up my alley. I‚Äôll check it out, thanks"
Sing Yesterday for Me,yep OP is definitely suffering from Wokeism
Sing Yesterday for Me,"I like that OP sticks to their guns, but some of their choices are not great to me.

Desenfrenadas in particular I found just laughably bad in how clumsily it tried to present real meaningful subjects but fell terribly short with its transparent privileged fantasy idea of what struggle in the ground looks like. It takes checklist, cliched characters that it thinks will benefit from a taste of ""real life"", but the test it makes them endure, beneath the thin layer of modern coating is terribly old fashioned and cliched too and it doesn't realize ever seem to realize its vision of reality is just testament that no one involved has ever gone on a crash course road trip in places like the ones it depicts. I found the all the leads (besides lucia bracho, who is the best, deserves better than this and I hope gets a vehicle soon) wooden, stiff, perpetually-instagram-posed and unlikable.

Also, it didn't help that it's just the exact kind of ""nuMexico vibe"" mexicans like me are extremely tired of.

And even after all of that, it just doesn't have a great structure. I had to hyper sweep the show for a sort of documentary job and it has a lot of cracks. 

But I also thought my brilliant friend s2 was great, even if it fell quite a bit shy of S1 for me, which I just adoooored. So we're a bit in tune maybe."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"OP is of course free to like whatever they like, but I think the reason people are giving them grief is more because they give off a really strong vibe of pretentiousness.  Personally I'd love to be introduced to new stuff outside the mainstream, unfortunately nothing in the OP's list that I haven't already seen really sounds all that interesting."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"not the first time seeing someone asking for this in the U.S. but unfortunately no i don't think it's available in the U.S. It's actually even available in Canada apparently but not the U.S.

Sing Yesterday for Me,So not denying it then. Interesting.

Sing Yesterday for Me,"Eh, bringing in a bunch of foreign TV to an overwhelmingly young, American demographic, and then dismissing something popular as not being ""avant-garde"" enough for you, is kinda gonna come off as pretentious to many people.

You like what you like, and honestly, more power to you.  This is obviously a list that is personal to you, even if it doesn't conform to the ""mainstream"" enough for most people.  As someone who grew up listening to music well outside the mainstream and being mocked for it, I can totally relate to that."
Sing Yesterday for Me,If the trailer is anything to go by script needed editing by somebody from England. The way the English characters talk is very unnatural.

Sing Yesterday for Me,"But that is ""quality"" for me, as quality is a subjective thing, and that does determine how entertaining a show is for me. It is a criteria of sorts, but not for the list, it's a criterior for me.

2020 TV had more to offer than these 2 shows guys c'mon. üòÖ have y'all even seen my top 2?!

> A drawback for Normal People is that straight couples on TV/film are pretty fucking boring now.

Yea as i said I'm hella biased against this show. It's something i didn't particularly enjoy... but can't necessarily say it's *bad*. I don't know, maybe it's because it kinda reminds me of my favorite film franchise 'The Before Trilogy', acting like a cheap imitation of that. Or maybe because of the sex scenes that reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey... or idk, I just wasn't feeling it. 

> Just skimming your posts shows how much of a insufferable snob you are

Why? üòï Because of that one line? It ain't that serious man it's all for fun and it's all opinionated. Me saying that is just how I felt at the time, I went on to love a lot of show focusing on straight couples, some of which are even on this list."

Sing Yesterday for Me,"I'll be honest, there's a lot of places where your list would be better appreciated than r/television. The demographic here is not suited for a list with so much foreign, dramatic, introspective content. People here are more in the male 18-34 demo, there's more focus on escapist shows. There's not enough comedy, sci-fi/fantasy, and action here for your list to be accepted.

Sing Yesterday for Me,Lol I didn‚Äôt watch tiger king. That show is for idiots
Sing Yesterday for Me,"You might be right about the demographic being hostile to my current taste... but on the contrary, I feel like the very heartwarming Ted Lasso and slow-burn heartbreaking romance drama Normal People being popular here proves that shows like these can be accepted. It's not really a matter of taste or me favoring the avant-garde too much, it's a matter of what's mainstream or what's popular. I think a lot of people just want to see shows that they've watched and regard highly whenever they see a ""Top TV shows of the year"" list. 

> there's a lot of places where your list would be better appreciated than r/television

like where? I feel like this is the only place someone like me could come and post about tv shows and actually have people see and read it without having to worry about gaining followers or building an audience, because the audience is already here. But if you know of any other place please do suggest. 

> If you had kept the thread title as ""my favourite shows of 2020"", you might have gotten a slightly more positive response.

But.... that's exactly what it is. As I said in another comment here, art is subjective, and any end-of-year list you see, whether posted on AV Club, Deadline, Variety, YouTube etc. will always be the author's opinion and limited to what the author has seen this year. Go on Variety and look at one of their ""Top TV Shows of 2020"" list.. now look at name of the author in that little box below the title, that's their ""favorite TV shows of 2020"". This is a fact that just seems to fly over a lot of people's heads here for some reason."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"lol yea as i said at the start of the post, originality, creativity and uniqueness are my 3 main factors, whether in storytelling or execution (because I watch a lot of shows you see I latch on to anything even slightly avant-garde üòÖ). 

[Here's my sum up of Ted Lasso](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/j4hjmv/another_ted_lasso_apple_tv_post/).... which looking back now could've been longer (guess I couldn't be bothered at the time to write down my full thoughts). I gave it a 7/10."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Im no expert, but saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs not avant-guard enough for me‚Äù is basically farming downvotes. We all have our tastes. Is when we‚Äôre subscribing to a taste for its own sake we‚Äôll have a hard time bringing others along with our opinions."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"thanks a lot. i really hate how much it seems to fly over users heads on here that lists like these will always be the writer's opinion... any end-of-year list, whether it's on Variety, AV Club, YouTube etc. it'll always be the author's opinion, and art is subjective."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Uggh I feel like you're still not understanding what I'm saying here lol.

> Most people look for a lot more than just ""originality, creativity and uniqueness""

I do too... good writing, good acting, beautiful visuals and good production values all round, but a lot of shows have those elements, what I'm saying is for me to consider it noteworthy or outstanding, originality, creativity and uniqueness are the 3 main factors that must be there... along with the essentials. 

> that's why people don't like your list.

Nah, let's admit most people come into posts like these expecting to see shows they've watched and regard highly, obviously this isn't that for most, so no i didn't make it expecting people here to like it.... but honestly it's going better than i expected. A lot of the comments are just misunderstanding me, guess i should've elaborated more in the opening NB. 

oh and p.s. it wasn't a serious *ask*, i just wanted the user to tell me what he thought about the list lol."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"Ted Lasso is a comedy, it leans heavily on the goofiness of its main character. The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey. Most people don't enjoy that. People like watching escapist tv where characters are solving problems and going on actual journeys and landing in humorous situations, your list has nearly none of that. Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

And when you say stuff like ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular"", you will get called pretentious. Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are. I don't think r/television only follows what is popular, it follows the higher end of what the male 18-34 demo follows, and it doesn't seem like you are part or at least don't understand that demo at all.

Also, lists like AV and stuff are usually a collaborative effort, so it's usually not just one person's opinion and meant to be more all-encompassing than a random video on Youtube. And you really don't see many random ""top tv shows of 2020"" Youtube videos being posted here. You'll probably see more vitriolic criticism being spewed at those videos in the comments than what you are getting in this thread."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"> The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

Yea... you right. But don't be dissing Dave though. üòÇ

> You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey.

Lol you right as fuck.... and i'll admit, this is something i didn't even realize before you said it, but the top 3 are essentially very similar shows story-wise, characters on self-discovering journeys. Lol you got me there. 

But see the thing is (*and this is something I guess I should've noted separately in the post, even though I did in some of the reviews*), I'm not just rating these shows based on just plot, im rating based off the way they chose to tell their stories, their visuals/cinematography or style, their production values etc. 

for eg. Partisan is ranked no. 9, but it has absolutely garbage ass plot that by the end leaves you quite unsatisfied (that's why I barely mentioned it), but it has beautifully unique cinematography and the way it builds mystery and tension with its cold and isolated atmosphere is quite innovating, thus... it makes the list. 

So Ted Lasso is good, it tells a decently good story, but how did it tell it? Was it innovative? Did it do anything creative like Dave's ""Jail"" music video montage? Was it doing anything special visually? ... or was it just pretty typically straightforward in the way it presented itself? (which it was in my opinion)

> Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

Shit that's pretty harsh... but I can't argue. I guess most of these aren't necessarily 'fun' shows. No. 1 is though (but demographic might be an issue there as you mentioned as it's a very female driven series. üòÖ)

> ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular""

Is that what I said or did you misquote? üòï I feel like that's not what I typed. But if it was that's not what I meant. 

> Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are.

But... ""quality"" is subjective. üòï Unless you mean ""quality"" as in production values well that is less subjective but that's not an issue on this list i promise you. 

And no if I come off like that I really don't mean to at all... like why would anyone even think that? üòï it's just TV shows. I'm passionate about TV shows. I've been posting and rating TV shows all year, it's really just for fun. Something I decided to commit to earlier this year because I had a rough year last year. Im just giving my opinions on TV shows. Another commenter called be a snob... and I'm baffled cause I don't know how I'm coming off like that or how to stop coming off like that. It really got me down."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"I hear you, I didn't call you pretentious myself (the poster I was responding to did), and I don't think you're trying to make it seem like your taste is better than anyone else's. People like what they like. But I do think you're putting too much of a premium on creativity and not enough on the pure enjoyment that you get out of a show.

I don't rate Lasso as highly as some people here do, but I still think it is a fantastic show. It may not be as creative as a show like Dave, but it provides joy and satisfaction that Dave could never give. You need to give more thought about what you simply enjoyed watching over what you thought was unique. A show can be derivative and still have quality at the same time. A show's quality should depend on how it makes you feel. That's why I think people are calling you a snob, because you're treating these shows like cases to study rather than what they are, escapist fantasies to be enjoyed.

I'll just give you an example, I think Queen's Gambit is infinitely better than Unorthodox, because Gambit is an uplifting story with well-fleshed out characters and a polished look, that doesn't demonize anyone and has no real villains (that last part makes it easily more unique than 99% of shows). Unorthodox, on the other hand, is not nearly as pretty of a show, and beats you over the head with the cartoonishly dumb orthodox Jew characters and a boring naive main character with zero charm. What could have been a good character study about a woman's struggle with her faith turns into a story of female persecution, which I thought made it completely unenjoyable by the end. But you have Unorthodox ranked higher than Queen's Gambit, with a much more muted description for the former as well. What you said about Gambit, ""one that actually takes our main character places, through losses, wins, good times and bad times"", people care more about than what you said for Unorthodox, a ""self-identifying and freedom-discovering story"". That I think is what people find snobby... you're placing a premium on things that don't matter to most people."
Sing Yesterday for Me,"> But I do think you're putting too much of a premium on creativity and not enough on the pure enjoyment that you get out of a show.

I mean... read the note at the very top of the post:


> *shows were chosen based on originality, creativity and uniqueness (as those are 3 main factors I look for in TV shows).*

..... that's what i enjoy. Those are the things I look for in TV shows. I'm fully enjoying a TV show when it's unique, creative, when it's giving me something I've never seen before. When it's being presented in a way I've never seen before. And as we agreed, the list is made by me, my opinion, my favorites. That's why at the start of the post, I tell people what I look for/want from a TV show. Creativity, originality and uniqueness, that's what the list is based on. 

Also keep in mind that I watch a lot more TV than the average viewer. Not to be a snob, as the commenters said lol, but after you've watched over a 1000 TV shows you tend to crave stuff you haven't seen before. 

> That I think is what people find snobby... you're placing a premium on things that don't matter to most people.

Yeah, you probably right. But what did you want me to do tailor the list for /r/television? Fill the list with the most talked about shows on here. Think of any critic, would they do that? Think of music critic Antony Fantano, would he fill his ""Top 20 Albums of the Year"" list with selections that his comment section favored, or would it be filled with music that he enjoys? music that probably sways on the experimental side because just like me he's looking to be wowed by stuff he haven't heard before.

Also, The Queen's Gambit and Unorthodox aren't that far off in my head quality wise. I gave Queen's Gambit a 8.0 and Unorthodox a 8.3... and the only reason is because I liked Unorthodox directing and clean aesthetics more. They are both equally great stories to me. üòÑ

But anywhooooooooo! I actually really enjoyed this convo. I wanted you to check out the Top 25 list I made back in 2017 and tell me what you think... but it's on another site, I'd have to pm you the link."

The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,I think the main difference would have to be Hammond being actually evil rather than whimsical grandpa.
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"In a fantasy world where budget is no concern, sure. Every book should be a tv miniseries.  I have a list of three dozen books just off the top of my head that I‚Äôd love to see that happen to. But Jurassic World cost 150 million dollars. A full season of tv would be even more expensive than that. And we just spent a whole day talking about how 120 million for one season of the Avatar: TLA was crazy insane news."
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,I want a Jurassic Park workplace comedy about the crew that manages day to day operations.
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"to pull it off, you'd need a movie budget for the fx."
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,I'd definitely watch that.
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,The Netflix Jurassic Park cartoon series is surprisingly good.
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"I don't think this would be unpopular, the problem is that Jurassic Park (movies) is a family friendly property, so taking a hard R left turn would be kinda a weird way to go with it"
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"I would also absolutely love this. And it will never happen, because Jurassic Park is a 'family' movie series, much like Marvel movies. We'll never get the dark and gritty shit because then they can't market it to a younger audience."
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"I want the T-rex swimming bit. It's like 5 of my worst fears all rolled into 1. The feeling of triumph when you go out into the water knowing that it can't get you there, then the dawning horror when you realize with its tail and massive bite force it's really an oversized crocodile that can swim a lot faster than our modern day predators. 

The duck billed Spinosaurus in the water in JP 3 was nowhere near scary enough. Combining water with a huge predator that is evolved to hunt and forage in that environment should've led to instant death for anyone unlucky enough to fall in or go near the waters edge, or the humans should've done something extraordinarily smart to outsmart it. Maybe 5 people go into the water, they all swim in different directions and 3 people at the most make it out. Someone tries to swim to the bottom in between some logs and detritus, only to find that the Spinosaurus' beak was evolved for the purpose of rooting around that type of muck to find food."
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"And I feel like it would have to be HBO, as they arguably do the best mini-series"
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"Everyone's talking about budget, and obviously it will be expensive, but if it follows the movie's way of keeping the dinosaurs almost a hidden danger then there wouldn't have to be too much cgi

The original only had 14 minutes of dinosaurs on screen, but they made every monute count"
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,Only if Ralph the baby Triceratops shows up
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"I see it. I like it.

Limit it to a single season, and basically model the casting and worldbuilding on HBO‚Äôs Westworld series (Crichton really loves his theme parks, huh?), but with none of the excess.  There‚Äôd be no need to spend 10 episodes building to the mayhem in the park because the existential philosophical ideas could be explored simultaneously, and you don‚Äôt need to justify dinosaurs eating humans or giving the audience reasons to root for the Hosts to rise against the oppressors, because the dinosaurs are inherently out of place and the breakdown of the park‚Äôs ability to contain/control them is itself thematically significant."
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,I still wish we could have received a more faithful treatment of The Lost World. The book was brutal (would have to be R rated to be fully faithful) and I was thoroughly entertained by the InGen vs BioSyn rivalry on Site B.

I would love to see it too but there's no way an IP like that is getting the TV-MA treatment"
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,With modern FX they could probably get the size of the T-Rex right. In the book it pick the entire Jeep up and shakes it in its mouth
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,Not even unpopular. Making Lost Worlds into a more adult limited  series would work there is enough mystery and thrill that would keep it reasonable paced chapters with the story and characters. recasting Ian Malcolm might be the biggest hurdle.

It's not like he's a company man like Burke from *Aliens;* he doesn't value property more than human lives, but he does still suffer from the delusion that he can control the situation, and ""fix"" it so that the park can still open. 

That's the whole point of the ""flea circus"" scene between him and Dr. Sattler in the cafeteria, and as a result, he reluctantly accepts that there's no salvaging his dream, all he can do is try to protect his grandchildren and the people endangered as a result of his hubris.

The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,All bets are off when you're talking comic books/marvel/etc
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"What lol

Yes, it is. They changed a Hell of a lot from the book to literally cater to families. It's not for toddlers, but it's most definitely a family movie for older kids."
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"What? The book is like pseudo-horror, they changed everything to make it a family blockbuster"
The Eighth Son? That Cant Be Right!,"The book is worse. Like when Nedry bites the dust he feels slippery snakes near his torso, he looks down and he's been disembowelled, his guts are spilling out but still connected to him. It's then that the Dilophosaurus starts feasting. He's thinks it's pretty rude that it didn't kill him first, then the pain and horror hit him.

Edit: Btw anyone who's thinking suicide by bear or lion, don't do it. Huge mammal predators do the same thing. They don't bother killing you, they'll just subdue you, and they'll eat you from the asshole first, because their prey typically has tough hides and eating through your butt is much easier than chewing through zebra or moose skin. 

So you pass out with the lions teeth clamped around your neck, they've crushed your jugular, momentarily stopping the blood flow to your brain and you think ""this is it, this is how I go out, the lacerations on my torso and neck hurts, but at least I am going ""to sleep."" You then wake up in agony moments later as the shock of having your stomach pulled through your asshole, your lower abdomen and legs being torn apart into fleshy ribbons. You are still conscious as they sever your arms from your body. Finally your heart gives out as a massive head breaks your ribs from the inside seeking out the liver and other organs."

Here's what we know:

- MovieHammond and Benjamin Lockwood set up InGen to monetize gene editing and cloned at least one kid.

- MovieHammond designed the park to normalize and showcase InGen's cloning tech for investors and a doubting public *while* garnering additional revenue for InGen. He hired incredibly unscrupulous people to manage its affairs.

- MovieHammond built the park outside the US to skirt regulations because

- the park itself is manifestly unsafe. In addition to dodging legal/ethical oversight, it was built on an active volcano. It has inadequate power/transportation infrastructure. Its security is totally inadequate. It's understaffed and its employees are mistreated. And it is populated with genetic monsters.

- MovieHammond bribed his security consultants to approve the park despite the park's problems because

- he doesn't value human life. He only acts to limit the damage InGen has done when his family is threatened and is still lying to his victims in his final appearance which doesn't matter because

- he built at least two other parks - Site B and the San Diego showcase. 

- He fucks around with InGen's legal responsibility to its victims. In the end, he hasn't learned anything or been made to account for anything. He dumps responsibility for lawsuits on his nephew. He doesn't account for guarding the doors his technology has opened. He doesn't understand the ecology he's disrupted or the worlds he's ended. He dies alone in a giant mansion filled with visual signifiers for ""old money"" after sending *another* group of bribed experts to validate his work. 

Peter Ludlow has the same goals as his uncle, but unlike his uncle is completely open about complying with government oversight, paying his uncle's debts, and making InGen profitable again. No one deserved the death Ludlow got, but Hammond definitely didn't deserve a glowing showcase in Masrani's park.

In the book Lex was just a liability. She was a character who was younger than Timmy who was too young to really understand the danger they were in, she was just there to cause unnecessary tension. For any parent reading the book she upped the horror, because you know a child that small would do stupid, uncontrollable shit in that situation AND being a parent, thinking about your own little bundle of joy being chomped on by a monster lizard is horrifying. 

In the movie they gave Lex something to do, a characteristic that comes in handy and she gave little girls a relatable protagonist. Also, at the time making a little girl a STEM character was out of the ordinary, it fit the theme perfectly and probably inspired a generation of girls to study a STEM field."

The Queen Mother,That‚Äôs great news. I‚Äôm hyped.
The Queen Mother,yeah just woke up and this put me in a good mood
The Queen Mother,"I  stopped watching the Arrowverse after Crisis, but Im defo watching this to see the return of Oliver. The whole verse popped off when I was in high school (and still had friends), this final season feels like an end of an era. To the fellow 2000s kids, what have we got left from our childhood? Only One Piece?"
The Queen Mother,He coming back as a ghost? Didn‚Äôt he die as Spector?
The Queen Mother,"Huge spoilers, do not read unless you want to know what happens this season:  >!Someone tells Barry to run!<"
The Queen Mother,They shouldn't have cancelled DC Legends
The Queen Mother,But will we get to see Diggle finally put on the ring?!?
The Queen Mother,"Hot damn, it really is ending isnt it?  As much as Arrowverse flopped over the years its still gonna be sad to close out this take on the DC Universe."
The Queen Mother,"I'm not gonna pretend it was the highest caliber of television but I enjoyed far more seasons of the two marquee shows of the Arrowverse (Arrow and Flash) than I disliked. The Arrowverse led me to meet my best friends and I'm really grateful to it, so I'm tremendously sad to see it go. I'm glad Amell gets to see it off."
The Queen Mother,"Just saw an ad that Amell did on instagram about a clash of clans knock off praising it for having no ads.  He needs a new agent, because that was rough to watch."
The Queen Mother,But he dead.
The Queen Mother,The Flash is still going? wow
The Queen Mother,"With this and the other returning characters, hopefully this will be a decent end to the Arrowverse.  I doubt they'll have everyone from the different shows, nor should they if they want to tell a cohesive story, but if they can fit more people into this season naturally, I'd be all for it."
The Queen Mother,"This guy was my spin instructor in a Toronto. As a teacher, he was meh but, good lord, that face and body brought all the girls to the yard."
The Queen Mother,Can‚Äôt believe this show went on for this long. I stopped watching after season 3 honestly it was mostly filler and final few episodes few in the middle and the beginning episode ever connected. Which is pretty exhausting and boring after a while.
The Queen Mother,Truly a shame that DC and Warner Bros. has wasted so much money. So much money. These nonsense CW shows.. Snyderverse‚Ä¶ the Batgirl film‚Ä¶ All a waste.
The Queen Mother,"I can't wait to not see this.

Don't get me wrong. Loved these shows, but they just ran the Flash into the ground."
The Queen Mother,"As a lifelong Arrowverse fan, I was so happy to see this news. Cannot wait until the season 9 premiere."
The Queen Mother,"But isn't the character supposed to be kind of...dead?

Oh, I know.  That never stopped them before."
The Queen Mother,"The Flash... heck I thought that show had ended or had been dumped. I hadn't seen it on the CW app on my Roku for such a long time, pre-Covid. I guess I'll have to go back and find it again and start rewatching."
The Queen Mother,"TIL The Flash is still airing. 

Since they took weekly episodes off Hulu and put them on Netflix months after release I've stopped watching the CW Arrowverse."
The Queen Mother,Wow. TIL they still make the CW superhero shows.
The Queen Mother,"Not surprisingly at all. If anything is surprising it that took this to him into an episode since arrow ended. 

I was disappointed that they created a justice league at the end of crisis and never did anything with it. Between Covid, WB being mess with their DC plans, batwoman being a complete cluster fuck behind the scenes, and supergirl moving on was just too much for them to handle."
The Queen Mother,"I stopped watching this show after season 1, is the rest of it worth it?"
The Queen Mother,I forgot this show ever existed
The Queen Mother,I don't think even Stephen can save the giant floppy turd sandwich this has turned into.
The Queen Mother,Genuinely did not know this show was still going on.
The Queen Mother,"I'm hoping they bring Wally West out in full [speed force fabulous](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/keiynan-lonsdale-sexuality). The CW Arrowverse audience has been very welcoming to LGBTQ characters, I think it would be great if Keiyan had his moment to shine."
The Queen Mother,Watch the Legends get a little note during the credits of Flash.
The Queen Mother,"Legends was by far the best Arrowverse show and the only one I wanted to see continue. 

I would love if we get one throwaway line joking about them just so we know they aren't in prison anymore."
The Queen Mother,a couple of the actresses were spotted in british columbia recently so it could maybe  be for the flash
The Queen Mother,"Arrow and Flash Seasons 1-2 are my favorites, especially the first seasons."
The Queen Mother,"Yeah, these shows went on much longer than they should have, honestly. Arrowverse was so good for 3 seasons. Same with Flash. But, I absolutely love Ammell."
The Queen Mother,"Tbh it was one of the best character interactions in those shows, and i wish they had done a bit more within their own shows to establish their friendship rather than just their bonding in the crossovers.

You dont even need to show the other character, just like ollie walks into a scene and someone asks ""how was drinks with Barry"" or something, like throwaway dialogue that shows they are friends behind the scenes.

That being said, the stuff they did show was always really good, like they deff wrote them as 2 friends that 100% trusted each other."
The Queen Mother,"This is why Elseworlds outshined COIE for me.  It was just a chance for Amell and Gustin to do a double act and they shined every time they shared the screen.  [My favorite moment](https://youtu.be/ee9KX6-F-QU?t=109) was when Barry as Oliver is talking to Ruby Rose and saying that ""Oliver"" would never dare to compare himself to a badass like Batman.  The dirty look Actual Ollie gives Barry in the background, and Barry's smirk, were gold."
The Queen Mother,"It wouldn't surprise me if they announce Caity Lotz and Melissa Benoist at a later date. They seem to be doing their best to make this ninth season of The Flash a proper send-off for the characters and the Arrowverse as a whole, so they might as well milk it and announce more returning characters over time."
The Queen Mother,That‚Äôs a good amount for a universe
The Queen Mother,"> with 710(!) episodes in total.

I doubt this is ever repeated again on network TV, Trek is at over 800 but that took fifty years."
The Queen Mother,Is Superman and Lois not part of Arrowverse?
The Queen Mother,"Same.  No one in my orbit was dumb enough to follow these shows so for a while I didnt have anyone to talk about it with.  Forget exactly how, but I found the FlashTV subreddit and with that I was off to the races."
The Queen Mother,[deleted]
The Queen Mother,"It doesn‚Äôt happen off screen, it‚Äôs like the second or third episode of Crisis.

He dies so they use Constantine to find a Lazurus Pit on a new earth to bring him back. They then have to go to get his soul like they did last time the pit was used.

They find his soul but he doesn‚Äôt go back because he gets asked to be a Spectre which leads him to saving the paragons"
The Queen Mother,"> I don't read comic books so i have no idea

It's okay, neither do the writers most of the seasons anyway."
The Queen Mother,"> I don't read comic books so i have no idea

Reading comic books honestly doesn't help someone to figure out what the hell is going on in the Arrowverse. In fact it makes it harder to understand sometimes."
The Queen Mother,"I stopped following Legends after S4 but it's a shame it didn't get an ending like Arrow, Supergirl, and Flash. I hope at least one cast member returns in The Flash S9."
The Queen Mother,"Even though I wish it hadn‚Äôt been cancelled, I kind of like The Legends having a ‚ÄúHere we go again!‚Äù ending."
The Queen Mother,"Dragonball is still around, kind of. Also, Bleach is doing a final Anime arc. Stargate might be coming back!"
The Queen Mother,Or The Flash goes back in time and they redo one of their previous team-ups. That would be my guess.
The Queen Mother,"Iris, who hasn‚Äôt had any use at all since Season 1 and whom has been outshone by every potential Barry Allen love interest: ‚ÄúWe ArE tHe FlAsH!‚Äù"
The Queen Mother,"No, he rejected the ring during season 8 of The Flash."
The Queen Mother,"Dude, it got so *weird* in between. Not only did they introduce a human representation of the Speedforce that just happened to look like Barry‚Äôs mom, they also had other humans as avatars of *Strength force, sage force and still force*."
The Queen Mother,I had the same thought. I haven't watched it since season 3 or 4.
The Queen Mother,"Absolutely not, that‚Äôs truly as good as it gets"
The Queen Mother,"Season 2 and 3 were still very good to me when I rewatched some of it. 

I like season 1 as much as the next guy but a lot of the content is filled with generic material for a origin story. The effects are also pretty bad at times but in season 2-3 the effects/CGI is very nice"
The Queen Mother,"I recommend Season 2, they did some fun stuff with the multiverse and Zoom is a cool villain.  After that though, not worth the watch."
The Queen Mother,Yes. If you watch the show for what it is. It‚Äôs a great show!
The Queen Mother,Season 2 is fantastic
The Queen Mother,Agreed!
The Queen Mother,"""The Legends died on the way back to their home timeline."""
The Queen Mother,"""Guys, are we really gonna ignore Barry again? It's another crossover.""


""Nate, sit back down. It's the Wynonna Earp finale and the dvr isn't working"""
The Queen Mother,Just Quantum Leap that shit
The Queen Mother,"Outside of Doom Patrol, it's the most comic booky show to ever exist. Legends of Tomorrow was nonsense and it knew it was nonsense. That let everyone have fun with it."
The Queen Mother,"I was so hyped seeing Booster Gold at the end of season 7. Sad we didn't get to see more.

Despite that I felt Legends got a decent run. They really turned the show around after season 1."
The Queen Mother,Which ones?
The Queen Mother,Arrow season 2 was pure gold
The Queen Mother,"Flash is the only one I've managed to stick with up to current.  It's cringe, but it's *my* cringe at this point.  I'm ride or die to the end."
The Queen Mother,"Those seasons and Legends S2-3 are some of the best superhero stuff i've watched.

Especially the season 1 2nd to last flash episode."
The Queen Mother,"Arrow Season 1 was legit. Season 2 wasnt as great but held up, after that, well, we all know."
The Queen Mother,"A loved Arrow season 1. Especially how in the end it turned out that >!whole conspiracy was a nonsensical plan from the main villain to get a revenge on a killer by destroying a place where he lived 20 years ago with apiece of technology that didn't exist all this time, and every rich person in the city going along with it, and thinking it's a great plan.!<

I mean come on, what could be better then that reveal? Right after that I knew, I just *knew*, how great of a writer team this whole franchise has."
The Queen Mother,"Too many mentions of the Flash in Arrow episodes would have broken the suspension of disbelief that anything Oliver was facing was a real issue. Pretty much every problem/villain of arrow bar maybe Damien Darkh could have been sorted with a quick text message to Barry who'd zoom over and sort it in two seconds flat. ""oh, the island is rigged with explosives? No worries!"".

People like to hand-wave it away with ""Barry's busy dealing with reverse-flash/savitar etc"" as if he wasn't off in his own episodes using his speed to run to Italy for pizza at every opportunity.

As it is I think they ended up using him about once a season or so, like when he ran them to Nanda Parbat iirc."
The Queen Mother,"It really was a great dynamic. Barry allowed himself to be mentored and truly appreciated and listened to Oliver‚Äôs advice as he knew he was raw. In turn, Ollie learnt from Barry to lighten up a bit and not take the small things for granted"
The Queen Mother,If anyone deserved a proper send-off it's Caity and any of the other cast from LEGENDS OF TOMORROW (whose show got cancelled on a cliffhanger).
The Queen Mother,Won't be too long now if they do announce it. Flash wraps in early March and all these guests the past few days are apparently for episode 9/13.
The Queen Mother,It was but now it‚Äôs not.
The Queen Mother,"> His host, Corrigan, meets Oliver in purgatory, which is the island from Arrow, and gives him those celestial powers. When he fights the Anti-Monitor, he births a new multiverse and dies. That's pretty much it.

i have a feeling this was not well explained in the show."
The Queen Mother,"My favorite part of the crossover was when Lyla showed up with a different costume and announced she was Harbinger now and all of the superheroes just accepted it. And then later, Wells does nearly the same thing as Pariah."
The Queen Mother,"> instead of writing a plot that actually made some sense.

Well, that's the entire Arrowverse, not only the crossover.

And as Netflix has proven, good writing is not worth the expensive cost."
The Queen Mother,"> he gets asked to be a Spectre which leads him to saving the paragons

OK but what the hell is a spectre"
The Queen Mother,Its in a [deleted scene for Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gat_sNL1w8).  Its cheap as hell but I still think it should have been included.
The Queen Mother,Or the writers of any of the movies.
The Queen Mother,"> I stopped following Legends after S4 

You should absolutely give the following seasons a shot. It just keeps getting crazier and crazier. They manage to keep it funny and stupid whilst having genuinely good plots and arcs."
The Queen Mother,It was one of the stronger shows through to the end. Most of the characters you know also got their (mostly happy() endings in the seasons since. Highest cast turnover of any of the shows.
The Queen Mother,The classic Futurama approach of ending your show like 3 times on a quasi-‚Äúoff to the next adventure‚Äù-style cliffhanger-ish.
The Queen Mother,I‚Äôm loving TYBW but that will probably end next year with their current pace. Not sure what‚Äôs happening with Super Season 2
The Queen Mother,Someone told me that at some point Barry's daughter came back from the future
The Queen Mother,Ah that's unfortunate. Thanks.
The Queen Mother,I totally read this in their voices. I miss the Legends so much. Long live Beebo.
The Queen Mother,I‚Äôve never seen a fan base adopt a new religion so quick after the introduction of Beebo and I am here for it
The Queen Mother,You can also tell that the cast and crew had a good time making it which made the show so good.

The Last Post,"The event where he fails to protect Ellie already happended in KC, when she saved him. He talks about with Tommy."
The Last Post,"Everyone is allowed to their own opinion about pop culture. If OP doesn‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs totally fine. 

That being said, this critique reads like the failures of the show are because they don‚Äôt follow the one formula for success. There are plenty of ways to make a successful, enjoyable show. OP ignores the fact that lots of people really enjoy it, even if it doesn‚Äôt follow the typical recipe for success."
The Last Post,"I‚Äôll argue against a few points here. 

1. Joels belief is that people are better off away from him (note how he would choose to live alone on a farm if given the choice). He believes he is responsible for the death of his daughter and Tess, and that it is only a matter of when (not if) he will be responsible for Ellie‚Äôs death.

2. Joel gets the pair lost on the trail and is responsible for the pair being ambushed by the commune‚Äôs riders. Joel freezes with fear and rather than taking action/speaking up, he allows the dog an opportunity to attack/hurt Ellie. (This is an explicit event that Joel speaks about as manifestation of his fear).

3. I propose that the conflict here is not between Ellie and Joel, but between Joel and Tommy. Recall that Joel was always looking out for Tommy, even before the outbreak. Tommy represents the last remnants of his family. The only person he‚Äôs yet to fail (besides Ellie). The conflict comes when Tommy refuses to take Ellie. This forces Joel to confront the reality that he is still responsible for Ellie. (Ge immediately sees a girl resembling his daughter, which causes a relapse into fear and causes him to once again question WHEN he will fail Ellie). 

4. This one happens offscreen. Ellie listens in on Joel and Tommy‚Äôs conversation. The conversation is crucial to understanding Joel‚Äôs feelings and motivations, but it also affects Ellie‚Äôs trust in Joel (a concept called to attention earlier this episode). 

5. This is the confrontation between Joel and Ellie. Ellie confronts Joel about his intentions to leave her. He ultimately gets defensive and lashes out. He tells her off and makes it clear he wants nothing to do with her (a lie to himself and to Ellie). The resolution to this comes when Joel reflects in bed. He visualizes his daughter, and the children he saw earlier living peacefully. He knows he doesn‚Äôt want to abandon Ellie, but he has to confront his fears. What will he do?

6. Joel chooses to stay with Ellie. He does so in a patently awkward way. A way only Joel could. He just waits by the horses. 

7. Are we here yet? Or was Joel proven correct all along? Is he failing Ellie by getting stabbed? 

So I think structurally, this is the breakdown of the story beats this episode. The confrontation wasn‚Äôt the conflict of the episode structurally speaking. It was the further complication which forced a choice. It also was a character moment as well as a relationship moment. The things Joel says are defensive but understandable. And, we see the regret he feels for saying them. 

It‚Äôs fine if this isn‚Äôt how you read the scenes initially or if you can‚Äôt see them this way. But the themes behind the characters‚Äô actions are string. The interpersonal connections are believable. If it doesn‚Äôt resonate with you, ok. But I question what motivates you to try to prove that the lack of resonance is a product of objectively failed structure."
The Last Post,"I don't want to attack you for what you think about the show, but I think you're missing all the nuance that the writing rides with its character driven story. 
I can't write out my disagreement for each of your points, but I think the writing is doing a great job following the game and making necessary changes to make it work for TV.
The one point you go back to a lot is how Joel doesn't show (or spoken through the writing) that he is facing this question of if he's good enough to protect this girl, but there's more to it. He's scared that he'll lose her the same way he lost his daughter and while he's the most badass person around to protect her, he doesn't think he can handle that loss again and is doing what he can only think to do to not let that happen. His chest pains, heavy breathing, when he thinks he sees his real daughter, then dreams about her and how that loss affected him.
You're entitled to you opinion, but there's is so much more there you're missing if these are the points you're latching onto.
This is an amazing story and sure you could say I'm biased from the game but I hope you look at it a little deeper and find a way to enjoy it!"
The Last Post,"You sound like you read one book on rigid screenwriting tips, and think you are a master storyteller."
The Last Post,"If you haven‚Äôt seen the Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship evolve over 6 episodes, then you‚Äôve not been paying attention. While he feels his ability to protect her has diminished a bit due to age etc, he says that as he‚Äôs unwilling to face the much more real fact that he‚Äôs grown to care for this girl, deeply, and she‚Äôs filled a Sara size hole and he‚Äôs terrified of going through that again, so best to disassociate as quickly as possible instead of risking that pain again."
The Last Post,It's 2023 and people still think they will be taken seriously about their pop culture critiques.
The Last Post,"I skimmed your post and I think you seem to be confining your thinking to mainstream Hollywood storytelling's arbitrary rules, where there is almost no room for subtlety and everything has to be explicit and easily digestible for a mildly interested, casual audience.

By your criteria, 'The Sopranos' and 'Mad Men' aren't great shows either because you can't pinpoint characters' choices and motivations to a specific scene earlier in the episode/last couple of episodes.

What TV shows do you give a 10/10 to? Not trying to be condescending, but I have an idea what those shows would be like and what networks they would be on."
The Last Post,I ain't reading all that
The Last Post,"Opinions are a thing. No need to write an amateur essay on it. What you identify personally as bad writing, others may identify as quality character development, it‚Äôs that simple. 

However, you seem to be in the minority regarding the show."
The Last Post,disagree
The Last Post,"I‚Äôm only responding to point 1 because that‚Äôs all I needed to see that you‚Äôre not seeing the big picture of the story apparently. The show does not do a poor job establishing his fear of losing someone because the fear isn‚Äôt directly related to Ellie. His fear is that as he gets closer to ellie his fear in losing her like his daughter grows. It would make sense for this fear to grow as he gets closer to tommy because the ‚ÄúJoel, tommy, Sarah‚Äù dynamic is when he lost his daughter and failed her. They highlighted it again when the ppl had their guns pointed at ellie and he froze. He also almost lost Ellie literally the episode before last nights. Twice actually. 

And his incompetence is shown in the intro to the whole series when he proved he was unable to protect the ONE person in the world he was truly responsible for."
The Last Post,Your entitled to your opinion. I appreciate you actually laying out reasons too. I don‚Äôt really agree but you shared your opinions in a reasonable respectful way so good on you.
The Last Post,I can‚Äôt imagine going through all this effort with a post like this when all you have to do is simply not watch it if it‚Äôs not for you.
The Last Post,Go outside
The Last Post,"damn, all that for such a mediocre and nitpicking take. while it‚Äôs not a groundbreaking show, it still hovers around an 8. you keep talking about plot devices like there‚Äôs a cinema bible out there somewhere. while the episodes currently out seem to have rushed some parts from the video games, they‚Äôre quite adapted excellently to fit the narrative of the series."
The Last Post,That was a long-ass post to tell us you don‚Äôt actually understand writing and character development.
The Last Post,What is this garbage essay? Lmao
The Last Post,"I just can‚Äôt understand the point of posts like this. Like what posses a person to post something this long that basically amounts to ‚ÄúEven though the show is a hit that everyone is talking about, all of those people are wrong, actually.‚Äù?"
The Last Post,Hypercriticism is a plague. Its as if people go out of their way to interpret things in the most negative way possible.
The Last Post,"Literally every reason you gave is not even close to accurate.   Typical for these types of posts on Reddit.   Your self awareness is shockingly low.   Your entire account is bashing this show.   I think we all know why.   Also, you think climate change can be stopped if everyone goes vegan lol?  Please don‚Äôt reproduce"
The Last Post,"I‚Äôll never understand people who don‚Äôt like something that‚Äôs universally praised by critics and viewers, feeling the need to post about how the thing they just don‚Äôt like is actually bad and everyone else is wrong for liking it so much. It‚Äôs okay to not like something. We don‚Äôt need a dissertation about how poor you think it is and how everyone is overrating it."

The Last Post,"If you don‚Äôt like it why did you take the time to write this? 

I don‚Äôt get why you have to call it ‚Äòoverrated‚Äô instead of just writing it off as not your thing.

The Last Post,I feel like in the real world a ton of people do end up making/changing decisions after a night of sleep. At least people who don't feel the need to stick to their opinion because it's the first thought they had.
The Last Post,"Never played the game, never watched the show, but this was the perfect length of read for the poop I was taking. Have a good day..."
The Last Post,"I think you're just suffering from ""howiwoulddaitus"" you're forming opinions about how you would have done it, and missing a lot of what you say is missing. 

I was actually just talking about this last night. How a lot of plot and character development other shows would stretch over multiple episodes, are written very economically in this show. 

Just a super short example of something you say is missing... Joel believes he's unfit to protect Ellie, and unfit to be her ""father"". 

Despite all the other instances showing him failing in his goals in previous episodes, you're ignoring the PTSD. But just inside this episode he falls asleep on watch. He's pushed by fear into inaction. He is convinced he's the only one who can ""save"" his brother, yet when his brother is out in the world on his own his brother is the one who thrives. He's reminded how he failed his daughter. He gains information about how he failed to notice that the kid was bitten. 

He's old. He knows he's lost a few steps, and he thinks that the only person he knows and trusts and believes is more capable than he is is a better choice for Ellie. A better choice for his ""daughter"". So he thinks that abandoning his daughter to the care of his brother would be the best option. But that's a selfish choice, and Joel's trying to outgrow being selfish. 

Just because you might be a bad parent sometimes, doesn't mean you get to abandon your kids. 

Joel's character growth, and obstacle he's overcoming isn't just his belief that he can't protect her. It's his belief that he's a shit father who failed at saving his daughter and will fail that once again. His growth is that despite those fears... A fear that has caused him to remove himself from humanity for a decade... He now understands that being a father and committing to the future of your children is more important than your fears."
The Last Post,"I read first point. Completely off... Perhaps you're just unable to pay attention or something... Joel has trauma from losing his daughter, he's not gonna be logical about his ability to protect Ellie. Dude... it's so fucking basic. I ain't reading the rest considering the first point is completely dogshit and doesn't even take into account the character, but is simply your personal interpretation of it from your POV instead of Joel's... 

And I was hoping for a good critique..."
The Last Post,"I don‚Äôt understand posts like this.  Is your goal to make people who like the show stop liking it and start thinking like you?

Why not just like‚Ä¶not watch the show and let those who like it enjoy it.

I see these types on posts on every entertainment subreddit I look at.

Makes no sense."
The Last Post,"I appreciate you sharing all your views and I personally disagree with a couple points. 

I think they provided multiple examples of Joel‚Äôs failures (Ellie killing the guy, the brother sneaking up on them at night, Joel falling asleep on watch). 

I think Joel does not trust many people (and Tommy shows signs of being similar to Joel in that thinking). Joel believes if he tells the community he will risk Ellie being killed on the spot. Tommy trusts Joel, but nobody else in the community has a reason to and it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù community where they all have a say. Joel is risking Ellie‚Äôs life if he chooses to tell everyone and he HATES putting trust in other people, especially any stranger. 

I also think that Joel decision to take Ellie is a lot of things that are unsaid. Joel at this point truly cares for Eliie and is scared of messing up and losing her like Sarah. He is deeply conflicted and is attempting to send her with Tommy because it‚Äôs an easy way out for him to avoid fucking up and killing someone he is starting to (or already does) love. They have been side by side for months now due to the time lapses. I personally think he decides by letting her go he is losing her and he doesn‚Äôt want to make her upset or feel unsafe because the fatherly instinct have kicked in whether he likes it or not, and that‚Äôs why he goes. 

That‚Äôs all my feedback. But everyone is entitled to their own opinions and theory‚Äôs."
The Last Post,It‚Äôs definitely a good show but I can‚Äôt disagree that it‚Äôs overhyped by a lot
The Last Post,"Fair play to your post. But I feel like if there was a huge triggering event in Sunday's episode, someone else would've written a long post about being spoonfed Joel's decision/realization that he wants to continue going with Ellie.

Damned if you do, damned if you don't."
The Last Post,All that for a drop of blood
The Last Post,"What is this, college?"
The Last Post,"I do agree that there could have been some improvements. Mostly:

Why didn‚Äôt Joel and Tommy escort Ellie?
Why did Joel change his mind?
Why did he not even consider staying at the encampment with Ellie for longer than a day?"
The Last Post,"What you're suggesting is some The Walking Dead level of hacky writing. Following to the letter the 'how to structure a story' chapter of every 'how to write' book ever is a good way to create the most mediocre, painfully predictable story filled with the most annoying tropes;

and to suggest that the one show that actively avoids doing that in a sea of mediocre, trope-filled stories that is the zombie sub-genre is poorly written because of it is just sad for someone who calls himself a writer."
The Last Post,"Don't care about any of that - still enjoying this show more than anything else I've watched in a long time.  I've never played or seen the video game and never paid attention to the hype for this show, so going in I had no bias except assuming that a show or movie based on a video game is going to be mediocre. 

I'm the type of viewer who has trouble staying awake for most 'critically-acclaimed' shows, and I don't even give a chance to commercial-ridden network television or reality TV."
The Last Post,"I think the thing you're fundamentally missing is that Joel learning to let people in and trust Ellie specifically are season long arcs and this is the midpoint of the story. Of course this episode seemingly confirms Joel's worst fears, that's what mid story complications do. They bring the main character to their lowest point before they can have their incorrect beliefs changed. 

Now Joel, deeply hurt and likely incapacitated, will be forced to rely Ellie's responsibility as he recovers, responsibility that he's openly doubted for the whole show but which was really underscored at the beginning of this episode. And he's going to learn that of course he can't protect Ellie himself, he needs a partner. With time, he'll realize Ellie is that partner and that the real reason he's struggled to protect her is because he isn't trusting her and is trying to carry both their weight instead of letting her help him too. There's even a direct call back to how bad Joel's trust issues nearly screwed them over in this episode when Joel talks about how Ellie covertly getting a gun when he wouldn't let her have one was the only reason he survived the initial attack in Kansas City.

Sure, there are individual plot beats that could be improved (I agree, Joel changed his mind about going along with Ellie too quickly and easily) but a lot of your big complaints about this episode boil down to getting upset that the main character hasn't completed his character arc in the middle of Act 2."
The Last Post,"Why do you think a wall of text justifies using the dumbest most useless word in all of criticism?


All ‚Äòoverrated‚Äô mean is other people like something more than you and you are unhappy about it. 

It‚Äôs an opinion on other‚Äôs opinions."
The Last Post,Where did you get the idea that for a story to be good the characters have to undergo some kind of change?
The Last Post,"This reads like the way my English teacher wanted me to pick apart books for the sake of picking them apart before I decided is was just better to just try to enjoy for the sake of trying to enjoy them instead.

When you pick something into pure parts and categories like this, you tear asunder any implicit meaning, losing the entire 'gestalt'. The whole being greater than the sum of its parts speaks to something *beyond* just its parts *or* its sum, but rather the simultaneous vision of both the parts and the whole. You've focused too much on the parts, and lost the forest for the trees."
The Last Post,"Not reading all of it as your first two problems are already wrong imo. He is justified in his fear of becoming incompetent to fully protect her. He's gotten very lucky so far that they've managed to make it across the US. Ellie saved his ass by shooting that guy because (unknown to him) she had a hidden gun, the dog didn't detect an infection in Ellie when it very well could have, the two people that snuck up on them despite the broken glass were actually good people and didn't immediately kill and rob them etc. He's getting old and his hearing is piss poor, as he himself states.

Your second problem - ""his incompetence isn't well established this episode"" is also wrong, as it wasn't just him over-sleeping, he also froze up when the dog went in to smell Ellie, which could have easily been the end of her.

Sorry, it just seems like you're just not properly paying attention."
The Last Post,Your post is bad writing. (I assume)
The Last Post,"People are watching it in droves and enjoying it.

You typed all this to fight and no one really cares"
The Last Post,"I ain't reading all that, I'm happy for tho, or sorry that happened."
The Last Post,I agree. I feel like the show is really light-weight. There‚Äôs a lot of interesting stuff going on but I feel like the show‚Äôs a bit rushed and we need to live in the world a bit more. The fact they spent an episode involving two other characters makes me feel like they don‚Äôt have a lot of meat to the story
The Last Post,"It‚Äôs Reddit. Youre going to be slammed. 

That being said, the show is fine. Much better shows on HBOMax."
The Last Post,"Since you‚Äôre such a expert, what successful stories have you written?"
The Last Post,Next
The Last Post,You‚Äôre a pretentious asshole. No one is impressed
The Last Post,You don‚Äôt like a show that people like? Who cares.
The Last Post,Have totally lost interest in this show after anxiously waiting for its premier. Bad writing.
The Last Post,"I actually agree with you. I noticed the weaknesses of the show as far back as ep 3. I pointed it out at the time, but I got shot down too. I think the writing is quite weak, and the overall quality will suffer because of it. I'm sure they cut corners with the construction of the show. Like I noticed there are way fewer interactions with the infected and marauding scavengers than one would expect. Maybe it was to save money? Who knows. But yeah, I think the writing is weak. I've also played the game though, and I definitely hold the game to a higher standard.

Don't worry. Opinions like this typically don't do well during the run of a show. Especially if the show is fairly well liked. These days all it takes is likable characters with comfortable political messaging."
The Last Post,The fact that you know these posts are annoying af but still posted it anyways is ridiculous.  We don't need multiple posts like this every single week.  Just let the season play out.
The Last Post,"So people love the one off gay romance episode with exactly .05% connection to the rest of the show, but when we finally have our leads show some character development it‚Äôs boring and overrated..?

Casual fans are really wild"
The Last Post,"I enjoy the show, but agree with you that the show is flawed. I have played the game, so any set backs the show has I can kind of fill in the gaps with from the game, but for someone who hasn't I can see some scenes might be a bit odd.I also didn't like how Joel just went to sleep and changed his mind immediately after an emotional conflict. 

More generally though, I like Pedro and Bellas portrayal of Joel and Ellie, but I think the show did a REALLY poor job of establishing their relatioship. This episode they felt a lot closer, but they also then immediately went to big conflict between each other, which I felt was a little too soon. 

They should have had a few more scenes establishing them getting closer throughout the previous episodes, but I guess its hard to do under limited time. In the game you had dozens of hours of interaction and just simple idle chatter between them which helped to establish their relationship so well, but in the show they boil it down to just a few key moments of dialogue and sometimes it can come off a tad cringey or inauthentic just because its so few and far between. 

I am interested to see the season play out though. There is still a lot of an amazing story left and if they can land it then I will be impressed. If not then, at least it was a more than decent video game adaptation. 

&#x200B;

And side note, I don't understand everyone going wild at you for having an opinion on a TV show."
The Last Post,"It bothered me that Tommy and Joel didn‚Äôt take the trip together. That was the biggest flaw in the episode for me but I‚Äôve never played the game nor do I know the plot of the game, and that may have simply been sticking to the storyline. It could have made for a great storyline though complete with a multitude of tragic results if they did though, IMO. 
I‚Äôve seen game spoilers hint that the TV audience isn‚Äôt going to like where Joel‚Äôs character arc was headed but killing off the top-billed, main character in 6 episodes was bold, assuming he is dead. Taking the game spoilers at their word though and seeing the next episode highlights points to a larger character development that may make your points moot and that is, with all the hype about Pascal, it‚Äôs not about him. Not knowing what is next and simply seeing what‚Äôs been presented and how ep 6 played out, the big, very meta plot twist is everything up to now and what‚Äôs ahead wasn‚Äôt about Joel, it‚Äôs about Ellie and her development in the timeline. And that‚Äôs a story I can get into because she is one incredible and dynamic character."
The Last Post,I would submit to you that posts about how some popular thing isn‚Äôt as good as everyone says (but is still good) are a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. It‚Äôs just not an interesting topic of conversation. Maybe go take a walk or something
The Last Post,I like the show and I agree with all of this. Last night‚Äôs episode was really just the most egregious example of it. I‚Äôm ready to say it is the worst of the series so far. A mixture of filler and rushed plot lines
The Last Post,no one cares
The Last Post,Is it overrated or just...widely rated?
The Last Post,the npc‚Äôs here will disagree  with you. but you‚Äôre spot on OP
The Last Post,"You know, when every comment Is pointing out how horrible of a take this is, and you yourself labelled it as ""one of those posts,"" perhaps you should just not post it."
The Last Post,"It‚Äôs just a fucking TV show, you‚Äôre taking it way too seriously, you need to get some kind of other interest in your life, or a hobby"
The Last Post,"I feel like the acting is so forced. Pedro Pascal does alright, but I cannot get over Ellie‚Äôs character. I get annoyed in general, but the jokes and the fake laughing makes me cringe. Also, the Game of Thrones syndrome where shit hits the fan and at the very last moment something saves Ellie or Joel‚Ä¶ maybe I am just losing interest in TV shows formulaic nature in general."
The Last Post,"My opinion is that it‚Äôs a perfectly fine show that‚Äôs getting a lot of buzz right now because honestly there‚Äôs not a lot of current shows that are very good airing week to week. It‚Äôs successful in my opinion because they picked a great time to air it (no dragon shows, no Yellowstone, no current big shows)."
The Last Post,Its not as good as TWD
The Last Post,"Wow. You wrote a lot and worked really hard for me to waive it all away by saying ‚Äúbut I am super engaged in the people, their arc, and their story‚Äù. Sometimes that is enough and in this case they are doing it as well or better than any other new show."
The Last Post,Not going to read all of this wall of text. If you don't like it then don't watch it. This seems like a lot of effort to explain why you don't like something to tell people that have no power to change it and probably wouldn't even if they could because they like it the way it is.
The Last Post,yeah its not really amazing its just okay to me
The Last Post,It‚Äôs an entirely different show to people who have played the game. We know what‚Äôs coming up.
The Last Post,I couldn‚Äôt read your post cus it‚Äôs too long and I downvoted you because these kind of posts are so boring and unimaginative.
The Last Post,"Idk why you‚Äôre getting all this hate lmao. Agree or disagree it‚Äôs nice to see a well thought out argument. I think it‚Äôs a good show, your critiques are definitely valid and you raise some good points. Joel changing his mind was very weak from a writing standpoint"
The Last Post,"Please, stop with this nonsense. I'm tired of reading these overrated posts every single day. Every single popular show is overrated to someone, no one gives a shit.

What do you want, a medal for being contrarian? Do you think you're going to change the opinion of the entire world and affect the show's reputation? Like, what are we supposed to do? If you think it's overrated then great, watch it with a little less enthusiasm lol. Like, what else?"
The Last Post,"It‚Äôs following the plot of the video game. Maybe your rules don‚Äôt apply since the story was written as game play originally then adapted for TV. Where the game writers have stuck (mostly) to the game‚Äôs plot. You‚Äôre over thinking anyways. It‚Äôs TV, not one of the moon landings."
The Last Post,"If you want to be a good writer, I urge you to reconsider your position on so-called writing rules. These are not laws written in stone, but mere observations made by someone who just read a lot. It's good to know them, but to cling to them fanatically is really a bad idea."
The Last Post,"Go outside and touch some grass. Self-proclaimed amateur writer critiques show that professionals worked on and knows where they all went wrong. 

You can't make this shit up"
The Last Post,Calling things overrated is overrated
The Last Post,People-STOP saying overrated or underrated when it is basically your opinion versus someone else's opinion! YOU are not the authority on ratings. Just the authority on your own opinion.
The Last Post,"I think you're right.  I don't know about the analysis, but I do think the show is over-rated.  I like it.  It's fine, but not amazing."
The Last Post,Lol you didn‚Äôt need to write a dissertation. Go outside and get some fresh or something. It is just a tv show.
The Last Post,It is an extremely overrated and boring show
The Last Post,"Yeah, these storytelling ‚Äúrules‚Äù are all bullshit. You can use them to make your story more efficient, but following them religiously is dumb. If every movie or show had to comply with these rules to be considered good, that‚Äôd mean stuff like the leftovers or everything David Lynch has ever done is bad. And it‚Äôs not."
The Last Post,"Reminds me of Christopher Moltisanti after he bought ""How to write a movie in 21 days"""
The Last Post,What's great is they are trying to breakdown someone's writing who literally has a podcast about screenwriting. Screams contrarian to me.
McMafia,"I watched this as it aired in the UK. Every week I was hoping for some sort of payoff and was continually let down. I‚Äôd skip it unless you are desperate for something to watch. If you are desperate for something to watch and haven‚Äôt started Counterpart yet, it‚Äôs the best thing airing right now. "
McMafia,this is terrible
McMafia,An AMC show called McMafia. I will pass. 
McMafia,Just finished Altered Carbon. Looking for another new good show. McMafia sucks. Counterpart sucks. Anything out there that‚Äôs good that I‚Äôm missing?
McMafia,I'd echo that. This was a big letdown for me. And I normally eat up these types of series (e.g. *The Night Manager*).
McMafia,It's a pretty good show. Some of the criticism is fair but a lot of it is from people with short attention spans who expect every character on TV to constantly emote like a cartoon character.
McMafia,"I‚Äôm completely 180, counterpart has no plot and the scifi mcguffin only serves to explore character ( it took til this week for shit to go down). At least McMafia has tension and a real sense of danger. Counterpart is all smoke and mirrors to hide the fact how little actually goes on. "
McMafia,"> Every week I was hoping for some sort of payoff and was continually let down.

Sounds Night Managerish. 
"
McMafia,"Yes, The Night Manager is a great alternative for anyone watching McMafia who is wondering when it will start getting interesting. "
McMafia,"I'm right there with you!  I felt like in the pilot counterpart had so much potential then it just got very disappointing.  I was so excited for counterpart basically, because I was thinking kind of like Fringe.  But, I was let down so bad when I saw the extremely amazing potential great idea, in the opposite direction.

McMafia has been exactly what I anticipated it.  I didn't hear it was groundbreaking, but was impressed after two episodes.  It has intrigue.  It seems like checkers is much more popular than chess.  I prefer watching chess!  McMafia is by no means amazing, but it's a good quality series well worth watching!   An example, Dark, maybe the best series to come out since 2017, and it's so underrated because people prefer not to think too much watching t.v.    Btw, altered Carbon is absolutely way ahead of its time, so it's may be getting devisive reviews, but it's groundbreaking and the series shows will now try to catch up to.  It's achieved in every way Sense8 failed to achieve (another series ahead of its time that's great).  Anyone that hasn't seen AC, watch it immediately and be prepared to be blown away.  Don't listen to negative reviews about it.  Sometimes when a show or movie (cloud atlas) comes ahead of its time, people don't recieve it well because it doesn't belong in today's time, but some we'll understand how innovative it is and applaud it and be happy to have seen the next landmark in Tv's quality standard.  
     But this opinion comes from someone with a very unpopular opinion that Black Mirror is the most overrated series today!  It hasn't been black mirror since season 2, when it was 3 episodes.  I never thought I'd say a series increasing to six episodes only shows how flawed it can be.  You can technically take all the best episodes of black mirror and make only one season out of four with six episodes with insanely incredible episodes.  The rest are forgettable.  It's a fact, the issue of me thinking it's overrated is subjective.  

Another thing, don't you have when you're looking for a new show to watch, but there all the same popular shoes and not like series like Utopia or Borgen.  Maybe Terriers or Boomtown.  I wish there was actually a post listing shows that actually have great shows that aren't so popular!  The ones that are underrated and fly under the radar, even if it's Gomorrah and has subtitles.  People's tastes are so predictable it's boring. 

 During all the cop procedurals, how come more series like the shield and southland weren't produced because obviously serialized tv is way better!  Sure now they get it, just like how now they they understand  how many insanely good tv series there are internationally, since homeland, they have slowly but surely been coming along.  Like I said, Borgen! 

 La casa de papal is incredible too btw on Netflix!  Locked up on Amazon prime is one of my favorite shows, way better than Wentworth or orange is the new black.  Btw, if you've seen Spotless you know your t.v.!  Kingdom is the most underrated tv series of the last decade including the Americans.  Kingdom is brilliant drama, but because it was on direct t.v. I understand how so many people didn't hear about it.  You will want to buy a few shirt.  Best show to watch before bed is Brooklyn 99 imo.  If you loved big little lies, you haven't seen the best tv out there because it's not that impressing.  It's good but not as good as people make it to be. I loved the night of, even the UK one, and heard the Sinner was great!   I should probably say my favorite series of all time are true detective and I love Rusty Cohles character, Lost, maybe a couple I mentioned, did I mention the Killing even though it's popular too?  Sopranos because it's one of the most groundbreaking series and can be watched over and over and just like with Lost I loved both endings!  Mr. Robot and then Friday night lights, Better call Saul, rectify, sorry, Breaking Bad, yes fine the Wire, fringe, the fall, Louie, Ray Donovan, bansee, justified, American crime story, American crime, Fargo, the leftovers, happy valley, our her, the newsroom, etc. If you loved the shield watch Braquo in French with subs, it's ten times more intense!   I have shows for days"
McMafia,"I agree Altered Carbon was good, but it wasn't Sense8 good!

Sense8 was the Wachowskis' doing Television (capital T). Every genre they wanted to cover, they did it. They gave us action, drama, suspense AND romance. 

Sense8 has great choreographed gun fights, martial arts, car chases, a great unrequited love story, police procedural bits, international spy thriller sequences, TWO mafia storylines, an Orange Is The New Black story arc that turned into Prison Break, a bollywood dance sequence, tele-novella soapy greatness, korean drama homage, and every season has a LGBT friendly orgy scene? CMON!

All this is tied together by a sci-fi, super hero origin story, illuminati, cat and mouse chase, mystery!

The Wachowskis gave us TV man! Filmed mostly **on locations in 11 different countries!** (Altered Carbon reused A LOT of sets but Sense8 never felt cheap)

 I didn't cry once when watching Altered Carbon, it just did not reach the emotional heights Sense8 did. But then again I am a sucker for pro-human, lets all hug and make world peace, we can all be better people, multi lingual, multi ethnic, humanity as one, etc etc, that was the moral of the story.

"
McMafia,"Great fucking point, but before i indulge you, I never supported orange is the new black.  Im insanely more better than that.  I said locked up is better than it!  Im not ordinary, so I would never mention OITNB.  Anyway, which is why I said I loved it.  I'm one who signed the petition and was passionate because at that time, because AC, I had never seen anything like it, but it wasn't being recieved because no offense to other straight white dudes, they couldn't take the gay scenes and such, which is total bullshit imo, but I don't want to get into opinions about such things.  It is more ahead of its time than altered Carbon to be fair.  The concept is so cebrelly refreshing, but Altered Carbon captured exactly what sci-fi is today, the reimagined blade runner cyber punk universe.  

Altered Carbon may not have filmed in 11 different countries, but it filmed in more than 11 different world's!  It will be the next best thing for t.v. after its second season and by the time it's second season arrives it will be massively huge as one can get in this demo.  

Cloud atlas is one of my favorite movies, the wacho brothers are legends!  They produce material that's visionary, no doubt about It!  My point was that Altered Carbon has succeeded in all the areas Sense8 has failed, but it still could fail being it's the most costly tv series made by Netflix and it doesn't feel like It!  Sense8 production was way better.  The two shouldn't be pitted against, but intertwined.  Point being, sense8 deserves a series run, not a stupid Christmas show!  If altered Carbon gets widely accepted, then perhaps people will revisit sense8 which may be years older, but really, years ahead of AC!  I never used to be a sci-fi fan until I saw Utopia and battlestar galatica.  I cringe at the star trek 20th century trash.  But I leanred along the way that visionaries are scientific fiction writers or creators.  Philip K Dick, and the like.  A Scanner darkly, loved It!  I think many creators in the genre have failed immensely on capturing right until recently.  Yes, in the past history there are flashes of brilliance, but it's not consistent. There's a lot of shit.  


I swear to you, science fiction is about to blow up big making history for the underdog of the demos, the genre that recieves the least at the box office (Check Blade runner 2049).   I can feel it in my bones.  So, YOU MADE THE BEST POINT in mentioning Sense8 because you made me realize how badly it gave me the chills with the immense humanity!  It's was so incredible!  It was flawless, but people don't know something so nearly perfect because they won't give off a chance if the world LBGT is mentioned and gay guy, sucks for them, but most importantly sucks for me because soooo many people didn't give it a chance (if they did it would be the most popular show), but mostly every person that finished the first season...probably 99% of people finishing season 1, loved it and said MIND BLOWN!  "
McMafia,"You're right, Altered Carbon is cyberpunk for the 21st century. 

I'm just not a big cyberpunk fan maybe, but I can see how it can scratch a certain sci-fi itch out there. 

And again AC is good show, but have you watched ""The Expanse""? That, IMO, is the BSG successor."
McMafia,"THAT is the very show the made me a sci-fi fan, my man!  I love It!  After the first season, I watched BSG.  I fell in love!  It was like when I watched Lost as it aired, there's a difference to watching a series like that live to today's age with so much information and spoilers.  Lost was an epic revolution in the way I started to write my narratives.  But also see tv.  That's why I love fast forward, and LOVE fringe so much.  But, the expanse did something I refuse to even watch shows that exist in space, it grounded it so well, I can't quite articulate, but I have a feeling you can!  It's also the show that saved the face of its channel along with 12 monkeys.  Channel zero I haven't watched but im tempted to being max Landis also created Dirk Can't let, which had a hint of Utopia because of the same musical composer and bright yellow jacket.  

But the only series I've watched that are in space are BSG and the expanse, two of the best I have a feeling.  I tried firefly, couldn't do it.  Nathan fillion is just that caricature of a cliche corn ball.  Dark matter, haven't seen, Babylon 5, stargate also haven't seen them.  But, you have awesome taste so if there's any shows you can suggest I trust in your opinion.  There's a tv series called persons unknown which I liked.  It's kind of underrated like Harper's island, but better.  I haven't seen the two seasons of humans if you know if it's worth it.  I haven't found any motivating reviews to.  There's so much content, and I write till late at night so I don't have time so I like to make sure the shows I watch are worth it.  I was thinking about watching 3%, but haven't heard much about it.  

I totally suggest you watch Dark if you haven't.  I don't watch animated series or invest in them like ""real"" shows but I just watch Final Space and it was awesome!  It's on TBS.  I actually like bojack based on the five episodes I watched, but haven't went back yet.  Rick and Morty I know is divine on Reddit and was considering.  Anything listing on Imdbs 250 best tv series list in the top 100 are all amazing shows, the ones I've seen and Rick and Morty are high on the list.  But. From watching Final Space. I got a feeling it's going to be really popular.  I love shows that subscribe to time theories; like the theory of Many world's theory.  Anyway sorry for ranting away."
McMafia,"I don't like the title of the show, it makes me think it's about the owner of a McDonald's franchise who gets in deep with the mob or something, and some gangster quips, ""he's sleeping with the fillet-o-fishes"""
McMafia,Looks like if John Cena wasn‚Äôt swoll af
McMafia,Tried this show for 4 episodes and couldn't get over just how dull it is.
McMafia,"This show is pretty good. First 4 episodes are pretty slow, but it's worth it."
McMafia,"Despite the name, the show is quite good, well at least the first two episodes.


Nothing is overdone. "
McMafia,"Excellent show, don't listen to the naysayers "
McMafia,McMafia? Really?
McMafia,[deleted]
McMafia,"For what it's worth, the show is based on a nonfiction book of the same name, which explains the concept of organized crime in the Era of globalization with a ton of nuance. This show is just a drama based on those concepts"
McMafia,I‚Äôd actually watch that. Sounds hilarious.
McMafia,the quality of the show is worthy of the quality of its title btw
McMafia,Looks like discount Dennis Reynolds.
McMafia,"agreed: tr√®s dull, especially James ""swoll af John Cena"" Norton. I was disappointed"
McMafia,"The last 2 episodes were fantastic, you should consider to watch the rest."
McMafia,"It's the title of the book. 

A book is something people read for education or entertainment. "
McMafia,"That's acutally a real thing and not a joke, the series is based on a non-fiction book named ""McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld"" by Misha Glenny.

McMafia,They really say that?
McMafia,I was curious if that was the case. Thanks for confirming that!
McMafia,This show was cancelled wasn't it?
McMafia,"Actually the BBC renewed the show in 2018, but they're taking their sweet time as usual.


[‚ÄòMcMafia‚Äô Renewed For Second Season By BBC One](https://deadline.com/2018/05/mcmafia-renewed-second-season-bbc-one-1202380138/)"
McMafia,"Yea, they keep moving where the shoot will be."
McMafia,ffs we are already in 2020... if they are not that interested they could sell it to another network..
McMafia,They should have got a new title.
McMafia,Love the first season
McMafia,A new writer?  Why? Hopefully the new writer won't suck..
McMafia,"Ooh my God, and here I was expecting it to drop early next year. I guess it will return in 2021 then. Christ."
McMafia,Why switch writers? The first season was good.
McMafia,"It won't be made. Many months ago, someone on here insisted it was already shooting because they mentioned a location. No where did it say it was currently shooting.  And obviously with this article it wasn't.  Still doesn't say when it could start."
McMafia,Thought this show was cancelled
McMafia,The ending was the best part of season 1 and it cheapens it to bring the show back like this. I'll watch season 2 but it would have been better if it just ended.
McMafia,"Lol, yes.  Great show.  Was a nice surprise.  Title was terrible and despite me searching out positive things, still almost made me ignore it."
McMafia,"Strong start, kinda weak ending, with some really bad acting at some points. Having said that, I‚Äôll still watch it"
McMafia,"Well, it is  ""very close to the truth"" in regard to FSB and organized crime that's for sure. I was actually a bit surprised about the way the showed it in McMafia. It was pretty authentic. Now  FSB (aka KGB) is not  just colluding with the mafia like in the show, but  it **is** the largest criminal organization in our country and the world. They are the enemies of Russia and Russian people."
McMafia,I thought it was a great show. 
McMafia,I love this show. The story line is intriguing. And I love The subtitles when they speak Russian. The actors are incredible. I am not concerned with how close to real life it might be. From an entertainment standpoint it is spot on.
McMafia,"The real-life parallels/[implications](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/05/government-crackdown-mcmafia-organised-crime-sees-russian-billionaires/) are more interesting than the show itself. It's [not good](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/30/mcmafia-next-of-kin-and-the-problem-with-slow-tv), at least imo. So don't claim you weren't warned when it comes stateside to AMC late this month. edit: clarity

McMafia,I couldn‚Äôt watch this show because of the name alone. 
McMafia,I enjoy it a lot anyway OP.
McMafia,"I'm glad you enjoyed it! People like what they like, right?

I was really let down by it though. Normally this stuff is right up my alley. I loved *The Night Manager*. *The Honourable Woman* and *London Spy* were really fun. Etc. But despite the exotic locals and all the money on the screen, and a solid first episode or two it was a real drag for me.

The main story feels trite and generally unthoughtful, James Norton is giving one dead, seemingly bored-out-of-his-mind lead performance, and as the linked review points out the show feels very slow without mixing in the smart nuance you need for such a tactic."
McMafia,"Man, London Spy was really good right up till the disappointing ending. 

Ben Whishaw is a wonder to watch on-screen, so it was worth it for him alone. "
McMafia,"Spoilers!!!!

It was a decent series"
McMafia,"The Son and the Daughter (main ones) were, IMO, the worst part of the show. The rest was pretty cool."
McMafia,"Ya, just decent. I thought the main character was incredibly bland. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what his motivation was. "
McMafia,Looks good enough to give a try
McMafia,"Production values are on-it, but hopefully it's actually gripping."
McMafia,Is that Nawazuddin who I saw at the end???
McMafia,I love James Norton... I think he's one of the best British actors around.
McMafia,"Actual Russian actors! Not no-names, either, but acclaimed pros. Props to BBC. "
McMafia,Looks cool. That name though...
McMafia,"This was a very interesting book, strange to see a TV drama based on it though. "
McMafia,"Which one is the clown ?




Looks great except for the stupid title."
McMafia,Czech actors too.
McMafia,"I almost skipped it due to the name. Glad I didn‚Äôt, first two episodes are great. "
McMafia,"""James Norton: not saying he was wooden, but wouldn't leave him in the same room as a beaver.""

üòÇ"
McMafia,I actually enjoyed the show. It was much better than Hard Sun which I didn't finish
McMafia,Why are those the only options?
McMafia,"I enjoyed the show.  

James Norton wasn't as good as Tom Hiddleston in The Night Manager though. "
McMafia,"It was really good.

But I wish they removed the ""Santa-Barbara"" parts of the show (Masha's pregnancy, Alex's father infidelity etc) lol"
McMafia,"It felt it was a bit slow at first but really picked up, good ending I thought as well 

Does anyone know if there‚Äôs a another series ?? "
McMafia,"Godfather is regarded as classic.I don't want to compare godfather with Mcmafia but looking from the eyes of audience who loved Godfather, Mcmafia is nonetheless it is equally entertaining and keeps you glued to the screen till last also this pilot also gives us the glimpse of Russian mafia style business."
McMafia,"Should have swapped roles with David Dencik, would have been way more interesting. And Dencik can act."
McMafia,"They could have made this into 6 more exciting episodes simply by cutting all those annoyingly boring 'James Norton looking at things without actually doing anything' scenes.

Could have been great (and it actually was at times) but there was simply not enough story. Which is kind of crazy considering it was only 8 episodes long."
McMafia,But Dencik isn't pretty
McMafia,Started watching a couple days ago. Not impressed so far.
McMafia,The sexy vicar from Grantchester is in this.
McMafia,"I've seen 4 episodes. The production is great, the story is interesting, and there are moments of genuine greatness. However, there is a line between slow pacing and boring and the show does drop below that line sometimes. Also, the direction and cinematography is massively mixed in quality, and the characters are boring as shit and don't have any chemistry."
McMafia,An AMC show is slow? Quelle surprise!
McMafia,"James Norton?

P.S. After seeing this show, if he's really going to be the next James Bond I might have to punch someone."
McMafia,Yup. He'd be a terrible Bond but he's a great sexy vicar. 
McMafia,Does Geordie ever show up in this show? His bromance with Sidney is once of the best things on television and it should transcend time and space.
McMafia,"Very enjoyable show from start to finish.  

Don't let the title put you off.  Superb portrayal of international organized crime."
McMafia,"This is AMC's new *Low Winter Sun* or *Turn*.  As good as the show may be, it's just getting very little interest from anybody.  And AMC spamming commercials for it during their other actually watched shows doesn't seem to help.

And that title.  Come to find out it's not a comedy about a corrupt McDonald's franchise?  Call me disappointed."
McMafia,"I was a little worried when AMC pushed it off to 11pm. Good show, terrible show name."
McMafia,McRussians
McMafia,Unexpected but not unwelcome. Was pleasantly surprised by this show.
McMafia,"This is good news.. I agree about the dumb name. For those of you unfamiliar, international Russian mafia story line. Very good. Give it a watch."
McMafia,"Utter drivel, probably the worst of its genre ever made. I can't think of worse. Made for today's demographics under the notion, it was born into it. Utterly forgetful and inept. Sure it had a sheen, a bit of glossy polish, acting pedigree, production value. But the content was dreadful. Too prove it. Sopranos is the World's best 10/10, followed by Boardwalk Empire 8 or 9 out of 10, and then take your pick Narcos 7-8 out of 10, then a Gamorrah or Maltese mafia detective, or Matrioshki  etc. Where pray tell does McMafia fit on that above rating bar? It simply doesn't. What should have been a cool gangster series, it had a few moments. Namely in Mumbai, quickly descended into stupidity driven by cliche. Where all it sought was a damn parody at the Kremlin. Because of memafia's damn bankers."
McMafia,"Well I guess absolutely no chance at him coming back now. Although if Geordie is still on, I'll keep watching."
McMafia,"Yes. but i thought 8 episodes for single season was less, what do you think?"
McMafia,"The name comes from the book, so it's unfortunately appropriate that they used it."
McMafia,"Well, tbd if/when Season 2 comes stateside. It works in the UK, enough so to commission a S2, but I'm not sure it did here."
McMafia,How's it s terrible show name? I don't think it is.
McMafia,More like McJews.
McMafia,The name does have a business related meaning behind it. Although it does sound like an item from McDonalds.
McMafia,"I agree, I didn't like it much at all. And these types of shows are normally catnip for me."
McMafia,I agree it's not as good as those shows you mentioned but it's not completely unwatchable
Pure,It didn‚Äôt seem that way the last time we saw her!
Pure,"Lucia is in love with Albie....'s money, lol."
Pure,"The title of the piece is predictably lacking some serious context on that quote:

>	She sees an opportunity, she sees an occasion and she goes for it. She makes the decision. So, I do think she is a little bit in love with him but in the end the dream prevails, the objective prevails, the goal is what matters."
Pure,Albie got to have his wounded bird for a week and basically suffered no consequences so sounds like everyone won.
Pure,"Her ending was the best case scenario for her, Albie and his father."
Pure,"We are lead to believe that Lucia is 100% ready to leave the game when Albie offers her a way out. We see many scenes that show her really contemplating the idea of leaving. We can‚Äôt be 100% sure which of those scenes are real or which are an act (but my assumption is that some aren‚Äôt an act). 

But at the very end, before she rides off into the sunset as a successful con-artist, we see her stop and look back at Albie. One could argue that this is Lucia saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a great man, and you have a pure heart that another woman will love‚Äù. But my argument is that she stops for a split second to ponder ‚ÄúI could stop sleeping with random men and settle down into a life and family that will provide for my every desire‚Äù. 

My plan is to watch this season again, and watch Lucia‚Äôs actions to see if they might‚Äôve been eluding to this ‚Äúbig con‚Äù from the very beginning. I faintly remember the girls being eager to find another man to woo over. Perhaps this isn‚Äôt for a quick buck like with originally thought, instead, maybe they make this sort of con all the time. They hope to find a lonely man who has lost hope for a real relationship, and pin him up to be the hero of their make-believe story.

At the very end, we see the two girls hug the guy that was ‚Äústalking‚Äù Lucia. This implies that it was all a setup, and that he isn‚Äôt some weird stalker or a brutal pimp. He was an actor in their game to make the experience that much more real for their target."
Pure,"Everyone‚Äôs arc in this season is to become what they looked down upon‚Ä¶ except Lucia, because she doesnt do that."
Pure,Oh please. She fucking played him like the mark his dad said he was.
Pure,You can‚Äôt be pure at heart and hire someone to be your pimp to scare someone into thinking your life is in danger and bilk them of a cars worth of money.
Pure,Hottest actress on TV
Pure,"The ending scene between Lucia and the pimp guy showed that their relationship wasn't real. It was all based on a facade.

She is most definitely not 'pure at heart'. she is 100% a scammer. Just because she is shown being content, it doesn't change anything."
Pure,Press X: Doubt
Pure,She might like Albie but if she loved Ablie she wouldn't have just taken the money and ran.
Pure,"she was never in love with him.  He was just a mark, like his father said."
Pure,"It was just showing the repeating cycle of the men in their family ruining everything with their dicks.

 He doesn't care even. It's just that he wanted her and this gave him her. 

He just grew up and realized he's just like his dad and grandfather. 

Proof is the woman walking in the airport in the end. They all just gawk at her like she's a slab of meat.

 Gramps never changed but learned to live with it and be happy, pops never changed and is still struggling with his shit, and boyo is just saying fuck it i guess this is how we are.

 In that moment looking at the girl in the airport It just seems to me they're all just doomed to be led through life by their dicks."
Pure,In what world? People have been killed over 1200 dollars. Bounce that check.
Pure,"It‚Äôs hard for her to respect Albie if she knows she took him for a ride. There has to be a mutual respect in the relationship. Albie was easily taken advantage of. Even though Albie may feel giving the money cost him nothing, he lost her respect. How special can she really be to Albie if she feels he would do that for any woman he crossed paths with."
Pure,"Girl, just no haha."
Pure,lol then why not stay with him and use the $50k with him?
Pure,Yes because we all swindle the people we love /s
Pure,Albie was definitely a major mark. Glad it happened to him so maybe he can learn from that mistake and stop being such a simp
Pure,Yeah... So where is that 50k euros?
Pure,"Sure, until the next group of marks arrive."
Pure,"Well, this is an actress who clearly just wants to believe in her character. She literally set out to rob him, even setting up a fake pimp storyline to garner his sympathy, and then slipped out in the middle of the night. She may think he has good qualities, but she then happily and without guilt takes advantage of those qualities in a strikingly heartless way.

I mean, he was going away anyway. She could have seen him off with a story about going off to uni or some such, but she couldn't even be assed to do that. üòÇ"
Pure,Bull Shit
Pure,She was spending all day every day with him. $50k seems about right if she was charging.
Pure,This fkn title is a spoiler
Pure,Pure of heart but let‚Äôs his stupidity cost others
Pure,Nah
Pure,"That's nice. Script says otherwise, so have fun with your fanfic."
Pure,[deleted]
Pure,"She scammed some gullible tourists out of $50k. I wouldn't call that ""pure at heart"". A reluctant thief, perhaps? Either way, the money helped Dom rekindle with his wife and hopefully Lucia used the money to get out of the sex trade."
Pure,yay lets post spoilers!
Pure,Take the money and run!
Pure,Still grifting
Pure,I got played as bad as Albie...I thought he was going to marry her and that would be his Dad's penance.
Pure,Hooker with a heart of gold. Tale as old as time. Simona is an incredible actress tho
Pure,I‚Äôd love him too if he gave me 50Gs.
Pure,Nah she a hoe
Pure,Hooker with a heart of gold...
Pure,The only thing pure about her was the pure look of delight when she saw her back account.
Pure,"I don't think this is true.  She did her job, everyone checks out of the white lotus, and new ""Jon's"" check in.  Its a buisness. Same with the other girl.  she used her skills to get what she wanted. Not money, but a job singing.  Of ll the characters, she was the most honest,(and dumb at times)."
Pure,Pure at scamming
Pure,"WHY do people agree with Albie that he was ""played""? 

He had an ultra-hot sexy, fun, well-dressed, and sweet hooker at his back and call for 72+ hours.

He paid for what he got.

Please understand this."
Pure,"From the article

>**Question: Do you think any part of Lucia has a love or sympathy for Albie?**

>Answer: When I read the script, I thought she was in love with Albie because I think what happened was she was not exactly sure she would be bumping into someone as pure as him. I would say that in the end she is a good girl and probably is pure at heart. I think it‚Äôs the story that she just decides which aspects of herself she wants to follow in a particular case. She sees an opportunity, she sees an occasion and she goes for it. She makes the decision. So, I do think she is a little bit in love with him but in the end the dream prevails, the objective prevails, the goal is what matters.

So, she has a degree of affection for him but that affection isn't enough to overcome her desire to take his money and ghost him to live her dream."
Pure,"I got the sense that she sincerely liked Albie, but the opportunity to obtain a large sum of money and continue doing her own thing was a higher priority in her life."
Pure,*‚Äôs dad‚Äôs money
Pure,"**Dear, rich Dora Standpipe! HOW I LOVE HER‚Ä¶**

Father‚Äôs money."
Pure,Yeah I fully agree with how she sees the character and I don‚Äôt think the title is too misleading. She can love him and still want more.
Pure,oh wow it was completely taken out of context then.  What a shit title.
Pure,He seemed to take it well judging by his conversation with Portia - it was not the end of the world for him.
Pure,Wasn't even his money
Pure,Except his dad
Pure,He was deeply betrayed by the first person that ever showed him any real love.
Pure,yes
Pure,"I‚Äôm confused how you guys think she wants to ‚Äúleave the game‚Äù. She *hired* two guy friends to pretend to be pimps, it was a set up all along. She might have felt a little bad about conning Albie, but not enough to not do it."
Pure,Or they die
Pure,"And Portia. She gets out of her job like she wanted, she gets a connection with Albie like she (sort of) wanted, and she gets to leave Italy alive."
Pure,I loved Daphne's character but did she have an arc or did we just learn more about her?
Pure,That‚Äôs not really the arc.
Pure,Who is that the arc for except maybe Albie and Ethan ?
Pure,Yes you can
Pure,Her last name really fits her.
Pure,why? Aubrey Plaza is hotter than her in that series
Pure,AGREED!!!
Pure,Yep all a facade. She told the pimp where they were so that they can pull them over and build more credence to their scam.
Pure,Especially cause she would've had more money if she left with Albie
Pure,Things can be more complicated
Pure,Achilles cocks
Pure,"Yeah I agree and it‚Äôs tragic because at the beginning of the series Albie sees how much it hurts the women in his life‚Ä¶ his mom, his grandma‚Ä¶ then he gets bit with the same weakness his family has and becomes an accomplice

It‚Äôs no accident that their woman-filled Italian family violently chases them away"
Pure,"But Albie didn't ruin anything.  Kid is doing just fine, and he's not ""just like his dad and grandfather"" because he's attracted to beautiful women lol"
Pure,"Pretty sure it was wired to her bank account. That being said, I feel like if the dad had just told his son about what he and Lucia had done earlier in the trip, Albie might have thought twice."
Pure,Tbh that would be pretty lame. The season had a theme of sex = power and Lucia was kinda in a league of her own with respect to wielding that power.
Pure,"Because Disney didn't write the show.

50K and now that Mia has a legitimate job, Lucia can come and go as she pleases."
Pure,"OK SEE THIS. ALBIE WASN'T ""PLAYED""!!

HE SIMPLY PAID FOR WHAT HE GOT."
Pure,The internet isn't obligated to bend to your overly broad definition of spoiler.
Pure,"He was the doorman at another hotel in town, he was helping her scam Albie."
Pure,Wasn't Giuseppe the original piano player?
Pure,The internet doesn't revolve around you. Stuff will be talked about. Get over it.
Pure,"Yeah, love may be too strong a word. She maybe adores him like an innocent puppy."
Pure,"I liked this show a lot because it didn't paint sex workers as black and white, as so much media has in the past.

I know a few sex workers, and most of them enjoy what they do most of the time and genuinely like some clients. We as a culture seem unable to process doing sex work for money and also not being a slave. They must either hate it or do it for free."
Pure,"What was her dream? Is that even clear?

Or is it to continue living this life?"
Pure,Yeah way to turn that pure guy into another hurt jaded pos
Pure,I think we can all relate
Pure,">obtain

That's a generous way to put scam"
Pure,That part pissed me off so much lol. My family was upper middle class but I can not ever imagine asking my dad for $50k for ANYTHING. Much less a prostitute lol. (I understand that Michael's character is a multi-millionaire)
Pure,\*Money's money
Pure,Good point
Pure,"Before I even saw her quote, that was my reading of it as well- she did sincerely like him, but the opportunity to get a big sum of money and keep living her own life was too good to pass up."
Pure,How can you love someone you conned lol
Pure,His dad gets to talk to his wife again
Pure,"and his mom, who he lied to about his dad so he could feel better about himself by rescuing the woman who he viewed as helpless"
Pure,"Yeah she literally starts the season trying to talk her friend in to getting in to sex work because it's easy, fun and lucrative."
Pure,Just one. And she didn't hire him
Pure,"For better or worse, she also got the adventure she was pining for.  Bit of a monkey's paw on how that desire was granted, but she got her excitement and a fresh outlook on life."
Pure,"Portia was so disappointing to me.  She finds out her boss is dead and her response is ""Can I get your phone number?"""
Pure,No she basically becomes Tanya by the end.
Pure,I feel like Daphne's character was meant to be somewhat unshakeable (and thus didn't have too much of an arc)  because that's what she had learned in her relationship prior with Cameron.
Pure,Something about this show brings out the wildest takes in people.  Like even the most cursory glance at where all the characters start vs where they end completely shoots down the top level comment.  But there it is getting upvoted and making people feel smart.
Pure,HA
SS-GB,What is SSGB? 
SS-GB,There's just something so gripping about SS-GB that makes me prefer it
SS-GB,"I'm really enjoying SS-GB. It's a slow burner, but I'm a fan of most of the actors (especially Maeve Dermody from Serangoon Road) and I don't demand non-stop action. But the best character is the SS man Huth. It feels weird to like a Nazi, but he's got a great deal of charm to go with his evil undertones. 

It helps to have a strong interest in the actual history of the period, otherwise it may just seem like a Nazis in Britain show for those tuning in out of curiosity. Viewers kind of need to feel like ""holy shit, what if this actually happened!"" Rather than ""oh, look, cool, Nazis in London."" "
SS-GB,C-Span.
SS-GB,"I haven't seen SSGB, but the Man in the High Castle S1 was almost good and I gave S2 four episodes before I pulled the plug.."
SS-GB,It's a mystery show set in England after the Nazis won World War 2.
SS-GB,"Would you recommend it, then?"
SS-GB,"So, it's not a case of just having Nazis in a place they weren't, but of having these people in a time and a scenario in which they weren't.

What is it that's so charming about Huth?

What kind of way does the show go, then, if not action?"
SS-GB,What do you mean?
SS-GB,"Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.

I haven't watched it since the 1st episode."
SS-GB,Is that is full name or an abbreviation? And what channel? Literally never heard of it.
SS-GB,"Well it hasn't been getting the best reviews, some people find it boring. If you enjoy dialogue driven and mystery style stuff, then it is for you. It's a quasi-police procedural too, and really ramps up towards the end. I love it, others maybe not. I definitely recommend it though. "
SS-GB,"The show so far is mainly about making hard choices in a complicated world. Rather than action, it basically asks questions through the various characters. 

The country is occupied by a hostile foreign power. Do you go along to get along? Do you fight, resist? What if you have children or a wife who depends on you, do you risk your life then? What if your job requires you to work with the occupiers? Do you do so & risk being labeled a collaborator? Who do you trust with your life? 

Huth's charm is partly due to the actor's charisma, but also to the character. Huth is definitely a loyal German, but not an ideological Nazi, despite being in the SS. So there's room for nuance. He knows he can't totally trust his British underlings, but knows he needs them to get anything done. He's somewhat flexible, something you don't often get from Nazi bad guys. "
SS-GB,"C-Span and C-Span 2 are American channels which show our elected officials at work. I called America's current right-wing government Nazis.  

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/13/amazon-launched-a-fake-radio-station-to-promote-the-man-in-the-high-castle-angry-trump-supporters-thought-it-was-real/"
SS-GB,"SS-GB is full name, is on English channel BBC One every Sunday.

Started a few weeks ago."
SS-GB,"Hmm. Not sure how much I'd like it if too much talking and not enough interesting stuff going on.

Or, non-talking stuff.

Thanks, I appreciate that.

What do you attribute poor reception to?"
SS-GB,"It's also a book, pretty good, you should check it out if it sounds like your thing"
SS-GB,"The first episode got bad press because people were complaining about the characters mumbling or not speaking clearly. Outside of that, I think the general lack of action particularly in the second episode led to a poor reception. It is very much a mystery story and zeroes in on Detective Douglas and who he is as a moral figure."
SS-GB,"Awesome, thanks!"
SS-GB,Len Deighton wrote the book in the 70's.
SS-GB,"I do as well, very much.  I loved the book when I was a kid, and have often thought it would be a great series.  And it absolutely is.  Top of my list for the moment."
SS-GB,"I'm loving it. I really like Huth, which feels weird because he's, you know, a Nazi. Third episode ended with a real bang. "
SS-GB,"Oh yes. Definitely going to give this a go. I couldn't even get through the ""The Man in the High Castle"" but this looks much more interesting. "
SS-GB,Why punch and shoot the Nazis when he could debate their views rationally? Doesn't he see that he's becoming as bad as them? /s
SS-GB,Oh yes I'm gonna watch this. Looks very interesting.
SS-GB,"If I disliked the *premiere* of The Man in the High Castle, should I give SS-GB a go?"
SS-GB,Love alternate history stuff so might check this out
SS-GB,I like the style. Couldn't stand The Man in the High Castle after 3 episodes. Love the gritty look while Man in the High Castle looked far too glossy
SS-GB,"Reminds me of that episode in Misfits where [spoiler](#s ""that one guy uses his time travel powers to kill Hitler and fails, resulting in a Nazi-controlled UK"")."
SS-GB,[deleted]
SS-GB,"It is not just an alt-history story. The book is specifically a *detective* story, against an alt-history background. I'm hoping the TV series will be a reasonably faithful adaptation, because the book was excellent."
SS-GB,Why could you get through Man in the High Castle? Was it boring?
SS-GB,the man in the high castle picks up in the s2 the s1 tries to follow as much as they can  (but not really close ;( )
SS-GB,What do you mean?
SS-GB,[deleted]
SS-GB,So edgy
SS-GB,I know no one named that.
SS-GB,"At the very least, expect ""Alt-History"" to be taught in schools."
SS-GB,"It just has mostly loathsome characters. 

The best (in terms of acting development and character arc) guy is the obergruppen german officer"
SS-GB,Think they're referring to some Yank white nationalist guy that got hit and the backlash against the the people who did it. 'They're being intolerant of his intolerance blah blah.'
SS-GB,"A lot of people on Twitter on Sunday seemed to be unimpressed, not into it and all that.

I'm glad you like it. I'm not sure, with their overwhelmingly negative reaction to SS-GB, whether to give it a go.

And, after TMITHC turned me off idea."
SS-GB,"Do you mean specifically the show, or the book?

I watched the premiere and couldn't find enough hope, or comfort, to continue to E2, despite it being one of the most wildly successful premises of all."
SS-GB,In SS-GB?
SS-GB,[deleted]
SS-GB,"It was less the intelligence of High Castle and more the overwhelming sense of pervasive cruelty that bothered me, compared to good."
SS-GB,Cannot wait for this one.  One of the best books ever.
SS-GB,"So, Man in the High Castle?"
SS-GB,Looks interesting.
SS-GB,"This is either a cynical cash in, or a lot of palms hit faces when Man In The High Castle dropped."
SS-GB,This and the knights show its a good year
SS-GB,what you mean dropped? the ss gb book is good too if you havent read
SS-GB,What knights show? I'm curious to know
SS-GB,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RrCwuCdxA 
SS-GB,Thanks
SS-GB,"The new Wet Hot American Summer series too, they barely promoted it (Seriously confused as to why) and even in this subreddit there weren't people discussing it. Also, The Tick, Fleabag and American Vandal. "
SS-GB,Totally seconding Superstore and Trial and Error. They're both so incredibly funny. And I've been meaning to give Wrecked a try.
SS-GB,[deleted]
SS-GB,Y'all heard of Game of Thrones? It's like Lord of the Rings meet House of Cards. Pretty good show.
SS-GB,"I love some of those. But I want to add one more: **Halt and Catch Fire**. 

It recently ended with a wonderful finale and each season getting better as time went on. I dare to say it's with Better Call Saul as the best AMC show of the year. Too bad AMC seemingly didn't care for it in the last season."
SS-GB,"Utopia is a good recommendation but i do feel it is quite popular  and gets mentioned quite a bit on this sub-reddit. 

I'm checking out The Exorcist and Patriot tonight because of a few posts on here (including yours). The Knick i'm aware of but have a hard time pulling the trigger on a medical drama (never watched more than one epsiode of House for the same reason)

Of the rest which would you recommend the most?"
SS-GB,"I have a couple!

[Witless](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5237932/), **Comedy/Thriller**: A show about two flatmates who witness a gang shooting and are put into witness protection, but the gang are after them. 2 series so far with 5 episodes each. Takes about 4-4.5 hours to finish and it's absolutely worth it. The leads are hilarious and it boasts a great and funny supporting cast. Series 3 will be it's last and will premiere early 2018. Don't miss out on this show!

[Flowers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5619658/), **Dark Comedy**: A dark comedy about a dysfunctional family. Not much more I can say without spoiling it. This showmis in my opinion a little masterpiece. The cast is great and the writing is very clever and leaves you wanting more! Besides, it has Olivia Colman. How much more convincing would you need?

[Queen Sugar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4419214/), **Drama**: A drama about three siblings who inherit a sugar cane farm from their dad which brings them all together. Not the most exciting of premises, but it's absolutely fantastic. The cast is amazing, the writing is incredible and the characters are all extremely likable. There's nothing I dislike about this show. Absolutely a must-watch in my eyes.

[The End of The F***king World](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/), **Dark Comedy**: Only came out as recently as late October, but all episodes were released simultaneously. It's a little British show about a teenager who realised he's a psychopath and his angsty teenager girlfriend who go on a road trip to find her biological father. It sounds like a incredibly cringy premise at first, but it's absolutely not. The actors are what make this show work. Alex Lawther (Black Mirror) and Jessica Barden give outstanding performances here and manage to make 2 characters that could've easily been annoying and unlikable into characters you end up rooting for. Another familiar face is Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy). Also a short show which won't take up much of your time, but is absolutely worth it.

[Imposters](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5212822/), **Drama/Comedy**: A show about three people trying to find a con artist who marries people and then steals her partner's money, all of whom are victims. At first it may seem like a fairly generic show, and it doesn't really kick into high gears until episode 4. Once it does, however, it's a pleasure to behold. Inbar Lavi is fantastic as the con artist and the three victims are all very well acted and hilarious. The writing is very witty and has great twists and turns all over the place. Not to mention the show has Uma Fucking Thurman in a recurring role!

[Rectify](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2183404/), **Drama**: Probably more well known within these circles, but still felt like I had to include it. It's about a man who is freed after 19 years on death row thanks to new DNA evidence and him having to reintegrate into society. It's a beautiful show through and through, although it can be very slow and depressing depending on your tastes. I like to call it Character Development: The Show. Definitely not for everyone, but if it is for you it's an absolute sight to behold. The cast is outstanding and the writing feels extremely real and well done. Definitely a show for the ages, and not one to miss."
SS-GB,I miss The Knick.
SS-GB,"That's a nice list, but I'm here to spread love for ...

SS-GB,"Im starting and then there were none tonight!

I love the Knick as well.

Im probably alone on reddit saying this, but Utopia bored the shit out of me.

SS-GB,"Berlin Station. It's on Epix. Didn't even know that was a channel. It's about a CIA station in Berlin and its various spies, handlers, etc. Very good realistic thriller, great acting, with none of that unbelievable violence that is typically found in the genre where the hero kills people every episode. Also has a good amount of strong female characters, again not something typically found in the genre."

"Wave, Listen to Me!",Kim was one of the all time great characters on TV
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Actually I like her scene with Tony Dalton better where she confronts and shows him up. The sheer command with which she delivers her arguments leave him with a lot to think about and so he just... leaves. 

Palpably tense and incredibly staged scene between the 2 characters (Saul being the 3rd character but who's just kind of... standing there)."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","She‚Äôs my dream right there.  I wish someone that good had my back. 

I get chills watching her scold Howard when he handed her Jimmy‚Äôs inheritance from Chuck."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Baddest bitch on earth.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Goddam she was so good. This scene, and when she told off Howard for offering to let Saul go through his brothers house after it burned were just peak performance. Her and Howard might be my favorites on that show"
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Nobody had scenes that made me audibly say ‚ÄúFUCK yes‚Äù like Better Call Saul did. Kim had her flaws but it‚Äôs so satisfying seeing characters be unapologetically right about shit. And her *‚Äùwhoever represents you next, I hope you‚Äôre going to listen to them better‚Äù* is such a good parting clapback to Kevin‚Äôs *‚ÄùJimmy McGill? You can do a whole lot better‚Äù* from earlier. I‚Äôll always be missing this show."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Yuuup
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Best ponytail on television
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Of all the characters in the Saul / Breaking Bad universe that went bad she is the one I have empathy for because she is the only one who actually had enough conscience to try and make things right by her own choice.  Everyone else stayed bad (Walt, Mike, Gus),  or got forced into consequences (Saul, Skyler), or evaded them (Jesse).  Kim came close to Breaking Bad completely but stepped back of her own volition and then turned herself in for it."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","It's scenes like these that make me love Kim.  Her fearlessness is one of her greatest qualities, she *always* steps up when it needs to be done, she constantly makes the difficult decision no one else would make.  She is willing to lay it all on the line not to save herself, but for the outcome she wants.  Ice ruins through her veins."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Such an incredible actress... After the scene in the episode Breathe where she rips Howard a new one I had to pause the episode to get a ‚Äúholy fuck‚Äù or two in, before skipping back and watching it again."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Kim ended up being my favorite character, and it was cemented after seeing more of her growing up with her shitty mom and figuring out for herself what was right and what was wrong."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I love that woman.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I‚Äôm surprised she has no Emmy nomination
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I fucking love Kim!
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Love Kim Wexler on so many levels!
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Slipping Jimmy more like Slipping Kimmy lol
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Anybody else want a new BB/BCS Universe series centered on Kim Wexler as an attorney trying to help the little guys?
"Wave, Listen to Me!",She totally reminds me of my mom. She used to advise me to go to bed. Never did
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I need a woman like Kim Wexler so bad it's not even funny
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Why is this in news?
"Wave, Listen to Me!",God damn she was good on that shoe. Some epic moments of acting
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Kim Wexler don‚Äôt play that shit
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I think it‚Äôs bull shit BCS and Rhea got snubbed at the Oscars.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Such a great fucking scene. Fuck does she rule
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Better Call Kim!
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I'm left to watch the last season
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Such a layered and interesting character. She liked to ride her high horse but really she loved the thrill of corruption as much as Jimmy. But while she had core values to eventually slow her down, Jimmy gave himself up to Saul."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Yet only one Emmy nomination and Rhea didn‚Äôt win.

One of many reasons I don‚Äôt give a shit about award shows."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","And her arc was probably something no one could have ever predicted, yet still makes sense! Such a beautiful complex character."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I appreciate you not adding 'female'.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",">Kim was one of the all time great characters on TV

Disagree"
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Her post breaking bad scenes were easily Emmy worthy but alas
"Wave, Listen to Me!",That scene was so well written that it made it believable she was not Howard'd. Which later we learned Lalo would have had no problem with.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","No hyperbole, that's one of the best scenes ever put on television. I barely breathed through it."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Amazing [scene](https://youtu.be/osPVh1mT5Wo), just the way you feel awful for everyone involved."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",The scene was just perfection. Her throat even catches a bit at first but then she gets her bearings and rips into him. So authentic and beautiful.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",That ponytail got me sweatin
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Fine as hell too
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Her and Avasarala (From The Expanse) are some of my favorite characters ever.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",The emotion in that scene was unreal
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Jesse ""evading consequences"" is an interesting take."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Jesse suffered as much as almost anyone. He was literally kidnapped and tortured and enslaved.

""Evaded consequences.""

He didn't go to jail, but neither did Kim."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",We all are.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",she has one for BCS and one for another show but no wins sadly
"Wave, Listen to Me!",We all do.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","It would be pretty extraordinary for them to win an Oscar, considering those are for movies üòâ"
"Wave, Listen to Me!","I was hoping she'd eventually change her name to Sally and go full on corrupt too.

That's why I'm not a writer."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","One thing I found super interesting which I admit I did not pick up from the show alone, in some creator background material they revealed Kim deeply regrets rejecting her mom as a child.(the shoplifting, drunk driving etc)

I guess you could draw a line from that to her attraction to Jimmys antics."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I don‚Äôt think she was even into a high horse thing I just think she had a more normal reaction to crime and corruption than Jimmy. But she was just as into it deep down as she was
"Wave, Listen to Me!",">she loved the thrill of corruption

 I feel like she loved the thrill of justice, and became more convinced that the only way to get it was through corruption. Her saving grace was the pro bono work. Where she could fight for justice without having to compromise herself. She experienced financial success with Mesa Verde initially, but became disgusted by what they were doing. Experienced tearing down deceitful people like Howard and Chuck, but saw what happens when you get in too deep with corruption. I don't think the thrill of that corruption was ultimately her driving force in any of it. It was the thrill of breaking free from an unjust confining system. It was that unjust system that hurt Jimmy, in her view, and it's why she was drawn to his willingness to work outside the system to find success despite it holding him down. But the divide came about because he was all about his own success at any cost, and that was never her aim. It was just that her sense of justice meant Jimmy deserved success when he was working his ass off legitimately while his brother and Howard kept him down."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Reminiscent of Skylar in Breaking Bad but sooooo much more complex and compelling. She's like Jimmy's last shred of morality, once she starts getting into his antics it almost enables him to the point of no return."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","they're mostly a promotion tool for the industry, no one should actually care about them"
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Which is insane. When you watch any episode she was always the emotional core of the interaction, without her the Saul-Kim relationship just wouldn‚Äôt have worked.

She should have been nominated for every season of the show with at least a couple of wins."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","I mean ""the wire"" didn't get any love from the award show. Jeff Daniels one best actor for that ridiculous show the newsroom over John Hamm and bryan Cranston."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",">Yet only one Emmy nomination and Rhea didn‚Äôt win.

She was never better than Julia Garner"
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Man, if he'd added female, he'd have had to take out ""one of the"".

Kim did for female characters in television what characters like Ellie have done for female characters in video games. Ultimately, making it so that the gender distinction is irrelevant.

Kim and Jimmy didn't have to be sleeping together, or married by the end of the things. The same ultimate arc could have been achieved by a male character acting as a best friend, or even mentor figure that realizes Jimmy goes too far. 

Media has lagged behind the realization that, sure there are differences between genders, but ultimately everyone is just a person. Gilligan and Gould deserve some props on the writing, directing, etc. front for Kim, but at the end of the day Rhea Seehorn left it all on the table in every scene she shot. That she never got an Emmy is some bullshit, lol."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I think you're comparing chalk and cheese. Howard walked in and started detailing a plan to ruin the cockroach's life. While Kim was respectfully reminding Lalo of his/their usefulness. It would make no sense for him to compromise a useful relationship.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Honestly just a notch below ‚ÄúChicanery‚Äù as a monologue
"Wave, Listen to Me!","The showrunners know it too, they put in a lot of care as they kinda used the ponytail as an indication of her emotional state"
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Finding out she‚Äôs 50 fucking blew my mind.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",He is living as a free man in Alaska despite being a primary part of numerous murders.   I'd call that zero consequences.  He lost some loved ones along the way but he caused many people to lose their loved ones.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I‚Äôm convinced they hate her
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Thanks BFF to correcting me
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Ah was there an awards show recently where House of Dragon took every category? Was it the Emmys?
"Wave, Listen to Me!","I mean, there is almost certainly a version where Kim breaks bad that the writers room didn't choose.  But in the same breathe, you would have been doing a major disservice to the show if you didn't at least entertain the idea on some level, even if it never was going to be chosen.

Part of making the right choice is comparing all the over viable options, and Kim was in a position where she could have gone either way."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","As someone very familiar with those kinds of familial dynamics, it's nice to hear it called out, and I definitely drew that line on the basis of the show alone, because IYKYK, and it was perfectly done. As always, Gilligan & co did a masterful job of building fully realized characters whose motivations are complex, logical in the context of their own histories and personas, and deeply deeply *human*. Brilliant as always üòòüëå"
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Agreed.  On the always sunny podcast they talked about how they heard it was even more insidious than that.  The first awards shows were  allegedly started to get actors to compete with each other to thwart unionizing.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",I think the romantic partnership is an important facet of their relationship. She doesn‚Äôt have to be female but things like living together and being married played huge parts in the events. The rarely shown intimacy also is used to great effect in scenes like when their shenanigans go well. It also makes the ending a lot more impactful because two bros don‚Äôt just put their life on hold for the other in a way that romantic partners do.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Couldn't agree more.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Kim Wexler pales in comparison to Peggy Olson
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Meanwhile, I'm remembering Cuddy for essentially playing the same character in House MD.  Has it really been ten years?"
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Wow‚Ä¶
"Wave, Listen to Me!","He was enslaved for half a year and had his girlfriend murdered in front of him, because he tried to do the right thing and get walt put away. I wouldn't call that ""zero consequences"". Jesse's life was entirely ruined by his actions in breaking bad. He made really terrible mistakes...when he was like 24. He did nothing but suffer consequences for his actions during breaking bad."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Zero consequences? He was literally kidnapped and enslaved by white nationalists. They murdered his girlfriend in front of him.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Kim *does* break bad. That's kinda the whole point. It's just that she ends up getting Howard, someone completely innocent and undeserving, killed right in front of her because of her addiction to and fetishization of scamming people. Jimmy takes all his trauma and stuffs it down, hiding from it under the persona of Saul. Kim on the other hand finally realizes that breaking bad is starting to have serious, life shattering consequences and has to extracate herself before anyone else gets hurt. 

She definitely goes down the bad choice road, same as Jimmy. But she's able to pull herself out of it after it gets someone killed. But Jimmy has no other coping mechanism and is already too far gone by the time Howard dies to do anything other than triple or quadruple down from there on out.

Kim even goes almost farther than Jimmy by the end. She gets more into the thrill than he does. But she was also new enough into that world that she could still get herself out by the time shit hits the fan. Jimmy, without Kim in his life, has nothing left *but* Saul and ends up getting trapped in that reality because he doesn't see any other means of escape."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Arguably we see Kim Break Bad with the Howard scam. She continually pushes it, even when Jimmy isn't fully on board. When Jimmy calls her the morning of an says he saw the judge with a cast, she turns around to save the plan instead of going to her interview.

Howard paid the price for Kim Breaking Bad and she didn't want to put anyone else through that"
"Wave, Listen to Me!",The relationship between Jimmy and Chuck is one of the most realistic and *masterful* depictions of dysfunctional family members I have ever seen! And I recommend it to people for that aspect alone.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Why are you actively downplaying Shea or her character lol? Looking from the comments here.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","I can't really attest to the actress's acting ability because I never really saw her in anything else, but I think Cuddy would have shined more like Kim did with better writing. House is a great show, and I love it, but it's mostly a great show because of House. 

Better Call Saul, you'll easily find people arguing the best characters to be Jimmy, Mike, Kim, or Nacho. Some people being up Lalo a lot, but I just wanted to mention people who were in every season."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Yeah there is a fraction of breaking bad fans that just hate Jesse and I don't understand it.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","And he still murdered people and had a role in the deaths of many others and is currently living free in Alaska.    Everyone lost people but Jesse is the only major bad guy character to either not die or face legal consequences.  Jesse should either be on death row or in prison for life, not living free.   Saul was no innocent but he had no direct hand in murdering anyone whereas Jesse did."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","You‚Äôre mostly right, but he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútoo far gone‚Äù until Kim left. That‚Äôs what broke him and caused him to go full Saul."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","That was really the moment where Kim's life hit a crossroads.  Had Howard not shown up, Kim continues down that path and potentially becomes just as bad as Saul or maybe even worse.  She wanted Howard's life absolutely destroyed, but she still wanted him to have a life.  Up until that point, it was just a game for her, and that's when the reality slapped her, and she had to face what she was doing.

And it also highlights, despite how similar they were, the fundamental difference that kept them from ending up together.  Kim had a conscious and was always doing what she did out of a sense of morality or righting a wrong (or, at least, that's what she'd tell herself), so she felt she needed to do penance and exiled herself to Florida.  For Saul, it was like he crossed a line, and there was no going back afterwards.  He was more in denial until that final courtroom scene."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Yeah Howard being there to complain and getting caught in the other deal changed her.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Walt got as far as he did out of dumb luck; he just seemed to keep winning and nobody he cared about got killed until the very end (although Hank had a close call). If he'd seen someone who mattered to him die because of his actions early on he might not have taken it so far.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","I don't think it's ambiguous at all, what she did was absolutely horrendous. The difference is she recognized it and felt remorse and tried to make amends.


But what she did was absolutely vile."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","I've seen the actress in other stuff, and she's played varying characters really well. She can play dramatic and comedic characters, competent, complete messes, etc."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Okay but you said ""zero consequences"" but he was enslaved and had his girlfriend murdered."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","In the end, Jimmy and Kim both chose their conscience. The reason one of them ended up in jail is he went too far and his self redemption came too late."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Legal consequences doled out by the American justice system, is what I think he meant"
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Definitely.  It just took Jimmy a lot longer to realize he had a conscious after what happened with Howard and own up to what he had done.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","He tried to cooperate with the law and the police that were helping him do it were murdered. He was attempting to make right with the law. Was reporting every single crime they committed which was even more transparent than Kim.

Think your tunnel visions by your hatred for him. He was literally working with the law to try to get justice for all of those actions. I'm sure he would have rathered continued with his cooperation rather than have the detectives be murdered in front of him, where he then was kidnapped and enslaved.

The only reason it didn't happen was because he had even worse luck and was kidnapped by white nationalists. But he literally confessed every wrongdoing they committed. Two detectives on tape and then got caught and tortured as white nationalist watched his confession."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",two and a half men is multi cam right so it reuses sets a lot or whatever probably and doesn't do a lot of on location filming.
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Multi camera v single camera. Single camera  has more locations  and more takes v multi camera shot mostly on reused sets with a couple takes at most.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Multicam shows are more like doing a play, you can run through a lot more of the show in one take and cover a lot more angles at a time. Longer takes + fewer setups = much shorter days."
"Wave, Listen to Me!","Actor/entertainment worker here.

Multi camera sitcoms like 2 and Half Men, Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld, all are shot like stage plays that are also being recorded. The actors have to memorize all their lines and scenes and marks and it takes a lot of preparation. But you show up to one location (the set). All the set locations are built for you (the office, the house, the back yard, etc). Lighting is already set up. And in a few hours on filming day you can shoot a 22 minute episode. The general order of things is something similar to this: script is Monday. Table read/rewrites Tuesday (and of course throughout the week). Rehearsals/camera blocking Wednesday and Thursday. Friday is filming. Maybe a handful of pickup shots throughout the week. But it's a very efficient way to do things. 

On a single camera show, you're not limited to a few sets. The scope of those shows usually means a larger number of locations. And often you're traveling to them. And with that, it requires more time to set up. Everything has to be lit, set dressed, etc. You're not just shooting the same three walls week after week. You need four walls and you have to find them often in new places. You have to close down streets and coordinate stuff. And like the name implies, generally there are a lot of shots only using one camera, or at least that's the aesthetic. So you have to set up constantly for new shots. And setting up those shots takes time to coordinate lighting, camera people, actors, etc. It's more involved. So rather than set up for one big scene to be filmed at a time from afar, you're setting up hundreds of shots to be filmed individually. You're filming every day rather than on one day. It's constant. It's going to take longer filming 4-8 pages a day versus shooting it all in one quick go of things.

Granted, you could still do single cam like a play with the only difference being people hold the cameras and there's no audience. It's Always Sunny shoots most of their bar stuff that way. But what happens with those styles is that you often have more locations to go to because you can. It's not just everything in the house/office/bar. And you're spending a lot of time traveling and getting things perfect. You're less likely to see shots of actors covering their mouths and laughing like you would with friends. You have more passes and retakes of doing the thing. There's less structure in that style of creating that just expands the schedule."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",Game shows are the best production schedule. Bang off a couple of weeks shows in a couple of days.
"Wave, Listen to Me!","My Name is Earl was a single cam show with locations that were a mix of soundstages and on location. Two and a Half Men was a Multi-camera show shot exclusively on one soundstage with very occasional trips to a backlot.

Multi-camera is often shot with a live studio audience. They're often there for a long time, but it's not like 10 hours. You can literally just brute force scenes through and it's a lot like live theater with the same urgency and energy.

Multi-camera sitcoms are also usually all shot on one soundstage with a couple permanent main sets all adjacent to one another. Changing locations for a scene usually just means scooting over to the left or right by a few feet. On special occasions they will shoot exteriors, always on a backlot. They do these sorts of scenes infrequently because they are more expensive.

Multi-camera sitcoms are... multi-camera. You have a few cameras recording the same action. In single cam shows, you have to reshoot a scene again from scratch if you want a different angle. Every time you move a camera you have to adjust lights, focus, move production equipment around so it's not in the shot, etc. Takes time.

Film sets are a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" It's long hours, but a lot of that time is involved with the technical process of setting up a shot. For multi-cam sitcoms, a lot of that tech debt is done ahead of time before the actors even show up for the day. All the lighting is figured out ahead of time and camera movements are simple and routine."
"Wave, Listen to Me!",">  I was just listening to Ashton kutcher on Howard Stern and besides the crazy facts that he made $750k an episode on 2 and half men

Why is that a crazy fact?

Kutcher is an A lister who was replacing the lead of a hugely successful show whose main character's public image had disintegrated. Kutcher had everything to loose."

The Big Show Show,WELLLLLLLLLLLLLL ITS THE BIG SHOWWWWWWWWWW.... show

The Big Show Show,He'll always be The Giant to me. nWo 4 Life
The Big Show Show,"Good for him - it's nice to see him picking up some post-WWE work, and he is genuinely funny. I doubt I'll watch this, but hopefully it's the kind of thing someone's looking for."
The Big Show Show,This will be awful.
The Big Show Show,"Before the end of the first episode, he'll turn heel, then face, then heel again."
The Big Show Show,0.3
The Big Show Show,"Back and forth, vice versa"
The Big Show Show,And when will he feud with Kane?
The Big Show Show,You're missing part. The Big The Big Show Show.
The Big Show Show,"We all are üòÇ

The Big Show Show,The Low-Cal Calzone Zone
The Big Show Show,tom green and andrew dice clay were supposed to do a show with that name a bunch of years ago but it did not get picked up
The Big Show Show,#***WELL ITS THE BIG SHOW***
The Big Show Show,"When he leaves the room, shouldn't they say, ""well, that was the big show""?"
The Big Show Show,*Canned laugh*
The Big Show Show,Hopefully that would get it cancelled faster
The Big Show Show, **Water sucks. Gatorade is better.**
The Big Show Show,Mr Nanny and Suburban Commando... what a time to be alive.
The Big Show Show,"Just adding Santa With Muscles here. He's not a babysitter, but it's a really fun movie."
The Big Show Show,They're getting Limp Bizkit to do the theme song.
The Big Show Show,Well wrestling has always been notoriously behind the times especially nowadays with a company micromanaged by a 70 year old. Where's the zubaz pants and fanny packs?
The Big Show Show,Probably an attempt to do what Drive to Survive did with F1. Bring in fans that are not normally WWE people.
The Big Show Show,You will be awful
The Big Show Show,"every episode will be something like this:

big show is loved by his family! then he does something to make his wife or a daughter mad, but by the end of the episode he makes up for it and is loved again"
The Big Show Show,"Ah, okay.

So it's Full House."
The Big Show Show,When he's leaving the room for just overhearing him enter the next room
The Big Show Show,At least once
The Big Show Show,"Yes! I actually just finished watching Mad Men for the first time a couple hours ago and watched one of those [‚ÄúWhere were they before Mad Men‚Äù things on YouTube and hoooly crap 0:34](https://youtu.be/NQHREFdQiTc)

That was a weird coincidence"
The Big Show Show,"> Where's the zubaz pants and fanny packs?

I don't know about the Zubaz but if you are looking for a fanny pack just go ask ol doot doot doot himself. I'm sure he has an extra one lying around."
The Big Show Show,Oh I see you've seen any episode of the hot wife/oaf husband type sitcom
The Big Show Show,"wow, ha ha ha"
The Big Show Show,He is a man of culture.
The Big Show Show,This looks surprisingly awesome
The Big Show Show,Welllllllllllllll...
The Big Show Show,https://i.imgur.com/jtQVTyk.jpg
The Big Show Show,This looks hilariously awful.
The Big Show Show,"that looks absolutely terrible. but I'm sure there's a huge audience for it. Also, urkel."
The Big Show Show,It's Netflix and the girl was white. You knew her bf was gonna be black. Every time
The Big Show Show,"welllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll it's the big show

it's the big bad show tonight"
The Big Show Show,Think he'll get his rematch with the Bushwhackers?
The Big Show Show,Why do you care and/or why does that bother you?
The Big Show Show,who cares
The Big Show Show,What a very cult like question
The Big Show Show,"Nope, just a genuine question; if you can‚Äôt answer it though, that‚Äôs on you."
The Big Show Show,Maybe the fact the answer isn't inside you is the issue
The Big Show Show,"I‚Äôll take that as a no then. Not a surprise that you bitch about such things on the internet, but when asked for your reasoning, you can‚Äôt fathom any."
The Big Show Show,Wow ok chill. You're too angry
The Big Show Show,"Stop distracting from the big question about the big show. How is any superstar going to throw a 500lb, 6ft tall leviathan over the top rope???"
The Big Show Show,"Says the guy pissed about interracial dating

find something better to focus your angst at"
The Big Show Show,Tha big dog!
The Big Show Show,I just finished both. This is irritating
The Big Show Show,We know she's a genius because she wears glasses.
The Big Show Show,"While I don't think this show will makes anyone's ""must see"" lists, in fact I would say it pretty forgettable: It's charming enough to watch. 

It doesn't follow the ""insufferable genius"" trope, and doesn't even do the ""Hollywood homely""

She's in an interesting position: 16, finished PHD's, and working a job where she makes more money then her guardian. But, at the same time, she's a teenager, and needs a guardian,  and dealing with all that comes from being a teenager. 

I enjoyed it."
The Big Show Show,"I was on set for the premiere and it‚Äôs definitely not something I‚Äôd watch. 

It‚Äôll scratch the old ‚ÄúFull House‚Äù itch. Safe tween programming."
The Big Show Show,"I watched all eight episodes already and loved the show - it's pretty cute! Really hope Netflix renews this.

Only reason I was interested in this was because of Allison Munn and ended up loving everybody else too."
The Big Show Show,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLL!!!!............
The Big Show Show,"Scenes with Big Show were good but the kids were just too much. Always screaming or doing stupid stuff. Basically being kids, yeah, but took all the fun out of the show.¬†Kids are good in Fresh off the Boat for example. Here they just sucked."
The Big Show Show,"I think it‚Äôs a huge mistake to pull HBO originals off HBO Max. It‚Äôs a huge draw for me, and we‚Äôve been rewatching The Wire and finally getting around to going through Veep and Deadwood. I think it‚Äôs fine to try to leverage all that content with a FAST channel, but to do it by taking it away from the ad-free HBO service is really crappy."
The Big Show Show,The thing about HBO is that most of their shows were made with no natural breaks. To put them onto FAST services is honestly such a disservice to the product and experience.
The Big Show Show,Where is 'FAST'?
The Big Show Show,"Article suggests that the sopranos is a contender for this FAST thing

I‚Äôve tried not to be hyperbolic about shows I was never gonna watch being pulled, but having the sopranos leave hbo max would truly be wild. 

Guess I gotta bump up my watch of the leftovers before it‚Äôs to late lol"
The Big Show Show,I feel like I missed the announcement that FAST would be the acceptable acronym of choice.
The Big Show Show,I wish these streamers focused on killer mini series. Westworld season 1 to mid 2 could have been an incredible limited series. Stop writing cliffhangers and make satisfying conclusions at like episode 8.
The Big Show Show,"If they continue removing content, it'll be a giant bait and switch for people who signed up under the recent discount promotion they ran ending in October who are now stuck with the service for a year during this content removal period."
The Big Show Show,"I feel like FAST makes sense for the backlog of TV shows that were made with commercials in mind (sort of like how Paramount has those streaming channels dedicated to old Star Treks, old cop shows, and the like) but I hate the idea of suddenly adding commercials to shows made not for commercial TV but pay options like HBO, particularly if it also means taking them off the conmercial free option."
The Big Show Show,"I have a strong feeling this big bet on FAST is going to fail. The media seems excited about this. Variety has some analysis on FAST almost every day. 

I've seen this before (several times)."
The Big Show Show,"So, I checked last night, and this show is still on HBO Max. My wife and I watched s4e1. When is it actually leaving?"
The Big Show Show,"I forget which show it was, but I've seen some things which are on both a FAST service and on a subscription service.

Seems to me that's the way to go for older shows that maybe don't bring in subscribers on their own anymore.  Put them on FAST so people can start to watch it there, and if they like it and want to watch the rest without ads they can subscribe and do so.  Of course they probably won't get as much selling a non-exclusive deal.

We may see renewed interest in physical media such as blu ray.  People are going to want to buy their favorite shows if they can't be guaranteed it'll always be on streaming or that they may have to put up with ads.  Westworld does have a blu ray release, but many shows these days don't."
The Big Show Show,"Cutting everything that some clueless executive thinks is just overhead is bad strategy.

It would be like a restaurant deciding that they don't sell plates and cutlery, so they jump dump food onto your table without it.  And since waiters cost money, have your restaurant customers come get their food and slop it on the table themselves.  And since bathrooms aren't a profit center, close those and just have people relieve themselves... where ever.  

They can't see that the overall package and experience and reputation are what form the business proposition, not the individual piece-meal elements.  I've long supported and defended HBO with the feeling that I've helped contribute to building a library of content that I, as a loyal, high-price-paying patron, could access, or at the least, stay available for others.

Pulling that apart, diluting it and trying to monetize it bite by bite isn't what I signed up.  They're at risk of really damaging their loyal base.  It's like becoming an executive kills or precludes common sense."
The Big Show Show,"They're literally going to destroy HBO Max to create a FAST, this is weird, would they really make that much more from an ad supported service w/o subscriptions?"
The Big Show Show,Fascinating to see IndieWire of all sites go all in on the brilliance of denying viewers the option to avoid commercials (*and* having to hunt down the shows they like across countless different services).
The Big Show Show,too?
The Big Show Show,"Streaming is fucking dead isn't it? We already have so many different services between, Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, HBO Max, Discovery+, Apple TV and so many other more niche services like ESPN+ and others. 

It used to be if you paid for Netflix and Hulu you had 80-90% of the content you could want to watch. Now you have to pay for 5 services to get maybe 50-60% of the content you want to watch or have available. 

It's basically cable TV with more steps."
The Big Show Show,"I care less and less, I‚Äôm getting closer to canceling all of these services and just turning the TV off completely. 

The more annoying they make the process, the more appealing other forms of entertainment become."
The Big Show Show,I'd rather walk through glass to watch a full hbo series than watch it with ads. Going to cancel my HBO subscription soon and just pirate everything.
The Big Show Show,"WTF is a FAST?  


:Reads link  


""free, ad-supported streaming television""

&#x200B;

Fuck outta here ..."
The Big Show Show,I‚Äôm going back to library books soon at this point.
The Big Show Show,"If you can get them to subscribe for the big, currently popular shows, might as well get the ad money for other parts of the catalog.

Big show like Westworld is a surprise though and will irritate fans a lot more than some of these smaller shows they took off."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"As someone who absolutely loves the original movie, I have very mixed feelings about this after watching the trailer. The animation seems... not that good.  
  
And considering the original story was at its about freedom and sort of showed the ""taming"" of the wild west in a critical light, it seems a bit odd to me that this show seems to reduce the theme to ""city girl has to live in the country""."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Kill it with fire
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Here they go again ruining a classic with a sequel
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Yes but will it have Matt Damon?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,It's actually pretty good imo
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Nothing will be able to reduce my enjoyment of the original movie or its soundtrack. 
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Unfortunately it will not. Nor Bryan Adams afaik.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I've also watched it in the meantime! It's not too bad, but the animations are incredibly clunky."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Travelers is a good time travel show
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Love this show so much.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It‚Äôs entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"great show
always recommend it"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Loved this show. So we‚Äôll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,In this thumbnail that guy could‚Äôve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn‚Äôt add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Couldn‚Äôt the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Someone must have never seen futurama
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I think Dark has something to say about this
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Good summer binge show
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,[deleted]
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven‚Äôt watched a 2nd time yet."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Very nice
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt‚Äôs Creek‚Äôs roles is pretty amazing.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Dude spoiler!
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Upgrade!
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn‚Äôt know about
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Shame about *The Rig*.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I‚Äôm 4 episodes in now and I‚Äôm loving it.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
Spirit Riding Free: Riding Academy,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.

StarBeam,"Only silver lining for Americans here is the studio will be able to see how popular it is everywhere it's on Netflix, so they know the shit ratings on the CBS app are because of the app, not the show itself."

StarBeam,"sorry for my ignorance but is this a complete reboot or does one need to have knowledge of the old series to be caught up with it?

Thanks!"
StarBeam,"They used to have startrek.com, similar to South Park Studios, which had every episode of every series. Even the cartoon. What happened there? Netflix and CBS offer them too much money to turn down?

I used to think that model was the future. I wanted a StarGate.com that had everything SG on it."
StarBeam,"I can't say I'm surprised. This is pretty much what I expected when they announced it would be a streaming show only.  
And pretty much why I haven't really given it much thought."
StarBeam,"It begins production in 1-2 months and we still don't know when it's set, or in which Universe (original or New Movies), or a single actor/character in it?

I mean, I get that they don't have images yet but you'd think we would know a when and where by now."
StarBeam,"Is this new series in the new JJ Abrams strangeverse or original? I've wanted star trek again for ages, but I'm afraid of it being all phasers and sex, instead of intellectual, with some phasers on the side."
StarBeam,Bell Media??! Looks like us Canadians get the short stick once again. ( Õ°¬∞  ñÃØ Õ°¬∞) 
StarBeam,"Can't wait for all the ""THIS IS HOW YOU GET PEOPLE TO PIRATE YOUR SHOW"" from people who think $8/month for Netflix is all they should have to pay for unlimited entertainment and every single show they want."
StarBeam,"Could not possibly be more excited. Would be nice if it were on Netflix in the US, but I'm more than happy to give CBS $6/mo for a new Star Trek show. It's all I've wanted for the last 11 years."
StarBeam,I hope they first bring TOS and TNG here(Not the US).
StarBeam,You said Beam! 
StarBeam,Yay! Can't wait for Star Trek!!!
StarBeam,"Thank you. I will wait for it to show on Netflix.

One thing though, will it be add free? I think this could be the show that Netflix ""MAY"" introduce some sort of adds. Maybe it would be like the BBC in UK where they can only advertise their own shows."
StarBeam,"If this show is at all worth watching, eventually it'll be available on non-pirate, non CBS app services.  I'll just watch it then."
StarBeam,Star Trek Beyond would have been a perfect name for a new series.
StarBeam,"Man, even if it's not coming out in Canada right away, I can't wait. 

New Star Wars, new Star Trek. Next up has to be Stargate."
StarBeam,"I hate CBS so much... Of course, America is the one country that gets fucked from this. "
StarBeam,"There's a is problem with this scenario.
Boycott App because it's a price gouge (with ads) and there'd only be one series that I'd watch.

New Trek gets cancelled due to a lack of ratings because everyone avoided their App.

Feels like a real catch 22.  ""Sometimes you can do everything right and still lose."" - Picard."
StarBeam,ITT: People talk about stealing a show that depicts a morally ideal human future.
StarBeam,Seriously guys. I dont want to Pirate the New Star Trek. I will if i feel i have to.  Dont make it like this. CBS? dont be stupid. You have NOTHING else to offer that i dont already get. Just open the damned deal with Netflix and get on with it.
StarBeam,Wonder if the new show will follow the cannon of the movies? 
StarBeam,"Yeah CBS can get fucked if they think we're going to pay THEM for a show they're producing.  All content we like should be distributed via the same pipe that we already pay for or the content owners can get fucked.  Why should we have to pay for anything more than a Netflix account?  What are they going to do, cancel the show and decide not to make anymore because it wasn't profitable?  "
StarBeam,"So I have to torrent in the US then? I'm not using CBS's streaming service. CBS can fuck themselves if they think I'm going to have another service on top of Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and the others. "
StarBeam,"WE DEMAND A NETFLIX MONOPOLY!!!

Because the cable monopolies have worked out so well for consumers....smh."
StarBeam,"> Beam

I see what you did there."
StarBeam,If only there was a site were we could get it for free
StarBeam,Hope they do something similar with The Grand Tour!
StarBeam,Dang It Netflix - Would you please add the Simpsons!  nuff said - (mic drop)
StarBeam,Netflix saying it's going to have a show in 188 countries is like when the cable company says you get 5000 channels with their package - if it doesn't include the one you care about the rest don't matter.
StarBeam,Omg omg omg! Finally I can start on this series! 
StarBeam,Name one show that CBS has been successful with the last 10 years.  Way too much romantic drama on that network.
StarBeam,So No Star Trek and NO universal healthcare? :(
StarBeam,[deleted]
StarBeam,deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.2976  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/66715)
StarBeam,"Lol, I was wondering how this would work in the US, but obviously the US wouldn't get that privilege. We will be forced to watch it live with 18 minutes of commercials :/"
StarBeam,Or Canada...
StarBeam,So does my dad  as an avid fan he is super fucking pissed at this online bullshit.  But he knows Netflix so it would have worked out well. 
StarBeam,I don't:)
StarBeam,[deleted]
StarBeam,Netflix usually doesn't release it's shows stats not even to the show creators.
StarBeam,"Is that exclusing US and Canada, too?"
StarBeam,That's been the case forever.
StarBeam,How many hours in total is that? 
StarBeam,"Holy crap. This should've been it's own headline. I watched TOS when it was available, but TNG wasn't. Then TOS disappeared as well from Swedish Netflix. Now I can finally continue my Star Trek....trek."
StarBeam,"They're really putting us in an interesting situation. Either you live outside the US/Canada or you have to pay for their streaming service. Personally I have Netflix and PS Vue (online streaming cable t.v. service) and would still have to pay for a single networks streaming service to watch. 

Sadly, I'm not going to get to enjoy the new Star Trek in any normal way. That's ok though, there's no shortage of great stuff to watch on tv. I'm not supporting CBS in this way, it's shady AF and I won't start jumping through hoops to get access to a single show that I don't trust they won't screw up anyways. "
StarBeam,Isn't this getting closer to what people want? A la carte programming?
StarBeam,Just wait for it to finish and pay for one month.
StarBeam,"You could use an antenna?
Edit: Nevermind, just saw that they aren't even airing anything past the first episode on the regular network!  WHERE'S MY PITCHFORK?!"
StarBeam,So Netflix amazon and hulu can have your money but CBS can't. 
StarBeam,"No, you don't have to steal anything. You want to, either pay for it or don't watch it."
StarBeam,Kodi - works wonders
StarBeam,VPN to Mexico?
StarBeam,"Just pay for a Premium VPN service. I use ZenMate, pay like ‚Ç¨7 a month and it took them about 2 days for everything to be back up and running when netflix made their changes!"
StarBeam,"Yeah they're fucking crazy if they think we're going to support them making content we like, those assholes should be working for free and feel privileged that we watch their shite"
StarBeam,Or just buy an antenna and watch it when it airs
StarBeam,"Your Netflix account should work there too BTW, no need to change anything."
StarBeam,"That's actually not bad at all. I was worried Bell would pull some Bell shit with this show but airing on Space is ok.

Also apparently the entire Star Trek back catalog will be rolling out to Crave as well."
StarBeam,"Canadians will have relatively good access with the choice of a cable channel or a streaming service that is cheaper than CBS All Access. I would prefer it on Netflix, as I know others will, but many others will prefer it on Space. 

I just wonder if they are making basic 48 minute episodes designed for ad-supported television.  If the episodes are longer than 48 minutes, I hope Space doesn't cut them shorter. Also, I have heard that the show will be darker given its streaming home. I think Space has been pretty light with cutting language, sexual situations and violence, but I am not sure."
StarBeam,Fuck Bell. I would have paid CBS to watch the show but I refuse to give Bell any money. To the high seas!
StarBeam,I HAAAAAAATE bell. 
StarBeam,"Considering the show is being shot in Canada, it's good that we have some okay options to watch it."
StarBeam,"Ok, so we can see it in Canada, just with commercials."
StarBeam,[deleted]
StarBeam,Proxying it is then. 
StarBeam,"Every country worldwide except for USA, Canada, (available elsewhere) Syria, North Korea (sanctions) and Mainland China (government block)."
StarBeam,"""Set speed to warp factor 8, Chewy."" ""I'm giving it all she's got, Han Solo!""

""I have been - and always shall be - your friend."" ""I know."""
StarBeam,"""Beam me up, Chewie!"""
StarBeam,"Shouldn't matter if it's a reboot or not (seems unlikely anyway). Just check it out. There are people who started on Voyager, People who started on DS9, freaking *tons* of us that grew up on TNG without having seen the originals (at the time). Try it out, if you like it go back and look at the other stuff."
StarBeam,"Historically Star Trek has been pretty good about not needing to have seen previous series. They will probably put a ton of Easter eggs that reference the other star treks; like what Marvel movies do with the comic books. But, you don't need to understand every reference to enjoy it."
StarBeam,"We don't know anything about it yet other than some directors/producers. 

We may find out more during Comic Con. "
StarBeam,"It probably is a money thing. 

If you have a site for each franchise then you will only get the dedicated fans to go there. Big sites like Netflix or Amazon attract many more people that might just try out those shows because they already have an account. "
StarBeam,"> What happened there?

We all block ads, and bandwidth costs money. Not really surprising that those kind of sites shut down."
StarBeam,"They haven't said anything because there is a giant comic con panel this Saturday. I'm 99% sure all of that will be answered there. I mean, if not there in front of thousands of fans, where else? Also, I think they've said it isn't the JJverse, it is the Original Universe."
StarBeam,I'm pretty sure it fits along with the TV canon not the JJ verse. 
StarBeam,"That has not been officially announced yet.

The only thing they've said is that the series is ""not related"" to Star Trek Beyond, which may be interpreted in different ways."
StarBeam,"The new official term for the JJ verse is the ""Kelvin Timeline"" as the pivotal event that changed things was the destruction of the Kelivn by Nero. "
StarBeam,"I heard it was still Prime Universe, but given the stupid shit they're pulling with the films I wouldn't be surprised if they reneg on that."
StarBeam,"Wouldn't it be interesting if it was set in the original universe after Nero and Spock leave through the black hole?

You could follow up on that storyline if you want to have cameos from classic cast members. What do Uhura or Sulu think of Spock's sudden disappearance?"
StarBeam,Hopefully they learned from the horrible mistake of Enterprise.
StarBeam,"Movies have always been all phasers and sex instead of intellectual. I don't understand why people are judging the new movies against the old series instead of against the movies. Seriously go watch the old movies, it is the same thing and the new ones are overwhelmingly better. Now if the new series is the same style, then sure lets break out the pitchforks and torches."
StarBeam,">Bell Media??! Looks like us Canadians get to torrent another show. ( Õ°¬∞  ñÃØ Õ°¬∞)

FTFY"
StarBeam,"I got to ask, how are we getting the short end of the stick ? I wont have to pay anything to see the new Star Trek. I already have CTV in the default channels, and Space is one of my a la carte channels.

Voayger was on CTV, Enterprise was on Space. Both channel now owned by Bell. Never had a issue then, why would I now ?

EDIT* I forgot to add one thing, by watching on Space, I will be officially supporting the show."
StarBeam,"I mean I get that expecting to be able to get all entertainment you could possibly want for 8 dollars a month is ridiculous. But the issue is that its 100% obvious (and especially more so now, in the US at least) that they are using this show to push yet another streaming service that many of us don't want.

I have no problem paying for multiple streaming services. But compared to other services on offer, 6 dollars a month is a shitty value proposition for me for just for a single show (since there isnt anything else worth it to me to actually get cbs all access)."
StarBeam,I thought they raised the priced to $10.
StarBeam,"In 2016, yes. Entertainment should be cheap and convenient. It's called Entertainment for a reason. 

What's the convenience in having to install yet another app and use yet another player with yet another UI? 

If they wanted me to pay extra to have an add-on to my existing app that's one thing. I'd gladly pay Netflix more money for new content like Star Trek via CBS. Like how Amazon Prime has Starz content. I wish I could have HBO Go as an add-on to Netflix because I absolutely despise their UI and player. "
StarBeam,"I am willing to (and already do) pay for multiple services, but $6 a month is an awful lot for a service *with* commercials and very little exclusive content."
StarBeam,[deleted]
StarBeam,Perhaps it's Netflix and Hulu's fault for getting us all accustomed to it to begin with.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,[deleted]
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Can we pls have a Canadian show that isn‚Äôt embarrassingly insecure about its Canadian-ness? Can‚Äôt it just be a show without having to over represent Canada? Just let it have its own identity!
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"Idk, the only episode I‚Äôve seen had them doing Chinese style baking which is actually an important part of many Canadian‚Äôs heritage.  I thought the hosts were at least as good as the UK version."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"I love this show, and it's not the typical show I would watch but it's nice break from all the rest. So they aren't making anything specifically Canadian?...Are we supposed to get season after season of butter tarts and nanaimo bars?  What I saw was a melting pot of people having their own take on each challenge and incorporating it in their own experiences in Canada. Can't really think of anything much more Canadian than that."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"> Since \[_The Great British Bake Off_\] first aired in 2010, it has not only become one of the UK‚Äôs most watched series‚Äîattracting, at its height, 14 million viewers‚Äîbut also inspired a kind of mania among its many fans. The events of each episode are regularly dissected in the British press; one incident involving a baked Alaska that was left out on the counter became a national scandal. There‚Äôs even a _Great British Bake Off_ musical. While this level of passion for a reality TV show about baking may seem absurd‚Äîand it is‚Äîmany Britons feel that the show‚Äôs humour, gentleness, and the competitors‚Äô strength in the face of culinary adversity reflect the best parts of the national character. But, despite the inherent Britishness of it all, the show has been a global success, and its format has been exported far and wide. Kenya has _The Great Kenyan Bake Off_, France has _Le Meilleur Patissier_‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâand we have _The Great Canadian Baking Show_, which returned to the CBC this fall for a sixth season, slapping flabbily onto the screen like a pile of wet dough.
> 
> _The Great Canadian Baking Show_ is one of the broadcaster‚Äôs most beloved offerings; its 2016 debut garnered more than a million viewers each week, and the following seasons were among the most streamed shows on CBC Gem. However, while it may have followed the original recipe, there was some point in the process where things went wrong. Like replacing butter with margarine or sugar with stevia: the taste is familiar but the result feels artificial and unsatisfying. As a baking show, it succeeds, delivering a certain amount of comfort and smoothing the rumpled surface of our furrowed brains as a spatula spreads icing. But by affixing the adjectives ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and ‚ÄúCanadian‚Äù to it, it protests too much‚Äîand in its attempts to ‚ÄúCanadianize‚Äù the formula with butter tarts and excessive kindness, it inadvertently exemplifies some of the worst tendencies in Canadian television and our national character."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"come on guys, Canadian baking is just ham"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"I hate the fact that every Canadian show has to cast the most plain, vanilla, personality free fucker you've ever seen, adding to the stereotype that Canada doesn't need at this point."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Had no idea this even existed. Can they get Bob and Doug McKenzie to host next season?
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Sure that's how it starts....
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"While I have not watched this season's yet-I'll disagree with the writer on some points. I am not a fan of Paul-so the writer acting as though he is to be aspired to....not.  I personally love Australian & Canadian versions a helluva lot more than the British one. Not to say I dislike the British one-just prefer those two more. And nothing can be worse than the South African or American version. The SA because those judges are the worse. The American because as per usual it is more about the drama above all else. And the hosts, I didn't have issue with the two from Baroness Von Sketch. They were not as good as Levy/Chan-but not bad at all."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I don't feel like the British one has anything meaningful to say about the country/nation/sovereign whatever the fuck Britain is actually supposed to count as either. It's just people politely baking and sometimes cutting their hands open in an extremely gruesome manner that earned the show a TV-14 rating on Netflix. Doesn't need to be some big statement no matter what show it is. It's people making petit fours and breadsticks.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,It's really a pleasant watch I don't know how someone could be against it?
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I think it‚Äôs required by law up there
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Schitt's Creek and Trailer Park Boys are good.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,[deleted]
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"I remember hearing Rick Moranis tell a story about SCTV having room for an extra sketch in Canada because of US TV having more commercials than the CBC. And the CBC said it should reflect Canada. Moranis said the show has Canadians writing and acting and is filmed in Canada, what do you want us to sit around saying eh and wearing touques? They said that sounds great and so they made Bob and Doug Mackenzie. 

They were intended for Canada only, but once they started making their way to the US airings NBC demanded more lol."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,The crtc regulates and supervises broadcasting and telecommunications in the public interest. Which is why Canadian television is lacking nowadays and they don‚Äôt even try promoting Canadian movies
The Great Canadian Baking Show,We need Red Green back.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Haaaaaaa I did not know that
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"CRTC mandates the amount of content based on cast, crew, and producers. It doesn't mandate cooking shows needing to be about butter tarts and maple syrup."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"So they're filming the american show in the UK tent?

I wonder if the ovens have Fahrenheit markings or if they'll have to do their own conversions."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,This apple crumble is coveted as fuck.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"Zach Cherry: alright contestants, for our next meal we will be having a waffle party"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"From ‚ÄúYeah, Spider-man!‚Äù to killing it on Severance to a steady reality paycheck. Good for Zach Cherry."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I don't think this is needed but those are the perfect people to host if we're doing it anyway
The Great Canadian Baking Show,They better not add a bunch of fake drama to this.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"Oh hey, Zach Cherry! Please enjoy all baking shows equally."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"Great choices for hosts, but the show is being buried on the Roku Channel?"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"As long as it's not too Americanized which means everyone is constantly telling everyone, ""I'm taking you down,"" like it's a wrestling match. What makes British Bake-off so enjoyable is that all the contestants act like decent human beings and not like it's a life and death zero-sum game."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"If you've already watched all of Bake Off then may I suggest watching Canadian Bake Off too, it really captures the original tone and style well.  

Many full-length episodes of Canadian Bake Off are on YouTube."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Ellie Kemper: I'm going to make this cake SO DRY.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"I went to high school with Cherry, it‚Äôs lovely to see him be funny and successful.. he has always been!"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,">Production is currently underway in the United Kingdom on the six, 60-minute episode series.

American contestants have to go to the UK to film? Hopefully this iteration does well enough that future seasons can be filmed here"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Didn‚Äôt they try this already?
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Trixie Mattel and her Easy Bake Oven have been preparing for this day their whole lives.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I know Cherry from his life before he went into acting and he's the nicest person on earth. A great storyteller and phenomenal listener.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"The Roku channel, really?"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Great casting. They are both beacons of positivity
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"Skeptical of if this will work. American producers find it hard to make reality TV without amping up the drama and adding a cash prize. Nothing is ever just for the love of it, and Bake Off is all about the love"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Hopefully they keep it a fun and wholesome competition like the British version and don't Americanize it by creating fake drama between the contestants or give everyone a sob story about how they need to win the money to pay their medical bills.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"""The judges would like you to make bread. BUT, it must be at least 75% corn syrup"""
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Will the tent have air conditioning this time? It's freaking stupid that they have to bake in a non-temperature controlled environment!
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"If it's American are they gonna make it mean?  What I love about the Great British Baking Show is the fact they are never mean, not the judges or the competitors."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I hope they keep the wholesome feel the UK version has. It doesn't need the drama.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"*sigh*

My money is on the US version being over-produced garbage where more time is spent on totally-not-scripted drama than on baking skill and civil competition, but I hope I'm wrong."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Think of all the prizes there will be for Zach Cherry‚Äôs innie to never know about.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Ellie Kemper seems different to me knowing how insanely wealthy her parents are. She seems nice but she comes from a whole different world than most people.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"They are going to fuck this up and never focus on the damn food‚Ä¶

The Great Canadian Baking Show,"If I eat downvotes for this, I eat them, but... I think I will like these hosts better than Noel+Matt, who I think have gotten progressively more grating.

The Great Canadian Baking Show,My wife and I always comment on how nice and supportive the competitors are to one another on The Great British Baking show compared to American cooking shows. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if that continues with this version or if we Americans just can‚Äôt be nice to one another.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I‚Äôll pass. They‚Äôll overdramatize it like they do with Masterchef and any other UK show. Plus no Noel = no thank you.

The Great Canadian Baking Show,"I hate when the hosts act like barkers at a circus. Too loud, too obnoxious."
The Great Canadian Baking Show,America can‚Äôt watch another country have a successful show without taking the idea and ruining it with our stupidness.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,If there isnt a large woman from Nesbraska named 'Large Marge' Then whats the point of watching.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,But why
The Great Canadian Baking Show,Why do the US have to bastardize brilliant UK shows.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,This isn't the Great Baking Show. This is the 'jump through hoops with barely enough time and if you hold it together you survive another round' show.
The Great Canadian Baking Show,I WANT TO SEE NY FUCKING KID GET BORN
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"Noooooooooo

Who asked for this ??"
The Great Canadian Baking Show,"I'm sure they're great but wtf happened to Noel and the bold guy?! I love them.

Edit: wait that's ""hey Spider-Man do a flip"" guy? Nvm I'm down this is great

Edit edit: oh this is American spin off. Nvm"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Man, I never seen a trailer for a comedy show work in this format.   
You need to focus on one short scene, and get it funny for the trailer. This deluge of clips just doesn't work.  
  
Maybe the show is funny, maybe it isn't, this trailer tells us nothing."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Just watched the first episode. Possibly the worst thing I have ever seen. It honestly doesn't make sense, none of the jokes land.

""Hey what if chicks did jackass but it was just them being mean to each other"" and then that's exactly what they film. Nothing else. Just that.

Theme song is solid. She's cute. Show blows.

Give me some more of I think you should leave now."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Sun!
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"She's pretty hilarious, and I'm a big fan of sketch conedy. Didn't even know she had this coming out. I'm stoked."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,I don't mind her comedy but her act is 'female Dane Cook' and that played out 10-15 years ago. She is hot though.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I'm not familiar with her work but I'll check it out because I just love sketch comedy.  Also, take a look at the comments here to see the type of shit women comics have to put up with.  oof"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Oh, I‚Äôm definitely watching this. I liked two specials I‚Äôve seen of her, and she was great in Spencer Confidential."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"What is the song towards the end of the trailer?

EDIT: the Theme song is [Smallpools - Play Pretend](https://youtu.be/NAXRL8DoGkM)"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Looks good

Comment section's off to a real start

> **I don‚Äôt have a problem with female comedians,** ^but ^talking ^about ^the ^same ^topics ^that ^have ^been ^discussed ^to ^death ^like ^‚Äúwomen ^aren‚Äôt ^funny‚Äù ^isn‚Äôt ^helping ^them. ^Sure ^there‚Äôs ^male ^comedians ^that ^talk ^about ^the ^same ^shit ^all ^the ^time, ^and ^I‚Äôm ^not ^into ^them ^either. ^The ^way ^to ^get ^rid ^of ^that ^stigma ^is ^to ^just ^be ^funny ^and ^stop ^bringing ^it ^up."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Is there a comedian hiding behind the hot chick? Or is that the joke?
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Dude I wanted to like this. Idk how you can make something this bad. Like this shit had to been rushed.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Not sure I'm interested. They open with ""girls aren't funny"" and then dedicate the remainder of the trailer to proving that thesis."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I don‚Äôt have a problem with female comedians, but talking about the same topics that have been discussed to death like ‚Äúwomen aren‚Äôt funny‚Äù isn‚Äôt helping them. Sure there‚Äôs male comedians that talk about the same shit all the time, and I‚Äôm not into them either. The way to get rid of that stigma is to just be funny and stop bringing it up."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Ehhh.....I'll give it a shot.

She's not that funny, but she's hot and I'm sure I'll be bored as fuck by April 1"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"to reiterate what everyone else is saying, she hot."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Good! I already like Iliza, and I get pissed off at movie trailers being full of spoilers. This gives us a look at the high production values. Netflix spends $20m on mediocre stand up specials that are visually uninteresting. For the same price they can get an impressive looking sketch show."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I watched all of the episodes, I agree that most of the jokes did not land, I do not think the sketches are terrible, those sketches are meh.

The funniest sketch for me was the board game one, that was hilarious. The Theme song is great, I like Smallpools."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"This is spot on. Jokes need a set-up and a punchline, and typically the punchline takes an unexpected left turn, which is what makes it funny. I was waiting for the Female Jackass skits to take that turn, and then they just ended. That's it. No punchline."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I, too, find her act to be very much ""Female Dane Cook"". That said, I honestly don't know why, but I find her hysterical, and him intensely annoying."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,She is definitely hot.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"her Boston accent in that movie was so, so terrible!"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3R_6Lb76rI

Or some kind of mix of that"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Yea, it looks very much like a ‚Äúgirl comedy‚Äù"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"In Spenser Confidential when she had the boston accent, oof."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,This is awesome!!! She is one of my favorite comics. I love her over the top comedy and voices she does. Can‚Äôt wait!!!
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,This will be really good......
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,[deleted]
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Fun fact, Gabriel Ingelsias and her were on the same season of Last Comic Standing.

She won because Gabriel was caught with a phone when he wasn't supposed to have one during the pre-recorded elimination rounds. She was even in the room when a producer caught him."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Idk I've watched several of her specials and really dont think shes that funny, she really tries hard to make up for her lame jokes with body language and goofy faces."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I remember her on last comic standing and I've seen her Joe rogan appearance and to quote gsp, I was not impressed with her performance


But maybe it'll be good idk"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Is this the one that bleats like a goat when she needs filler material in her routine?
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Is she smart and nice and funny?
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Newcomedy
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,She is the Dane Cook of female standups.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Could be interesting, I wonder if this is what Michelle Wolf wanted to do instead of the commentary show."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"""More of a personality than a comic""

Wrong subject matter. My bad."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Nikki > Iliza
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Sorry to say, but this sounds like it'll be DOA."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Careful guys. 

If you ask her for a light then she considers that sexual assault."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,She wouldn't be so funny if she weren't hot.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Why does netflix insist on digging its own hole.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I've watched three of her specials.  I thought *Freezing Hot* and *Confirmed Kills* were excellent.  But *Elder Millenial* was significantly worse (or at the very least, it felt stale)."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I agree with you, cant wait!!"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,People pitch and Netflix orders.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,A production company (either in-house or independent) probably made a pilot and a pitch and shopped it around to other production companies/distributors. In this case Netflix decides it's worth investing in and they work out a deal for $$ and how many episodes. Then the original production company goes off and makes it.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"> she really tries hard to make up for her lame jokes with body language and goofy faces

Isn't that what all ""physical"" comedians do? They make jokes that work with their body language."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I think she‚Äôs... fine. She‚Äôs definitely doesn‚Äôt have the worst stand up I‚Äôve ever heard but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs hysterical either. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever watch any of her specials again, but I don‚Äôt regret watching them either."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Comedy is subjective so it makes sense, not everyone has the same type of humor. But that can also make or break a show. It needs to be general."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,>tries hard to make up for her lame jokes with body and face
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,She seems smart
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,And cool and being nice?
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"She was an executive producer on her show, if she didn't want to do something, who was going to make her? Her split personality?"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Am I missing something? I don't see that as a quote in the article and can't find what you're referencing.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Burr was more likely referring to Chelsea Handler who was at the same benefit show as him during that timeframe and isn‚Äôt really respected as a comic.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Why does it have to be a competition? This is why we can't have things.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,What do you mean?
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Why is this getting downvoted? She‚Äôs awful.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"> She wouldn't be so funny if she weren't hot.

She wasn't hot when she started, it's really only been fairly recent that she lost weight."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Jim Carey, Robin Williams, Eddy Murphy...weird I only ever read this criticism for female comedians."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"While I agree, it's always strange when nearly everyone agrees on a talent of a particular comic (see Dave Chappelle). Makes you wonder if there isn't an upper echelon in art where subjective becomes a bit less flexible."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,?
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,speak on that
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Network executives
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Bill Burr said it in his standup about an unnamed female comedian who sexually assaulted him at a specific event that this person was at, but it was most likely actually Chelsea Handler."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,That makes more sense.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Having competitions > Not having competitions
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Ok not sexual assault but something 

https://youtu.be/uQUUm_kicS0"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,She was on a reality show about a decade ago and she was a smokeshow.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I can't think of a single female comic that reddit likes. Sure, theres some actresses that get props for doing comedies, but being a woman doing stand up is something else."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Dane cook, sabastian manascalco, men, hated for being physical."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,I guess you never heard people criticize Dane Cook.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Dane Cook.

Check and mate."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I don't like Jim carey nor robin williams as stand-up comics, but they are indeed funny.  

&#x200B;

Eddie Murphy, though, was a beast back in the day. Watch Delirious on youtube."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Dave Chappelle was a comic all throughout the 1990's, was in several movies, had several specials, and most people on reddit obviously only know him because of his show in 2003-2006.

So really he was definitely not in the upper echelon of the art of stand up comedy where he rose above comedy being subjective and appealed to everyone as an obviously talented comic.  He actually worked very hard through a long career of ups and downs before landing a ""big break"" (his 4th actually) that finally saw him be a breakout star and household name.

It was a time when Comedy Central was at the height of their popularity, with a lead from the daily show at its very peak during the Iraq war with Jon Stewart also becoming a household name and iconic figure of the time period.

It wasn't because Chappelle simply ""had it"".   He is, in my opinion a great comedian, but he was pretty much the same comedian his whole career.  ""Universal"" popularity is not always indication of some kind of transcendent art, a lot of it is opportunity like everything else in life.  Some people aren't truly appreciated until after they die, most great artists are probably lost to history entirely."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Goes to show the hypocrisy of the media that Burr being sexually assaulted by a peer has gotten zero coverage.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,they will probably tell you Roseanne lol
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I legitimately have liked Amy Schumer at times, but she's had some bad looks, The Leather Special is one of them.

Her show on Comedy Central was good, and her newest special was a return to form.

I know this is r/suicidebywords on reddit, but there it is."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Nikki Glaser is pretty good
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,That ventriliquist chick is good.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Dane Cook wasn't originally hated for being a loud comedian by the masses, he was hated for stealing jokes. In fact, the vast majority of the reason for his rise to ultra-fame (for the time) was because he a loud comedian similar to Jim Carrey which people enjoyed (at the time.) After the joke stealing stuff surfaced he was tore apart for everything."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,I think Chappelle was literally in 8 TV pilots before Chappelle's Show. Dude would've been a sitcom actor but none of them went anywhere. Year after year he booked pilots but had no luck.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Your statement could be made of any great artist, and how context/culture plays a role in their success. This should be implied. I never said or implied that Chappelle was great from the beginning, so while I appreciate your argument, it has nothing to do with my post. Cheers!"
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,I don't care for pretty much any standup but her sketch show was good https://youtu.be/lDk5wDBR3hA
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Amy Schumer is funnier than Iliza Shlesinger
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,I haven't watched any of her own work but she is really fun to watch on Conan and she was also on an episode of hiking with Kevin.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Nina Conti is less funny when you realise she has real issues with her parents and actual attachment issues with her dolls.
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"https://youtu.be/GMV4kwbSdw4

Come on, man. He was literally parodied on mad TV for jokes that aren't actually jokes with flexes and stares."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Whoever wrote that did a good job of simultaneously capturing Sorkin's ""voice"" and making fun of it.

I'm telling you, if you think Amy's never done anything good, ever, you just hate her and have no ability to be impartial in your judgements."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Can't wait for the Jim Jefferies special. Bare is hilarious 
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Can't wait for Bo's new special!
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"I saw ""Make Happy"" live and it was great, can't wait to watch it again when it comes out."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,damn too bad they didn't order any Bill Burr

 I think that Zach Stone is going to be famous."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Bo Burnham's last special was fantastic. Shlesinger's last special...wasn't. 
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"Netflix specials are the new HBO. I saw/read/heard/who cares Bill Burr saying when he got a Netflix special his ticket sales went through the roof, especially internationally."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,Joey Diaz needs to do a Netflix special. 
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"We need more Bill Burr, period. So much more. The man's anger puts a bitter smile on my face."
The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show,"More Demetri Martin, please!"
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn‚Äôt on your list, but I guess it‚Äôs not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler‚Äôs List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it‚Äôs clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it‚Äôs great
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It‚Äôs bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúJohn B‚Äù and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."

I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Having watched the entire interview, I don‚Äôt *outright* disagree with Stewart‚Äôs position here, but I can‚Äôt help but find it‚Ä¶ unrealistically optimistic.

My issue with his stance can be entirely summed up by that old adage that goes along the line of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt logic a person out of a position they did not logic themselves into in the first place‚Äù.

I very much agree that the series of punishments will do little to nothing to change Kyrie Irving‚Äôs mind. Even if he goes through with them, it will be pure lip service. In all likelihood, he will emerge from this fiasco even more deeply entrenched in his ideology than he was before.

Stewart talks about addressing Kyrie‚Äôs, or Kanye‚Äôs, or whoever‚Äôs misconceptions calmly and factually, with patience and understanding- but the amount of bigots who are receptive to those kinds of good-faith talks in the first place is exceedingly low. They exist, clearly, and the level of dedication from those like the black guy who befriends KKK members and deprograms them is astonishing- but there‚Äôs a reason those cases are overwhelmingly the exception, not the rule."

This isn‚Äôt about Chapelle as I think most people should understand that a comedian can say what they wish in the context of humor.

That said it doesn‚Äôt mean that SNL or their staff need to be ok with a particular comic‚Äôs humor. Them not wanting anything to do with it is not censorship.

In short, Kanye can lose a major contract for his words and action and people can complain about Chapelle to the point where he‚Äôs not host of SNL."

That‚Äôs just not the case here with Kanye and Kyrie. They have doubled down when people or groups have tried to open a dialogue. And losing millions of dollars is not a punishment for sharing an opinion, it‚Äôs a business decision. If I was to say what they said at my job, I‚Äôd be fired. And I think rightfully so, to not only protect a business partners reputation and bottom line, but also put someone in a space for self-reflection."

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"JS didn't really say anything new here. It's the same old debate. It's one thing that has disappointed me about JS the last few years (aside from the really effective policy-wrangling he has done) - his schtick seems weirdly dated, like he hasn't paid a lot of attention the last 8-10 years.

The situation is this. Free speech is great. Trolls suck. Trolls have always been around. When trolls - by which I mean either people that say horrible stuff honestly or dishonestly - say trollish things, then ""the way to combat disagreeable speech is more speech"". Sure, fine. That's been the way for hundreds or thousands of years, among democratically enlightened folks.

But now there's asymmetric speech, which is biased toward controversy. Controversy gets algorithmically boosted and rewarded. Now when you try to combat troll-speech with enlightened-speech, well, the troll speech has an extra built-in advantage, that it didn't have to this degree before. You can't combat troll-speech with enlightened-speech if one side has a megaphone and the other just gets squelched.

I'm not saying that this phenomena didn't exist before. Those kinds of factors always existed before. But I am saying that it's gone past a critical mass point in recent years. It's reached a sufficient level that ""combat speech with speech"" is often like bringing a knife to a gun fight."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,Obviously Kanye has been pretty explicit but I don't see how Chappelle's SNL monolgue would be considered antisemitism.
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Jon Stewart is a legend and always will be. His ability to humanize and digest down very complicated, political-gamesmanship during the Obama years to a broader audience did more than he will ever know to get young Millennials and older Gen-Z politically involved and knowledgeable outside of whatever your parents would tell you, pre-social media.

However, Stewart very much comes from an old guard of political commentators. He got out right before Trump, and has been politically involved still on specific issues he knows about. However, he has very little involvement in the social media sphere, and basically none to the degree that these stories (Kanye/Kyrie) have risen to.

If you've been on the Internet for awhile, hearing Kanye and Kyrie rambling and the specific messages they are echoing are nothing new. 4Chan and deeper realms have shared these messages, memes, and charts (Kanye's excel spreadsheet of Jewish people, for instance) to further such anti-Semitic tropes. Kyrie is just literally echoing Hebrew Black Israelite messaging.

Stewart believes we are somehow able to peacefully talk people out of their positions of bigotry, like we may have been able to 10 or 20 years ago. In the current era, because of the  recognition of the ""threat"" of ""cancel culture"", which for most has literally no effect on their bottom line, people double down on, rather than back away from, their controversial stances once challenged. Once people, particularly vocal celebrities with a massive platform, start getting criticized for it, whether those criticisms are valid in scope or not, this defensive shield pops up and makes them internalize those criticisms to a personal level. Many of those people's fans will also come to their defense, because they love how they rap/make beats/play basketball/what have you. This entrenches those stereotypes even amongst people who may have not believed them fully just because they feel like they need to defend their idol, which means you have proliferation of the message that is distorted, discriminatory, and dangerous.

At a certain point, when does it warrant or justify someone receiving consequences for their words and actions? Does Kyrie or Kanye need to literally attack a synagogue or punch a hasidic Jew on live television to be condemned for being anti-Semitic? Stewart is essentially making a distinction without a difference: that a certain amount of anti-Semitism from some people is acceptable, and that such a course of rhetoric can be reversed by a simple private conversation. What happens when that doesn't work?

Kyrie and Kanye have both been explained to by many people both publicly and privately why their messages/statements/Tweets were harmful. Both by Black people and by Jewish people, as well as others with knowledge of why those things they say/share are hurtful. To which, both have doubled down and essentially blamed someone or something else for trying to silence them. It's clear that once they are given a chance to recant and apologize, they personalize it and make it a broad generalization about the entire class of people as an enemy to fight against.

We don't need to engage in oppression Olympics, we don't need to reference old, tired stereotypes to have these discussion. What we all know and recognize that when a person's concern is over their economic or social treatment, bad faith actors can manipulate people/celebs that are emotionally suggestible (Kanye) or intellectually stunted and thus suggestible (Kyrie) to validate their misguided beliefs, push away people that don't, and reverse any legitimate criticism into just another attack of themselves as an individual, when in reality all most people ARE trying to do is educate them so they can stop using hurtful stereotypes and connotations to their otherwise legitimate business concerns as if they somehow originate from the people being Jewish and that as a result they have a vendetta of some sort against Black celebrities. 

Dave Chappelle referencing this by saying ""can't say nothing about Jewish people"" is a doubling down on ""Jews always overreact every time they are mentioned"" which is mostly because the last time an entire country engaged in prolific antisemitism that wasn't challenged and became broadly culturally acceptable, that country committed the Holocaust, which the movie that Kyrie shared said was a ""myth"" that ""never happened"" and is a lie that the ""fake"" white Jews use to solidify ""their power"". So, in context, a pretty justified reason to go what some may consider ""overboard"" in protecting their heritage and religion so that we don't fall further down the autocratic anti-semitic fascist ladder by allowing definitionally hate speech to be promulgated by our most famous and revered athletes/celebrities.

Not that they should be role models in everything they do, but that when given the chance to speak out on a platform, if they wish to do so about struggles that they as Black men see and face and wish to speak out on, that should be encouraged. It just does not in any way justify putting another group down."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"It‚Äôs better than inaction or indifference though. Actions, including free speech, have consequences regardless, especially when money is involved. It isn‚Äôt even censorship. 

Censorship is banning movies in China because of whatever reasons the authority come up with. Cutting ties with a person who spreads hate speech isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs called consequence."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Censorship is not the answer. But no one is entitled to a platform, so we need to stop pretending that de-platforming someone is the same thing as censorship.

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Nobody's censoring Kanye or Chappelle, they're as free to speak their minds today as they were yesterday.  I'm not obligated to keep paying attention to them, just as I have no expectation they would ever hear what I have to say about these topics."

They will rather stick to their circle of misinformation and keep pushing false narratives. Some (like Trump himself) are willful liars & truth deniers. Their minds are not winnable with rational material. Cancelling such folks is the only way their minds get to see the truth or consequences."

Let us also not pretend that giving someone a platform to say whatever they want to say would make a difference of any kind regarding their opinions. 

If we ask about chances, well every moment they take to introspect is a chance to change their own minds. Which can happen pretty much anywhere at anytime they bother to try it. 

Short to say, it is their responsibility to do something about it not ours. If the owners don't want to hear what they have to say on their platform. They do not have to let them use it. They are still free to shout it at people passing by on a street."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"People act like being deplatformed on major social media isn't the same as censorship because they are ""privately"" owned. I would agree if we got rid of the monopoly they have on public discourse. That's part of the problem."

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"They can say whatever they want.

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"I don‚Äôt see how Jon Stewart can equate anonymous online trolls with someone as public and listened to as Kanye West, Kyrie Irving, or Dave Chappelle.

Yes, casual antisemitism is VERY prevalent online, and it‚Äôs disturbing, but the reason it resides purely online and anonymous is because it‚Äôs understood to be a public taboo to express these sentiments. Once someone as big and (despite their claims) powerful as these public figures are seen breaking these unspoken but understood rules, it‚Äôs going to be hard putting the genie back in the bottle.

A lot of these online trolls themselves have already been slowly conditioned to see these kinds of sentiments as more funny than hurtful by niche sources. These celebrities are goi g to reach far wider than smaller trolls."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"Pretty bad take by Jon Stewart here. He offers no alternative but trying to change their mind, which if you've followed Kyrie or Kanye at all you know isn't happening.

Sometimes the best thing you can do is just take their platform away. There's no amount of reasonable discussion you can have that's going to change their minds. At this point all you're doing is legitimizing conspiracy theories by treating them as if they're a reasonable position to hold and allowing them to spread by giving them a platform to reach millions.

Paradox of tolerance is relevant here. You can't tolerate intolerant beliefs. Especially those that aren't willing to engage in good faith discussion."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,That‚Äôs not true. Making something socially unacceptable literally changes the way people think. For example nowadays it would be unthinkable to refuse someone service at a restaurant because of their race. It‚Äôs unthinkable because it was made unacceptable
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"It's a very difficult subject to address.  How do we handle hate speech, racist oriented conspiracy theory and things like them?  As we enter an age of political correctness which is a double edged sword that can be wielded to benefit us and also wound us equally when used improperly.  Jon makes a lot of good points in this video.  Chappelle didn't really say anything offensive just dancing around the line with a real and unfiltered opinion swathed in humor."

This vitriolic propaganda isn‚Äôt like someone having a different opinion about a movie ending, we‚Äôre talking inciting hatred with phobic superstition and weaponized imagery.

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"He's correct in a way, \*but\* that presumes that most of the anti-Semites and racists are open to constructive dialogue to the point that they would ever change their views, and that's never really been the case. It's a feel-good position and an appeal to a better nature that doesn't really exist. Hence why they just face more punitive consequences."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"No, not everything is anti-Semitic, but those ideas not only persist to this day, they've regained traction and inspired more youths to join fascist political movements."

How to Fix a Drug Scandal,"i guess I would ask Jon this if I could:  What does one do if you can't change their mind and they continue to propagate those thoughts to other people. I'm seeing a awful lot of ""kanye was right"" comments across twitter and other social media many said in complete seriousness."
How to Fix a Drug Scandal,It may not end antisemitism but it sure as hell helps stop the blatant spread of it.

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well.

But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"

Grand Prince,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Grand Prince,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Grand Prince,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Grand Prince,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Grand Prince,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Grand Prince,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Grand Prince,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Grand Prince,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Grand Prince,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Grand Prince,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Grand Prince,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Grand Prince,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Grand Prince,I am pretty sure that Death Note does not have 11 seasons
Grand Prince,We're back to having tv channels
Grand Prince,"Have all these departures been officially announced?  

 I am glad Halt and Catch Fire and Rectify are not on this list."
Grand Prince,">Paramount+

wtf is this? first time i hear about it"
Grand Prince,This is why used to use VPN for Netflix before then blocked them all. You guys have so many tv shows we don‚Äôt here in Scandinavia.
Grand Prince,That‚Äôs good to know; just decided to re-watch Nurse Jackie a few days ago only to realize it won‚Äôt be on for much longer. Damn it!
Grand Prince,"The appeal to Netflix for me was always that they had a mix of shows I liked to rewatch and a good amount of original content that was largely good. Now they're losing most of the licensed content (a lot of shows I like are already gone) and their track record with original content is mediocre, made worse by their quick axe with shows.

They're becoming the most expendable streaming service to me. The one I don't need to have all the time."
Grand Prince,Good thing I have the internet
Grand Prince,"Damn, I was about to finally watch The West Wing."
Grand Prince,"> High profile

> Friday Night Tykes

What."
Grand Prince,If only this meant we could get The Last Kingdom s3 and s4 on Netflix...
Grand Prince,"I find it interesting the second or first most binged show two years running isn't moving

I guess Netflix won't be going to hell..."
Grand Prince,I've only seen two of these shows. None of the other shows interest me so I guess I am lucky!
Grand Prince,"> Netflix Canada

> Friends (Seasons 1-10) : moving to Crave

> The Office (Seasons 1-9)

> The fresh Prince of bell-air (Seasons 1-6)

Actually, The Office is staying put for now and it is Gossip Girl in fact that's leaving Netflix over here in the North."
Grand Prince,I started Gran Hotel on Wednesday but I don't think I can watch 60+ episodes in the next week!  Hope it moves to Hulu.
Grand Prince,"Yeah what the duck. Unless one season consists of 3-4 episodes

The anime has 37 episodes in total and it's all labeled as one season and there are few live action movies including a western one which failed."
Grand Prince,Not having ads and choosing what to watch is a huge plus though
Grand Prince,"We were never not going to have that. When we complained about cable it wasn‚Äôt because they asked us to pay for content we wanted. It‚Äôs because they also forced us to pay for content we didn‚Äôt want. I was paying thirty bucks a month for four ESPN channels I never ever use. I don‚Äôt want that.  I don‚Äôt have to pay for that without cable, which is great. But ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get all the content in this entire world for 12.99 a month‚Äù is kinda unreasonable."
Grand Prince,"Time to buy a 3TB hard drive and work on the only channel that matters, a Plex server"
Grand Prince,"People wanted the ability to just pay for what they watch, right? Well here you go."
Grand Prince,"Except the ""TV channels"" have everything available immediately and you can cancel anytime. Seems like a pretty major difference."
Grand Prince,[deleted]
Grand Prince,"This are all officially announced, but the bad news is what i listed is probably only 1/10 or 1/15 of what will be leaving Netflix soon."
Grand Prince,"For the ones on Netflix France at least, you get a warning when playing them. So that's sure for those. I assume the others are the same"
Grand Prince,"New name for CBS All Access, they're rebranding"
Grand Prince,Some still work like Expressvpn
Grand Prince,I completely agree.  I regularly unsubscribe from Netflix for months at a time to save a few bucks until something I REALLY want to watch starts up.
Grand Prince,For a minute I thought it was a typo for Friday Night Lights!
Grand Prince,"Wait, you don't? Where are you? I thought they carried that everywhere."
Grand Prince,"Damn that sucks man, the last kingdom is awesome. That‚Äôs a shitty situation I‚Äôd be pretty irritated."
Grand Prince,What show
Grand Prince,You're only obligated to a monthly payment and can cancel anytime which is a huge plus as well. If the streaming services ever change this model that is when we go back to tv channels but without commercials.
Grand Prince,[deleted]
Grand Prince,mine is up to 67tb :)
Grand Prince,"> we don't have a single place to go to get the back catalogues like we used to 

We never had this."
Grand Prince,"Netflix had to start creating their own content because the other networks were already pulling content. They were proactive to the changing market, not the cause of it."
Grand Prince,Dam it‚Äôs getting really hard to keep up with all these streaming services
Grand Prince,"Nordics. The Last Kingdom was on SVT (public television) here in Sweden back in 2018, however since then you cant stream it anywhere as SVT only carries the episodes on their streaming site for a few weeks. Its very strange how Netflix hasnt gotten the rights yet"
Grand Prince,Lucifer
Grand Prince,"I get it, we are past the exciting new part of streaming, but I feel like so any people forget how worse cable truly was. This is a great point"
Grand Prince,"The cost is vastly lower and you can cancel whenever you want, jump to another streaming service and watch their content too."
Grand Prince,Need 2 more TB
Grand Prince,"They‚Äôre mostly done a bad job of naming themselves, despite fairly obvious choices.

* Disney+ is *fine.* ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù possibly would have been better.
* HBO Max. You could say it should be ‚ÄúHBO,‚Äù but HBO is a premium brand yet they‚Äôre using it as a service name for all Warner Bros.' shows and movies. ‚ÄúWarner Bros.‚Äù  or ‚ÄúWB‚Äù would have been better, with ‚ÄúHBO‚Äù as a tab within that. No need to dilute HBO‚Äôs existing cachet.
* CBS All Access should just be CBS. Paramount works fine, but calling it Paramount+ just looks like they‚Äôre a wannabe Disney+ (which they are). The Paramount Channel, maybe.
* Peacock is an awful name. Most people don‚Äôt know that NBC‚Äôs rainbow logo *is* a peacock. Again, just call it ‚ÄúNBC.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúApple TV‚Äù is probably the only option they had, since they‚Äôve moved away from ‚ÄúiMovie‚Äù-style names and it mostly has TV shows, not movies, but it creates confusion between the streaming service, the physical box you hook up into your TV, and the app that acts as a portal to all (non-Netflix) video."
Grand Prince,"Easier to keep up with it if most of them aren't releasing in my country. Netflix, Prime and Disney and that's about it I guess.

edit: forgot Apple+"
Grand Prince,"Bizarre! Sorry to hear that, though -- I hope they make some changes soon for you all."
Grand Prince,"All that - plus you actually choose to watch what you want, when you want. The ability to watch Fuller House never stops you from watching The Office."
Grand Prince,gimmie a month im on it!
Grand Prince,"The paid service is called AppleTV+ actually. Apple TV is the app that regroups all other services on the tvOS system (which is available on the hardware called...AppleTV). Yeah it's a mess of naming

> HBO Max. You could say it should be ‚ÄúHBO,‚Äù but HBO is a premium brand yet they‚Äôre using it as a service name for all Warner Bros.' shows and movies. ‚ÄúWarner Bros.‚Äù or ‚ÄúWB‚Äù would have been better, with ‚ÄúHBO‚Äù as a tab within that. No need to dilute HBO‚Äôs existing cachet.

That was kind of the idea, profit from the HBO brand awareness in TV for it. But yeah it's dumb because they have stuff like DC, Cartoon Network, CNN, Warner Bros,.. all of those are strong brand in their own right. They should have done something like calling it WarnerMedia (that's literally the new name of the Warner branch inside AT&T) and include ""sections"" for HBO, CN, Warner TV, Warner Bros (movies), DC,...

> Peacock is an awful name. Most people don‚Äôt know that NBC‚Äôs rainbow logo is a peacock. Again, just call it ‚ÄúNBC.‚Äù

It's ridiculous but it's larger than just NBC too, it's the whole Universal catalog too (at least it's the objective)."
Grand Prince,"They‚Äôre changing to Paramount+ because outside the US no-one knows what the hell a CBS is, except the people who remember the billboard company or the record label.

Sounds like a painful visit to the toilet."
Grand Prince,"BET+, AMC+, and Discovery+ are fairly well named. Although the discovery service is surprisingly packed"
Grand Prince,Better Disney+ than just Disney. That would just create confusion when talking about about it. We would forever having to say whether we mean Disney the company or Disney the streaming service.
Grand Prince,Nice
Grand Prince,"Oh gosh... wayyy too many to list. Series I'm caught up on or have finished fully is pushing 300. It'll be easier just to list the shows on my binge rotation. I just finished season 2 of Hulu's Shrill and Woman of Dignity (korean show) earlier today. Now I'm getting through Part 3 of the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Other than that, I'm on season 3 of the L word, season 3 of Mom, season 3 of Please Like Me, season 04 of sex and the city, and season 13 of Law & order SVU. 

If anyone cares enough (doubtful haha) you can skim the full list of series ive finished on my trakt account. 
https://trakt.tv/users/allgloss/lists/finished-shows?sort=rank,asc"
Grand Prince,I don't have a comprehensive list of all the series I've watched that I've enjoyed across all channels.  But I do have [a list of all the Netflix Originals that I've liked so far](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/afspgp/this_year_netflix_loses_20_of_its_content_disney/ee15z5d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)
Grand Prince,[deleted]
Grand Prince,"Wow u watch 300 how do you get the time to rewatch them 

I thought I was bad 

Like I have 4 and a half ikea shelves full of movies and tv shows and some I have to put on the side meaning they go over the edge

Do u just like watch every show that is current on air and all the big shows from past"
Grand Prince,I mean it is a personal list. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Grand Prince,What‚Äôs is your list (does not have to be as long as mine)
Grand Prince,"Haha I normally don't rewarch them, unless I'm rewatching them with someone else who hasn't seen them.

And oh wow I used to be bad with DVDs like that. But now I'm more of a digital hoarder/streamer. DVD wise, I only own the complete series of Tru Calling, Alias, Charmed, Dark Angel, Dollhouse, and Medium.

I don't watch every show that's on air, just the ones that interest me. Which happens to be quite a few of them since I enjoy a little bit from every genre. I also watch shows from a wide variety of countries, too."
Grand Prince,"Some shows I only download to watch such as outsider true detective etc and some I watch on prime and Netflix so do t get them 

I will be watching all the live action Star Wars and marvel shows when they come go Disney + but probably unable to get it because paying for too much already so my have to download them 

And would u not really rewatch some of the greatest shows such as the office friends Seinfeld cheers the Simpsons family guy breaking bad/better call Saul the walking dead the wire malcom in the middle etc etc

I enjoy some shows that are airing too like from different genre. In the uk sky Atlantic shows hbo shows (I have virgin tv so do not get that channel but it was advertised a few times and I was like it looks good and now I seen the first one day it was out and episode 2 a few days later and just watched episode 3 earlier"
Grand Prince,"Ehhh though I have seen many of those shows you mentioned, I wouldn't consider them any of my personal greatest/favorites. Though i love putting simpsons and family guy on in the background when I'm doing school work. But as for doing a full series rewatch, youll probably catch me rewatching something like Medium or Dollhouse or one of my favorite korean shows like Oh My Ghostess or Ice Adonis before i'd do a full series rewatch of any of the shows you mentioned. 

It is getting rididiculous with the amount of streamers there are. Its not really feasible to have them all unless say everyone in a family or friend group pays for one and they all share them. And even that can be a stretch cuz that's not even counting the premium channels like showtime, HBO, Starz, etc etc."
Grand Prince,"It's like a cheap, British version of Gossip Girl with worse actors. Which is a shame because a show about modern royals could be a huge hit now that actual modern royals are in the center of attention all the time."
Grand Prince,"I made it almost until the end. When the bodyguard gloated he had a sex tape of the princess and she just let him walk out with it- instead of calling one of the many, many people around to take the phone- I was done. "
Grand Prince,I saw a commercial for this as I was watching Basketball today.  I feel dumber for even knowing that this show exists.
Grand Prince,http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jan/21/the-royals-trashiest-tv-liz-hurley-joan-collins
Grand Prince,"There were maybe 3 minutes of the show that wasn't horribly soundtracked to death.

This show is exactly the quality you would expect a show from the creator of One Tree Hill to be."
Grand Prince,"I'll give almost any show three episodes before I decide to forget about it. I gave this show ten minutes before giving up. An obvious Gossip Girl knockoff that manages to have all of the angst and none of the swagger. If you're going to make a show about the rich and powerful behaving badly, they need a bit of the Magnificent Bastard trope mixed in, otherwise they're just unlikeable assholes.

I believe Elizabeth Hurley is the queen of England about as much as I believe I am. Hurley's natural sleaziness simply doesn't work for the role. I would've completely bought her as a royal fixer who gets the king and queen and their kids out of trouble. This casting goes up there with Keanu Reeves as Buddha and Meg Ryan the helicopter pilot.

And whatever you think of Gossip Girl, it unquestionably used music smartly and rarely got heavy-handed with it. The Royals, which opens with Gimme Shelter, only knows heavy-handed."
Grand Prince,Boy this thread really blew up!
Grand Prince,"This show has some pieces so I might give it another episode or two. They need to tone down the morality tales from the King. It's a trashy soap, you've got to go 90MPH."
Grand Prince,"this feels like watching 'the prince and me 3' turned into a television show. lots of unrealistic dialogue, championing of the 'common American' (why is she even at the palace?). 
also why are they eating pie as a sweet dish. it's not even that popular  (they wouldn't just call it 'pie' that's an american thing) 

it's a show about English royalty made by Americans who probably haven't even been to England or even watched an English show. ever. this is crap. "
Ladies Up,Great move
Ladies Up,"I haven't watched either but The cleaning lady is based on an Argentine TV series with the same name. And it's also not the first adaptation, there's a Mexican one too."
Ladies Up,What's the hierarchy in tv shows?thought creator was at the top? what about ep and producers?
Ladies Up,Technically EPs are a higher rank‚Ä¶cuz while the creator has the idea‚Ä¶the EP makes it happen. And then the showrunner basically is the tv version of a director. Oversee creative through all episodes to tell the story the way they want
Ladies Up,"I'm not sure but I think the creator is just the person who had the idea and brought it to the network, there are even cases where the creators are not part of the production at all."
Ladies Up,"yes, i kinda like honest people."
Ladies Up,"I remember a Neil Patrick Harris interview from years ago where he was asked about his old ‚ÄúDoogie Howser‚Äù show. The interviewer was kind of goading him into trash talking the show for being lame and a little ridiculous. Harris wasn‚Äôt having any of it, because there were a lot of people working on that show that worked hard on costuming, editing, lighting, etc. and did a very good job. He didn‚Äôt think it was fair to shit on all the work they did just because the show didn‚Äôt age well. I have a lot of respect for that sort of attitude."
Ladies Up,"The Delta Flyers, a Star Trek: Voyager podcast, is a great example of this.  The two hosts are Garrett Wang (Harry Kim) and Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris) and they review and critique each episode.  Wang is the more forgiving of the two, but they'll definitely point out or criticize things (including their own performances at times) that don't work for them in the episode.  McNeill has had a prolific post acting career as a TV director and producer, so his production insights are great as well.

While they seem to have a good grasp on canon from their own show, they definitely have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Trek lore from the other shows/movies."
Ladies Up,"It's always a bit jarring when you're reminded that most actors don't care about their characters and/or the show as much as the more ardent fans do. Like, when fans pick up on a pattern or a subtlety and then you hear the actor talk about not realizing that at all. Or like when some of the Marvel actors did an interview and couldn't answer some of the more basic questions about the lore, and it made me realize that I was spending way too much time/energy trying to understand every little thing."
Ladies Up,"My take is i want them honest to an extent is how I'll say it. If you're proud of the show generally and want to look back and critique both the good and the bad, I love to hear it. Will Friedle said of boy meets world that for them it's like growing up and finding out your parents are full people with positives and negatives, you don't love them any less its just a different relationship. And I like that, it really fits i think.

But if you hated your time on a show, thought it was stupid, hated the writing, hated your character, and you're going to review everything like it's the worst thing ever, keep it mostly to yourself. If something traumatic happened, of course they can talk about it, I dont wanna say they aren't allowed to tell their story. But if the extent is you thought the dumb show you were on is dumb, keep it to yourself and let fans enjoy the dumbness"
Ladies Up,I don't really care about Star Wars stuff at all but I gained respect for John Boyega when he bullied SW nerds on Twitter.
Ladies Up,"It‚Äôs childish I know, but I get a little bummed out when actors on ‚Äúhang out‚Äù shows say they don‚Äôt care about the show or even don‚Äôt like it. A good example is Jason Segal (and Josh Radnor come to think of it) on How I met your mother, both of whom seem a little embarrassed by the show. 

A counter example is Seinfeld‚Äî the main cast on that show all seem to be genuinely proud of what they made and think back on it fondly."
Ladies Up,"Oh absolutely. I want to know it all. I think the only podcasts I‚Äôve listened in the past 12 months is from the people who work/have worked on tv shows. 

Which is weird, a few years ago I would not have listened to stuff like that and would rather listen to content that teaches stuff. Now I‚Äôm all for it.

Edit: forgot to say, I listen to podcasts of people not involved too. Like I‚Äôm fully entertained listening to 3 guys break down a Simpsons episode."
Ladies Up,I‚Äôm completely indifferent
Ladies Up,"I dunno. Everyone likes gossip, but that industry seems so ego heavy, I honestly feel bad for actors who are put on the spot to bad mouth something they've worked on knowing those are real doors closing for them."
Ladies Up,"I'm enjoying the Talkville podcast which is Tom Welling & Michael Rosenbaum discussing Smallville. It seems pretty honest, but there's also a lot they seem to have forgotten about making the show, understandably so, it was a while ago that the show aired."
Ladies Up,No not really. I just want to enjoy the magic of movies and TV shows.
Ladies Up,Half of Pod Meets World (the boy meets world podcast) is the 3 actors shitting on some of the decisions the producers and Michael Jacobs made about the show lol.
Ladies Up,"Why would I want it the other way around, honesty is appreciated."
Ladies Up,"Alan Ritchson is known for doing this on podcasts.

I watched a podcast were he talked about how brutal filming for Reacher was, he explained how they underestimated how long filming would take so everything was rushed and the fight scenes were choreographed in between takes then filmed after. How he was so exhausted and injured from the 16+ hours days 7 days a week that he was taking so much ibuprofen that his testosterone tanked which made him even more exhausted. 

On a different podcast a few years ago he also talked about how badly he got screwed with contracts for the Ninja Turtles movies which resulted in terrible filming conditions for the turtles."
Ladies Up,It's a mistake for an actor to do this because any future producers will naturally wonder if their show will be criticized.  Even the cheesiest show has its fans so why ruin their pleasure?
Ladies Up,"They're actors. Even better actors if we the viewers think they absolutely loved their show/character and it turns out they didn't. I'm sure they're are plenty who hated, loved, were ok with when it came to their shows/roles.  The more they're in, that's what is going to happen. To me it is far worse, when you really like an actor, & that actor is a complete a-hole in real life :) Honestly that is why you should never make someone you really don't know, into some kind of giant/hero. They are people like you & me, with a job to do."
Ladies Up,Does Wang mention how he was a shit actor and basically was saved because he was named sexy in TV Guide or whatever?
Ladies Up,"To be fair it's more the writers/directors/showrunners who you would expect to know that stuff. Plenty of actors don't like watching their own work (I know it'd be a form of torture for me in their position), and when you spend months shooting things out of order, not seeing other people's scenes, not seeing the VFX, months or years going by before it's aired, you can forgive them for forgetting a lot of it"
Ladies Up,"There was a Comic Con GoT panel where GRRM said that some of the actors didn't even read the books and Natalie Dormer rolled her eyes, lol."
Ladies Up,"Yes, for many actors its like the equivalent of being a systems engineer/electrician/plumber/insert profession here. It‚Äôs a paycheck and they‚Äôll (most of them, anyway) be professional during their work hours, but then they‚Äôre tired and want to do other things. Like Carla recently said hanging out with the rest of the gang in an episode of Scrubs, ‚Äúcan we please talk about something else besides work?‚Äù

I try to look closely when watching any show to try to spot sone things, but I just like to watch in a more relaxed way and notice different things naturally without staring at the little picture in the background of a scene briefly shown that‚Äôs a little obscured. Sometimes I wonder how these diehard fans do it. üòÜ

Bless these people, though, who are really dedicated."
Ladies Up,"Well for actors it is a job at the end of the day. Also throughout their career they are in many different TV shows, they aren't going to remember all of it."
Ladies Up,tbt to Paltrow not even knowing she was in Spiderman üò≠
Ladies Up,"I agree fully with this. If I like a show but the actor just didn‚Äôt like it or didn‚Äôt get along with most of their fellow actors or had a lot of creative differences and spoke that way for the majority of time the podcast runs, it wouldn‚Äôt be a fun time listening for most of the show‚Äôs fans who would rather hear how fun and great it was and at least more honest balance between praise/criticism of a show rather than breaking down how terrible something they took a lot of pleasure from was."
Ladies Up,Some of the game of thrones cast who i never really had much care for really gained my respect when they spoke out as to how shit the last seasons were
Ladies Up,"I appreciate it when creators clap back at obnoxious and rude people on the internet. Simu Liu did something similar when some alt-right grifter types tried to paint Shang-Chi as a box office bomb, only for it to do quite well. And I think his [responses](https://i.redd.it/7jp7cu8wjyl71.jpg) were [appropriate.](https://i.redd.it/rlsnr8gsi0m71.jpg)"
Ladies Up,">A counter example is Seinfeld‚Äî the main cast on that show all seem to be genuinely proud of what they made and think back on it fondly. 

Could point to the quality of the show to explain the difference, but iirc the cast on Seinfeld had a lot more influence on the production than modern prime time sitcoms; easier to stand by something you had a hand in, Segel is more like that with Forgetting Sarah Marshall iirc"
Ladies Up,"What do you mean by ‚Äúput on the spot‚Äù? It‚Äôs the actors‚Äô choice if they host a podcast/YouTube channel/blog to interact with fans and talk about a show they spent a lot of time and energy on. If they are very generous with their praise, honest with criticism or just very balanced in their views, they‚Äôre willingly sharing these views.

In interviews I definitely get your point, but this post is specifically about podcasts hosted/co-hosted by these actors."
Ladies Up,"I guess there are some fans out there who if an actor faked enthusiasm for something well enough those fans would never notice whether these actors hosting this podcast are just praising their show nonstop out of a sense of obligation (bias) or they really mean it from their heart.

For example, let‚Äôs say on the Fake Doctors, Real Friends podcast, if Braff and Faison didn‚Äôt like an episode they were recapping and talking about but instead of saying that and explaining why on the show they just pretended to like it and every single episode and minute ever of Scrubs because they were loyal to the show/producers/network for all their hard work and loyalty to them and gave each bad/only decent episode the benefit of the doubt/overlooked it‚Äôs flaws and pretended these episodes were all flawless, it could come across as dishonest if enough fans pick up on it.

My point is, as a fan of a certain show, would you prefer the actors hosting this show talking about it (especially reviewing episode-by-episode) were essentially drooling over it and nonstop praise even if they don‚Äôt really believe it but believing this is what the fans want celebrating this show you like, or would you want them to criticize episodes that were of lesser quality and be impartial even if that means there are some harsh words spoken occasionally about a show you like?"
Ladies Up,It was him or Kess. Kess' storyline had dried up. Limited lifespans will do that.
Ladies Up,"I think Kit is the only one from the major actors who has read the books.

Really incredible how people like Liam Cunningham (Davos) and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) absolutely nailed their characters despite never having read the books.

Stephen Dillane (Stannis) absolutely hated the show yet was a literally perfect casting choice. I think this speaks volumes about how acting chops are more important than being a fan of the source material."
Ladies Up,"I would be surprised if most of the actors have at least flipped through a few pages but I don't blame them for not reading the whole thing through, the books are good but a bit dense and hard to digest IMO, I switched to the audiobooks and enjoyed that immensely more."
Ladies Up,"she has like two lines in it, they probably didn't even tell her the context or what it was for while shooting."
Ladies Up,I also gained some respect for that guy from Twilight after seeing him talk about how bad he thought the book/script was.
Ladies Up,[deleted]
Ladies Up,I mean jerry did but the other three were just actors as far as I know
Ladies Up,"Ah, my bad.  I didn't read closely enough and missed the hosted by part."
Ladies Up,She was a way more interesting character
Ladies Up,"To be fair, hating literally everything around him was super on brand for Stannis."
Ladies Up,">I think Kit is the only one from the major actors who has read the books.

Gwendoline, but she seems that way inclined for everything."
Ladies Up,Do you know why he hated the show? He was a pretty prominent character and on it for a good long while.
Ladies Up,Pretty sure Masie read them aswell.
Ladies Up,As I understand the industry a bit better I dont blame her for that
Ladies Up,"The rest of the cast spoke out against it via morse code, if you check their blinking."
Ladies Up,"Not saying they were writing their own lines or anything, but remember Michael Richards and Jason Alexander being able to sort of make the character their own; had a little more freedom and ""ownership"" of their character

Meanwhile my understanding of modern network sitcom productions are the actors mostly just show up, read their lines, and go home (bc even in a long running sitcom, you can be replaced, see Roseanne)"
Ladies Up,"he also didnt understand the show at all

so he was basically stannis and doing his duty"
Ladies Up,[removed]
Ladies Up,I think he didn't so much hate the show as the experience of working in it.
Ladies Up,I think Ian McElhinney is a fan of them as well.
Ladies Up,"He's just one of those old hats who's not a fan of fantasy. Probably thought the show was nonsense. Liam Cunningham mentions that Stephen would constantly ask him what was happening in a scene (lol).

Pretty insane to think just how perfect a Stannis he was. He was just in it for the paycheck :)"
Ladies Up,"He didn't hate it. Just didn't ""get it."" He never badmouths it directly.

I think for him it just wasn't a very interesting experience. With a huge production like this, in multiple countries, you don't necessarily get a great work environment. His character barely interacted with the majority of the cast, I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't even meet a bunch of them."
Ladies Up,"For the greater good. If he believes the religious nonsense Mel is feeding him and was desperate enough, then it makes sense he would burn Shireen. I'd assume he'd appoint another heir, unless he was convinced he was covered in plot armour or something.

It's been a while since I've read the books and I've never liked Stannis, so I may be wildly off about what makes sense for Stannis to do."
Ladies Up,"yes, that's right. There's a few. More haven't than have."
Ladies Up,"Yeah, he talked about how he was excited for a bigger role coming up.

Oops."
Ladies Up,"I also haven't read them in ages, but I never got the impression that Stannis believed any of it, and he was just using them."
Ladies Up,Enjoyed it when it was on. Especially Wade.
Ladies Up,"I miss this show and wish it was able to get more seasons.

The movie to close the series just felt rushed but I‚Äôm glad HBO at least gave them that."
Ladies Up,Such a funny show. Stephen merchant is underrated
Ladies Up,"I loved it, the tapdancing scene is one of the cringiest things I've ever seen. Haven't watched it since it aired but still remember it."
Ladies Up,"I really enjoyed it.  
  
Just finished his most recent series ""The Outlaws"" which was on BBC here in the UK. About a bunch of people on Community Service in Bristol, and randomly stars Christopher Walken."
Ladies Up,Such a hilarious show. My favorite sequence is Merchant going back and forth between the limo and lounge because he thinks he can hook up with his roommate's friend.
Ladies Up,When they are in the bathroom at the club and he lies to the bouncer!
Ladies Up,I had heard of it but had another look after your post.  There's a movie with mixed reviews if you didn't know: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12944538/
Ladies Up,"Amazing character arc that was only realized in the movie, unfortunately.  I loved him."
Ladies Up,"Right? I felt the same way.  I was wondering how that movie came about.  Were they contractually obligated to do it or did they pitch it to the network? I‚Äôm not sure.  

Of all the crud in the past three years I‚Äôve watched that did not deserve a second season, I‚Äôm bummed they didn‚Äôt get a round 2.

The same goes for HBO‚Äôs Enlightened which I was obsessed with.  That deserved two more seasons at least."
Ladies Up,"I can completely co-sign this comment, would have been my near exact statement. Great little show and it‚Äôs *still* a pleasant surprise it got the wrap up movie. So many little satisfying series would be more beloved and recommended if it had the closure, at least, like this got."
Ladies Up,Lanky cowriter
Ladies Up,He's to Ricky Gervais what Larry David is to Jerry Seinfeld.
Ladies Up,"Merchant wrote Hello Ladies, correct?  The writing on this show has made me want to seek out stuff he's done since Hello Ladies ended."
Ladies Up,"Love that scene! There was also some insanely ballsy humor around color and race (at the pool party) that they handled quite well.  This show had no issues making Merchant look like a total ass.

‚ÄúChicken Wings!‚Äù"
Ladies Up,"Yep, it's officially the 9th episode of the series on HBOMax.  It was OK, more saccharine than I hoped for, but still good."
Ladies Up,Exactly
Ladies Up,"Yeah he did.   
  
Merchant also co-wrote the UK Office and *Extras* with Ricky Gervais."
Ladies Up,"I watched this show as a kid, but I don't remember much anymore. I see it's on Prime, I might start watching it again."
Ladies Up,"I totally forgot about this.  I enjoyed it.  For some reason, it reminds me of that show where a guy started getting a newspaper a day early and tried to help people."
Ladies Up,"Yes! Loved this show. Really enjoyed the concept. The theme song in seasons 2 and 3 was really good. It was part of a ""double header"" on Saturday nights on NBC with ""The Profiler."" They crossed over a couple of times, too.

John Gries (aka Uncle Rico or Roger ""Workman"" Linus) was on it before his Napoleon Dynamite days."
Ladies Up,"I liked it a lot, and Ms. Parker is still one of my favorite characters because the trauma and the pressure seem very... contemporary: she's a mood, and I think many people often feel like her.

I wasn't a fan of the individual jobs/""cases"" in most episodes, and Jarod often felt a little creepy. I wish the show leaned into that a little stronger.

also, I wonder what happened to Michael T. Weiss, the actor: does he have some personal issues? plus, most people assume that he is queer, but I never read anything official.

completely random: Apple TV often has shows that fit the ""Pretender"" mood (geniuses, 60s retro stuff etc.: Hello Tomorrow, Severance, For All Mankind) and I would love to see what they would do with that concept."
Ladies Up,"What ever happened to that guy, Michael T. Weiss.  It's like he entered the Witness Protection Program or something, the way he disappeared."
Ladies Up,"Jeez, I hadn't thought about this show in over 20 years."
Ladies Up,I'm still mad we never got a proper ending.
Ladies Up,One of my favorites
Ladies Up,Great show. Watch is every few years.
Ladies Up,Great show. It's unfortunate that it's fallen out of the collective of good shows such that you rarely hear about it.
Ladies Up,"I remember it, watched it a lot. I might have missed a few episodes, though. 
It had crossovers with Profiler, which otherwise wasn't that similar. 
Had also neat cast of antagonists, and a larger background plot. Though it did feel a bit like they were making it up as they went along."
Ladies Up,"They took the perfect ""plot of the week"" show and ruined it with a monomyth."
Ladies Up,It was okay on TNT or whichever it broadcast on
Ladies Up,Loved that show - I think of it often whenever my career is getting me down.
Ladies Up,"I pretty much just remember the main dude looking kind of like Bear Grylls, the premise of the show and... that's it. I know I watched some episodes, but it was one of those shows I never made a note to actually watch. It's weird how the title ""The Pretender"" still rings a bell though."
Ladies Up,I watched it as a kid with my parents. Had a crush on Ms. Parker.
Ladies Up,Like The Hulk and Quantum Leap: gifted guy finds a new person in need every episode and apply their wholesome skills.
Ladies Up,"*The Pretender* was great. I'd support a reboot...if they kept the tone more serious than light-hearted. 

I do think the original show skewed a bit light-hearted in places, but there's a dearth of shows of that nature which tend more towards intensity, and a Pretender reboot would fill that gap nicely."
Ladies Up,"I remember a promo for a new episode where the voice over is asking, ""Is he crazy? Or crazy like a fox!"". I never watched the show, but that stuck in my head for some reason."
Ladies Up,Shocked to find all 4 seasons on amazon prime today
Ladies Up,Extremely underrated. Jake lloyd was in it before phantom menace
Ladies Up,"The myth arc got a bit away from the show, but really enjoyed it overall."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Legion takes place from David's point of view and is not necessarily what actually happened.  Always take his outlook as the best possible outlook for him. The only narratives that may be taken at face value are those which do not involve David from his own perspective.  Yes Farrouk took advantage of David's ""situation"" but without spoiling any more, if you see David happy and dancing, you should question the authenticity of the narrative. What he wants is not necessarily what we are seeing. All is explained later in the series."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I think this might not be the show for you then. Which is okay.

Maybe as you said, just read a summary and be done with it.

The final seasons are very ""show, don't tell"", and leans a lot into making us feel rather than pushing the plot forward, so if you don't enjoy the stylistic elements, this might not be the show for you (anymore)."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I believe they use the musical dances and numbers to portray psychic or astral plane activities and attacks. In most cases at least. Which adds a more interesting layer onto them. For example, the scene with Lenny dancing to ""Feeling Good"" in season 1 is Farrouk dancing through David's mind and memories.  Showing how much fun he has causing chaos and destruction inside David's mind.

I'll say they lean heavier into it season 3 though.  There's one moment where there's a long montage of people travelling through the desert to music that keeps going on and on. Then it cuts to commercial with nothing happening and it actually made me laugh outloud.

S2 also has an amazing astral battle set to a duet of ""Behind Blue Eyes"".

I actually loved the dancing and music in the show though. And I loved that it was how they portrayed psychic battles."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,The dance scenes are stylized fight scenes. Because without them it‚Äôs just two people staring at each other.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"The show was great overall, yes, but I did feel like after season 1 they were trying to be weird on purpose, not because it actually helped the story or anything, just for the sake of being out there. Felt a little like Hawley bought into his own hype."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I was in a similar position to you, but it was my partner that lost interest for the same reasons in season 2 - so I eventually watched it solo

but what I can tell you is that you should definitely persist and its definitely worth it!"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,It's not a secret what the dancing represents. It's pretty on the nose actually.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"You don't understand the show or the characters, lol. I don't think you are going to like the rest of it.."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"choreography as storytelling is a thing that you're missing, clearly.

you call it 'pointless' and 'no progressing the plot', but that just shows that you lack understanding of how choreography can tell a story.

you can either keep being blind to a new way of accessing information, or you could open your mind to something you've not understood."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I couldn't stand that show....
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,For me Season 2 and 3 should have been merged into one season. It was great.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Yeah this might not be the show for OP.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,That desert scene was s2‚Ä¶
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"From a summary of s2 ep1.   
""He tries to find Farouk telepathically, using an amplification chamber created by scientist Cary Loudermilk to increase the range of his abilities, **but instead relives a memory from the nightclub of a strange monk and a dance battle with Oliver and Lenny Busker""**

No, you just THINK it represents something.  I guess this show is perfect for you, fool. Idk what the name for it is, but its just 'character porn'. The main characters are dancing, and thats enough to entertain you. I guess my problem is I did not want to watch a musical."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,[removed]
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"> dance battle 

They're using a dance battle to represents a psychic battle because how do you represent that interesting style without people just holding fingers to their heads."

Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"lrn2read

""relives a memory""

do you know what a memory is?"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,The books are great. They explore many dark ideas. ‚ÄòInterview‚Äô is only a small peep into the Anne Rice universe.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I really liked the first two episodes. They skip the homoerotic subtext and really lean into it, which I like. 

And I‚Äôm liking the new Lestat better than Cruise."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I was very hesitant about this show with the time period change, but holy crap this show already hooked me"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I'm hopefull with the great performance the actor has put on as Lestat that we can have a prequel season and finally get ""The Vampire Lestat"" on film which is my favorite of the series."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"""Interview With The Vampire definitely does not suck"" sounds like one of the most desperate advertisements I've read in awhile."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I was very young when I read interview with the vampire and I never even thought it could be that they were in a relationship. The second it‚Äôs brought to my attention I realize yes, obviously they were! I can‚Äôt wait to read it again."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I've watched both available episodes now (just finished episode 2), and this is my favorite show right now. The adjustments made for this adaptation are fantastic so far - so much so that they feel like a fantastic example of how to adapt material in general. The performances, costumes, and sets are top-tier, and I found watching the BTS very refreshing. It's clear that the show runner and the crew really *get* the source material and really care about how important the series is to so many. I'm very much looking forward to the rest!!! Like dammit AMC, you made me *want* to pay for you wtf üò≠"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"As a big fan of Anne Rice and of the first film adaptation, I was really put off by the big changes - to the time period and Louie's background - in the first few minutes. But damn, this show is incredibly compelling and I ended up really enjoying the changes! They made this version of Louis quite a likeable character and someone you really want to watch and delve into his story. 

Can't help but the chuckle at the people who are appalled by the open homosexuality between the two male leads. How could you watch the 1994 movie or read the books without picking up on the homoerotic subtext? The implications seemed pretty clear to me, but I guess they are easy to if ignore if you don't want to see it. A lot of Anne Rice's vampire series have homosexual undertones though so people getting angry about it is utterly ridiculous imo"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I love Raleigh Ritchie‚Äôs music which is enough to convince me to give this a go when it finally comes to the UK
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"It's a bit ironic how Anne Rice for years and years was so against fanfiction of her works and this show plays like a alternative universe fanfic of her works. Mind you, it's a fun fanfic. I was blown away by the pilot and I am here for the rest of the season. But I think it's funny how much they have changed the characters beyond just lookwise but whole back stories and Anne Rice was fiercely trying to prevent that from happening. Lestat isn't a bastard. He was always pretty much a charming devil of a bastard in the books. I don't mind the difference. But he really isn't like book!Lestat. With that said, he is compelling as a character. 

Again, if you looking for a loyal adaptation of the book like the way The Sandman is a loyal adaptation, then this isn't it. However, with that said, if you can pretend that this is simply a horror drama with vampires, you are in for a good time. The leads are fantastic. They have great chemistry with each other. The writing is good. The production is rich. They clearly spent their dimes on this. If you are fan of Hannibal, check this out. To me, it has the same vibes."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,The movie was good to watch. The book was ducking amazing. Couldn‚Äôt put it down.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"The first five minutes I thought I was watching a documentary, not the beginning of the show.  Eric Bogosian brings gravitas. Jacob Anderson is doing a great job as well."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I've always been a big fan of the books, and so far I'm living this new...reboot? 

Louis is a much more interesting character in this new series. The racial commentary is a new angle that I appreciate. Lestat is more natural so far. The unreliable narrating of classic Louis is missing, but that's turning out to be a good thing so far. 

I can't wait to see what else they do with the material."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I understand people having misgivings, but it's strange seeing this show getting so much criticism in advance. I'm not familiar with the source material or the 1994 movie so for me there's no comparison, I can only judge the show on its on merits and having seen the first two episodes I'm completely overwhelmingly on board. I expected I would be, since it includes a lot of things I enjoy, but beyond that it's just really great TV. The acting especially is worthy of mention. Get Jacob Anderson and Sam Reid their flowers now, immediately. 

The series has been getting great reviews (no, it's not just 2-3 articles out there) and I've seen word-of-mouth picking up on twitter and elsewhere, hopefully it's enough to alleviate some of the scepticism/outright dismissal I've come across. It just feels like such a shame that this show would slip under the radar just because people won't even give it a chance."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Excellent show, shocking in moments. It's really well written."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"One of my friends finished the second episode and we both agree on one thing...

It's a bit too openly gay. Mind you, we're both gay, but as fans of the novels and the first movie, that element of subtext makes it so much stronger. 

Sometimes subtlety creates a powerful atmosphere and gives something a bit more style, having certain things spelled out on screen feels a bit cheap, like pandering to the people who otherwise wouldn't get it. 

Louis and Lestat are bisexual, or pansexual. Lestat especially, he is hedonistic in his desires and feels no need to indulge society's hang-ups regarding sex. Something is only taboo if he deems it a taboo, and there seems to be little that Lestat deems taboo.

Louis is conflicted, and while that is the same in the show as it is in the book and the movie, the conflict he experiences is between his repressed state and his desires. He wants, but abstains from it, only to give in to it. Alwaya tormented, always racked with guilt. The show leans heavier into what he desires, and while they show the guilt, in episode 2 it seems like he has given up on feeling guilty about his desires and his moments of weakness."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Wait‚Ä¶there‚Äôs an Interview with a Vampire show?? How did I not hear of this!?
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I just watch the pilot and it is really good. The acting is great and the scenes are pretty. 
Im also a history fashion lover and the costumes were so pretty. In my opinion pretty accurate for the period."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,When I heard about the changes a while back I was skeptical at best. But the first episode was fantastic. I was very impressed with it. I think they‚Äôve captured something special here.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Definitely does not suck. That's damning with faint praise, if I ever heard such a thing. 

The pun does suck though."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Quite liked the first ep.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I just finished watching and it was AMAZING! I really set my expectations low based on how well adaptions usually go and the vampire genre being difficult to pull off but this show exceeded my expectations! Also I love the fact they made it LGBTQ!
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Im a long time reader of Anne Rice. This was a really really good take. The one thing that i found wierd is the journalist was to on the nose as Anthony Bourdain. Also a good journalist style would have been Charley LeDuff. 

I hope this works out, because although ""Interview"" was hugely popular, i liked the secound book better ""Lestat"""
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,The cast of the original film was so damn good that nothing can touch it. Sorry AMC.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"This show has me torn... 

I like it... but I don't like it as the show-version of Interview with a Vampire. 

It has all the ingredients to make it a really good show... but it is so different from the original books that it isn't a good adaption.

I like it... but I don't... bit I do.

I want this to be a success."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I've really enjoyed it thus far. The setting is great, the acting is wonderful, Daniel's older perspective has been tons of fun (no fucks to give, vampire or not!). I think it's quite clever how they've ""updated"" the time period for the show with this being a repeat interview, while still acknowledging the 70s interview as canon.

My two big criticisms are simply:  
‚Ä¢I don't like the time-period change. It's nothing particular about the setting; I just don't like how it basically cuts Louis' life in half. Shave a hundred years off of Louis because the producer/directer/whoever ""doesn't wanna tell a plantation story."" Well then write your own best-selling vampire story, jeez.  
‚Ä¢Actual sex being included. It's established in the books that vampires can't have physical sex anymore; their parts don't work, their sex drive is gone and replaced with their hunger for blood. The story involves pretty deep emotional connections that easily step into the erotic, and homo-erotic, a lot throughout the series, but physical allure is always used as nothing more than a hunting tool, because they \*physically can't.\* Changing that cheapens the whole thing just to score cheap points with the Twilight/Vampire Diaries crowds, and that's disappointing and lazy, IMO."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I actually heard great reviews of it so far so I will check it out.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Honestly, it reads like advertisement from start to finish.

Stuff like:

> The series wisely ages Claudia up to 14 (she was 5 in the novel and film), trapping her in a permanent puberty that will leave her impulsive and voracious for all eternity.

Why is that wise? Claudia's conflict of being an eternal child is central to the main themes of the novel.

And what is this crap?

> He‚Äôs also, vitally, very funny; you have to be to sell lines like ‚ÄúYou can endeavor on an experience that feels like eating syrup while riding on the wind.‚Äù

Why would anyone think a good idea to introduce corny humor to this story?

It all feels like the producers/channel were uncomfortable with the source material so they added a lot of sugar on top of it to make it more ""palatable"" for their audience."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Really enjoyed the first ep and excited for the rest of the season. The setting is gorgeous and thoroughly enjoy Louis and Lestat's characters and how they're portrayed, even moreso than the movie which I've been a fan of since I was a kid. Can't wait until they get Claudia in and hoping we'll also get Armand this season."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Been many years since i read the book but wasnt Louis a plantation owner if i remember correctly? How does that work with him being black in this series?
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Well if a vampire doesn't suck then it's not a great show
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"A fresh take? There has been one take of one book back in the 90s and another take of another book soon after. It‚Äôs not like we were inundated with Anne rice vampire films.

Yeah super true to the source material, other than time period, setting, circumstances, character backgrounds, and relationships yeah it must be totally similar."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I‚Äôm guessing if I watch this it will be a good thing that I don‚Äôt know anything about the source material and will just take it for what it is
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,The books are fantastic. I really hope they do them justice
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,They better do all the books by golly!!!
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I liked it
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Just watched episode 2 and it is even better. The writing is so stellar I do not see how they can maintain the quality. 

The two leads are perfect. I still don't want to be a vampire but they make me want to be a gay male in my next life. 

This is the most seduction/ foreplay we have seen on the TV screen in years. 

TV has more sex scenes than ever but shows tend to get straight to it -- HBO's Industry for example.

This show has the balls to be erotic and the execution is natural rather than romance novel cheezy."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,[removed]
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,It absolutely sucked. They focused more on the relationships then they did them being vamps. Very annoying
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,‚ÄúTrue to the spirit of its source material‚Äù is never a sentence that inspires confidence in a tv or movie adaptation.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,">AMC concocts a wholly fresh take‚Ä¶

Ah, crap."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Congrats to fanfic on winning Anne Rice‚Äôs war on fanfic
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I could be wrong but I just never saw the books as being adapted to film without major changes for a mainstream audience.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"fresh takes are not what I look for in adaptations, I don't trust showrunners, that's why I don't care about this"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Can we not just once have something ‚Äòtrue to the books‚Äô instead of the ‚Äòspirit of the books‚Äô, which basically means not true to them at all? Would it be so difficult to just adapt it properly? No timeline shift, no changed backgrounds, just the actual story that sold so many copies. Not sure why we need a ‚Äòfresh take‚Äô when we haven‚Äôt had the actual proper take yet."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Its amazing how consistently new shows have 1 to 3 articles telling people how amazing a new show is.  Its almost like they are paid for in advance.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I watched half of the first episode and concluded tha it is complete garbage. The writer was simply afraid to tell Louis' actual origin story, so, he decided to make him a black man. And why stop there? Let's also make the story about racial inequalities. I am all for equality and I really should not have to point that out lmao. But, hey, we're just getting started; let's also get Louis and Lestat to get it on in the first episode, too. Tha fuq? Ya just bastardized the entire story within 30 minutes. Pathetic, but, i bet everyone just eats it up."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,You people are insane this is trash
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"So it blows?

Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Not my cup of blood.  From all the reviews I was expecting to get blown away, I turned it off halfway through the first ep."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Well‚Ä¶ new show to watch :) didn‚Äôt even know this was out or a thing. They need to do more advertising,"

Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,This is definitely my thing. I‚Äôve read most of her books and love all of the movies. I would love to see more of her books on film.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"It sucks and is another example of tv writers with huge egos thinking they can do better than the original authors....and have the gall to say they are keeping in spirit with the intent, when they clearly don't understand the intent of the author, that then spend loads of time patting themselves on the back for a job well done.

&#x200B;

At this point I kind of feel like these shitty tv show writers are plagiarizing, I mean if you can't do, copy someone else shit... but badly in your own words right!"
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Whenever I see the words ‚Äúspirit of‚Äù come up in any adaptation of anything I know it‚Äôs going to be a shadow of the original property at best.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"One of the times when one of the characters being black makes no sense and really undermines the story.

They should have just done a different story with a black vampire.

A rich black confident Southern gentleman who easily navigated high society in louisiana in 1780 make no sense whatsoever.

Insulting for everyone and downplays ls racism of the place and time.

Black people are only 13% of us population but somehow a single show without a black lead is unthinkable.

Could have made him Hispanic if they didn't want an all white  leading cast.


But seems that diversity is just another word for black."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Saying it doesn't suck is almost as desperate as removing all the reviews for a show.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"Sick of all these remakes to be honest. It‚Äôs never anything new, only recycled movies."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"> ""It‚Äôs fair to ask whether, at this stage of the game, we need another entry into the blood-bloated vampire canon.

Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,I found the show horrible IMO. I thought the acting was particularly bad.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"I mean, it's been on AMC+ for long enough for people to be talking about it if it were otherwise, and they aren't. Given the lineage there should be crazy buzz about this series, yet it was crickets from the media until yesterday. That's not a great sign."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,## DO NOT QUESTION THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Really wish it wasn't locked on amc+
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Anyone know how to watch this in Canada?
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,"My issue is that if they plan to adapt the latter novels, well they arnt too good.  They go downhill fast after the Queen of the Damed."
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,Doubt.
Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai,It's a poorly acted gay porn show with garbage .10 ratings. They renewed before release. Total garbage and will be cancelled because 90% of viewed wrote it off after episode 2 and will never come back. Woke has officially jumped the shark.
Unorthodox,"Just finished binging it, wow I loved this series. The acting was superb, the making of mini-doc revealed how carefully they constructed the details and considered the themes, and I am always excited about seeing women centered media (director, writer, costuming, story, actor, etc).

I disagree about the flashbacks being distracting. Often they connected to memories that Esty experienced while navigating new directions in her life. As the film approaches a climax (what will happen with her life) more is revealed about exactly how her past was so traumatic. It shows us what is at stake, why she is fighting for a future.

For the criticism from Orthodox community and reported inconsistencies, remember this is the story of just one specific community/sect of Orthodox Jews, and this can be used as an allegory for many different people's struggles."
Unorthodox,"This story of a young Hasidic woman who wants to leave her cloistered way of life is both heartbreaking and uplifting as it pits her courage and determination against the cruelty and arrogance of the insular and ignorant Hasidic community. If you thought the Hasidim were repugnant and obnoxious after watching the Netflix documentary ""One of Us,"" the dramatization of the true story in ""Unorthodox"" will not change your mind.  


One important correction: The subtitles repeatedly read that the Hasidim are praying in Yiddish. They do converse in Yiddish, but for Jews, including most definitely the ultra-orthodox Hasidim, the language of prayer is Hebrew. For those of us who know the difference, in ""Unorthodox"" the Hasidim are indeed praying in Hebrew. The film is correct but the subtitles are wrong."
Unorthodox,Just finished. This blew my mind. Sooo moving.
Unorthodox,does anyone know the name of the DJ group in episode 3?
Unorthodox,"Just a heads up. A lot of Orthodox Jews are a little annoyed at the series for exaggerating Orthodox, and specifically Hassidic, life. The allegedly non-fiction book that the series is based on was also found to have some problematic inconsistencies.

On an unrelated note, Shira Haas's Ruchama was my favorite character in ~~*Schlissel*~~*Shtisel* (up until her weird boyfriend storyline)."
Unorthodox,Can anyone tell me about what was happening in the kitchen in the scene where she suspects she is pregnant? It looks like lots of surfaces are covered in aluminium foil.
Unorthodox,"Last write-up in this series for a while. Will probably still be posting random stuff on here just won't be watching any new shows for the next 3-4 weeks. Hopefully within a month I'll still have my life and health to continue doing these. 

Next shows I'll be doing when I'm back at this should be Little Fries Everywhere. Also I'm making a 'Top Teen-Dramas of All Time' listicle for some reason idk. üò™

Anyways, stay safe guys!"
Unorthodox,Thanks for the list and the review of this series.  Now I have something to watch since I finished Tiger King.  BTW is that one not in the list because it is to new?
Unorthodox,Catnapp. The soundtrack for the show is on Spotify
Unorthodox,"I haven‚Äôt seen the show (only the trailer) but OF COURSE Orthodox Jews don‚Äôt like it. The Hasidic community is extraordinarily inclusive and they don‚Äôt want people knowing how dated their beliefs are, especially when it comes to women."
Unorthodox,"I tried to watch this show, and I'm not even up to anything controversial and can still see why. There's just an underlying disdain for them that makes the show really hard to watch."
Unorthodox,"Wow, I went down a rabbit hole of the debunking articles....

Reading that she wasn't really educated in that community, her family apparently supported her going to Sarah Lawrence, and she lived a more liberal Orthodox lifestyle than she claims, changes things. She actually had the kid while she was still married, and didn't leave until he was 7.   The real story sounds far more interesting!!

Shame she felt she had to craft a cookie cutter story to make her story more compelling to outsiders."
Unorthodox,"The show is called Shtisel, btw"
Unorthodox,I mean...they would say that...the point wasn‚Äôt to portray them in a good light...
Unorthodox,"Ruchami‚Äôs boyfriend was everything her father wasn‚Äôt, and she craved the sense of domestic normalcy missing from her home life."
Unorthodox,"That scene takes place during the holiday Passover (which lasts for eight days). Part of Jewish practice in general is maintaining a kosher (""clean"") kitchen. During most of the year this includes separating the meat and dairy etc. During Passover, however, this includes getting rid of all of the chametz (leavened bread). The aluminum foil is to ensure that no chametz from the rest of the year gets on their food/their food during Passover is clean. Some people will do a full spring cleaning for Passover but foil works too."
Unorthodox,"I believe they were fasting and she was feeling extra hungry because she was pregnant and the food was tempting her,  but she had to wait until the grandfather finished praying to eat."
Unorthodox,Have you seen Skam because if not your list won't be accurate.
Unorthodox,"I know I'm responding 3 months later but if you want something even more crazy than Tiger King, try Wild Wild Country."
Unorthodox,Insular*
Unorthodox,"Well sure, there's no shortage of scandals involving that community....but apparently the book is fiction. 

I think she feeds off really dated and unexposed beliefs about Hasidim too, and they're rightfully sensitive to that."
Unorthodox,"I mean, there‚Äôs that in Christian fundamentalist (big love) shows as well. Fundamental religious communities do not treat women well, and the protagonist in the show is a young woman. If the main character was an elderly patriarch in the society the tone likely would read different."
Unorthodox,"They talked a little about this in the ""how it's made"" portion after. They said that since the author was so well-known in communities surrounding this subject, she wanted to give Etsy a different life than her own. They wanted the discussion to be about the character, her story, and the Satmar community, not about the author. 

Because of this I get the sense that she weaved together a narrative from a lot of different experiences of people who left."
Unorthodox,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I was actually wondering about the aluminium foil. I read somewhere else that is to do with keeping the kitchen kosher."
Unorthodox,Of course I have lol. Top 3 teen drama!
Unorthodox,"Yeah, inclusive is literally the opposite haha"
Unorthodox,"Big Love went out of it's way to show them as real people, not caricatures to scorn. That's a great example of a show giving humanity to it's characters. You could argue too much.

I mean, if it's from the perspective of someone who is young and doesn't offer that, and the writers wanted to stay true to that, then it's not great source material."
Unorthodox,Would like to point out that Big Love was not based on Christian fundamentalists... it was based on Mormon fundamentalism.
Unorthodox,"I think it's also because the real person is problematic, and her stories didn't check out. Why else would they downplay the unique parts of her story and go with some generic cardboard cut out version of a person leaving a traditional community? 

I mean, what really happens here? She isn't happy, she has a mother that's left, she goes to find her, she makes some friends and finds herself drawn to an artistic outlet and gets an opportunity most do not, and during it all, her naive possibly autistic husband chases after her, finds her and gets rejected. In the big scheme of diabolical ""leaving the religion"" stories, nothing happens. The bit with the brother abducting her and the gun, is insane, and if it happened no doubt that was scarring, but then he ultimately walks away, he doesn't actually try to bring her back to NY."
Unorthodox,"I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúfundamentalist community‚Äù in Big Love which is out in the desert, which were basically the villains of the show, that the main characters escaped from. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community depicted in this show is an insular fundamentalist community the main character escape from."
Unorthodox,"No kidding, but aside from generically assuming all fundamentalists are the same, your comment has little value. Even among Hasidim there are different sects and traditions, and they feud. Some are more liberal while some oppose rock n' roll.  If there's no awareness or depth, then it's just saying ""boo religion"" or ""boo ultra orthodox Jews"", and that's boring unless you're predisposed to hating entire communities and want to feel validated in your hate."
Unorthodox,"Okay lol but the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal, they‚Äôre depicting a young girl being forced into marriage and forced into sex. 

So what are you trying to say in context of this argument. I‚Äôm not saying all religious communities are like this, but the specific story being told is of a community that is. So why should they treat that community with any reverence? If the acts they‚Äôre depicting in the show are brutal

And it‚Äôs not Jewish specific. A lot of fundamental communities of every religion, even the Amish, have groups that mistreat women and chalk it up to ‚Äúreligion‚Äù and it‚Äôs no excuse

I would harken back to ‚Äúbig love‚Äù - the community out in the desert in big love is not progressive, they force teen girls to marry the prophet, and are not treated kindly by the show at all. At the same time the main family in Big Love is shown empathy, even though they‚Äôre still a fundamentalist bigamist family, because they‚Äôre not doing inhumane things like the community out in the desert is. 

If this show was about a progressive Hasidic community that was treating young women kindly, why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

Should we just not tell the stories of women mistreated in fundamentalist communities for fear of sounding ‚Äúboo religion‚Äù? This goes for Amish, catholic, Mormon, Scientologist, Islam, Jewish, whatever."
Unorthodox,">the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,

Right, does the show bother to explain that?

Also, I'm not claiming to be familiar with her story, I'm reacting to just attempting to watch the show.. but she apparently really went to liberal Orthodox schools earlier in her life, so the depiction of the family isn't entirely accurate.

I see dramas about terrorists that deal with Islamic fundamentalism with more respect and depth.  I see more care with depictions of the Amish community (though improvements could be made for sure). The idea isn't to give reverence but to give characters depth, and that's what makes people interesting, and can influence societal change when it's eye opening.

As opposed to just gawking and demonizing. The fact that you're comparing this story to ""marrying the prophet"" cult like behavior from a group that splintered from the mainstream, is a problem. Big Love carefully explains who the group are and their stature with the more mainstream LDS church. It's a major plotline. 

\>why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

That's ridiculous. People leave religious families they're born into all the time.  I'm on her side with that (unless it's fiction, and a couple seconds on google suggests some of it was). And it's a common narrative in tv and film and theater. It's told all the time. But if you just have one dimensional stereotypical characters, you're not learning anything from that, it's not really exploring the predicament, it's just trying to expose bad people with an agenda against devout religiousness. In this case people think because they got a glimpse into homes they've never seen before, that's sufficient to make up for the lack of depth and humanity in the community it portrays. You can do that and still ultimately show people are wrong."
Unorthodox,"**People leave religious families all the time but they don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúescape‚Äù them as is shown in the show. Notice I said ‚Äúflee‚Äù not ‚Äúleave‚Äù. The story depicts an ‚Äúescape‚Äù not just someone turning their back on religion** 

And in regards to the memoir the show was based off of, if you asked me and my mom to recount an argument we had when I was a teen we would both give wildly conflicting stories. That doesn‚Äôt mean either of them are ‚Äúfiction‚Äù, it just means the people involved had different justifications and motivations to act the way they did. 

I believe the author that this is her side of the story, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs portrayed in the show. Her side, her perspective, her interpretation of how she felt. No one can spin that and say it‚Äôs ‚Äúfiction‚Äù unless you‚Äôre her.

It sounds like you just can‚Äôt handle any attack on a segment of Judaism, because my interpretation of it is that this community depicted in the show is very much a fragment of the larger Jewish community in Brooklyn, and they do not all engage in abhorrent behavior like forcing a young girl into sex slavery (aka, ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù), but for the people who are, their story is worthy of being told. 

It might not be ‚Äúmarrying the prophet‚Äù but it‚Äôs forcing young girls into reproductive slavery all the same through societal and financial pressure. These things are happening, in our country, and we have no obligation to give the people perpetrating them ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of character. 

**People using religion to keep women (and LGBT) down are the villains in today‚Äôs stories. So, it‚Äôs not an attack on religion, it‚Äôs an attack on the excuse and bastardization of religion.** 

In our post-post modern society religion has been torn down and disproven as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Catholic priests molest children. Female genital mutilation. Honor killings. Etc etc etc etc. But we‚Äôre still holding reverence for ‚Äúculture‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWomen in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for having pre-marital sex‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs their culture‚Äù

Or 

‚ÄúI had to have sex with the producer for this role‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how Hollywood is‚Äù 

**is no longer an excuse the public will permit**

Now, we‚Äôre dismantling tradition as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Just because your religion/community/ has customs and traditions to uphold, does not mean they will be permitted in the modern world. **Shame, and telling the story in a negative light, is one way of expressing the contempt for ‚Äútraditions‚Äù that do not fit into contemporary human rights and ethics, rather than glossing over violations because we feel it‚Äôs not our place to critique**

Side note: the show does not hold the orthodox community in distain for their differences; the way they dress, language spoken, or traditions. The elements of the show that put a negative light on the community are strictly the scenes that portray human rights violations."
Unorthodox,">>the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,
>
>Right, does the show bother to explain that?

You're right, the way they wrote the show I totally thought Esty was fleeing a liberal Hasidic sect üôÑ"
Unorthodox,"The movie literally has Yael explain the unique nature of the community. I know this was 12 days ago, but coming into this discussion from the outside, it seems like you are gathering evidence to support your conclusions."
Unorthodox,One of the most beautiful posts I've read in a long time. Spot on.
Unorthodox,Well said!!
Unorthodox,"You don't have to flee an orthodox Jewish family. 

Leaving any family, for any reason involving lack of acceptance, is difficult.  It's a story. If you can't handle a real life complicated depiction of these communities because you just want to bash people, then that's boring.

There is no perspective that can account for a fictional story. 

Her mom was easy to locate and didn't leave when she was a toddler, for example. 

Calling aranged marriage ""sex slavery"" is an extremist viewpoint, in my opinion. Totally dogmatic. Arranged marriages are still fairly accepted in some communities. I've known Indians, and Arabs who accepted their parents arrangements and as horrifying as it sounds at face value, they're happy. Sex slavery is a real thing, please dont' make light of it to feel better about the Netflix show you liked.

Look, some Satmars are nuts, but this isn't a story about one of those victims of nuttery. It's not sexual reproductive slavery or whatever dogmatic bullshit opinion you came to the show pre-formed. And cut the crap, you do care about their traditions which you just called human rights violations. You are Othering these people. It's a step away from claiming they fuck through a hole in a sheet. There are plenty of bad things you can say about Satmars, or any fundamental religious folks of any stripe, but again, in 2020, show they're humanity and stop the caricatures that re-affirm horrible stereotypes, and stop pretending you just watched a show that justified your jackassery biases."
Unorthodox,"She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood, went to Sarah Lawrence, and stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show."
Unorthodox,My conclusion is the show had an underlying disdain for the community that was hard to watch.... to which people defended it by expressing their disdain for the community. Just stop.
Unorthodox,"**It becomes sex slavery, and a human rights violation, when you do not give a woman the means to support herself outside of her reproductive capabilities, and only give the path of being a wife. Which is what is depicted. Raising a child from birth for the sole purpose of them becoming a wife and mother. The women are not even allowed to play musical instruments for fun in the strict rules of the community.**

The avenues allowed to them are to be a wife, or as in the show, run away and be ostracized from their community. Which leads to the ‚Äúleaving/fleeing/whatever‚Äù people being homeless, since they have no real world skills or means outside of their insular community, also depicted in the show. 

**That‚Äôs different than an arranged marriage, which i never said was a bad thing or a human rights violation**

Not giving women the option to choose their path in life, and raising them from birth with one end-goal (wife/mother) is a human rights violation, and raising them with the purpose of them being a reproductive servant. I.e. sex slave. So no, it‚Äôs not a reach.

**And it‚Äôs not ‚Äújackassery bias‚Äù. If a new cult was raising girls for the sole purpose of becoming a bride, raising them from birth, and forbidding them to learn skill or a trade that would be bona fide sex slavery. Just because this is a sect of Orthodox Judaism doesn‚Äôt change that. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying contemporary society will not tolerate ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs our tradition‚Äù, if it‚Äôs not ethical in the modern world it is not ethical in your old-fashioned society.**"
Unorthodox,An arranged marriage can be a form of sex slavery for someone who is pressured into it and someone who doesn't want it. I'm not saying that all arranged marriages are like that.
Unorthodox,">She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood... stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

This is something you used as an example of liberalism üò¨

>The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show.

I think Hasidic Judaism is a fairly problematic worldview, yes. I am aware some sects are more or less problematic than others, but they're all problematic to some degree. Note I didn't say all Judaism is problematic, I said **Hasidic** Judaism is problematic, in the way I believe all fundamentalist religion (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) is problematic. 

Are you saying no Hasidic Jewish sects whatsoever reflect the depiction? None at all? Because that's really the only way your argument has validity. Otherwise, it's actually showing what some Hasidic women live through, and that's a story worth telling even if it isn't Deborah Feldman specific story."
Unorthodox,"Criticism isn't disdain and you've clearly got some personal issues regarding the ability to rationalize differing opinions. I know exactly what happened, I just read through it all. You're wrong."
Unorthodox,"You told me you think I didn't respond well to the show because it involved Jews.... which is unintentionally your admission you liked it because it's critical of devout Jews. Too late.

You're not describing ""slavery"" or describing what goes on in Orthodox communities in New York.

It's fine that some of you liked this show, but not fine that in defending it,  you reveal really bigoted presumptions that this show just validated for you."
Unorthodox,"She agrees to the marriage and thinks it's what she wants.  Sure arranged marriage can be forced, but that's not what is depicted. She lived in New York, she always had the choice to lead her own life, which is what she did."
Unorthodox,"No, it's something this dumb ass series used as an example of her shedding her traditions for a liberal secular life. 

I doubt you know much about Hasidim and that's the problem here. What's really being depicted there that's so outrageous or unique to any Hasidic sect?  I hate all the Jewish characters in the show, including her. You don't have the first clue what they live through, because you projected it, nothing horrible happens in that film that's real or is commonplace. You can't possible think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction or have a brother in law pull out a gun. 

You can't defend this show by saying there are Hasidic stories worth telling...sure, but I'm criticizing this one."
Unorthodox,"Disdain is disdain. The series is presenting harmless everyday observances as if they're oppression. The Redditor I was conversing with took it farther. There's a point where criticism isn't an opinion and treads into bigotry.
You jumped into this because you sympathize with hating Hasidim apparently, and that's wrong. You're a clown."
Unorthodox,"Lol... I said that because when i compared it to other fundamentalist religious representations (big love) you acted like Orthodox Jews were supposed to be exempt. 

So girls in orthodox communities aren‚Äôt raised to be brides and mothers? Oh my mistake then. I live in Brooklyn, i don‚Äôt see any orthodox women having a job or running a trade. 

But I guess that‚Äôs just not ‚Äúbased in reality‚Äù and it‚Äôs all ‚Äúmy bias‚Äù 

**i‚Äôm against any fundamentalist community; Amish, Mormon, Jewish, that raises girls to be mothers with no other avenues. Or raises men to be fathers and tells them being gay is god‚Äôs mistake**

This is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about, you cannot claim people are being ‚Äúbiased against a culture‚Äù when they point out human rights violations within that culture. Something which is unethical is unethical even when cloaked in religion. 

Maybe the VAST majority of orthodox communities empower their young women, but you cannot negate the small percentage of those who are suffering.

And just to say it louder 

In case you didn‚Äôt hear 

**raising girls explicitly to be wives and mothers is a form of sex and reproductive slavery. If a community is guilty of that, i don‚Äôt give a fuck what religion they practice.**"
Unorthodox,"Just flipped through your recent comments, all you‚Äôre doing is calling people biased against Jews for watching this show on a bunch of different threads, weirdo - when you didn‚Äôt even watch it yourself ? Wtf is your problem the character are less ‚Äúone dimensional‚Äù if you watch more than 10 minutes"
Unorthodox,"I don't think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction, neither do I think many of them pull out guns. I never thought this and no one here believe the show is making these insane blanket statements except you.

It's clear you are projecting because you are making blanket statements about all viewers based on what you're worried they think.

You like blanket statements so you think everyone else does as well.

Projection."
Unorthodox,I'm jumped in because you're psycho
Unorthodox,"None of your rant is in the show. None of it.

No small portion of the show featured the Hasidic sects rituals...criticism of their beliefs to the point of ridicule beyond what the show is depicting is pretty blatant of you. 

Who the hell thinks Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust? Piss off."
Unorthodox,"I've since watched the series. The fact that it set people full of vitriol like yourself off on hate rants speaks volumes. 

The Jewish characters are all unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated.....and it's supposed to be representative of a Jewish community? If that's normal to you its because ...well, you already went on a bigoted rant."
Unorthodox,"Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

You forget what you already admitted earlier in this thread."
Unorthodox,"What's psycho is getting upset that some Jews grow their sideburns out. Which is really what that person used as an example of xenophobia.

You jumped in because you dislike some Jews."
Unorthodox,"**how can you say that none of my rant is in the show when the central problem in the show is hte main character was raised to be a wife and mother, and doesn‚Äôt know how to support herself outside of her community? That‚Äôs the whole show. Her trying to get a scholarship because she has no real-world skills and no money. That‚Äôs the WHOLE plot**

No one said ‚Äúall‚Äù ultra-orthodox have this experience, but if this is this person‚Äôs story who are you to tell them it‚Äôs problematic/false? 

Many fundy communities fall into the same trap of womb worship. If that‚Äôs not YOUR experience in them, then good for you, but you cannot say others share your experience.  

And i think it‚Äôs you who can ‚Äúpiss off‚Äù. Have fun setting women back 200 years with your pathetic blindness

If you‚Äôre fundy and you like it then good for fucking you, but maybe it hasn‚Äôt been so kind to others."
Unorthodox,"The main character is jewish and she doesn‚Äôt seem unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated."
Unorthodox,People disagreeing with your faulty assessment isn't a hate rant. Stop.
Unorthodox,">Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

I never said any of this. You must have me confused with someone else."
Unorthodox,"That doesn't equate ""reproductive slavery"". 

They're a strict religious community so there's lots to be critical of, especially if you dislike religious practices, but the darker more horrific story you describe isn't in the show. You projected your hate on to this community.

Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

Putting pressure on someone to consummate a marriage after a year, or to have a family with kids?.....It's obnoxious but it's not slavery. 

It's also fraud. The real girl went to Sarah Lawrence while observant, and became a writer. 

Hasidim exist in New York outside of their communities, and they work, drive, and have independence, and they can do that within their communities or out. The disadvantages of joining secular culture are not unique, and can't be equated to brutality. 

Nothing happened to this girl that girls haven't felt in the secular world either. Again, the sway the show depicts these people just validated hatred you already had."
Unorthodox,"There's nothing sympathetic about a girl who shows up to a top music program and insults them like she can just audition for piano. 

Or invites herself places.

Or who doesn't know what ham looks like, and eats anything put in front of her then panics....or educated about someone who hasn't seen Google (the entire purpose of that scene).

It goes on and on. That character couldn't be more ridiculous."
Unorthodox,"People outraged that some Jews don't cut their sideburns, and observe Passover by wrapping food in tinfoils isn't a hate rant.  Then you share their hate."
Unorthodox,Then why defend the show? Why are you elsewhere in the thread challenging a self defined Orthodox Jew to tell you what was inaccurate about the show?
Unorthodox,"
>Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

The fact you think any criticism of Hasidic Jews equates to what you stated above  is tiresome and unfortunately not at all shocking not shocking."
Unorthodox,God you sound like such an insufferable cunt.
Unorthodox,I'm Jewish jackass. Lmfao
Unorthodox,"The only other person I've discussed the topic with on reddit is not a ""self defined Orthodox Jew"", they said they're ""familiar with the Hasidic world"". All I did was tell him something to the effect of ""saying it's inaccurate is useless unless you give us examples of WHY you think it's inaccurate"". And I'll take this opportunity to say the same to you. What specifically is factually inaccurate?"
Unorthodox,"What's tiresome is that you think this series depicts every Ultra Orthodox Jew, because what else did it show? Don't invent shit that's not in the show itself to justify your thirst. 

I don't think any criticism of Hasidim is a problem, there's a lot to criticize, it's unfortunately YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, as depicted with this one dysfunctional family.  You decided its representative... because you have a disdain for those Jews."
Unorthodox,You sound insecure on the internet.
Unorthodox,Thank you.
Unorthodox,"Are you saying there aren't Jews who hate other Jews or Jews that are different than them, or more observant and it make it okay to express hate?  Take a hike."
Unorthodox,"You don't even know what you're reading. They literally said ""I grew up ultra-Orthodox"".

I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced your antisemitic ass that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  The fact is the author the story is based on was able to get an education and stopped wearing her wig while still living in Brooklyn.  You're clueless."
Unorthodox,"For someone who looks down your nose at others for allegedly making assumptions, you sure make a lot of your own.

>YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, 

When the fuck did I say that? That's not what I think. You have a chip on your shoulder."
Unorthodox,"Yikes, if you find yourself wondering why you can't maintain a healthy relationship, I have identified some factors"
Unorthodox,"You can't even detail what you think you saw that was oppressive and represents the community as a whole, because you know it would paint you as bigoted.

Yet you're in this thread chastising anyone that doesn't think this is an accurate depiction at all. Take a hike. The reason you're passionate about this at all is because you have the chip you didn't even realize you had until now, and you got called out for it. Feels bad for you I'm sure."
Unorthodox,"If you find yourself trying to psychoanalyze strangers on Reddit when they point out the shortcomings of your bigoted posts...you might just get a mirror and write ""sociopath"" and ""hateful"" on it."
Unorthodox,"No, pretty much only you and probably not much longer. 

Hasidic Judaism is fundamentalist religion. Sexist roles, xenophobia, ""my-group-is-better-than-everyone-else"" mentality backed by the word of God, virtue signaling taking precedence over actual virtue (not cutting your hair = virtue signal. Covering kitchen surfaces in foil to prevent yeast from contaminating Passover seder = virtue signal), insular bubble...

I'm not saying every single Hasidic Jew is like this, but some/many are."
Unorthodox,"You clearly know zero about Hasidim and couldn't site examples shown in the show.

You just rattled off a lot of assumptions that aren't in this series. 

And no, claiming you're an equal opportunist hater doesn't help.

I take it back saying you're a bigot was putting it nicely. You're worse."
Unorthodox,"Is [the official web site of a Hasidic sect](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/374918/jewish/Aluminum-Foil.htm) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? The same site also talks about [men not cutting the corners of their hair](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2963669/jewish/Why-Do-Some-Chassidic-Jews-Have-Long-Sidelocks-Peyot.htm). 

Is [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5212069) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? 

Virtue signals are negative things because they tend to serve as a substitute for virtue.

If I'm factually wrong, tell me what I'm missing rather than namecalling me."
Unorthodox,"Holy crap, you're a Grade A bigot. You just used examples religious Jews observing their holiday by avoiding bread or hiding it under tin foil as an example of oppression and justifying your hate mongering. Those are harmless customs you are depicting as proof they're bad people.
Men choosing not to cut the corners of their hair is an example of oppression to you?  

You're an idiot, I'm not going to bother pretending you're coming to this from a reasonable place and neither should you. 

It's not ""virtue signaling"" you just used Passover against Jews."
Unorthodox,"You're still just namecalling and getting angry at me for saying things you don't agree with, you're not giving me an example of what I'm saying that's incorrect you're kind of just angrily saying ""nuh-uh"". 

You're also not talking about the same thing I am, and you are putting words in my mouth.

**Religious groups, especially fundamentalist ones, have virtue signals. Displaying the virtue signals does not make anyone a bad person. I never said that because I don't believe that. I think virtue signals are problematic, that does not mean I think people who use them are bad.**

I'm not talking about hiding bread under foil or avoiding bread. I'm talking about [this](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1745/jewish/Preparing-the-Kitchen.htm). It's not hurting anyone per se, but thinking God cares about such minutiae is genuinely sad to me and seems pretty unhealthy.

The whole point of the first Passover meal is that the Jews in Egypt had no time to prepare. They were in such a hurry they ate unleavened bread and drank unfermented wine.

This level of intricate, time-consuming preparation performed by many Hasidic Jews is quite the opposite of the original Passover described in the Torah. Passover was a hastily prepared meal in advance of an impending visit from an angel of death. The Jews in Egypt weren't covering kitchen surfaces and heavily scrubbing pots and ovens, they were throwing together a meal as quickly as humanly possible."
Unorthodox,"That's a lot of minutia for clueless bigot. Now you're gatekeeping and saying one group of Jews in their diaspora don't practice correctly? You're a fricken Rabbi now? Get a life. It took me two seconds on google to see that preparing for Passover by removing, burning or temporarily hiding leavened bread is part of their custom. You hate some Jews, you're not smart, and you're actually critical of their religious observance as Jews, which makes you antisemitic."
Unorthodox,">I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced [you] that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  

Remember how I never said that and don't believe that? The show never said that either. 

>clueless

>bigot. 

>Get a life. 

>not smart, 

>antisemitic

That's a strong argument you've got there. Have a good one. Sorry you're so angry."
Unorthodox,"The problem is you're making bigoted lifeless, idiotic, clueless and antisemitic ""arguments"" and you're upset at the response you're getting.

Really...what kind of person gets upset that Jews hide their bread for a week in the privacy of their own homes and uses that as an example of xenophobia, or oppression?"

Unorthodox,Terrific show with fantastic performances. One of the best miniseries I have watched in recent times.
Unorthodox,Amazing show. Emotional watch.
Unorthodox,[deleted]
Unorthodox,"I really loved this one, so well done and such a fascinating look into a community I'd never even heard of before."
Unorthodox,Amazing show. So good. Watch it.
Unorthodox,A well done mini series about the escape from religious extremism. A lot of her struggles after the escape could have been prevented if she went to her mother right away or called her beforehand. This nearly felt like a trope. In Berlin the location switches between scenes sometimes didn‚Äôt make sense but overall the acting was great and the cinematography was appealing. One of the best aspects were the conversations in Yiddish. Very interesting from a linguistic perspective.
Unorthodox,good show but then I read about it and the Berlin part was not true.
Unorthodox,"The bad things that happen in that show within the hasidic community sadly happen in all walks of life, including mainstream society. I really enjoyed the show and empathised completely with Esty. The demonisation of another alternative lifestyle is a bit hard to swallow though. The west is presented as a utopia for her to escape to, which we know it isn't. Second series shows her struggling to acclimatise to mainstream society, divided communities, money problems, housing problems, isolation, poverty, drugs, prostitution, AIDS, politicians that you can't believe in..."
Unorthodox,It's a big no-no to go after the Jewish community
Unorthodox,"How did you, or it seems your parents made the choice, remove yourself from the community?"
Unorthodox,[deleted]
Unorthodox,Watch Shtisel on Netflix for a different view of this community.
Unorthodox,"Wait, you mean not everyone shows up to Berlin and within 48 hours has become BFF with a group of diverse, cosmopolitan, and beautiful 20-somethings?  
  
But yeah, aside from that show was good."
Freud,That one woman does her best Eva Green impression from Penny Dreadful.

Freud,This does not look great... will give it a go but ye.
Freud,also the lead looks like older brother from haunting hill house
Freud,"Yes, this appears to be a spinoff of Penny Dreadful."
Freud,Solving crimes is tight
Freud,Reminds me of that John Cusack movie where Edgar Allan Poe was trying to stop a serial killer who was using Poe's stories as a template for his crimes.
Freud,Reminds me of 'The Alienist'
Freud,I‚Äôm hoping that all those weird or graphic looking scenes are actually just dreams! And that speech during the trailer is actually him referring to dreams.
Freud,"Like, how did CBS pass on a procedural?"
Freud,They made a 19th century crime solving tv show about Sir Joseph Bell and and a young Arthur Conan Doyle.
Freud,SOOO CRATES
Freud,FRUDE DUDE!
Freud,A team up with Noah's wife!
Freud,Oh grandma
Freud,"*Bold words for someone who probably wants to have sex with their mother* - Freud, probably"
Freud,"He had some good theories and bad theories. One good theory was that sexual abuse of children has long lasting negative effects. One bad theory was that EVERYONE craves attention from one parent and resents the other parent for taking some of that attention. What he wasn't was a psychologist, he never used the scientific method to support any of his claims. What's really bad is how sensationalist claims are still taken seriously by some people."
Freud,"Anyone can read up on Freud if they want. Freud's theories were still covered in my high school's psychology classes. You can't deny the influence he had on the field, he practically created it.

Are you really arguing we should stop creating TV shows about famous and influential historical figures just because somebody might find out about them and buy into their theories?"
Freud,"That's kind of the funny thing with Freud. If you're generous and you read his statements in a more metaphorical interpretation you can kind of go ""oh, ok, obviously he isn't being literal"", but the problem is Freud constantly clarified ""no! I'm being literal! Everyone wants to fuck their actual mother!"""
Freud,"If you read up on Freud the vast vast majority of articles and books on him preface their info with the point that Freud has now been found to be wrong for a number of reasons. Very few people will read up about Freud and come away with the conclusion that he is wholly correct. Infact I think people will be much more likely to reject him and his theories if they read up about him, as opposed to the few snippets many know through pop culture (namely Oedipus and to a lesser extent the Electra complex).

I also think it's pretty over the top to describe a show about Freud as potentially damaging because it could lead to some people taking Freud too seriously. While incredibly flawed and overtly sexualised Freud's theories are not a set of dangerous ideologies that would have a serious impact if someone was to take them on wholly. It's not Nazism and there are plenty of shows about Nazism."
Freud,"What are your thoughts on La√ßan, ≈Ωi≈æek, and Todd McGowan?"
Freud,Lmaoooo
Freud,"But look at the actor's cheekbones! He's so dreaming, he can peddle histeria rhetoric all night <3

Freud,I don't think so. He had his shirt on and wasn't flexing.
Freud,no i think it's based on his brother Jimmy Freud

Freud,"""Fuck their mother, huh? And I understand you also have another theory called projection, in which people take their own unsavory qualities and ascribe them to other people.""

Freud: ""Yes, what about it?"""
Freud,"well, if he had access to the recent porn trends, i think he would feel vindicated to say the least..."
Freud,"Lacan is an unscientific witch doctor (as opposed to the scientific kind), and Zizek is literally a raccoon stuffed with hot dogs, you fool. It's been scientifically proven, *by science*, that only a charlatan reads stuff before wildly mischaracterizing it, because science is what's true whether you believe it or not, and I don't need to read anything to know that's science."
Freud,Must be one of the Sackville-Armstrong.
Freud,Can‚Äôt tell if joking
Freud,"No, definitely not. He is trying too hard, or maybe it's just that retarded sound mix."
Freud,"I don‚Äôt disagree with you necessarily, but it‚Äôs likely that you are being down voted for the tone of your post. Good points but maybe a bit more palatable presentation"
Freud,">Oh, so then it's a historical psychology class? Because Freud's theories are nearly universally rejected now.

Except in a lot of feminist/gender theories. So hysterical idiots already have a ""academical"" foundation and validation to accept his moronic theories anyways."
Freud,"Right! Like wtf is going on! It's not even milf stuff, it's like 21 year olds acting like ""oh god, I cant believe my forty year old son is so hot""."
Freud,"When you tell people about ≈Ωi≈æek like that, you run the risk of them reading him and thinking for themselves. 

We can‚Äôt have that."
Freud,[deleted]
Freud,"I‚Äôm not arguing that his use of a straw man is justified, and I have no idea why you think I‚Äôm defending the comment above above yours. That posters rhetoric isn‚Äôt great, his only evidence is anecdotal. However you don‚Äôt provide any evidence as to why he wrong you just say that his view has already been disproven. It isn‚Äôt necessary to provide sources for things that are common knowledge, and in the world of psychology it is 100% common knowledge that Freud has been disproven. But for most people this isn‚Äôt common knowledge and they aren‚Äôt likely to disregard arguments that don‚Äôt include any documental or even anicdotal evidence. Im not sure what point you were trying to make in with ‚Äòidiots‚Äô and the acceptance of Freud‚Äôs theories

Idk, I agree with you‚Äôre point overall. I just think it‚Äôs easier to spread the word with better rhetoric"
Freud,"You're just an asshole, and no one likes dealing with assholes."
Freud,"""His mother did it! No? He did it to please his mother! No? Fine, the guy with the bloody knife did it...because of his mother...?"""

J-Style Trip,"Probably not the same tone or era, but Anne with an e is pretty good."
J-Style Trip,Thanks for the list but your taste is wayyyyyy off from the type of teen dramas I like
J-Style Trip,Me & my fam likes [Atypical](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=ATYPICAL&jbv=80117540&jbp=0&jbr=0) which is a comedy with angsty moments.

How horrible do you have to be to post a list like this on /television?

^(I might finally watch Skins. Not my typical kind of show. Haven't considered watching it since I worked at Blockbuster.)"
J-Style Trip,why everyone ignore sex education
J-Style Trip,Yes. 100%. Absolutely. Best tv series of all time. A must-watch for everyone who loves supernatural romance teen dramas.
J-Style Trip,"> while Sounds can be great, it is only the first generation that actually is.

I assume you mean Skins?? Loud and wrong. 2nd Gen > 1s Gen, at least for me. I've seen a few persons who've prefered the 3rd. The whole thing is great. Each gen is like a different TV show. They're similar of course but at the same time unique in their own different ways. 

> My So Called Life, I am Not Okay With This, Sex Education

I considered them all. If the list was Top 20 they'd definately be there, along with Veronica Mars.

Never seen Buffy but I kinda get the impression it's a supernatural series with teen drama elements as opposed to being a teen-drama at heart."
J-Style Trip,exactly!!! I just finished rewatching and it's definitely I'm the same league as skins and skam. three of these are quite possibly the best in their genre. like ever. I'm so passionate about this trust me
J-Style Trip,"Degrassi was the shit


I watched pretty much the whole thing on youtube a few months qgo, from junior high to season 10 of next generation. A lot of it was bad, but i enjoyed the majority of it"

why, what did i do? üò∂üòï"
J-Style Trip,Oh no Buffy is absolutely a teen drama. All of the supernatural and horror elements work to service the teen drama stories in some way or another. I implore you to watch it OP.
J-Style Trip,lol elite makes the list but not sex education. Elite season 1 was good but damn it got chessy so fast.
J-Style Trip,Just stop after the first generation
J-Style Trip,Just trying to help you avoid crucifixion with some sarcasm. :)
J-Style Trip,"Naw, Buffy is definitely a supernatural series first and foremost."
J-Style Trip,can't. too long. don't have the time.
J-Style Trip,Elite season 2 is far better than season 1. Sex Education is also very cheesy. √âlite is a soap.
J-Style Trip,The second gen is good too. The third is not
J-Style Trip,We can agree to disagree on that one.

J-Style Trip,"Ha, this is reddit, sir.  We need to disagree viciously!

Anyways,  I'd say only the first three seasons have a concentration on coming of age stories and even then many of the stories don't really map well to that experience (for example, most of Angel's season 2 arc)"
J-Style Trip,"Bahahahahahahaha üòÇüòÇ

I guess I do see where you‚Äôre coming from - but the arc where Angel/Buffy sleep together and all of a sudden he‚Äôs uninterested and also literally evil....sounds like every boy I dated in high school."

I think the seed of the idea is applicable but the actual specifics don't track well.  I.E.  needing to kill you're murderous boyfriend or having your gypsy friend research cures."
J-Style Trip,"lmao no it‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs quirky.

Okay yeah no I get that!! I should add that I haven‚Äôt rewatched it in full for a little while so I‚Äôm arguing based off memory and my brain thing is more like a bowl of spaghetti hoops at this point than a functioning organ but I guess the show was more fluid than I remember!!"
Hillary,"The thing is that SNL has always been super hit and miss over the years, people just like to fondly remember the years that *they* loved it. I was watching full episodes of mid 2000‚Äôs SNL a while back and there are some great sketches and some total shit stinkers just like there are today."
Hillary,"Did it kill SNL?  No.  

Was it funny?  Also no."
Hillary,Rob Schneider is a stapler.
Hillary,"And if somebody knows about how to stay relevant and bankable, it‚Äôs Rob Schneider."
Hillary,"What has saved SNL is Youtube, IMO. I wouldn't watch a full hour run of SNL if you paid me, but I have downloaded a few clips a year that get some buzz. I doubt NBC makes much money off me doing that though.

But in the age of the internet, no way I'm watching 1 hour of SNL, which typically consists of 1 really good sketch, a couple more good ones, and the rest are average to poor. Broken up by tons of commercials and a music act that there is a 90% chance I don't care about."
Hillary,I saw a clip of him on the bill maher podcast talking about how patton oswalt hates him lol
Hillary,I trust comedy advice from Friend #5 in every Adam Sandler movie as much as I trust medical advice from Dr. Oz.
Hillary,"It was overdramatic, but it by no means killed SNL. They get plenty of Youtube views, and all the cast members show up in movies and commercial deals. The show is doing fine.

Should the show end with Season 50 and Lorne retiring? Maybe. Or give the show to Kenan."
Hillary,"Because ""Copy Guy"" was peak SNL."
Hillary,"If Rob Schneider didn‚Äôt kill it, this certainly won‚Äôt."
Hillary,"I personally thought that cold opener was a bit overdramatic but the show has been fine.  The idea that segment ""killed"" SNL is just as overdramatic."
Hillary,Says the guy whose entire career has been riding the coattails of a successful SNL breakout star
Hillary,Rob Schneider derp-de-derp!
Hillary,"Hey maybe no one should act like that show is some sacred cow.  It‚Äôs been watchable for like ten of the 50 seasons it‚Äôs been on.  

Rob Schneider makes his whole living piggybacking off of people way more talented than he is"
Hillary,"Weird, it looks like to me that they have had several seasons since then"
Hillary,"He was recently on Bill Maher‚Äôs Podcast ‚ÄòClub Random‚Äô. I had heard Schneider was very Republican, and knowing Maher is political I thought I‚Äôd tune in to see. I have to say Schneider has the worst takes on politics I‚Äôve ever heard. The dude is a great example of someone who believes they know everything because they read something on the internet, but when pushed to supply more information or presented with facts their beliefs backtrack and fall apart instantly. He has no idea what he is talking about, and an absolute idiot. Any ‚Äòtakes‚Äô he gives should never be published because because anyone who reads them becomes dumber."
Hillary,As cringe as some of the stuff SNL does it is really hard to kill the show. It's quality is cyclical and it is an ever changing show that is an cultural touchpoint. SNL isn't dead because they did some cringe political stuff. Schneider is a right wing nutbag who was a one note joke at his peak.
Hillary,"If anyone knows comedy, it's Rob Schneider"
Hillary,"Breaking News: cast member from over 20 years ago,who's own career ended over 10 years ago claims show that's over 45 years old is dead due to political message that's different than his. More at 11."
Hillary,He's wrong SNL sucked way before that
Hillary,"You know what's not coming back?

Schneider 's career."
Hillary,"It was very weird and kind of made me cringe


But sit the fuck down ROB SCHNEIDER lmao"
Hillary,Failed actor and needer of Adam Sandler handouts has opinions to please right wing host.
Hillary,I wish I could tell Adam Sandler this about Rob Schneider's career. He keeps trying to bring it back and it's not coming back.
Hillary,Rob Schneider is a carrot! Rated PG-13
Hillary,"I mean, there is a point in that ""where's the punchline?""

I think a lot of people pretend to be funny by just stating their political case, or giving a political presentation to an audience clamoring for self-affirmation of their beliefs. And just because people applause, doesn't mean it's real comedy. Perhaps Tragedy."
Hillary,"When was the last time Schneider was funny?

He seems to only be doing low grade B movies and whatever Sandler can shove him in."
Hillary,Yeeahh like I'm going to click on an article where Rob Schneider explains to me what is funny and what isn't. Concrete Hard pass.
Hillary,I mean if anyone can identify the death of a career in showbiz it‚Äôs Rob Schneider
Hillary,"He has a point about late night talk shows, barring Conan, being at their absolute laziest and hackiest by milking Trump jokes nonstop for like 5 years to the point where one of Kimmel's head writers actually quit because she wasn't given much wiggle room for writing.

I would also agree that SNL suffered a similar scenario. There was no point to tuning in for the cold open because it was always Baldwin's awful Trump impersonation that got old like a day after he started doing it. 

However Rob isn't exactly in a position to be throwing stones. I'm pretty sure he's said this before when weighing on Darrell Hammond not being hired back as Trump. He's lucky that Adam Sandler still wants him as part of his entourage so he can get some of that Netflix money."
Hillary,"The only good thing to come out of Rob Schneider in the last 30 years is his daughter.

I unironically love Elle King's music.

Outside of that, he should probably just stick to tagging along with Adam Sandler."
Hillary,‚ÄúMaking copies‚Äù dude you weren‚Äôt that good
Hillary,Rob Schneider knows a thing or 2 about dead careers
Hillary,He‚Äôs not wrong about how cringy that was but saying it killed snl is a big stretch. Plus if public cringe is a crime Rob Schneider should have been locked up years ago
Hillary,Rob Schneider's standup specials killed comedy and laughter and it's not going to come back.
Hillary,Pretty sure it died during the eighth ‚ÄúMaking-Copies Guy‚Äù skit.
Hillary,Who is Rob Schneider and why does he look like his cat just passed away?
Hillary,Why is a Stapler talking?
Hillary,I guess he would know about when things fade from popularity. What was his last major role again?
Hillary,I read some blind item about how one of the former castmates had become a big time Trump supporter and was annoying all of the other SNL community with his Trump obsession. Maybe it was Rob Schneider.
Hillary,"Da derpa de derpa, da teedly derpy derpy dumb."
Hillary,"He was once on a talk show with Adam Sandler and got pissy that the host wasn‚Äôt talking to him enough. He made a comment on stage that he might as well have been in the audience.

That dude is a piss bag"
Hillary,"Because when I need deep insight on the entertainment industry and politics, Rob Schneider is always the first guy I think of"
Hillary,Is he the guy who hires immigrants in home depot to choke him in the shower?
Hillary,Who the hell cares what Deuce Bigalow said on a Glenn Beck podcast??
Hillary,"Good lord, the guy that made a career off of being Adam sandler's less funny friend is trying to be the arbiter of what belongs on SNL? This is peak cringe, should have just kept his mouth shut"
Hillary,Says the least funny man in comedy.
Hillary,"Rob Schneider is a dipshit. I agree it was a bad, weird choice. I think it soured the episode. But just *that* episode. SNL will always have different writers and performers as long as it continues, some seasons will be weaker and some will be stronger, and even then that's subjective opinion. Even within episodes there are sketches I think are great right next to ones I think are lame.

Also telling that he choose this moment as the low point,  and not having Trump on as a guest, which was almost as bad as the Jimmy Fallon hair-tussel. 

SNL constantly changes, to say it's 'not coming back' is dumb as hell. Does he think we're all anxiously waiting the comeback of ""MAKING COFFEEEE"". yeah, no."
Hillary,"So, a guy who was [a loud and proud Republican](https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/celebrities/2022/08/31/630ed76d22601d6b7c8b45ae.html) didn‚Äôt like when a show he was no longer a part of did a skit he didn‚Äôt like? And because he couldn‚Äôt see the humor in it half-a-decade ago when it happened that must mean the show is dead?

What a twatwaffle."
Hillary,"Rob Schneider critiquing comedy is like my fat ass criticizing Christ Hemsworth for not being ripped enough in his movies. His shows have always been terribly unfunny, almost like he finds something funny and does the opposite.  He claim to fame are his stupid taglines from Adam Sandler movies."
Hillary,The least funny cast member of SNL says what??
Hillary,"‚ÄúSNL is dead and it won‚Äôt come back,‚Äù says the guy with the career that‚Äôs dead and won‚Äôt come back."
Hillary,That may be. Only time will tell. But we also know that Rob Schneider is definitely not coming back.
Hillary,I like how they‚Äôre pushing the idea that we should care what Rob Schneider has to say about things‚Ä¶.ü§£ you mean I need to care about Deuce Bigelow‚Äôs opinion on matters??? Cmon
Hillary,Neither is Rob Schneider. No matter how many of his hot ‚Äúhot takes‚Äù he vomits onto a stage where no one is waiting.
Hillary,If the media thinks Anybody gives a leftward fuck about what Rob Schneider thinks then we can just disband the whole thing and shut it down
Hillary,Old guy predicts SNL's demise because he got old. Never heard that one before.
Hillary,"The man knows comedy. Duce Bigalow, that time he turned into a carrot, that time he said ‚Äúyou can do it‚Äù, or ‚Äúmaking copies‚Äù. If only Kate McKinnon had said ‚Äúyou can put your weed in it‚Äù at the end of the sketch. SNL will never recover from one sketch without a joke."
Hillary,Rob Schneider? I think I remember him from a long time ago...
Hillary,From the ‚Äúyou can do it‚Äù guy.
Hillary,The guy who just said ‚ÄúMakin copies‚Äù is blaming someone else for killing SNL?
Hillary,Yeah because poop humor and ‚Äúyou can do it!‚Äù Cameos are the pinnacle of comedy lol
Hillary,"Rob is just die hard trumper, politics are only an issue for him when it's the opposition."
Hillary,Since when do we care about Robs opinion? lol Adam Sandlers puppet
Hillary,What a tool.
Hillary,Was Rob Schneider ever funny?
Hillary,Pretty sure this is code for Lorne won‚Äôt let me visit anymore.
Hillary,I can‚Äôt remember the last time Rob Schneider was funny. So.
Hillary,People have always said this SNL season is the worst.
Hillary,And why do we keep seeing this 'story' and why do we care what Rob Schneider has to say...?
Hillary,It‚Äôs all about talent.  They‚Äôve lacked superstar talent for years now.  Rob Schneider has jumped off the deep end - but he‚Äôs right about that sketch.
Hillary,"I mean Leonard Cohen had JUST died. 

So I get it. 

Was it funny? Shit no bro but how many skits are?"
Hillary,"Wait, we're listening to Rob Schneider now?"
Hillary,Shut up Rob
Hillary,"Yea, let‚Äôs all listen to the opinion of the man who‚Äôs entire career has been sucking Sandlers dick."
Hillary,"Rob Schneider is a talentless hack who had the great fortune to be cast on the show when there were SO many other talented performers to carry him.  Once he was on his own, his films universally sucked.  He has no idea what makes SNL good, or bad.  He has no idea what ""funny"" is and he says a LOT of stupid shit.  There's zero reason to care what he thinks about anything really, but certainly about comedy."
Hillary,Why does anyone care what Schneider has to say?
Hillary,Rob Schneider being Rob Schneider in movies killed Rob Schneider's movie career. It's not going to come back.
Hillary,"He's wrong because SNL has always done hokey shit like this from time to time. It's also been an explicitly left leaning institution since it's inception (spoiler alert: much like truth, comedy and the arts will always skew left)

This is more 'I held a delusion about what SNL was to begin with and had that fantasy killed' than 'SNL is dead and never coming back.'"
Hillary,"Rob Schneider has evolved into an insane nutbag, so..."
Hillary,[deleted]
Hillary,"Please. If Rob Schneider couldn‚Äôt kill SNL, one Kate McKinnon sketch also couldn‚Äôt. What a fucking child."
Hillary,If Rob Schneider in his prime was in SNL's current cast he would still be one of the least funny members.
Hillary,"Is SNL funny? No.

Is Rob Schneider funny? No."
Hillary,And here I am thinking SNL hasn‚Äôt been at all funny since the Will Ferrell/Darrell Hammond days.
Hillary,I love every SNL skit without Rob Schneider better than I like anything Rob Schneider has ever done in his life
Hillary,"More importantly, why would I care about Rob Schneider's opinion?"
Hillary,Schneider is an anti vaxxer dick.
Hillary,Rob who?
Hillary,Who cares what Rob Schneider thinks?
Hillary,"Rob Schneider is the last person who should be giving out comedy advice. 

I swear he‚Äôs just Adam Sandler‚Äôs go to guy who‚Äôll debase himself enough to do racial caricatures of other cultures. 

For example:

- Mexican in the ridiculous 6

- Palestinian in Zohan 

- Arab in Click

- Native American in Bedtime Stories

- Chinese in Chuck and Larry"
Hillary,"His remarkable career is a testament to his deep critical insight.  Yeah, right."
Hillary,"The irony of a one note trombone like Rob Schneider taking notes on any cast member of SNL before and after him is clearly lost on a guy who relied on the kindness of Adam Sandler for roles for two decades.

His ego is incredible for a guy who has really done nothing compared to his contemporaries."
Hillary,Rob Schneider killed Rob Schneider and he is desperate for attention.
Hillary,rob schneider can bite me
Hillary,"I just rewatched it and I think that was some of the best and most needed three minutes of television in all of history, never mind SNL. Kate McKinnon gave us a chance to pause and breathe and cry a little as we prepared to face what we knew would be some troubled times. I think she conveyed heartbreak and optimism and resolve all at once and I will always love her for that."
Hillary,Rob Schneider is an idiot that shouldn't be taken seriously.
Hillary,"This isn't the typical, ""SNL was much better before"" comment, he's a MAGA idiot."
Hillary,Rob also thinks he was the most talented on that show somehow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Hillary,"I mean, I don't think anyone's going to deny that it was absolutely, 100% fucking cringe. And the show has certainly declined in quality in the last decade.

But I'm not sure we need criticism from the guy who wrote and starred in ""The Animal."""
Brand New Animal,I thought Little Witch Academia was good but it didn't really impress me. Excited to see how much Yoshinari has improved since then.
Brand New Animal,THESE GODDAMN FURRIES
Brand New Animal,"I know what we‚Äôre going to do today, Ferb"
Brand New Animal,"Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a new season."
Brand New Animal,"Somehow, Doofenshmirtz has returned."
Brand New Animal,Another 104 days of summer!
Brand New Animal,Will Doofenschmirtz‚Äô mother be present this time for his (re) birth?
Brand New Animal,"This has to be the work of the reboot-aniator‚Ä¶ 



‚ÄúPlatypus noise‚Äù"
Brand New Animal,No Swampy?  Who will do Major Monogram?
Brand New Animal,"My heart: YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!!!!!

My brain: NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!"
Brand New Animal,"Cool I suppose,

But what about Kim Possible?"
Brand New Animal,"It'll be 40 new episodes over 2 seasons 

EDIT: The article doesn‚Äôt say where it‚Äôll be streaming yet."
Brand New Animal,"That's kind of sad, I love P&F but the fact that Disney is going all in on revivals and continuations. The company, for all its faults, is viewed as imaginative and the fact that it goes to the reboot pile again and again makes me sad for the future of animation."
Brand New Animal,‚ÄúI hear there‚Äôs a new version of Phineas and Ferb in the offing.‚Äù
Brand New Animal,"So long as they can continue original ideas, I'm in."
Brand New Animal,I watched this entire show as an adult. Great cartoon. Will definitely watch this.
Brand New Animal,104 days my ass.
Brand New Animal,Great show
Brand New Animal,But...why? Milo Murphy was a decent enough continuation. Why not just re-new that? Phineas and Ferb already had a decent ending.
Brand New Animal,I hope they age them up a little.
Brand New Animal,"Probably the only revival project that would be remotely as good as the original. I love that show.

If I remember correctly, I thought there had once been talk of movie trilogy; 2nd Dimension, Candace vs the Universe and then a third, untitled movie. I guess a revival show would be just as good."
Brand New Animal,"Honestly, if the creators are coming back and the cast is all coming back, I‚Äôm perfectly fine with it and I know for a fact Dan Povenmire also said he never wanted to stop making the episodes in the first place. They had so many more stories they wanted to tell and now they can! Also, if the movie was pretty dang good, I have no worries about these 40 episodes. I also bet there will be closure for Milo Murphy‚Äôs Law they will not just leave that show hanging out to dry, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we got closure. I also know that at one point they wanted to do another crossover with Phineas and Ferb. I also expect a crossover with Hamster and Gretel. Especially because he‚Äôs gonna be working on both on the same time, so it‚Äôs easy to schedule the cast and you can start coordinating between the two shows."
Brand New Animal,"Wow! If I had a nickel for every run of Phineas and Ferb, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. Right?"
Brand New Animal,[People on this announcement.](https://youtu.be/5WzswZXTMZQ)
Brand New Animal,I love when a childhood cartoon returns with uncanny flash animation to mimick the original 2d animation.
Brand New Animal,Anyone think they'll do a time skip? I think what they'll do is just say that they did a school year and now its the next summer lmao
Brand New Animal,Please just make it a continuation of the story after it ended and not like the new scooby doo
Brand New Animal,Bring back Gravity Falls. Cowards
Brand New Animal,"So, what's re-booootin'?"
Brand New Animal,Whatcha dooooooin?
Brand New Animal,"Saw the TikTok announcement when it was new.

Let‚Äôs be honest.

Disney has basically made it so that Phineas and Ferb can come back whenever they want and it‚Äôs awesome"
Brand New Animal,"Wow, I can't believe after all this time I never knew Ferb and Phineas were stepbrothers.  I'd just always assumed they were brothers."
Brand New Animal,"I‚Äôm so conflicted right now. Like I‚Äôm thrilled that I get to see all these wonderful characters again, but at the same time it feels like such a ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt attract anyone to new things anymore so let‚Äôs just profit off of nostalgia again‚Äù moment."
Brand New Animal,I don‚Äôt really know what to think of this
Brand New Animal,I‚Äôm so excited for this. This show was awesome.
Brand New Animal,"This show is the reason Bowling for Soup is my favorite band. Even though I‚Äôm in my mid 20s now, I‚Äôm happy to see it coming back."
Brand New Animal,But we already have an ending. They're gonna revive it and cancel it and give it no closure... Disney is clearly out of ideas.
Brand New Animal,Stupid sexy nostalgia
Brand New Animal,It already had a great ending though‚Ä¶
Brand New Animal,"Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!~

The revival~"
Brand New Animal,One of those shows that the kid's loved and I didn't mind watching either. Always thought it was cleverly done.
Brand New Animal,I watched the shit out of this show while my boys were growing up
Brand New Animal,"Phineas and Ferb gets a Marvel cross over! 

 I know what we‚Äôre doing today Ferb."
Brand New Animal,There's 104 days of summer vacationüé∂
Brand New Animal,Mom! Phineas and Ferb are planning a Disney+ revival!
Brand New Animal,"‚ÄúCan you give us a full Owl House season 3?‚Äù

‚ÄúBest I can do is reviving a cash cow that‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt been gone for even a decade.‚Äù"
Brand New Animal,Just bring back Gravity Falls
Brand New Animal,"Stop, unless we get more Milo I don't care."
Brand New Animal,"Really? I thought the show had a pretty good ending already with two movies and several crossovers with Star Wars and Marvel. 

But of course it‚Äôs fucking Disney and we can‚Äôt have any new nice things and just reboot/remake stuff they knew people love.

It‚Äôs fucking sad that this is a part of Entertainment culture, at least prominently in the US. Japan‚Äôs Anime always have new shows (either based on manga or original) coming out every year with only a couple of them being remake or reboot that have new stories and characters and able to sell tons of merch. Meanwhile American companies can‚Äôt no longer make new shows that can last more than 3 seasons and just keep milking old IPs that some lasted longer than an average human‚Äôs life expectancy."
Brand New Animal,Let it rest. Please.
Brand New Animal,Owl house?
Brand New Animal,Interesting considering Povenmires disdain for Disney
Brand New Animal,"Whelp, they‚Äôre going to ruin that show. It was a classic."
Brand New Animal,They‚Äôve done this like 4 times since it‚Äôs been canceled
Brand New Animal,I love P&F but we don't need this. It had a great (and long!) run.
Brand New Animal,"I love the original, but it fell off in quality massively at the end. Really don‚Äôt think a revival is necessary."
Brand New Animal,Why üòÇ
Brand New Animal,it feels like every show that's been off for a while is getting a revival now
Brand New Animal,Looks like a 2nd summer
Brand New Animal,This was one of the cartoons I actually enjoyed watching with my children.
Brand New Animal,"Since the original ends with Doof being a good guy, I wonder how they will handle the B plots."
Brand New Animal,Now this is can get behind
Brand New Animal,The futurama of disney channel
Brand New Animal,"""Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.."""
Brand New Animal,My kids are so happy right now!
Brand New Animal,The best of news
Brand New Animal,They try to bleed every hit show huh
Brand New Animal,Whatcha doing?
Brand New Animal,The vacation continues.
Brand New Animal,So will Doof be evil or still be good?
Brand New Animal,One of those shows as a parent you absolutely enjoyed watching with your kids.
Brand New Animal,This doesn‚Äôt bode well‚Ä¶
Brand New Animal,I know what we‚Äôre going to do today‚Ä¶
Brand New Animal,"PERRYYYY

He‚Äôs a semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal of action!!!"
Brand New Animal,I sincerely hope they don‚Äôt ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù the animation style and fuck it all up
Brand New Animal,Guaranteed this was due to some of the show's dances trending on TikTok for a couple weeks.
Brand New Animal,"Hey Ferb, I know what we are going to do today"
Brand New Animal,Surely there was a reason Disney didn't renew Phineas and Ferb for a fifth season. Sounds more like Hamster and Gretel isn't doing that well.
Brand New Animal,But The Owl House still left to die even after being a smash hit of late
Brand New Animal,‚Äúah perry the platypus you have uncovered my ultimate scheme to take over Disney so that its owed by me then I can but the tri state area!!! and maybe afford my dry cleaning like look at this perry $30 for starching my pants thats just rediculous
Brand New Animal,"I wonder how they're gonna work around the final episode and ""Act your age""


However, i'm excited"
Brand New Animal,"I would assume that means we will get more Star Wars crossover episodes, marvel crossover episodes, some other random Disney character crossovers and maybe even doctor who crossovers with the deal that Disney struck with the BBC?"
Brand New Animal,Is Jeff swampy Marsh part of it too?
Brand New Animal,Any word on original voice cast
Brand New Animal,"Okay but‚Ä¶ what about Owl House? How does this get revived, while that successful show is forced to end due to there contract. Extend the damn thing.

Ugh"
Brand New Animal,Oh boy!  *Squirrel In My Pants II !*
Brand New Animal,I didn't know Phineas and Ferb had stopped! Haven't watched it since the first couple episodes came out. They always seemed to be making new stuff like the Star Wars movie.
Brand New Animal,"My parents in their 60s will be ecstatic. For some reason, they got really into this show. I‚Äôm almost 35 and I‚Äôve never seen it."
Brand New Animal,"Any word on if the full cast is returning? I saw Vincent‚Äôs post on IG, but I haven‚Äôt seen anything from Ashley yet, and surely she‚Äôd post something about it?"
Brand New Animal,Please don‚Äôt ruin my favorite childhood show!
Brand New Animal,Bruh didn‚Äôt it ended line only 5 years ago
Brand New Animal,i wonder if the stuff that happened in milo murphy's law will affect the show or if that's gonna be completely ignored and removed from canon
Brand New Animal,"I have no idea how to feel about this. I LOVED THIS SHOW! Heck I STILL LOVE THIS SHOW!

However‚Ä¶ it had a very sentimental ending‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt like how reboots do in this day and age. Things most certainly become different and the show ends up getting ruined more often than not‚Ä¶ I really hope that doesn‚Äôt happen here.

I trust them however as The movie that was from like 2 years ago felt just like classic phineas & ferb, so if they can keep it like that I will be BEYOND happy!"
Brand New Animal,"Every morning: Phineas tells Ferb he knows what they‚Äôre going to do today.

Every evening: Pinky asks Brain what they‚Äôre going to do tonight.

Imagine telling someone 5 years ago that in the early 2020‚Äôs both pairs would return in series revivals."
Brand New Animal,"It's ""**Ferb,** I know what we‚Äôre gonna do today"" ackshually"
Brand New Animal,Needs more oooo‚Äôs in Mom üòÅ

Brand New Animal,Doofenshmirtz was in Milo Murphy‚Äôs Law too
Buddi,Heard them interviewing someone about all the labour strikes on News Hour this morning and when he brought up that even some BBC employees were striking she blew past it. Was pretty funny
Buddi,"I‚Äôm not British, but between this and the MotD stuff, the BBC seems like a mess right now?"
Buddi,"I'm Canadian, and we have the CBC, which is our version of the BBC. I am well aware of the shortcomings and issues of a publicly-funded broadcaster that theoretically exists to speak to the center of a country's values and ideologies.

I've worked in the industry and have seen the MANY ways that shooting for an ""objective"" or ""neutral"" voice leads to reporting that at best, says nothing of deeper value or insight, and at worst actively protects the status quo. These are all valid concerns.

But I've also seen what a lack of having a large, well-funded, public-interest media presence looks like, because I've seen America. I find it absolutely absurd that there's just no neutral function in American media. You have, what, PBS and NPR? The former rarely engages in news reporting, and the latter has been pigeonholed as a lefty elitist podcast enclave. Which means that the biggest options are run like a business and need to compete with both pure entertainment products AND opposing news networks that have no mandate to report on facts and reality, period.

If you remove a public service to replace it with a private one, you haven't proven that it wasn't needed or wanted. You've just shown that you want to control that service for profit or propaganda. Or both. And that's what this strike is about. The roles and shows being marked for redundancy will be paid for elsewhere: either through privately-owned alternatives, or through the ultimate consequences of this starve-the-beast approach to killing public support of public services.

The CBC is boring and stale and often leaves a lot to be desired. And...that's what the news is SUPPOSED TO DO. At the very least, I trust it to deliver an acceptably accurate explanation of a current event. 

Look at what happens when people can't agree on a shared set of reality-defining facts, and tell me that MORE of this is good for our collective future."
Buddi,"In today's news.  BBC anounce a new weekly program called We all love Rishi.  When asked if this was within program guidelines, we were told, to quote ""shove it""."
Buddi,Radio what's new? Someone still loves you.
Buddi,[deleted]
Buddi,Power to the Workers!  Make the BBC show dead air!
Buddi,Bring back mock the week!
Buddi,Or you could apologise to the union members to improve their working conditions so they didn't have to strike in the first place.
Buddi,"Rich getting richer, poor getting poorer, never gonna stop until capitalism in it's current state is outlawed."
Buddi,"Canada has the CBC, which is similar to the BBC. The CBC is susceptible to whatever political party is in power. What both need is legislation guaranteeing public funding and complete autonomy from political and corporate influence. Fact based news held to the highest standard possible. That won‚Äôt happen because the powerful love to use all media as their own little propaganda toys.  Want to see just how corrupt they will go? Read the transcripts and text messages in the Dominion Voting Systems vs. Fox News. They knowingly spread misinformation for money."
Buddi,"The BBC also fired all of their choirs and cut down the orchestras. A shame, because they are all fantastic ensembles."
Buddi,"The BBC is sorry?  I don‚Äôt actually believe that, at all."
Buddi,"The BBC has become intensely right-wing lately.

>A Cardiff University analysis of BBC news coverage in 2009 (under Labour) and 2015 (under the Conservative-led coalition) counted how often it mentioned think tanks categorised as left-leaning, right-leaning or neutral in both years, finding a broad balance in 2009 but a clear bias to the right in 2015: ‚ÄúWhen Labour was in power [in 2009], the BBC‚Äôs use of think tanks was relatively even-handed, but when a Conservative-led coalition was in power [in 2015], the centre of gravity [in the BBC‚Äôs coverage] shifted to the political right.‚Äù

>Another study, by two London-based academics, found that during the 2017 general election campaign, 69 per cent of the newspaper stories featured on the BBC‚Äôs daily late-night TV show The Papers were from Conservative-supporting papers versus only 23 per cent from those supporting Labour and 8 per cent from those supporting other parties (such as Ukip or the Lib Dems). Of those studio guests representing a paper with a clear party affiliation, 68 per cent were also Conservatives. However much this may reflect the political bias in the newspaper landscape, it again shows that claims of lefty favouritism are simply untrue.

Buddi,Your apology means fuck all when you literally are the mouthpiece of the current government. A government that often tries to pass laws that are called out for being pretty n*zi like.
Buddi,"What's the problem.  It's government owned, just increase the license fee and pay the bums."
Buddi,were sorry that were such big scumbags that most of our workers are striking right now.
Buddi,What bombshell dropped on this comment section.
Buddi,BBC trying really hard to appear the victim.
Buddi,"Don't apologize, treat your workers better."
Buddi,Or just apologize for mediocre pay and working conditions? Easy to make it up to the strikers.
Buddi,"Oh no!!! What will we do without dancing stars, people baking and D listens being lost on an island?"
Buddi,"What I wouldn't do to live in a world where instead of this, BBC apologizes to its audiences for not paying or respecting their workers more, and making amends because of that."
Buddi,"Oh FFS, just pay them! They are not asking for anything crazy."
Buddi,So who else is going on strike over there? I got friends heading over in a few days

Buddi,I read this as Big Black Cock apologizes.....
Buddi,#DefundtheBBC
Buddi,Scrap it. Dinosaur cartel of an organisation.
Buddi,"If it weren't for the news, I wouldn't have known they were on strike."
Buddi,"In other words, the BBC isn‚Äôt on the employees side. Nor on the tax payers it seems.

Then again they are ran by the right and refuse to air documentaries about the state of the planet. Don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs much left to save soon."
Buddi,Maybe instead of apologizing to viewers you should apologize to your staff. Just a thought.
Buddi,Don't  apologize.  Take care of the strike which you've created.
Buddi,That took me a second to realize you didn't mean PBS NewsHour.
Buddi,"The conservatives want it to go as they want fox news style output only, as they are in cahoots with the owners of mass media. The BBC while fairly right leaning still has enough of a left wing presence to not be fully controlled by them.

Plus the BBC thinks it has to share every viewpoint even if its insane. They gave Farage, somebody that never got elected into public office but was a charismatic figure, endless screen time on the run up to Brexit and also use their screen time to interview random idiots off the street as if they are representative of anything worth listening to. As lampooned by Charlie Brooker of Black Mirror fame in this clip https://youtu.be/aHun58mz3vI"
Buddi,"You'll sometimes see people claim that the BBC is neutral because they get complaints of bias from both the left and the right. The problem is that the complaints from the left are that news & politics reporting tends to support the government's line, their political correspondents are mostly right-wing, the BBC fails to report on protests by the left, etc. The complaints from the right tend to be that there's a woman Dr Who, there's brown people on panel shows, and dramas have some gay characters."
Buddi,Not just the BBC In a mess. Many 'institutions' are thanks to years of awful conservative leadership.
Buddi,Government put a tory party donor in charge.
Buddi,and covering up for paedophiles like Jimmy Saville
Buddi,"I wouldn‚Äôt say so really. The BBC is massive and held to really high standards. The problem with the Lineker thing was that the rules weren‚Äôt clear. In the end all that happened was Sunday football was shown without hosts once.

If you‚Äôre not from the UK you‚Äôre probably not aware but there‚Äôs loads of strikes going on right now."
Buddi,[here's some background](https://youtu.be/ovacofuB63A)
Buddi,It's being setup to fail. Same thing happens with the ABC in Australia when conservative governments are in.
Buddi,"Seems they‚Äôve been a garbage heap for a while. They built, empowered, and covered for Savile decades ago. 

Now they‚Äôre having staffing issues and employees are up in arms about content decisions.

I‚Äôm confused why Attenborough would even work with them."
Buddi,Have to disagree with you on PBS; they're increasingly more into delivering national news. Think BBC World Service or CNN International.
Buddi,"But the walkout isn't because of pay, which you would know if you read the article.

""BBC employees are protesting against plans to make nearly 50 roles redundant across local services. Radio shows are being cut, while the BBC has axed We Are England, a regional documentary TV show.""

It is a protest that jobs are being cut in some areas."
Buddi,BBC is publicly owned. You couldn't pick a worse example to represent the flaws of capitalism.
Buddi,"""its"" current state"
Buddi,Itt: bootlickers
Buddi,"> until capitalism ~~in it's current state~~ is outlawed.

There is no ""good form"" or ""good state"" with capitalism. Never has been, never will be."
Buddi,"> capitalism in it's current state is outlawed

Said every pimply-faced high school student ever, until they graduate college and begin earning actual money."
Buddi,The natural state of man is poverty. Capitalism changes that.
Buddi,Then you just end up with everyone getting poorer.
Buddi,"Touring is mostly out the window now too, as Brexit has meant that the cost of Visas doesn't make it worthwhile."
Buddi,"Its a British sorry, which never is one."
Buddi,"When did England become such a rancid, right-wing shithole? It's like the Texas of the UK."
Buddi,"The ECHR has called out the Tories for this as far back as 2015, they are pathological."
Buddi,The English literally keep voting for them...
Buddi,People went to Channel 4 to bake. The pay was better.
Buddi,I drove past 3 pickets today.
Buddi,Seems like Britain has been practically approaching general strike conditions. The unrest against the Tory government is unprecedented.
Buddi,"I believe this week has trains, London Underground, universities, teachers, civil servants, BBC local staff and Amazon workers on strike. I believe there's more Royal Mail strike days soon as well. Ambulance staff, nurses and the fire brigade have been on strike recently too."
Buddi,The end of the world will not be official until the BBC stop showing repeats of Homes Under The Hammer.
Buddi,Wrong channel buddy
Buddi,So no news at all?
Buddi,It had to after spitting in someone's eye.
Buddi,He did but he said it with a spot of tea so it sounds different on reddit.
Buddi,That Charlie brooker newswipe bit is depressingly accurate but also brilliant
Buddi,"They invited Graham Linehan onto Question Time when debating trans issues. Linehan is an ex-comedy writer who has no qualifications in the matter, aside from being a mouthpiece for the transphobic before he got banned from Twitter for spreading hate. They could have had a doctor or a psychologist or a trans person or the relative of a trans person or someone who transitioned and then regretted it or *anyone else* in that chair."
Buddi,"That is indeed every single news piece on the news, any news anywhere."
Buddi,Farage was elected as an MP to European parliament.
Buddi,"Sorkin called the ‚Äúshare every viewpoint‚Äú ‚Äúbiased towards fairness‚Äú. There aren‚Äôt always two sides, sometimes there are five sometimes there is one. Quoting Sorkin through Will McAvoy: ‚ÄûIf the entire republican caucus went on the house floor and proposed a resolution stating that the earth is flat, the New York Times would lead with ‚ÄúDemocrats and Republicans can‚Äôt agree on shape of earth‚Äú.‚Äú"
Buddi,"> The BBC while fairly right leaning 

Can we define ""right-leaning"" here?"
Buddi,"BBC should be a couple of channels only and BBC radio all paid by normal taxes, the rest can go online"
Buddi,Didn't the Tories try to privatize Channel 4 not too long ago?
Buddi,"> Plus the BBC thinks it has to share every viewpoint even if its insane. 

This is not dissimilar to what was known here in the US as the ""Fairness Doctrine"", a 20th century policy that forced broadcasters to allow equal time for opposing viewpoints, and something that many centrist and left-leaning individuals are clamoring for a return of.  

Some would argue that if you don't allow for the airing of all viewpoints, you're simply headed for a Fox News situation anyway."
Buddi,"They've specifically said that that's not the case, at least when it comes to global warming they've said they don't need to speak to a denier to somehow balance out the truth"
Buddi,"> They gave Farage, somebody that never got elected into public office but was a charismatic figure

He was somehow an MSP by that point, being very right-wing and anti-immigration while living and working in Brussels and having a wife from a European country.

The epitome of hypocritical."
Buddi,">Plus the BBC thinks it has to share every viewpoint even if its insane.

Isn't that because they are state owned?  They can't simply shut out one side or it would be seen as government taking sides.

Funny thing is, I remember on the run up to the brexit referendum the brexiteers were accusing the BBC of favoring the remainers and that was one of the reasons why they were calling for the termination of the TV license fee."
Buddi,"Can we please stop defining fairness, honesty, empathy and consideration as 'left wing' traits? Those, if anything are centre ground (and far to the left of the right-wing assholes who control the Government and head-up the BBC).

Other than that, spot on. üòÅ"
Buddi,"Utter nonsense.

The BBC isn't right leaning, at all:

Buddi,In what world is the BBC right leaning?
Buddi,[deleted]
Buddi,Brooker for bbc board
Buddi,">t fox news style output only,

Ah, so entertainment only?"
Buddi,"Loved News Wipe, wish he did some more recent analysis of the news coverage of recent times post Brexit and Trump era"
Buddi,"Tbf plenty of folk who work in the media are more than happy to accommodate right wing takeovers like in the Labour Party. This stuff has been festering for decades but its boiled over now that the right wing conservatives, lib dems and Labour have stripped all the copper wires out the walls of Britain's state capacity.

4% of brits went to a private school but make up 52% of the media. The acidic coverage of corbyns policies that was the first manifesto for a long time to actually challenge the upper caste of British society and the structural dysfunction that allowed them to continue to accumulate wealth. 

There's no party to vote for that isn't part of the old boys club of capital in England or Scotland tbh. Having been involved in the labour movement I've seen first hand that the politicians who materially support us are the exception and not the rule (espically in Labour where allies were purged by the right wingers in control). The unions also due to our anti-democractic trade union laws (that Tony Blair bragged about) have to constantly ballot members but ironically this means that the trade unions have WAY WAY more of a democratic mandate than Westminster or Holywood at this point."
Buddi,"Yeah but, like, surely all sides can come together and agree that Jodie's weak run was Chibnall's fault? I mean come on, we gotta be able to reach common ground on some core issues at least, right?"
Buddi,">The complaints from the right tend to be that there's a woman Dr Who, there's brown people on panel shows, and dramas have some gay characters.

I think that's a bit disingenuous to frame left wing complaints as reasonable checks to political interference, while right wing complaints are mostly simple racist, sexist fear mongering.

Both sides generally complain that about a lack of voice from their side, aka the fact finders or news anchors or management of the BBC is predominantly made up of left-wing / right-wing voices. Decade to decade the BBC has swayed a little left and right. 

For example, the right wing complaints against the very recent David Attenborough episode that was not broadcast focused on:

- It was partially funded by two activist groups that lobby and donate to mostly left wing officials and pushed for left-wing environmental policies. 

- The producers of that specific extra episode pushed a much more political left wing argument than the other episodes (anti big farming that harms environment). EG a quote from the producers:

""Those farmers [interviewed in the episode] are there to make the point that every farm in the country ought to be able to do a little bit at least of what they do, and that it is possible to farm alongside nature, to make a profit, to produce healthy food and to still run a business""

Which is of course not some objective environmental fact unlike say ""these populations of wildlife are getting crushed by human activity"", but a very clear ""we should stop it through these political policies"". That is the line the BBC has to walk.

While I am very left wing and agree with the producers, I think its harmful to just paint the British Right as if they are entirely made up of basically dumb sexist racist idiots shouting into space trying to prevent the pure good progress of the left."
Buddi,And a ex Tory candiate as DG.
Buddi,"If that's true, great! And forgive my general ignorance on their current coverage."
Vampires,"Gellar on Starring in a Buffy Reboot:

>""I am very proud of the show that we created and it doesn‚Äôt need to be done. We wrapped that up.‚Äù  

  
>‚ÄúI am all for them continuing the story, because there‚Äôs the story of female empowerment. I love the way the show was left: ‚ÄòEvery girl who has the power can have the power.‚Äô It‚Äôs set up perfectly for someone else to have the power. But like I said, the metaphors of ‚ÄòBuffy‚Äô were the horrors of adolescence. I think I look young, but I am not an adolescent.‚Äù"
Vampires,"It would have issues because of the cast alone.

Spike and Angel's actors simply can't play immortal vampires anymore. Nicholas Brendan is probably completely unemployable until he gets some long overdue help. They already killed off Anya and Cordelia.

That's before you get into how like half the cast wants nothing to do with Whedon anymore and that Whedon himself is a major no go right now.

SMG, Hannigan and Trachtenberg are probably the only 3 you could realistically keep running with. Maybe Anthony Head. 

It might be interesting if you could get Noxon, Fury, and Espenson back in the writers room but that's probably the only chance it has."
Vampires,"The buffyverse is an incredibly fleshed out and brilliant universe with a lot of potential 

Pick another slayer in another era and tell a different story completely unconnected from Buffy 

A period piece would be brilliant.

I‚Äôm surprised no one has done this yet"
Vampires,Make a spinoff about the Hellmouth over Cleveland instead.
Vampires,God I respect her so much for this. Not everything needs to be rebooted. Try and get some new ideas
Vampires,"Agreed. It doesn't need to be done. 
This will unfortunately have absolutely zero bearing on whether it will in fact, be done."
Vampires,and that's why we love her
Vampires,"I mean she is 100% right.

Create a new show with a new slayer not named Buffy and not set in Sunnydale.

You get to have your own show and characters without pissing off the original fan base."
Vampires,"Lets be honest, we all know it would have sucked.  Hollywood does not respect any IP or the fans."
Vampires,"The finale screamed for a subsequent anthology series. AHS style, following a different slayer in a different city (world wide) with periodic overlaps for team ups to face specifically big bads."
Vampires,SMG doesn‚Äôt need cash. That‚Äôs good.
Vampires,"Half-joking with this but hear me out, instead of a Buffy reboot, we get a spin-off where Kendra gets brought back from the dead and the plot twist is that Bianca Lawson STILL plays her because she actually is a vampire IRL. She does not age."
Vampires,"Give us the Giles ""Ripper"" prequel you cowards."
Vampires,We'll always have the Musical.
Vampires,"Buffy was a fun show and a vampire slayer mini-series could be good, too, if written well. You could have 10-episode seasons and focus on a different slayer. For example, I remember a scene that showed a kung-fu Chinese slayer from ages ago. It'd be a blast to watch her fight Chinese Ghost Story-type baddies."
Vampires,"Even if it did need to be done, why would you recast the old Buffy to be in the New Buffy? That's stupid."
Vampires,Gotta respect someone for not rebooting something that already had worked and run its course.
Vampires,I loved Buffy. I don't want any sort of reboot. I would however like some sort of continuation of the story with an entirely new cast. It's very well set up for exactly that. They could potentially grab SMG (or another original cast member) for one special episode- i doubt she'd say no to that. Could also potentially be an anime- easier to showcase all the magic and powers of the slayer (and bad guys) without breading the budget of what would otherwise be a (potentially) expensive show given all the needed special effects.
Vampires,We do need answers to some burning questions like: aren't Angel and Spike corpse-cold to the touch? Does Buffy not retch from the reek of dried blood breath? You think kissing a smoker is bad.
Vampires,She literally said no to money out of principle. You don't see that every day. Good for her.
Vampires,"For the best

Lets face it Whedon might be an asshole but history shows

If he isnt in charge, stuff based on his work usually sucks"
Vampires,Respect
Vampires,Augustus St. Cloud howling at this statement.
Vampires,"Probably for the best. I love Buffy, but it ended almost 20 years ago and the story was pretty well wrapped up.

If anything it was Angel that had a cliffhanger ending, unless you read the follow up comics."
Vampires,"The show WAS the reboot. 

It‚Äôs already been done, doesn‚Äôt need to be done again."
Vampires,Wasn't her show a reboot of the movie?
Vampires,"Another redditor once pitched the idea that Buffy is living a normal life and hides the fact she‚Äôs a slayer from her husband and kids. One days she takes out the trash and is attacked by a demon only for the scooby gang to show up to kill it. I‚Äôd love the take of grown Buffy coming out retirement or even being a watcher or something. It‚Äôd be cool if we could see a snippet of her life even if was just for an episode in a new story. However, I respect that she‚Äôs done.

Ripper would‚Äôve been a great story."
Vampires,I don't understand why they haven't/won't do an animated series. It could be so good.
Vampires,This wouldn't happen without Wheedon. He's notoriously obsessive over this show and likes to be puppetmaster. No one would want to work with him again.
Vampires,She‚Äôs such a queen ü§©
Vampires,Already being made. It's basically what Wednesday is. Mythical monsters? Check. Teen girl who is just good at everything? Check. Bunch of other weirdos around her? Check. First bf turns out to be a maniac? Check. Etc etc
Vampires,Thanks god for SMG
Vampires,"***ReVAMP***, headline writers, ""Geller shuts down starring in Buffy revamp""!

For god's sake, it's right there"
Vampires,"It really really, doesn‚Äôt need to be done.  Reboots are becoming an absurd meme of Hollywood, constantly playing the nostalgic angle and rarely succeeding to recreate the magic of original content.   Bringing things back to inject current social norms is also tiresome.  Goddamn. Where‚Äôs the creativity these days?  You know what I damn well mean!!!  There *has to be* new original content out there, probably sitting stagnant on some desk but won‚Äôt get green-lit bc of fear of not turning a profit."
Vampires,Good for her for not taking this obvious cash grab. That show was just as much about Joss' scripts as it was the actors. I think everyone knows it would suck without Joss' writing.
Vampires,She's 100% correct. We don't need a Buffy the Vampire slayer reboot. A Buffy TNG though could be interesting but it doesn't need to happen.
Vampires," I dread a direct reboot just because they always seem to turn out like garbage.

Warrior Nun is legitimately the perfect spiritual successor to Buffy, in my opinion. Really hoping they get picked up because I'm hooked on the lore ‚Äì *so* much potential."
Vampires,"If there is money to be made, it will get done.

-any greedy Hollywood producer"
Vampires,Sanity prevails.
Vampires,Respect.
Vampires,"100% don‚Äôt fucking reboot beloved, perfect tv shows. hope this show crashes and burns and the show runner who greenlit it"
Vampires,Finally someone in with some sense... Reboots are generally not better than the originals and most of them don't need to be done. It's purely a profit-driven practice to milk the nostalgia of gen Xers and millennials.
Vampires,This is true of all reboots‚Ä¶
Vampires,Good on her for having the guts to say it
Vampires,"I mean it all ended with dam comics, they didn't really finish it on TV, same with Angel"
Vampires,"Sad as i am to say it, she's right."
Vampires,This is the most rational news headline Ive seen in years.
Vampires,It needs to be done because Hollywood is out of ideas and loves money.
Vampires,"Good, I absolutely agree.  It doesn't need to be done.  Want to watch more Buffy?  Just rewatch the show again, it's more than good enough.  Really want to know what happens after the end of the story?  Well, there's a comic series that picked up the story and was even written by Joss Whedon if you really must go that route."
Vampires,It‚Äôs great being an 80s kid. I get to watch my younger years microwaved shows with awful writing and worse acting /s
Vampires,Unpopular opinion: that show and universe is fine as it is. It doesn't need a reboot and it doesn't need a spin off.
Vampires,"Agreed. Enough with the reboots. Let's have the talented writers pitch original television/movies. 

Seems like the writers with original content are not being heard."
Vampires,"I'd like to see Gellar as the mom in a conventional teen drama centered around her kids as high school students doing TV high school student things... but every now and then you get a scene like Gellar washing her stakes and knives as the kids come home to tell her about their day. Strange events would occur - skies darkening, earthquakes, etc. - without any explanation and would just end up being resolved while the kids stress about making the cheerleading squad or their latest love triangle."
Vampires,I have honestly never cared about this show at all.
Vampires,"I don't want season 8.  I don't want a remake either.  


But a story continuation in the same universe with different characters would be the sweet spot.  And that leaves the door open for the odd cameo should anyone wish to do it"
Vampires,"I agree with the sentiment that we don't need a Buffy reboot, but if there was one why would Sarah Michelle Gellar be starring in it? She's 45."
Vampires,"You could argue her Buffy show was ""a reboot that doesn't need to happen."" too. And it turned out to be pretty good after a rocky start."
Vampires,"I agree with her, do something new."
Vampires,"Haven‚Äôt heard anything from her in years, first thing is a shameless repudiation of reboot frenzy even though it may be financially lucrative. Lots of respect"
Vampires,It also probably wouldn‚Äôt last more than a season in today‚Äôs environment.
Vampires,The TV show WAS the reboot.
Vampires,I would argue that as a society we're ready to be done with anything associated with Joss Whedon.
Vampires,"I mean, the original Buffy didn't need to be done. So, good for her for growing up."
Vampires,Cell phones would make that whole series 5 minutes long
Vampires,"People crying for a sequel, reboot, anthology, whatever and then get surprised when Disney launches 15 shows in a year with the same IP. Just let things end with grace. Let new things pop up."
Vampires,She must still be doing very well financially.
Vampires,Buffy was an artifact of it's time.
Vampires,The first series didn't need to be done either. No tv show or movie needed to be done.  Doesn't mean it won't be re done anyways
Vampires,"Most reboots can fuck all the way off. The only legitimate reason to reboot, or remake something, is if the original was lacking in some way. I‚Äôm not a fan myself, but every single woman I‚Äôve ever met absolutely loves Buffy, and would spit on the floor in disgust at the thought of a reboot, or anything that would retcon or diminish anything at all in that universe."
Vampires,"Once she sees that paycheck ""it absolutely needs to be done, they convinced me we'll do it right"""
Vampires,FFS stop rebooting shit! Have an original fucking thought for once.
Vampires,Also she‚Äôs no longer a high school teen so‚Ä¶
Vampires,She‚Äôs always said no. She‚Äôll never work with joss whedon again. He was too abusive.
Vampires,"Glad she was real about it. It'd end up being total shit crammed with woke, shallow agendas that serve only as a checklist in an effort to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Especially in this day and age where streaming services become more desperate.

I'm not saying a younger generation's adolescent experiences are somehow not significant enough or whatever (they have a whole new world of material that could be used) to match the OG show but rather studios today are so inept that it'd come off that way. It'd just be hollow."
Vampires,"Isn't ""The Chosen One"" by definition, required to be a teenage girl? I thought ""Slayers"" aged out, or do they usually just die before they make it to adulthood?"
Vampires,She already WAS in the reboot
Vampires,thank god. That last season was rough enough
Vampires,She's right. Also she's difficult to work with with so that's another reason.
Vampires,Jenna Ortega
Vampires,"How about ""Cissy The Vampire Slayer"" starring Kathy Garver?

/obscure?"
Vampires,"Buffy is a product of it's time. What made it special in the 90's early 2000's is how everything is done now. You throw it all together now and it looks like any other CW baked show.

The only thing you get with Buffy now is the lore and the supporting characters. And the lore of Buffy isn't that great. And really you can't reboot Spike and Angel because the actors really made those characters. 

If you really want to continue Buffy then the best way to do that is break the universe. It's not the world we know but something drastically different. Vampires and other monsters have taken over, they each have their own countries or places of power. Maybe there's pockets of humanity. That's probably too much budget wise but just returning to the high school procedural is going to look like so many other products already out there."
Vampires,Goddamn I respect the hell out of SMG for this statement.
Vampires,"She‚Äôs a true artist.

Ugh bless her"
Vampires,"Yes, it does. I‚Äôd love to see a big budget, all-in reboot."
Vampires,So then write zero words about it
Vampires,"I wouldnt want to see a new buffy, or spin off with the way hollywood is now, they are woefully inept at doing an actually good show and all they want to do is push a totally unrealistic storyline, look at rey(cant do anything wrong, good at everything), they are even worse with trans or nonbinary characters( only well done char was M in motherland fort salem because being nonbinary wasnt all the character was, they were an effective soldier, but not perfect) and you can bet they would be jamming gay/trans/nonbinary chars in at every possible opportunity, they need to stop jamming these type of badly written chars into EVERYTHING, there is a place for all characters if they make sense in the story, but a show needs a story, not just gender box ticking"
Vampires,Didn't the world end at the end of the series?
Vampires,She doesn‚Äôt own ‚Äúbuffy the vampire slayer‚Äù lol. Who cares what she thinks needs to be done?
Vampires,"... she says after staring in a reboot no one thought needed to happen.

Am I taking crazy pills? The whole show was a fucking reboot."
Vampires,"Senora, you better get your coins."
Vampires,"Eh, I dunno. I'd be interested in seeing a middle-aged Buffy juggling being a Slayer and a normal adult life."

Vampires,She worried about people seeing her turkey neck.
The English Game,nice! I dig Julian Fellowes in a guilty pleasure sorta way so i'm looking forward to this.
The English Game,"Yeah, because it's fucking long."
The English Game,"Kinda have to. I could be misremembering, but Part I is around 16 hours long, Part II was more like 35/40 hours, even if a lot of those events are concurrent

Edit: apparently I remember it being longer than it actually is! Still, I think it benefits from being approached as multi season arc, as someone who likes the vast majority of it"
The English Game,"I feel like part 2 could be adapted as two shorter seasons of 7-8 episodes, with hopefully a quicker turnaround. It'd suck to have to wait two years between seasons 2 and 3 after the likely 2 year wait (optimistically 18 months) between seasons 1 and 2."
The English Game,"I‚Äôm curious where the split will be in-between seasons. Unless season 2 is going to be all >!Ellie hunting Abby and end with Abby confronting her at the theater, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre going to do the POV switch in the show because it could seriously dissuade show-only members if a season 3 starts and they only see Abby every week for over a month. Paralleling their days in the same episodes seems like a better fit for the medium.!<

Also I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre going to add a lot to the show because even thought Part 2 is twice the length of Part 1, it has a lot of extended combat scenes (moreso than Part 1) that will likely be taken out. I can see them fleshing out >!some of the side characters like Yara, Jesse, and Isaac were who fairly one-note in the game, and give more backstory to the Seraphites since they felt like set dressing for the most part.!<"
The English Game,If I don‚Äôt see the >!Rat King!< I will stop watching üêÄ
The English Game,"That was obvious but what I'm curious about will be the timeline. Will they keep it like the game or make it more linear? Either way after season one, I trust them."
The English Game,"Third season will be the NG+ playthrough where the story is the same, but all the gun stats are maxed out from the beginning."
The English Game,I really hope they keep the crane
The English Game,"Hope they keep the rope puzzles, I loved those."
The English Game,Part I really needed that extra runtime as well.
The English Game,"This sounds like they‚Äôll be able to give it room to breath and maybe it‚Äôll give them a chance to structure the story  in a way that feels a bit tightly focused. I love the story they told with the game, just feel like the way they told it could have been re structured a bit to work a bit better."
The English Game,"Makes total sense. If the pacing is about the same as Season One, Season Two could comfortably take us to the natural ""inflection point"" that anyone who's played the game can appreciate.

Part II is a more complex story with a larger cast of major characters. Would definitely feel rushed if compressed into a single season."
The English Game,"I don‚Äôt like a lot of the choices from part II, I think a few changes here and there and it can be received much better. 

It will probably still be an absolute shitshow online like when the game released."
The English Game,Really wish the first season was longer
The English Game,"I hope they take their time with it. This season has felt a little too rushed, in my opinion."
The English Game,"This season was good but as it went on it felt like they were rushing through the plot and the finale felt just a little hollow as a result, almost like I was watching a catch-up summary for the next season. Doesn't help that every show now has to be 10 episode seasons or less. Looking forward to starting the game and getting the full effect."
The English Game,[removed]
The English Game,It was a significantly longer game so that makes sense.
The English Game,I still think they could have made Part I into two seasons. Maybe not 10 episodes each season but something like 7-8.
The English Game,"So I haven‚Äôt seen the show yet, but for those who have, is season 1 part 1 only?"
The English Game,"All of yall thinking where to cut in the video game, but im guessing they could go the hobbit route and randomly introduce a love triangle between side characters. 

Oh lord"
The English Game,"Absolutely hated Part 2 for personal reasons, but if they decide to adapt so that >!Season 2 is Abby‚Äôs background and story, maybe leave out the part that intersects with Joel and Ellie first so that new fans don‚Äôt know who she is and they get to bond with her character and then either end Season 2 with their initial confrontation or start S3 that way and have the entire season focus on their conflict!< I would give it a shot.

Main reason why I didn‚Äôt like Part 2 was >!The way they wrote Joel‚Äôs ending!< and >!the game‚Äôs ending!< being absolutely disappointing for me. But I hope they make it work somehow."
The English Game,The drop off of viewers is going to be interesting after a certain event.
The English Game,"everyone working ""spoilers not spoilers"" into their comments, suck, for those of us who didn't play the game, and are just trying to enjoy the story presented by the show"
The English Game,"Huge spoiler take

>!show dies when joel dies!<"
The English Game,This last episode felt rushed with 9 episode season for sure
The English Game,Why don't they just make a couple seasons that explore what happened between the games?
The English Game,This show started off amazing. I got bored as the season went on. I‚Äôll watch season 2 but I‚Äôm not excited about it.
The English Game,"I personally didn‚Äôt really think Part 2 was that good, but I can definitely see it being handled a lot better in a television series format, especially considering Part 2 will be stretched longer to make everything feel more developed and complex."
The English Game,"a 3 season show feels about right, I'd like it to have a definitive end there and not just say ""hey, success, lets keep it going!"""
The English Game,"I hope the actress that plays Ellie will be able to pull off the older character. I'm assuming so, but still makes me nervous"
The English Game,"I thought they flew through David‚Äôs storyline. I‚Äôm loving this so much that I don‚Äôt mind if they stretch it out, I know they won‚Äôt ruin it and I trust that they will stick to source material and not exhaust the series"
The English Game,"Should have done the same for part 1. One of the most poorly paced shows I've ever watched. I'm glad they stayed pretty true to the game but damn, they could have done so much more."
The English Game,"I think they are between a rock and a hard place with the next season. If they follow the games' story there will be a ton of people that hate it, if they dont it will be admitting that the direction they went with the game's story was essentially a mistake. Will be interesting to see how they navigate it."
The English Game,[removed]
The English Game,I imagine you‚Äôd have to just for pacing purposes when translating it to live action formats. The fairly early game twist would be jarring if they just hit that off the beginning episode of season 2. Not to mention there is plenty of in between game happenings that could be made into great character development moments to make the events of the 2nd game more impactful in tv format
The English Game,they could have adapted season one into multiple seasons. they rushed through the plot points I thought.
The English Game,Money
The English Game,"Probably should do their own spinoff, too, explore the whole world, get as wild as they wanna."
The English Game,"Could have done that with s1 too, felt rushed ino"
The English Game,"I think they will probably pseudo-alternate between TLOU and HOTD every year, like they did with GOT and Westworld years prior. 

They now have seasons 2 & 3 mapped out. HOTD S2 is coming out in 2024, so they might do TLOU S2 (first half of Part II) in 2025, and do HOTD S3 in the same year (2025) or 2026 and do TLOU S3 (second half of Part II) in 2026 (since it would be a two-parter story, I don‚Äôt see this coming out in 2027). 

Maybe a break after 2026, and they might have revealed or even released TLOU Part III by then. So possibly TLOU S4 in 2028."
The English Game,"First game needed at least 3 or 4 more episodes. Or 2 seasons. With Joel almost dying as the finale/cliffhanger.

Glad they will be making game 2 at least 2 seasons."
The English Game,"Pitch Meeting:  
 *So, you got a tv show for me?  Yes sir I do. You know how you like money sir.  Ohhh yeah, is that what the script is about?  Well it can be sir. I was thinking we take a single story and make it last 3  or 4 seasons.  Oh very cool, sounds like the fans will love waiting 4 years to watch it.  I think so sir*"
The English Game,"I haven‚Äôt played 2 because it seems like a despair burger (I get notoriously dark with stuff like that)

Is it worth it though? Im seeing people saying it‚Äôs an experience not worth missing. May have to change my mind‚Ä¶"
The English Game,"Without spoiling the games, is season 1 the entirety of part 1? Like part 1 and season 1 ended at the same spot?"
The English Game,"This is great news. People already felt this first game felt rushed, and the second is twice as long."
The English Game,"So I gotta say... the show was a pale comparison to the game. Performances were flat (Check out side by side comparisons if you don't believe me) It felt really small in scope and severely rushed.  Felt like a local theater troupe rendition of a Hollywood play. 

If I had never seen the original, I would have probably loved it, because I didn't know all the stuff they cut out and how stellar the performances were. Yes, I know episode 3 was a nice story, but it wasn't worth cutting out an entire section of the game where you really come to understand Ellie and Joel as characters. BUT, I think most issues I had with the season was a budget problem. They couldn't afford to tell a grand adventure. So, with the big success, maybe they can do the story justice.   IMO, the first game should ideally be covered in two seasons instead of one.  Splitting up the second game will improve pacing a lot."
The English Game,Shit‚Ä¶ that scares me! If you played the games you know why
The English Game,Of course Neil wants his proper baby to span into 2 seasons while the S01 finale was 46 minutes
The English Game,Tbh wonder how pedro/joel being done durty is gonna go with tv audiences. Ppl definitely hated it and i personally hate the entire plot of the second part.
The English Game,"For once I wish they'd deviate from the source material. Unfortunately, I found the plot of part II to be lackluster and not that interesting."
The English Game,loved the second game but i hope the show improves some narrative issues that part 2 have.
The English Game,I know I'm alone on this but I wish they'd come up with new stories that take place in between the games. I want more world building and what not
The English Game,Milk that cow dry baby. After that we will have 3 spin offs and prequal
The English Game,"I think that makes sense.

I think Craig Mazin is perfect with character dramas, and was STILL surprised at how well-developed the characters of TLoU are.

But we all know the biggest challenge is TLoU2 by a *mile*. They all have their work cut out for them trying to get me onboard with that story. Even just trying to connect the two stories meaningfully... because Drunkman failed so spectacularly...

I like The Closer Look's YouTube video arguing how the story works wonders as an adapted TV series that can give the perspectives they need to give the story scope. Much better than a video game that has to frame the game through a couple perspectives at most.

I say this because TLoU tried to pull a grand perspective shift and failed because it disrespected the player and played then for sympathy, constantly trying to twist them into hating the protagonists...

I don't know if it's possible to salvage TLoU2. But I think if anybody can do it, it's Mazin. And I can believe it's going to take 2 seasons to get there. I'm praying they can find two complete stories that fill in the gaps of story in the game. With what I've seen of S1, I'm at least hopeful they got a shot."
The English Game,"Naughty Dog needs to get on finishing its story.

I'm getting Game of Thrones flashbacks."
The English Game,"God I'm actually low-key dreading them adapting LoU2, if only cos we're gonna get a repeat of all the awful discourse surrounding it, which among other things led to actresses/creators getting death threats, the Last of Us sub devolving into another redpill/gamergate hive and has even infected this very thread when I scrolled towards the bottom comments, only this time it won't just be contained to gaming sites."
The English Game,"Last episode sucked though, they cut way too much and it felt rushed."
The English Game,"They are going to have to. I think they start losing viewers once they >!kill Joel off, so hopefully he stays alive for most of if not all of season 2!<"
The English Game,"Lol they speed run/drag their feet through the beloved first game in one season, but now want to drag out the maligned and controversial second in multiple seasons? 
Yeah ok makes perfect sense üòÇ"
The English Game,Hopefully with better pacing. My expectations are pretty low because season 1 was kind of weird.
The English Game,"Yeah, I loved the game but felt it was a couple hours too long: condensing all of that into 9 episodes would be a nightmare."
The English Game,"Game 2 seems to be a passion project of Druckmann based on the way he presents the game. I‚Äôm not surprised that he‚Äôs basically brushing aside the first game to start work on the second. 

I‚Äôm curious to see how it will be adapted considering the gameplay in game 2 is what held it up, not the story. Maybe he‚Äôll listen to criticism and change up the way the story was presented, but he‚Äôs been pretty bullheaded and doesn‚Äôt seem like the kinda guy who think he can do wrong."
The English Game,First game should also have been two seasons honestly.
The English Game,"I mean hell, I thought the game was over and then it switched perspectives

Then I thought it was over *again*, and it switched perspectives *again*

They‚Äôll definitely go the GOT route and have rotating perspectives or else people will tune out when season 3 doesn‚Äôt feature anyone you really know. It would be like if they made season 4 of GOT with *only* the parts about Dorne in the books."
The English Game, Shoulda done that for part 1 too
The English Game,I LOVED the narrative of TLoU. I couldn't finish TLoU2.
The English Game,This'll be a beautiful trainwreck. The discourse will happen again cause they'll double down.
The English Game,"Because they know ""you know what"" is going to turn people away and they want to delay it as much as possible"
The English Game,They‚Äôre adding to the show to keep certain characters on screen for longer.
The English Game,"I don't get all the excitement and hub-bub about this show. I'm up to episode 6. I mean, it's good, and I definitely didn't expect Nick Offerman to make me cry, but..... It's just a rehash of The Walking Dead, no?"
The English Game,"if the seasons are only 10 episodes, that's unsurprising"
The English Game,"honestly this first part should of been two seasons it felt so rushed yet it had entire pointless filter episodes about characters that had 5 minute in the game. 

Would of really liked to see more of the infected as a threat.  They really felt like a non threat. And while the game is almost Post - Post apocalypses where humaning it coming back around and the biggest threat to humans is humans.  They (infecteD)  really felt like almost a complete non threat ."
The English Game,"Why not just do a longer season? Remember when shows used to have like 24 episodes a season? I get wanting to cut costs, cut filler, etc., but it really feels like with a lot of the shorter season shows nowadays that you lose so much character development by only having 10 episodes to work with. We just don‚Äôt know anything about characters anymore. There is no room for the relationship between character and audience to just take a breath together."
The English Game,"It's going to need some reworking. The plot in TLOU2 was pushed along by the characters trying to out stupid each other, it was infuriating. I finished the game hoping that they all die."
The English Game,Milk it baby.
The English Game,"Just don‚Äôt nerf the violence from the second game. Don‚Äôt want them softening it up, the second game was amazing"
The English Game,"Part 2 is a story that's undermined by and undermines its medium, If done well it will shine and be appreciated much more in the TV show."
The English Game,"If they >!kill Joel like they did in the game,!< I will stop watching the show right then and there."
The English Game,Redo season 1 as 3 seasons. I feel like the sped through it.
The English Game,Last episode was ass
The English Game,Gotta milkü•õthat intellectual property.
The English Game,"I wish they had done this for season 1 instead. It felt so rushed, and I was in no hurry to get to the story of the second game.

The stakes are so low compared to saving humanity from Game 1, and I hated what they made the character of Ellie become, and disagreed with her motivations for most of the story. It had all the sensibilities of a Rambo movie wrapped in a pretentious bubble, and had none of the heart of the original."
The English Game,No thanks
The English Game,"I hope they change the order of some events. Whilst I think it had the basis for a fantastic game, the pacing and structure left so much to be desired. I just didn't care what happened because of the way it was. They kept trying to force this one thing on you and I didn't care."
The English Game,They did this exactly backwards.  They should've made TLOU at least 2 seasons.  The adventures of Joel & Ellie is what people wanted.
The English Game,Could have easily done that with season one too
The English Game,"This was clearly the plan, all along. Rush to Part II quickly."
The English Game,"Hopefully, ""adapt"" means change that story completely"
The English Game,"People are thinking that the next seasons are going to be as negatively divisive as the second game was.  I think this may be incorrect.

1. Hopefully they will have learned their lesson from the games and keep everyone in character this time.  This was a preventable problem with the game that could have been solved with better writing.  So with a little luck, they can solve the problem here.
2. We can have a bit more time to build up the new characters.  It's hard to do that in a game where everyone really wants to get back to playing the characters they know.  
3. This format may be much more forgiving to the story they wanted to tell.  One of the problems that turned many people off was being forced to play as someone you felt was the enemy.  That is tricky to pull off.  But we are used to seeing different points of view in shows.  Cersei was a fan favorite despite being, well, Cersei.  

We'll see how they handle it."
The English Game,"So wait‚Ä¶. If I watch the last episode of season one tonight, I don‚Äôt need the game?"
The English Game,"Excellent. The game itself has cliffhangers within cliffhangers, it‚Äôs only right the show leaves us wanting more as well. All the stories and character arcs might not feel rushed"
The English Game,So they could drag out that crappy storyline? Ugh!
The English Game,They should have did that with the first video game
The English Game,"The second season is just going to be the rattlers subplot confirmed.

/s"
The English Game,"I hope they can make it a little more compelling than the game, just because it is hard to follow game/season 1. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I think it‚Äôs a good story but it felt dragged out"
The English Game,Could honesty be 3 season if they are are short as season 1. 9 episodes with 2 being self contained flashbacks made it fly by.
The English Game,"I‚Äôm really curious/excited to see how they adapt this game. I‚Äôm a huge fan of part 2 but I think by far the worst aspect of it is the pacing and a lot of that was down to how the story was structured, so I wonder if they‚Äôre gonna change that for this show."
The English Game,Gotta stretch that oooouuuuuttttt mang.
She,"She killed Dipper? Damn, there goes the Gravity Falls crossover"
She,Couple therapy...
She,TIL Melanie Lynskey is John Ritter‚Äôs daughter in law
She,Ahhh. Jason Ritter. The guy it took me longer than I'll admit to realize that he isn't James Marsden
She,TIL that Melanie Lynskey is not American.
She,His dad was one of my favorite comedic actors
She,Jason is one of the nicest people to work with in film. Raising Dion may not have had much success but damn it was fun to help make that show with him. Glad he's still going forward with more stunt work.
She,She was great in Fireflies. Edit: Yellowjackets.
She,TIL that Melanie Lynskey is married to Jason Ritter.
She,"> as the survivors are attacked by a herd of clickers, which is the show‚Äôs name for the terrifying former humans who are now controlled by a parasitic fungus that was mutated by global warming. 

Ugh, Clickers are a specific type of infected, not every one is a Clicker. Clickers are the ones with their heads completely covered, they can't see anything but have exceptional hearing - they navigate by making clicking sounds."
She,Nepo Zombie
She,"I‚Äôve never been more pleased with watching a character get her face eaten off by a rambunctious preteen hoped up on fungus

She delivered that part fantastically and I hated her maliciousness."
She,isn't this the chick from two and a half men
She,"""The 'Yellowjackets' star had a guest-starring role in the second season of the hit HBO series.""

Am I taking crazy pills or is this stupidly wrong."
She,"That's a solid blood line: existential crisis that results in subtle personal growth or some equally poignant but violent outburst, then trip over a couch before getting some strange at the Regal Beagle"
She,Ive seen her in a few things and when i saw her on a talk show yesterday i was so surprised she had an accent. Im always impressed at how good they get at hiding it.
She,"She‚Äôs an INCREDIBLE actress!!! Loved her in Good Girls, Candy , Yellow Jackets just to name a few. I love her grit and dead pan humor. Amazing that she‚Äôs a NZ native!!!!"
She,Y'all do realize it was all pretend? She played a character and he played another character? This would only demonstrate how much they like one another.
She,"Wow, we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for ""news"" aren't we?"
She,She is one of my favorite actresses.  I loved her in that HBO show with the guy from the league.
She,"Jason looks every bit the spitting image of his dad. Perfect for a 3's Company remake, but I also don't want it because it wouldn't be in the spirit of the original."
She,Jason Ritter is a wholesome dude. I miss his dad.
She,"Omg I didn't realize she was in this, I adore her. I was planning to watch already but definitely will now."
She,She was the weakest character in the show.
She,kathleen was sucha lame character
She,Spoilers in title smh
She,Love Yellow Jackets too!
She,She was wrongly cast for that part in the show. Didn‚Äôt fit at all.
She,"She didn‚Äôt work for me in the role. Just took me right out of the story whenever she was onscreen. I get that they were trying to cast against type, a normally nice woman driven to ugly extremes because of trauma, etc, but it just didn‚Äôt work IMO."
She,"there were only a few missteps from this show and her character was one of them. felt like a character from a bad walking dead season, totally out of place with the vibe of the rest of the show."
She,That‚Äôs a reveal? We‚Äôve truly run out of things to talk about.
She,I liked all the changes they added to the show‚Ä¶.EXCEPT HER
She,She did a good job in TLOU.  Made me absolutely despise her character.
She,I love this.
She,"I love how excited he is about her projects. Candy, Yellowjackets, this. They‚Äôre so sweet and you can tell how supportive of her work he is."
She,"Lovely performance on both sides, I‚Äôd say."
She,I love them so much
She,I love shit like this!
She,Another Canada shot show that had main cast's family in smaller roles. It's an interesting way to get around the regulations
She,Cathartic; most likely
She,Umm spoiler?
She,She has a great voice.
She,"TIL 

&#x200B;

Jack Ritters (RIP) son Jason is married to Melanie"
She,"What dedication to acting, letting fungi infect her husband and then shooting him dead"
She,Her acting was really bad
She,"She was pretty awful lol. Least menacing ‚Äúscary leader‚Äù ever with a dumb backstory completely centered around Dead Unseen NPC #15382. 

Show‚Äôs pacing was a nightmare in an otherwise solidly crafted show and that whole side plot was a huge offender."
She,"Who asked? Easily the lousiest acting and character arch of the season. She, nor the series, benefited from her casting in this role‚Ä¶ just an honest evaluation."
She,Worst character in the show imo. Least likely person in the apocalypse to become leader
She,Worst and least believable character in the show.
She,"This was one of the most recent memorable miscastings I can recall from a television show. 

Great actress - Just atrocious for this role."
She,She was easily the worst character in the show
She,"She was Probably the only negative i have for the show. Her voice was unbearable, couldn‚Äôt wait for her to die"
She,"Can anyone recommend some of her performances? Ngl she was one of the few characters in LOU that didn‚Äôt make sense for me, it just didn‚Äôt seem like she was in any form of character. There were moments that I could see what she was going for, but many others where her acting took me right out of the drama and made me feel like I was watching a bad Walking Dead episode."
She,She was the absolute worst character in this entire show by far... (acting wise)
She,[deleted]
She,"I absolutely love Melanie Lynskey‚Ä¶.she‚Äôs excellent in everything she‚Äôs in (even though we didn‚Äôt really need to see much of her or her group in this season Last of Us. 

It was a nice diversion for sure, and a great little story line - but would have rathered more Joel and Ellis stuff!"
She,She was so bad. I‚Äôm sorry but she was
She,"""quick, need to fill our TLOU news quota for the day"""
She,So?
She,Meh show
She,She was the worst character in the show
She,Is that Rose on Two and a Half Men? Looks like her
She,Jason Ritter has such a doofus face.
She,üòêüëçüèª
She,"Two and a half men crazy lady, right?"
She,I had no idea they were married
She,Why is this trending?
She,"I‚Äôm sorry, but who gives a shit?"
She,"Jason Ritter is an awesome person, only good things to say about him."
She,"Am i the only person who's buy-in to this post apocalyptic world was completely destroyed when the leader of this brutal faction was revealed to be a midwestern Karen? It was zero percent believable. I enjoyed the show. I actually cried when Joel asked Tommy to take Ellie. When Neil is actually focused on the story, he's pretty good. But when he's distracted by.... other priorities... it really hurts the whole product."
She,She did a horrible job in the Last one of us.
She,Who cares?
She,"This is just tabloid nothings. 

Also, her character was the weakest, unfortunately I didn‚Äôt hate her because she was so mean or whatever‚Ä¶ I hated her for being extremely unconvincing and just an element that was unnecessary to exist. 

‚ÄúOohh but her husband was in the show as well!‚Äù‚Äî- published over a month after we alllll forgot about her üíÄ"
She,Why would you remind the world of one of the most horrible miscasts in Hollywood history?
She,Worst performance of the show. Woefully miscast and horribly executed.
She,I kinda liked how poor of a fit she seemed for her role. I felt like it made sense for the context of her being someone who kinda ended up in charge in a place where the rest of the attempts at law and order were pushed out.
She,"The game was better hands down, idk what this crap is, but i beat it on ps4."
She,"She was fantastic in this role.  Check out her episode as a sweet voiced sociopath in ""the shield"" too."
She,She was awful. How did she get cast in that role?
She,Worst actress ever
She,Man I hate that the show wasted so much time on this annoying character
She,"Ngl, I think her character was maybe the weakest part of the whole show"
She,"She was poorly cast. Loved her in ‚ÄúHeavenly Creatures‚Äù when she was a teen, but she was unconvincing on ‚ÄúThe Last of Us.‚Äù"
She,What an absolute bombshell of a reveal ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
She,"Is she considered famous enough for being a ""guest star""? She's borderline an actor you know you know but don't remember where from. It took me a while for me to recognise her from don't look up.

I don't know how good she is in yellowjackets but her performance on Last of Us was really poor and unconvincing. I really don't get all the praise She's getting for that part.."
She,Slow news day huh
She,Who the fuck cares
She,"""Revealed"" or just casually mentioned in an interview. I hate modern journalism..."
She,"Wow, slow news day. Who cares?"
She,Ok
She,This isn‚Äôt an old show. Careful with the spoilers
She,Most screen time as a Karen award goes to!
She,She was trash on the show
She,Ass character. Wasn‚Äôt threatening or intimidating.
She,Terribly miscast; wooden and unconvincing dialogue; wholly forgettable performance that was distracting and unnecessary in a stirring and emotional episode.
She,wtf... jason could do sooooo much better
She,anyone else despise her casting and story arc?
She,Probably some of the worst acting from a person I‚Äôve ever seen from a high budget television show
She,Worst actor in the series so far. All her scenes were so unbelievable that she would be the leader of her group. I was happy she was killed off in 2 episodes.
She,Glad this idiot got taken out in the series.
Dare Me,"Wasn't due to lack of promotion. It was just another teen drama among a hundred others. Mildly interesting, nothing special."
Dare Me,The show was advertised during every commercial break for Raw.
Dare Me,pffffttt. Raw? Who the hell watching Raw? lol. That's a whole different demographic than what this would appeal to.
Dare Me,"I really enjoyed this, kind of annoyed it didn't get renewed :/"
Dare Me,"I was a HUGE fan of this book, but after watching a couple episodes of the show, I‚Äôm not sure it translates well onto the screen:/"
Dare Me,I enjoyed it. Wish Netflix would pick it up.
Dare Me,"Oh, yay! I can finally finish it. I was watching it while it aired, but there were several weeks where I'd just forget it was on, even though I liked it. haha"
Dare Me,I‚Äôm glad! I‚Äôve wanted to watch it for a while now but they only had the first three episodes on Hulu. Now I can finally watch the whole season.
Dare Me,I liked this show
Dare Me,Does this end on a cliffhanger or does the season have a satisfying end?
Dare Me,"I like this show, but the marine recruiter's hair is too long for someone in the military. It's not realistic. Plus the other marines saluted him in one scene, but he isn't an officer, he is just an enlisted sergeant. TV Shows should really do their research. It's not that hard. (I used to be in the military.)"
Dare Me,"It's wishful thinking, hopefully it gets popular on Netflix"
Dare Me,"It's def not for everyone... I just learned after the book's release, the original plan was for a movie starring Natalie Portman (6 ish years ago). I'm hoping by some miracle, the show gets a resurgence on Netflix. I plan on reading the book within a year or two though"
Dare Me,Enjoy!
Dare Me,Enjoy!
Dare Me,Solid soundtrack as well
Dare Me,Sadly cliffhanger leaving the viewer with more questions
Dare Me,"Agreed!

Shame it didn't get an S2."
Dare Me,But it's still worth watching for the suspense.
Dare Me,"That's the hope, if it does well on Netflix, you never know"
Dare Me,[deleted]
Dare Me,I won't be shocked if this is Netflix's next hit.
Dare Me,I liked this show
Dare Me,"Very worth watching, even if just one and done."
Dare Me,"It's on netflix here in Australia from the get go. I don't know anyone else who's watched it, even though the lead is aussie, maybe because it came out at about the same times as Cheer, Spinning Out and another one. I like it though, a B- Euphoria"
Dare Me,Really liked it. Hoping Netflix picks it up
Dare Me,"Ffs, this was a good show, and its ratings weren't bad. They were significantly better than *Briarpatch*'s ‚Äî a bad show ‚Äî and if that's renewed I'll be super-pissed. And Netflix was helping to defer much of *Dare Me*'s not-huge costs."
Dare Me,"They basically went to the end of the book and stopped short of the ending, so it's questionable how they were going to stretch out another season anyway."
Dare Me,"üò≥ no... no.... nooooooooooooo! wtf is this!!???? üò§üò§

edit: Gawddammit. One of the few teen-dramas i've enjoyed this year. Great cinematography, dope soundtrack, thrilling story with a dab of mystery. Amma need Netflix to make a YA series about cheerleading or gymnastics real soon. This is just awful news for me. üò©"
Dare Me,"Good.

It is nice to see this shit off the air."
Dare Me,"When I saw ""USA Network"", I thought to myself, ""Wow, THERE'S a name I haven't heard in ages!"". Then again, I got rid of cable TV a little over a decade ago."
Dare Me,They would be crazy not to pick it up as an original. It‚Äôs really good.
Dare Me,I thought it was a Netflix original. It's already on Netflix in my country.
Dare Me,"Yeah I'm surprised this didn't get S2. It's like Big Little Lies but in high school.

Edit: not being sarcastic, I enjoyed the show."
Dare Me,[deleted]
Dare Me,They actually had a good chunk of the book left. There‚Äôs a lot more revealed about Addy and Beth‚Äôs relationship as well as how Coach and her husband went about doing what they did. They were most likely building to some cheer camp flashbacks considering all the hinting they did throughout the season.
Dare Me,Does this show end on a cliffhanger?
Dare Me,Their music selection and cinematography was bang on. I was really into it the last 3 eps.
Dare Me,"Mr. Robot is a very very good USA show, definitely worth a watch. Suits was also pretty fun, not as high quality IMO as Mr. Robot but I still enjoyed it."
Dare Me,It was a cheap Euphoria wannabe. It will die here.
Dare Me,"I think any assumed sarcasm has to do with the fact that Pretty Little Liars is a high school show

Unless you meant Big Little Lies maybe?"
Dare Me,"> Yeah I'm surprised this didn't get S2. 

Shows on USA with lower ratings:

Mr Robot (ended)

Pearson (cancelled)

Not that much of a surprise. Anecdotally it did alright on Netflix internationally though. At least I saw it in their top 10 for a weak or two."
Dare Me,there are dozens of us!
Dare Me,"Is there? All that's left is to reveal who did it and I'm not even sure it's a spoiler to say who, because audiences will have narrowed it down and figured it out by now. How much longer can they stretch it? 

The Addy and Beth thing factors in but how many flashbacks of Beth sneaking around do they need? And they basically need an episode or two based on the style of the show, to do the remainder of their story and bring it to a close. 

They've already shown things that happen in the final chapters."
Dare Me,"Yes.

It's a cliff hanger they tease for nearly the entire season too, and then don't fully reveal it."
Dare Me,I meant Big Little Lies. Whoops.
Dare Me,You said Big LIttle Lies.... you weren't wrong
Dare Me,"Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not a teen anymore, but I don‚Äôt have the patience for characters like Beth. That whole sociopathic-because-I‚Äôm-broken, always trying to play games and be sexy makes me cringe. I‚Äôm enjoying it so much because it‚Äôs entertaining, but damn, she‚Äôs annoying."
Dare Me,Euphoria x Bring it on x Assassination Nation
Dare Me,"trailer makes it look like a bootleg Euphoria, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not from these reactikns"
Dare Me,"As someone who read the book, it doesn't compare. Though it's still good."
Dare Me,[deleted]
Dare Me,"I am not a fan of Beth but trying to make other girl fall down because the coach made her be top of the pymaid is kind of dangerous but good thing other girl made sure she didn't fall. I understand you don't like your half-sister but she not blame for the situation her dad is. 

This series reminds me of Friday Night lights because it's shot without color correction. 

Making a guy go down on her after he pushes her head for a blowjob was some amusing shit. I completely found that amusing. You could tell a female writer pitched that idea.

What a way to find out the only reason he got the job as the stadium manager is that they wanted his wife to coach the high school cheerleader squad. 

I am very disappointed with the ending I really thought she was going to be a good influence on the girls but cheating on your husband is sad. it seems all the females' characters in this series are damaged in one way or another."
Dare Me,No idea what to expect but let's do this.
Dare Me,I saw this before the premiere and I was throughly entertained. Excited to see where this goes because its obviously going to get darker later on.
Dare Me,üëÄ
Dare Me,Thoughts?
Dare Me,i‚Äôm so here for ittttt
Dare Me,MAD DOG REPRESENT
Dare Me,bit late to the party but anyone else notice the soundtrack featuring indie Australian artists? Courtney Barnett and Stella Donnelly both!
Dare Me,"Okay, spoiler alert although I‚Äôm guessing if we‚Äôre here is because we‚Äôve all seen the show by now. 
I just finished it and.... halfway through the last episode I suspected that her husband was in the middle of it too. Poor Will, felt bad for the guy, besides, what was the point of Codette and Matt in killing him, I thought that all she wanted was for her husband not to find out but.... he ended up helping her covering the murder. Or maybe he followed them there, caught them in the act and in a moment of fury he shot him and codette helped him cover it up. 

ALSO how did Beth know the she left the bracelet behind????"
Dare Me,"Same, even more frustrating is when other characters put up with it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just how she is...‚Äù. Like, how do you point a loaded gun at someone and everyone is like, ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs just standard Beth!‚Äù"
Dare Me,Are you planning on watching future episodes?
Dare Me,Not sure where it's going at all but I think this sums up the first episode pretty well.
Dare Me,There's a book!
Dare Me,She reminds me of Effy from Skins
Dare Me,"Google Aidra Fox then and u will love it, they look like sisters"
Dare Me,Same producer. Pete Berg!
Dare Me,I love me a good teen drama
Dare Me,"Seems kind of predictable so far, but I'll tune in next week. Who was that guy the Coach was with at the end? Just some random student, or did I miss something?"
Dare Me,yes! i was actuallyso suprised but heartwarmed
Dare Me,Exactly! That‚Äôs not realistic at all! And completely unacceptable
Dare Me,Yes. I still plan to watch :)
Dare Me,Yes !! And it is VERY good. Megan Abbott has a talent for storytelling.
Dare Me,"I'm usually not the teen drama type, not anymore at least, but this looked dark and intriguing."
Dare Me,"I only got a quick look, but I *think*  he was the military guy all the girls were trying to hook up with. I could be wrong though. 

And yeah it looks a little predictable, but I have a feeling the predictability is intentional and the show will throw us some twists. I hope, at least. Overall it seems decent."
Dare Me,"That's awesome, I have a new book to read!"
Dare Me,I get Assassination Nation vibes for some reason
Dare Me,"If you read the book, Addy is an unreliable narrator so I would expect twists."
Dare Me,I must've missed the connection to the military guy as to why she's banging him. I guess it'll be revealed later on?
Dare Me,"Same, that was a fantastic movie."
Dare Me,"Okay found the episode in my On Demand and skimmed through the ending. It was definitely the army guy, and also I'm guessing he is either a senior or a recruiter, because a few mins prior he refers to another girl as ""jailbait"", so he is most likely of-age. But the fact still remains that the Coach cheated on her husband and Beth has it on video."
Dare Me,"It may not be him, but in any case, I think the main point was that she was cheating on her husband, and having relations with someone who may or may not be underage. I'm not quite sure, the scene happened so quick. But my main takeaway was that now Beth has dirt to blackmail her with."
Dare Me,AGREED!
Dare Me,"I unironically agree with this. It‚Äôs without a doubt the best episode of anything I‚Äôve watched so far this year. I‚Äôve been watching the show but haven‚Äôt been *super* into it up until this episode, but this was something else. Beth‚Äôs perspective was one of the most gut-wrenching things I‚Äôve watched in a long time."
Dare Me,I am LOVING this show. Too bad it seems like no one on Earth has heard of it.
Dare Me,USA has been killing it lately.
Dare Me,"One of my favorite things about this episode, something I hope everyone noticed, was Beth's line delivery. The way she spoke each line was different depending on whether it was from Addy's perspective or her perspective. She said the same words, but from her perspective everything sounded softer and more docile, there was no attitude. This can mean one of two things, either Beth is unaware of how harsh she comes across, due to her issues and things she's struggling with, or Addy hears everything Beth says more malicious and harsh than it actually is, because Addy is paranoid. Or, most likely, a combination of both. Either way, it was great to have that insight into Beth's mind."
Dare Me,I‚Äôve been meaning to watch this show. I heard so little about it but what I have heard has been good.
Dare Me,I'm going to check this show out purely as a thank you to USA Network for the incredible roller coaster that was *Mr. Robot*.
Dare Me,"It's a combo of Euphoria, Sharp Objects, Big Little Lies, and some other shows. It started off iffy but it's picking up steam."
Dare Me,"As a long-time David Lynch fan, I can say that this show is nothing like any of his works. I like this show but it seems insulting to compare the two."
Dare Me,Is this a limited series?
Dare Me,They cancelled colony :(
Dare Me,No
Dare Me,"Oh dang, I thought it was a miniseries as well. Loving the show but feels like a 1 season mystery show like Sharp Objects."
Dare Me,"A sports drama produced by peter Berg? Sign me up, coach.

Also I think USA did this eaely free release for Mr robot, and that got me hooked."
Dare Me,"First review - OP if you watch would be curious if you feel similar. Will watch, USA gets at least another half dozen misses for anything that doesn‚Äôt feel Blue Sky / Suitsy

Dare Me,Watched and really liked where it was headed. Hope they keep the same pace.
Dare Me,Never heard of it. May have to check it out
The Letter for the King,"I liked the show overall, if they continue probably going to watch it, but that ending was kind of anticlimactic.

SPOILER

I was expecting a boss fight or something, but they were just staring at each other."
The Letter for the King,"My biggest question is why did the birds attack Tiuri in the beginning? It's like they gave the girl the powers halfway through the show thinking that was a good plot twist, but it just made previous things that happened not make sense at all."
The Letter for the King,"The first 3 episodes were enjoyable, but the entire story is in no way an adaptation from the original book, they share the title and character names, that's it. Netflix had its way with the story and had to tick the boxes for strong independent female protagonist, multiracial inclusion, LGBTI and sobby teenage love drama, all of which are not in the book.

However, this is fine, but the plot has so many holes... The magic where/why/what? and especially the sudden twist of who wields it makes absolutely no sense. Before there was at least a story around it with shamans and shit. The way the plot twist comes around gave me the impression that somebody suddenly improvised on set and thought it was a good idea, but it makes no sense and this also results in an absolute garbage ending, maybe the worst I have ever seen. Also, the only good character in the series is the horse.

Tl;Dr the series is an insult to the book and its story. The name should be removed from the series. Nobody would notice any resemblance with the book anyway."
The Letter for the King,Why do like 80 % of Netflix shows seem to have a teenager as a protagonist? It gets a bit tireing that the majority of new Netflix shows have some element of teenager angst in it.
The Letter for the King,Might like it if I was a teenager..
The Letter for the King,"This is clearly a show for children so I enjoyed it for what it was, but that ending was terrible and six episodes just aren't enough to flesh out multiple characters and make you become invested in what they're doing. I like the plot twist because it adds layers to the Tiuri and Lavinia characters and their relationship. Tiuri is the chosen one but she's his protector which is why the horse takes him to her and why he always finds her when he's in danger. The villain was very boring, he literally just sits and stares with a menacing look the entire time. They didn't really need to introduce gay characters just to kill one of them off. It is a nice little family adventure show but they need to improve the writing and extend the show to 10 episodes."
The Letter for the King,I actually kinda got pissed when it turned out the girl had the powers. We went the entire show with this guy getting visions and having an unknown power only for a random girl to get it. So what are tieris powers?
The Letter for the King,this show was the worst time waste ever tbh only kept on watching cus of the setting/scenery
The Letter for the King,"I liked it. By far not as good as the books, and it's annoying that even though she had the powers, his visions were never explained. Also the main danger to Tiuri is his own stupidity for like 4/6 episodes. 

I still liked it though, and Ruby Serkis in particular did a great job. 

The real protagonist is Arlenwen (?) though (the horse).

Edit: It irks me that neither the horse (understandably), nor Lavinia got any visible reward. Yes, she wore a nice dress at the end and stood next to the crown prince, but this is like chewie not getting his medal all over again!"
The Letter for the King,I feel bad for Tonke Dragt. To see your work butchered like that
The Letter for the King,"I liked it at first... but the twist just made me feel stupid for liking it. Then the ending just threw out all realism for drama... Tuiri has the magical abiliy to navigate any castle or some shit and after all the effort to sneak in Lavina just walked in unopposed. By the end I was just hate watching what a stupid show,"
The Letter for the King,"I really enjoyed the first episode, second was ok, and then it just became awful. I really can‚Äôt stand most of the characters, I don‚Äôt get why Lavinia has magic when Tiuri had magical experiences before he even met her, the bury your gays trope is embarrassing at this point, I just really didn‚Äôt like it. I thought the actors were good and I loved the scenery but the storyline was just bad. I know this thread is mostly dead but I‚Äôm so disgusted I had to vent here."
The Letter for the King,"This is horrific. I don't know what it has in common with the novel from Tonke Dragt besides the names and base idea.

The Letter for the King is a book about an untrained honourable young knight who gets thrown in way over his head and scrambles through a massive journey of fear, lonelyness and constant vigilance finding friends beside the road when he doesn't expect it.

This adaptation is a fucking insult to what Tonke Dragt wrote. Compared to this the Hobbit movies (all of them...) are a stroke of genius."
The Letter for the King,"The acting is a bit wooden. It's like they just did one take and said ""that'll do."""
The Letter for the King,"I really liked it up till episode 6. I know it's very different from the book but I can respect that. And I was actually enjoying a lot of the changes. However, fuck the bury your gays trope they had in the last episode. I get that you want representation and it would've been really cool to see Jussipo's and Foldo's relationship grow, but don't kill him off mere moments after he came out. They really did Jussipo dirty, when imo it would make much more sense to have Arman die if they really needed someone to. Making the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good would've actually completed his arc of doubting Tiuri all the time but eventually trusting him.

Also the last episode doesn't make any sense at all. Suddenly Tiuri can magically find his way anywhere? There's also so many unexplained plot points, like what happened to Tiuri's mom? She warned the queen of Dagomar, so she must've known what was going on, right? What happened to the scryer of prince viridian after he made her eyes turn black? Why was Tiuri hearing voices and how is Lavinia magical but Tiuri not? 

Then there's the thing about the magic. Tiuri doesn't have a lot going for him except for the fact that he might have magical powers. And then, last minute it's taken away from him. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for women empowerement, but this just feels like bad writing to me. I thought they were going to pull a last plot twist and say they were both born with magic, but no... 

Then, at last there is the final scene which was just so anticlimactic. Lavinia shows up, basically has a staring competition with prince viridian, who we've not seen nearly enough of to be a decent villain except that he killed a shaman, his shadows nearly engulf her but her light eventually breaks through and he just kind of dissolves into nothingness. What? I was honestly laughing through that whole scene because it felt so dumb.

I really liked the series but I think they should've taken way more time developing their story and characters. It's really a shame because it had a lot of potential which I feel is wasted because of that last episode."
The Letter for the King,"This really is for young kids over the age of 10 because as an adult i was bored. 

If you got kids at home stick this on and have 6 hours free"
The Letter for the King,im confused did the girl steal the power from the boy or what
The Letter for the King,"From what i remember about the first book, i was expecting a series about lonesome travel with dangerous encounters, friends and foe met along the way, and a happy ending.

Instead, Tiuri is hyped up to be a magic-doped version of himself in the book, but then the show lets you down ???

The only upside is that Tiuri makes it to the King despite not having powers, like in the book.

I don't think the Eviellan=magic is a bad idea, but then the show needs to follow that, and not give all the magic to non-eviellans.

The show had the scenery for a good travel story, but dropped the ball when it came to the characters..."
The Letter for the King,King of Unauwen: You will marry my son and then my sons will both have thrones. *glug glug* It's foolproof because no brother has every fought his brother in all of history. *glug* My mind is so sharp. *backpat glug*
The Letter for the King,"Why wasn't Armin's father executed for killing Tiuri's father and setting his castle on fire.

Why wasn't Jussepo given post-mortem honours after the bunch were knighted?

Where is Tiuri's mother? Shouldn't she be watching her son become a knight?

Tiuri is a direct descendant of a Shaman, why wasn't he able to use magic in the final fight?

Why didn't the King give them rewards for saving his kingdom?

What was up with the Queen's eyes turning black, does that mean the evil is inside her?

Does Eviellan exist anymore?"
The Letter for the King,"It was entertaining...but it's pretty weird how you can tell it's meant to be a light-hearted social justice medieval fastasy show but they try to throw in serious tones as well, which just makes it confusing and weird and lowers the quality.  

A non-netflix adaptation of this coulda been pretty good.  One where they don't force racial diversity or gay scenes into the series for no reason other than to appease the far left crowd."
The Letter for the King,"Couldn't bare to watch past second episode. This is almost a compilation of everything shitty about teenage shows/movies:

- Teenager gets out of death situation via deus ex machina 5 times per episode
- Villains are dumb and let teenage protagonists get away inexplicably
- Sentient pet
- Gore doesn't exist, you die is someone vaguely caresses you with a weapon

Even if I was a teenager, that would pisses me off. What a waste of money."
The Letter for the King,"Not to sound sexist but when I found out that the girl was actually the one who that was prophesied about, I was so disappointed it was NOT a pleasant surprise.  I'm not saying this because it was a girl, I am saying because it was so unexpected that it just made no sense. One of the worst plot twists that I've ever seen on a tv show. I mean, why make a character seem so important only to pull the rug under us and just kill the anticipation that was building? probably the worst tv shows I've watched this year. Just to add, I would like to point out the bad and good in terms of character development.

 Tiuri: I actually liked him as a character and the actor carried the role well, but my only issue is that his character wasn't developed enough, and near the end of the series, it just gave the impression that it wasn't even a main character.

 Lavinia: To me, one of the only character that did get a decent character development but her story was just all over the place and they should have given her a better story. The fact that she turned out the one with powers just made no sense to me.

 Iona: The writers tried too hard to make this character multi-dimensional only to make a huge mess of her. They rushed with her and they made her into the bad guy (or girl) but it just didn't convince me. It could be due to bad acting but throughout the series, she did not give off that kind of vibe and it made no sense when she showed her ""true"" colours

 Arman: I actually enjoyed his character and he probably has one of the best character development the entire show. Although it was predictable, but his development actually made sense.

Foldo and jussipo: Again, it came out of nowhere and none of them had any chemistry. 

.Piak : I loved the little guy, I wished they had given him more screen time. 

 Prince Viridian: This is probably the most interesting character in the entire show. His character had potential sadly, it got killed off too soon. His death scene was too quick. Someone THAT powerful should not have died that quickly."
The Letter for the King,"Watched it all, but thought it was pretty bad to be honest. 

The acting was quite bad for the most part. The story was bland and very predictable, minus that plot twist which was not predictable but still bland. The dialogue was uninteresting, even when they tried to be ""deep"" with Tiuri and that crazy dude who tried to help his heavy heart or something. No worldbuilding that's worth mentioning. It seemed like they tried to add some political intrige, but even that wasn't interesting. Most characters were also boring to be honest. No depth at all. 

I also really wonder what the point was of adapting the book, considering they changed almost everything and added a horrible magic component. Might as well have made this a completely original show."
The Letter for the King,[deleted]
The Letter for the King,"Watched it. Well the acting is not that good.The plot is predictable for most of the story albeit the second to last episode. IT has a plot twist which is still nothing special.
There was one smaller battle scene I think in episode 2 which was decent. Everything else was boring and forgettable.
I believe this show to be too juvenile and uneventful although barely watchable."
The Letter for the King,"I watched it out of curiosity, I was bewildered when they straight up copied the melody for the song that one kid with the lute sings in the second episode (Giuseppe?).  the real song is In Hell Ill Be In Good Company by The Dead South and its almost a tone for tone match.  Wonder if they got permission?"
The Letter for the King,Well that was anticlimactic.
The Letter for the King,"Is anyone else annoyed by the travel? Tiuri travels, on horse, for days, but the knights show up with Iona within minutes? 

Like, people are just walking around the entire kingdom faster than this kid on a horse."
The Letter for the King,"Like most of you guys have said, the side characters made the show for me. I wish they devoted more screen time to the group of ragtag failed knights who were hunting their ‚Äúbad‚Äù comrade for redemption. (I mean, their entire plotline in episode 3 was walk in snow, get avalanched, wake up.)

And what happened to my boy Jabroot. He had so little screen time and his character could‚Äôve literally been done away without any difference to the plot but that was what made me like him. He gave Viridian some dimension, and there was quite some depth and untold history to his character too.

I‚Äôd give them a second chance, just to see a season two."
The Letter for the King,"So just finished it too...
It was beautiful done mostly the plot was generally weak but the finale... It was horrible. Why associate it with the book if it doesnt have anything really in common?
If you want a more modern story with strong female main character than adapt stories like that"
The Letter for the King,If Lavinia had such immense power why in the frick did she let Jussipo die instead of healing him? I was really happy about him and Foldo and just wanted them to have a happily ever after. This made me cry
The Letter for the King,"Welp, this is trash."
The Letter for the King,"Currently on episode 2 so far. It's pretty good, but there is one element that could make it from ""good"" to ""great""

Blood. No, not gore, \*blood\*.

 When characters get stabbed, slashed and otherwise supposed to either die or show the stuff that‚Äôs in their inside on their outside, you show blood. Maybe not as a spray of squibs, but as a mark of damage. When a sword or spear is run through, the other side of the shaft or blade should be coated in congealing red.   
   
 Why?

Simple. It increases tension and drama. 

Death happens in this series, and it happens relatively often.   
   
 You bruise, you gash, you get stabbed, you lose:

   
 \- focus

\- balance

\- vision

\-stamina

   
 That makes anything the characters do despite the pain, even more heroic and amazing.

As people are stabbed and left behind, a gathering pool of red shows just how much of their life is drained away, and how much time they have left. 

And without it?

You‚Äôre left with visual shortcuts, that by pop culture osmosis of tropes, their acting or by the music, you KNOW what is happening, but you feel detached, because there simply doesn‚Äôt feel to be drama or stakes. The tone isn't right. You wouldn't feel like the story is a matter of life-or-death for the character."
The Letter for the King,"I don't even know, at first I thought she stole the magic off the boy but apparently she's the one who had it all along? The ending was very anticlimactic... It's... Fine, I guess but that's all it is, fine."
The Letter for the King,this series was way too predictable
The Letter for the King,"I found an article that explains the plot twist and the one clue that we missed in the prophecy. After reading this, it makes a lot more sense. 

""Tiuri and Lavinia have something in common: Both grew up knowing only one of their biological parents. Tiuri's father was a shaman who was killed during the long assault on Eviellan, while Lavinia's mother was a noblewoman who came from Dangria, a town in the country of Unauwen. Given their family histories, it's natural to assume that the fantastical displays of magical power are done by Tiuri. However, while magic flows through Tiuri, allowing him to experience visions and hear voices (in a similar way to young Amaris in Foldo's fireside story), it's Lavinia who is actually the ""Great Mage of the North"" prophesied to defeat the darkness. The clue is in the prophecy itself since Tiuri is originally from the south, but Lavinia is the daughter of the two northern kingdoms. Tiuri's visions and voices weren't a manifestation of his own power, but rather was the magic guiding him to Lavinia."" 

 [https://screenrant.com/letter-king-season-1-netflix-ending-explained/](https://screenrant.com/letter-king-season-1-netflix-ending-explained/)"
The Letter for the King,"The only reason I really enjoyed the show was because of Jussipo, and from the beginning I already shipped Foldo and Jussipo. I was so happy when it finally happened, and then Jussipo died. They could've at least give us some more Frodo and Jussipo (relationship) scenes, and not all that in one episode. There will be a season 2, but I won't be watching it without Jussipo and Foldo."
The Letter for the King,Anyone know the name of the song jussipo sings? I have heard it somewhere before and it‚Äôs killing me
The Letter for the King,"The moment they killed Jussipo they killed my interest. Making the girl have powers was stupid. She was annoying, selfish, and had a bad attitude. If I were Tiuri and she showed up while I was facing down that blob dude I would've cussed her out. 

The ending scene was the most underwhelming, anti-climatic thing I've ever seen.

Why does Tiuri have bird face following him? Why is bird face angry? 

Why doesn't Iona have more screentime? She, Jussipo, Foldo, that one kid, and Piak carried the show. 

I can't believe they gave Foldo and Jussipo a romance scene *at the end of the series* and then proceeded to kill Jussipo off like 15 minutes later. This is homophobia. Why can't the gays have anything nice? I mean I know this series isn't top tier, but I feel like it's common sense not to have a character come out and then kill them like 4 scenes later. 

How did Iona know they were gonna show up outside of the random sewer well in the palace? Why is there a sewer well in the palace  right outside of their grand hall? 

Who is Eviellan?

What happened to Iona's parents? 

What happened to that Alianor lady? She just kinda got black eyes and then never showed up again. Wasn't she and angry prince gonna get married? 

Why is Tiuri and the main crew so stupid? They could've snuck out of that village when the red riders showed up. Ardawhatever its name is would've showed up later anyways. 

Who did the scenes with the horses? In the episode where annoying magic girl was trying to steal Ardawhatever the horse literally backed up and she was thrown off but then Ardanwen reared up with *two people on his back* and they didn't even move. Smells like someone who doesn't know anything about horses.

That's barely scraping the surface of my questions about this godforsaken series. I love the casting, I love the characters, I hate the plot. Who wrote this? They got a very good cast of characters and what did they do? Wasted them. Wasted their talents, their potential, their story. The supporting cast cannot carry an entire series. 

I give 2.5 out of 5 stars. Wasn't the worst thing to watch, but very disappointing and a waste of time, money, and potential.

However, my favorite part about this show was the costumes. I thought Tiuri and Iona's costumes were awesome. Alianor's was ugly. So I guess props to them for giving Tiuri a cool cape edgy aesthetic and Iona looking like an assassin from assassins creed."
The Letter for the King,"In my opinion I liked the side characters more that the two main (Tiuri and the girl) and I would just get bored watching them. 

The twist makes absolutely no sense because if Tiuri doesn't have powers then why did the birds attack him in the first episode.

I am also mad that they finally let the two characters come out as gay and then not long after that kill one of them off."
The Letter for the King,"I liked the story as a nice quarantine entertainment, but the females tropes bothered me: of the two strong young female characters, one is a mercenary villian, the other is a true hero but relegated to standing on the side with the horse, while the boys get the accolades."
The Letter for the King,"I liked the show specially the side characters when they add entertainment and start engaging with each other, it would have been worse if these werent involved, ofcourse until the last episode. They showed us the gurl had heeling powers, why didnt she use tgem on jusippo? Why was the last fight so rushed? Wherendid she even come from k and how did she even get in the palace. I hope there is another season. This show just had much potential wasted!"
The Letter for the King,What a fucking shit of show
The Letter for the King,"Extremely bad writing. Why did Tiuri hear voices and see bad guys face in birds if he has no power at all ? I mean, he must have a mental disease or a brain tumor maybe.

The plot twist has so much potential but it is so poor... Tiuri is an Elvian, a son of a shaman, he sees and hears things, his mother knows about some weird prophecy, but he has no powers at all and the girl we know nothing about, has no background history at all, is all mighty... 

They could have done something better, first of all he should have some powers, anything would do, but make him powerless was ridiculous, second, if they wanted the girl to be important, please make her a background history. It would work if they were ment to defeat the bad guy together."
The Letter for the King,"or as my wife and I now call it: ""Harry Potter and the Game of Rings.""

I would say this is a step down from Kingdom, which we just binged, but it's really more of a cliff.

Mediocre acting, mediocre writing, boring and predictable plot, confused tone, same-ol' fantasy world, same-ol' fantasy threats, same ol' teen characters. Absolutely stunning scenery."
The Letter for the King,"Another coming of age teen show. This time set in a fantasy world with magic, but with bad acting."
The Letter for the King,Im just here to say screw that fking plot twist with the magic kid. That shit is literally just to tick off Netflix‚Äô inclusion boxes. Whoever wrote this garbage really needs some writing lessons.
The Letter for the King,"This was one of the worst shows I've seen in a long time. By the end of the first episode, we realized we were still watching it out of a sort of morbid curiosity. How bad could this get? How could a show with such terrible writing and plot, nonsensical and flat characters (we applauded whenever a character did ANYthing that actually made sense), and mountains of cliches and tropes get such a big budget?

I liked the fact that they went to the effort of putting in a twist (I didn't see it coming, so props), but then the character disappeared! They completely failed to use that opportunity for character growth (as well as pretty much all others). The show was rushed, and it was shallow as a result.

The cherry on top of this trainwreck of a show was the pointless insertion of a ""bury your gays"" trope. Seriously, what the hell? That almost seemed intentional to me.

If the show were mine, I would have had Magic Girl finish her road and discover a terrible secret about her mother and the prophecy (killed by Big Bad in the past). This would have broken her and given her character motivation to pursue Big Bad. She would confront him AND WIN, absorbing his powers and getting lost in them (making Big Bad correct that he was not the darkness). Magic Girl would now be the darkness prophecied. This would leave Incompetent Knight to confront the darkness alone. Using his only skills (which were apparently naivete and sincere goodness), he would reach the soul of Magic Girl (who liked him anyway) and pull her back from the power.

Then, if we must do the whole gay guy gets stabbed bit, she would demonstrate her recovery by using her power to save his life."
The Letter for the King,"I finished this and I'm still so confused... how is the letter Tiuri delivered different from the one Red Riders were supposed to deliver? Or was the recipient different? I realise I come off dumb, but from the first episode I've been so ??? about it.  


Also, maybe I'm thinking to deep into it but when Lavinia and Tiuri were getting onto the ship they sad Eviellan has to go with the livestock, how did they know he's Eviellan?"
The Letter for the King,"I really liked the series but it desperately needs a second season to complete what it has started! As other guys have mentioned the whole plot was rushing without focusing enough in characters and in their relationships! If a second season will ever exist it should follow this path and I believe it will be great. If there will no be a second one then it‚Äôs really sad ... it was just a series without an end. (LET ME KNOW IF YOU BELIEVE THAT A SECOND SEASON WILL EXIST AND ALSO IF YO7 HAVE INFO ABOUT THE POPULARITY OD THE SERIES!) 
Thanks"
The Letter for the King,I‚Äôm upset about the whole show I stoped watching the end 3 min in. I‚Äôm so happy that the girl has power but Tiuri should have power too why does only one have to be it? Why can‚Äôt they both have power in some youth romance bulls**t u know. What upsets me is Tiuri can‚Äôt fight can‚Äôt ride can‚Äôt do anything to help anyone. His character is completely useless and it gets me mad. Like I said I‚Äôm glad the girl has power I really like her character but both should have had it
The Letter for the King,"meh, protag is dumg, his friends are dumber. 

Coincedence and a magic horse are the heroes here.


Also:
swords do not cut through chainmail...."
The Letter for the King,This is biggest pile of shite I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of wasting my time watching
The Letter for the King,"I adored the book and the sequel when I was a kid, I still own both of them. The show is alright."
The Letter for the King,"I couldn't make it through first episode.

The fight choreography was absolutely atrocious and the acting was ranging from passable to utterly horrendous - the guy sucking in the evil black cloud more or less did me in, that was painfully bad.

Oh well, nothing gained, nothing lost ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
The Letter for the King,I enjoyed it. It‚Äôs simple though because it‚Äôs made for family viewing.
The Letter for the King,The lady in the town the cross in EP5 is such a good actor. I already loved the show but she added such an intense element to the show
The Letter for the King,"Just finished the series and so far like everyone has already said, I really liked Tiburi, Viridian, some of the side characters and my man, Jabroot. I thought it was a bit out of the left field that Iona betrayed everyone and wish there was more build up to the why.

I wish there was more build up to Lavinia having powers but actually don't mind the twist at all. Thought she was a bit selfish at times. I hope they can explain why Tirburi is hearing voices and having visions if he isn't the chosen one at all. Are Tirburi and Lavina linked and can't separate at all in order for their powers to work? (Are we suppose to chalk it up to his Shaman blood and leave it at that?)

Viridian, however, made this show for me. It's really interesting to see how he thinks he's the hero in this story even though he's the villain. I wonder if Viridian took a chance he might not make it out, even after the blood moon rose, so he possessed the queen (hence why her eyes went dark) and put himself into her. (Also, is Viridian also the birds at the end and in the beginning attacking Tiuri? Did they ever explain who Bird Face was?) In a way, if this gets a second season, I hope Viridian can come back because the way he went out was so anticlimactic. They just like stared at each other for minutes. I was expecting more.

Also 8/10 to the scenery shots. Thought those looked beautiful at times. 

Wish this show wasn't limited to TV-14 or whatever this is rated and hope they can tighten up the writing and some acting and stuff if they ever get renewed. This series could have so much potential imo."
The Letter for the King,"This is an old thread but still I want to vent after watching it.

This show is basically a kids show with a bit of realism. So close, very much on the edge, but no blood, no guts, nothing. 

Completely unsatisfy and doesn‚Äôt fit the plot, especially considering the betrayals and ‚Äòfight scenes‚Äô. Theres no coming of age moment in this show when the characters realise they have to kill people or be killed to get the job done. The only time it becomes sobering for them is when their mate dies right at the end, which is utter bullshit. Just naive kids tryna be soldiers the whole show.

The show does have a couple things going for it. The cinematography and acting was very good. So was the CGI and the costumes and sets. 

However. They completely fucked up the way they presented the landscape and ‚Äòkingdoms‚Äô they were in. They created the impression of a tiny clusterphobic group of kingdoms with seemingly one tiny forest. It ruined the immersion. They could of simply provided a map graphic depicting the area they covered or shot scenes of the entire landscape depicting the direction they were heading. 

The lack of urgency added to that feeling of smallness. They constantly stopped for breaks and slept all night, no hours of walking, running, riding. At the start we are told they only have 13 days to the disbelief of Tuiri and yet feels like an holiday stroll throughout.

The story too pisses me off. The arks are predictable and cringe worthy. The twists are extreme and off putting. The depictions of the characters abilities yoyo from incompetent to being able to take on trained soldiers. The projection of them being weak children doesn‚Äôt fit. If they were really aiming to become knights they would have been trained constantly to be fit and tactically minded. Not the soft and naive characters we‚Äôre presented. They could have been better portrayed as flawed but each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Idk, I could be being unfair, maybe they thought it would satisfy the targeted demographic whoever it was meant for. But as someone technically in their teens, I certainly wasn‚Äôt satisfied."
The Letter for the King,"This show is cringe for 1 simple fact; No adult with years of military training can beat up these kids. Its dumb. They are fucking kids! just cut them in half ffs!

This show hits no age group, kids cant get into this because its too complicated to follow, teenagers dont care about kids being the protagonist. Adults think its dumb because kids shouldnt be able to best adults over and over unscathed.....

How the fuck they bring out shit like this but cancel stuff like marco polo.... netflix is insane sometimes."
The Letter for the King,"I can't believe I wasted six hours of my life watching this only for the ending to be so deeply unsatisfying. Borderline infuriating considering all of the CHILDREN were knighted and no one even said thank-you to Lavinia, who saved the entire world. 

Character development = 0/10.
Plot holes = 11/10."
The Letter for the King,"The ending was shit, It might just be me but if he doesn‚Äôt have any special powers I‚Äôll pretend I‚Äôve never seen the show. Believe me I‚Äôve seen great men do great things without magic, instead they got brains, and I don‚Äôt want my boy to just be a pussy compared to the actual pussy beside him."
The Letter for the King,Was this any good? Worth watching?
The Letter for the King,Why did they put the main character as a black kid when this is an European fantasy series written by a Dutch writer born in 1930? Can't they let us have anything? I hope the next leader of Wakanda will be white.
The Letter for the King,"This felt like it moved really slow and as time went on it really didn't feel like it progressed much each episode. I don't know how to explain it other than it felt like something that was just on TV and I kept watching for some reason, not because it was good, just because it was on. Extremely slow moving and not a ton of good action."
The Letter for the King,Can someone please tell me what they were whistling at the end of episode 6. I know it but I can't remember what it is and it's doing my head in.
The Letter for the King,In episode 6 who is the old man with the white beard at the campfire that Tiuri stumbles upon? I know his voice I just can‚Äôt remember who he is. And they don‚Äôt have the extras listed in the cast.
The Letter for the King,[removed]
The Letter for the King,I think the plot twist was good. Not only it reverses the clique ‚Äúchosen one‚Äù trope but also means Tiuri doesn‚Äôt need to have fighting skills nor magic to finish his task. Arman told him it doesn‚Äôt matter who has magic powers it matters he‚Äôs the one that opened the door. It sends a message that anyone can be a hero.
The Letter for the King,"I've just watched all 6 episodes and honestly it could have been so much better. Sure, it was an ok watch, but it's not going to be remembered until/unless they bring out another season with loads of improvements.

Would it have been so hard to double the episode count, show Viridian in some of his battles (big GoT style fights), show more world/character development, and, probably most importantly, give Lavinia some damn screen time and give her some importance other than rocking up like Gandalf the freaking White to save the day.

Oh, and Iona can fuck right off the traitorius little cow. At least give us some better scope on why she's a dick."
The Letter for the King,"Spoilers!
( also I haven‚Äôt read the novel so this is my opinion from the series alone )

I think overall the series would mostly suit those at a younger age and I did get bored and had to skip most of it.
I enjoyed finding out about the boys‚Äô moment when they kissed as I love when films/series aimed at younger people include LGBT+ however clearly I was sad to find out it was only that scene. I was Disappointed to find out that Lavinia had powers instead of the guy even though it was quite predictable, only because I was rooting for him to have his big moment. The ending wasn‚Äôt all that, I was expecting a boss fight or some sort of twist. Only good thing about the ending was the boys death ( not that I wanted him to die, I just liked the add of emotion since my eyes were so dry through out it ) and also the heartwarming knighting at the end.

I know it sounds really negative but I feel like younger kids would definitely enjoy this show and even older people as well (depending on what you like to watch ) overall I did like it as it was a nice series but definitely add more to it.

Also if anyone could tell me, why was the boy hearing whispers and see the birds change to that face? Was that explained? Because I think I might‚Äôve slipped past it."
The Letter for the King,"Absolutlely loved the twist at the end of episode 5 and it was refreshing to have a person of color be the main character in a fantasy show.

I also got so excited to see a canon gay pairing and seeing how they handled diversity so far I curious how their story would continue.

And then the ending happened...

The only asian character, who would have been the only female knight in the series keeps being a traitor. Why??

And then they KILL OFF one of the only two gay characters. SERIOUSLY?! The bury your gay trope was disgusting since its existence. But it's 2020 now and they still do that shit to us. WHY?!

If they wanted to kill anyone off, why not his brother? Would still suck of course, but it would make sense since the kid has no combat training at all. Also if he would die faster due to his small body it could make sense that he couldn't get healed.

Seriously there is HEALING MAGIC in this series and it isn't used at the end.

&#x200B;

And the final fight wasn't that epic as it should have been. So much build up for a staring contest. The black smoke didn't even hurt anyone. In general a villain who should have so much magic power used almost none of it..."
The Letter for the King,"30 minutes in and I just lose an interest, if people love it I will come back to watch it later."
The Letter for the King,Well a good story to binge while I'm stuck in lockdown in my country.
The Letter for the King,"REPOST because i tried to use spoiler feature in the text editor but it is not good enough, it still not hidden to some people and AutoModerator suggested a different format:

I'm starting episode 3 now and I'm loving it so far. I like the focus on the young to be knights. I liked the training scenes, fight scenes, the horse.

I also loved The Last Kingdom, Narnia.

Hated The Witcher (Netflix), loved all the monsters except the golden dragon.

\[Spoiler\](#s ""Man, when those Grey Riders got slaughtered by the Red Riders I was disappointed... it's like they had no armour at all. Lol. Lightsabre!!!!!"")"
The Letter for the King,[removed]
The Letter for the King,"That fight at the end was the most underwhelming thing I've seen in forever. I mean all that lead up to this powerful darkness and they just looked at each other for a minute and light wins. C'mon.

More time was spent animating the shadow at the end than the thought process being that boss fought. Such a let down.

And the death of Prince V. My gawd. He's got all these powers, is a battle hardened soldier, commander, etc, and gets poked that easily?

That whole ending was frustrating. What a let down."
The Letter for the King,i think whoever wrote this just has no idea how to build up a story (or character). all the big plot lines ‚Äûplot twists‚Äú were very predictable or just seemed random and uninspired.
The Letter for the King,frrrr that makes no sense the character is still weak asf
The Letter for the King,"Magic is everywhere and not just something inside of certain people. Magic itself led Tiuri to Lavinia. Tiuri, himself, cannot use magic, but magic used him."
The Letter for the King,"No, it's just that we weren't really paying attention to the prophecy. The prophecy says that a great mage from the North will defeat the darkness. Tiuri is originally from Eviellan which is in the south and Lavinia is from the North. The horse also takes Tiuri to her as she needed him to access her powers. Notice they only work when he's in danger or hurt."
The Letter for the King,"So the plot twist where the girl turns out to be the one with magic powers is just totally made up for the show?  

That's weird...  

I figure that they do have a reason for why she has powers, probably to do with the girl's mother, but not knowing anything about the source material I figured that this was something that they took from the books.  

Really weird to find out that they've diverged from the books in so many major ways, because the entire show still feels very much like a book adaptation due to the pacing, so it's hard to see what they've gained from diverging from the books so much.  
It's not like they used that opportunity to make the plot and story more suitable for a tv series with 6 episodes per season, because their journey still felt really rushed and weird with all the strange sidequests and the repetitive way that they kept getting captured and then escaping again."
The Letter for the King,"Yea, I agree. The twist was too out of nowhere, considering the magic system they had spent so much time building up, and poorly developed. It was basically the end where they decided to focus on all the characters, except the one who actually needs development. I could definitely see this being an idea they just ran with and figured they could just figure out what excuses work and dump those in the next season."
The Letter for the King,"the books are really good though, just dont get it why they changed it so much. why bother getting the naming rights?"
The Letter for the King,"totally agree. i feel like they were just too lazy to come up with an own world to set their lgbtq propaganda into.
also strong female protagonist? where?! none of the female characters have a strong/noble personality... although the male ones don‚Äòt either really. i guess whoever wrote this adaptation is just bad at character design."
The Letter for the King,Because it's loosely based on a YA novel from Tonke Dragt (that did not feature any magic at all... IIRC)
The Letter for the King,Cause they think that is what teens want. Maybe it's true. I just k ow I hated teenshows as a teen.
The Letter for the King,"I feel like every one of these newer series that Netflix makes that catch my attention end up with the same general twists and plot points. They all shoehorn in a gay romance, they twist it so the main protagonist wasn't the main person, but some other girl or something.

Just predictable at this point. I don't have a problem with those things, but when it seems like every series, especially one diverting from source material does it, it gets annoying and generic."
The Letter for the King,I didn't watch teen shows when I was a teen
The Letter for the King,Yeah the villian sucked balls....I kept hoping he was gonna kill some of his minions but nope....and he didn't even kill anyone at the end...just kinda floated there as a shadow monster...so strange and anticlimactic.
The Letter for the King,"Yeah exactly like what the fuck is this shit. I mean where did these birds then came from that showed him that face. Not trying to be that gender offender guy but I hate it when there's the main character that we see throughout the whole series but in the end a fucking girls is the hero or whatever. And why the fuck did she even got the powers, she's not even from this weird clan or tribe"
The Letter for the King,"Fucking nothing, the old white dude had it right in the feast, he's quite literally nobody. Just someone in the right place at the right time with a good heart. So basically your average knight. He's no one special at all."
The Letter for the King,probably there is a 2nd season coming
The Letter for the King,"i think that‚Äòs why it was made. someone just wanted to make a pg13 lgbtq version of sth that is likely to find an audience right now, so they jumped on the game of thrones bandwagon and butchered it(without any blood involved ironically)."
The Letter for the King,"I was actually really glad they didn't give her a medal or anything. Everything involving her in the last episode felt entirely unearned, cheap, and anticlimactic. So for them to basically put her on the same ""level"" as Tiuri would have bothered me. She ditched them when she was revealed to be the most important, she only came in the first place for greed, she screwed Tiuri over when she first met him for greed, and was generally unlikeable most of the show.

All the while Tiuri only has one scene where he gives up, and is able to be talked back into it by his not-friend. It's a well written scene, too. So where Tiuri loses the only two good things in his life and _still_ decides to push on, she up and leaves when she is given superpowers. Cool! I love this character now /s

Seriously though, that scene with the ""darkness"" plus the scene where it's revealed she has the powers both ruined the show for me. Go ahead and cancel this one Netflix, you've cancelled far better than it. Or get better writers."
The Letter for the King,Twice.
The Letter for the King,I watched this with my daughter. Now she wants the books
The Letter for the King,same it was just stupid I can even watch it without getting mad
The Letter for the King,Same here. It‚Äôs just the need to know if everybody also thought this was trash. I actually liked the first 3 episodes. Then that twist was awful and the ending was hot garbage.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Thanks for this! Very impressive work.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Amazing work and fascinating read!

Question, is that last list Oscar winners making their series regular television debut or did you include those who are returning as well? Because your description reads like the former but includes actors that are returning to tv."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Am I missing Sam Rockwell in F is for Family? I love him as the voice of Vic!
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Thank you! The last list does include actors who have starred in a TV show before but the main idea is that these actors haven‚Äôt starred in a TV show after winning an Oscar. Furthermore, all these actors don‚Äôt have any experience in the current state of television (aka Peak TV since the last five years).
So for example, Brie Larson starred in United States of Tara on Showtime but that was way before her Oscar win and also before television became as big as it is now."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"You're absolutely right, I didn't know Sam Rockwell has a main role in that show. I will add him to the list!"
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"You're absolutely right, I didn't know Sam Rockwell has a main role in that show. I will add him to the list! Do you know any other actors with a TV role?"
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Larson was one of the ones I was thinking, but Holly Hunter also started in a tv show (Saving Grace on TNT) after her Oscar (though not during peak TV).

Edit: I forgot, she was also in Here & Now on HBO last year."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"You're right, I did not see that while writing this post."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"No worries!! Still an awesome bit of research.

Are there any actors you‚Äôre surprised haven‚Äôt made the jump yet?

I would love to see Ryan Gosling in a comedy series, he was amazing in The Nice Guys. He has no Oscar but nonetheless, he would be incredible in a series. I am surprised that Tom Hanks and Robert de Niro have not starred in a TV show.."

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,I‚Äôm excited and here for it! Octavia Spencer is amazing!
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Was wondering when this was finally coming out
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,She got rich helping black women look more Anglo though. Walker is a problematic historical figure.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"I like her too, but she's definitely not underrated, she has an oscar."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,She gave black women options. You can day that she was problematic but she offered them something much better than what they had before: products that allowed their hair to thrive instead of the damaging ones they had to make do with. They were a demographic that no one cared enough to cater to so she took it into her own hands. She went on to employ many other black women while others wouldn't and gave them an opportunity to provide for themselves. She also gave back to the black community through her philanthropy and patronage instead of hoarding her newfound wealth to herself. The eurocentric ideals that they had to conform to was unfortunate and still stick around today but it was a means to survive in a society that looked for any opportunity to put them down and turn them away. We have the luxury today of being more expressive and comfortable with our hair but that simply wasn't an option back then.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Yeah, i guess. But I don't hear people talk about her very often. She hasn't gotten much hype from the general public, I don't think."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,She also sold skin bleaching cream. So yeah problematic.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Why in the world are people downvoting you?

Very interesting to hear the real history as I watch the made-for-TV story. They‚Äôve definitely painted her as an advocate for black beauty in this retelling"
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,She got rich trying to help black women appear less African. The irony gets lost on people.

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Maybe a bit of a stretch, but I‚Äôll say with how unpopular/polarizing it was/is, the 2nd season of The Wire. The total shift from the story of the streets to the dockworkers with only a few overlapping characters was jarring and brilliant. How the two seemingly unrelated narratives of Sobotka and Stringer Bell actually were parts of a large chain of crime was so well done.  Personally it was one of my favorite but I think the fans that dislike the season were really invested in the characters from season one, rightfully, and didn‚Äôt like the feeling of abandonment.

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"The Venture Bros. Season 3 finale having the Venture family bodyguard Brock Sampson leave the Ventures and the death of Henchman 24. 

So many core dynamics of the show were broken up by these changes that it could have completely tanked the show going into S4 and yet it ended up being the best move. It allowed for some incredible characters development for Hank and Dean Venture as well as Henchman 21 where they were able to come into their own while also letting Brock's storyline provide more room for some of the side characters to be fleshed out a bit more further adding to the depth of the world.

The Venture Bros. did a brilliant job of writing out characters and storylines when they were played out and it wouldn't be the only instance where they would completely change everything. Thankfully every time they took the leap to shake up the dynamic of the show they would end up hitting it out of the park for the betterment of the story and characters. Just a shame the show didn't get it's 8th season."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Archer Vice drops to mind. 5 seasons in and it abandons the spy comedy thing to do something totally different. I was also (mostly) a fan of the coma seasons. I think the reason that show has had longevity is that it tends to shake things up pretty often while still feeling tonally consistent.

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Parks and Rec possibly? Not so much a single big event to try and catch the audiences attention but a major overhaul of most of the characters to fix a floundering show. 

The conversation that must have taken place where someone suggested ""let's change most of the characterisations, drop some characters completely and essentially treat it like a new series"" must have been interesting to witness."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Cougar Town got away from Jules being a cougar pretty quickly halfway through the fist season and morphed into a pretty enjoyable comedy about the cul de sac crew hanging out and drinking wine. It was a hard enough pivot that they considered changing the name of the show and even made jokes about it in the title card.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"The reveal at the end of season 1 of the good place. I thought it was a disaster of a decision, and struggled with the next season, but it turns out that it opened up the space they had to storytelling and made the following seasons exceptional"
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"If people didn't mention the UFO from Fargo I would completely forget about it.  So honestly I wouldn't call it ""catching the shark""   it's just a ""huh, that's odd"" moment."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"I don‚Äôt know if this counts but classic Doctor Who could have completely failed when they replaced William Hartnell with Patrick Troughton. 

That could have been a jump the shark moment but instead it‚Äôs the reason the show has lasted 60 years"
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Thinking of this makes me think of Marvel's Agents of Shield.

First, maybe not a catching the shark moment but more of a successful pivot was the end of season one getting totally derailed by the events of Captain America: Winter Soldier (back when the show had some pretense of being part of the cinematic universe)

The actual catching the shark moment in my opinion is midway in season 2 when >!one of the main characters goes through terragenesis and gains superpowers before inhumans are really explained to the audience (oh and another character dies in that moment, RIP Trip)!<

In retrospect, the show later had its jumping the shark moment and i can't decide if it was introducing ghost rider or >!having almost the whole cast be abducted to rescue earth from the future in space!<. Don't get me wrong though, as a fanboy i very much enjoyed how crazy the show got in its later seasons."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Breaking Bad spoilers ahead:

>!Walt rigging a bomb inside Hectors wheelchair, which subsequently exploded with a simple bell ring, which in turn blew up half of Gus Frings face, should have been a Jump The Shark moment. Even describing it now in this post it feels convoluted and cheesy. But the moment went down as one if not the greatest death in BB universe history. The shot of Gus waking out of the hospital ward with half his face melted is ridiculous. An act that would never happen in the real world. But it was spectacular. It stuck the landing.!<"

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"The season finals of What We Do in The Shadows are always a big clifhanger that can cross into Jump The Shark territory when you have to wait a year to see if it's going to pay off but it always does. 

Usually because they just ignore it and go for what's best for the characters and comedy instead of forcing weird plot lines."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,I'd say in season 2 of The Office it was a smart move to make Michael into a somewhat likable character with some redeemable qualities instead of staying on the same trajectory as season 1.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Atlanta season 3 (I think) where it was a collection of vignettes
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Not sure if it fits your post but I'll go ahead and say LOST. Only because it's the best show I've seen to sense the pulse of the audience and shift/course correct. Whenever that series started to lose me they bounced back in amazing *jump out of your seat* fashion.



For example, Nikki and Paolo. No spoilers, but the introduction of these two characters was bemoaned by fans. To this day if you ask a fan what is the worst episode they'll say, ""The Jack tattoo episode."" Which is the correct answer. But some might say the episode on those two characters. What's fascinating is that it's not a bad episode. It's a solid thrill ride with a wicked ending. I always theorized fans clung to that episode as a kind of lightning rod for them in the show as a whole. *Nikki and Paolo = bad LOST therefore Nikki + Paolo episode = bad.*




Especially considering when they finally had their end date and could backfill their ""plan"" from there. The first season after that contract negotiation was Season 4 and it was the tightest wound thrill ride of any season. There's almost no fat or down time to be found. (writer's strike probably also helped) I remember my new roommates at the time freaking out as I'd be screaming, ""Oh my GOD!"" at the end of every episode.




And just for fun I'll throw in Supernatural but only for the line: ""It's not jumping the shark if you never come down."""
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Each Stargate series had these moments

SG-1 sort of jumped the shark when they replaced Daniel Jackson with Jonas, but Jackson returned the next season. I say ""sorta"" because the Jonas season was actually a good run of episodes.

Also SG-1 replacing RDA with half the cast of Farscape was a good move. It freshened the cast, added a fun romantic screwball comedy angle and brought in a new villain with new stakes

Atlantis brought in Jason Mamoa and the team leveled up, making the show a lot more interesting. Unfortunately season 3 screwed up by >!killing both Carson and Weir!< and I don't think it really recovered.

SGU caught the shark right at cancelation by deciding to have the characters cut out the internal and focus the series on finding the origins of the gates. Unfortunately that was like six episodes before cancellation so they wasted a season and a half of really bad storylines."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"I don't know if there really is a show like that. Even Fargo, in this instance, doesn't quite apply. Jumping the Shark is normally used to pinpoint where a once popular show tries to recapture its audience's attention by going big - and they go big in a way that actually cements their fall.

I can't think of a show that's had a downward trajectory, losing its audience, only to go big and recapture their audience. When shows dwindle, they just seem to dwindle.

Although if anyone has one, I would love to know. I love the term."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Halt and Catch fire decided to pivot away from being Mad Men in the 80s to something better at the end of season 1.

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"MASH, with each character replacement. It was damn near perfect from the start, so it would seem impossible to keep the genius going after losing one character and replacing him with another. Yet somehow the show improved and mutated with each change, from Blake to Potter, McIntyre to Hunnicutt, and Burns to Winchester."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"M\*A\*S\*H. After a couple of seasons of trying to be a zany comedy, it basically became a different show with the same setting and most of the original cast. McLean (Henry Blake) Stevenson and Wayne (Trapper John) Rogers were removed, as was 90+ percent of the ""slapstick"" humor. The show became a critically acclaimed ""dramedy."""
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"-Castlevania S2 finale when they killed off a huge character. I thought to myself there's no way the show can continue anymore. But the void left behind only served as room for even more interesting characters to develop. Power vacuums are nice.

-Avatar The Last Airbender, when Zuko pops up and announces that he wants to flip sides and join the Gaang. On paper this seems to make no sense, but due to the teenage awkwardness it ended up working and now I can't imagine the show's arc working any other way."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Maybe not quite that crazy, but Star Trek enterprise failed to really resonate with an audience who had a bit of Star Trek fatigue after so many continuous years of trek. s3 they decided to do one long season wide story arc, which had not been done before in any of the previous 26 seasons of live action trek. It was received very well (compared to its first two seasons)."

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"I thought ""shoresy"" was going to just be more of the same letterkenny format that I've grown stale on.  

It turned out to be a refreshing side piece that takes the humor I like from the show, and replaces all the things that grew old. It's got an actual story line, albeit simple, that tracks through multiple episodes. The jokes are new, characters are new, and thru don't beat you over the head with one liners.  Also as a hockey player the humor was extremely relatable. It gets into more than just what Riley and jonesey had to offer, and provides some more depth.  

All in all it was a really refreshing take on a tired format."

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,I think the show shot to new levels when the Teletubbies finally started to scold the Nuu-nuu when it was becoming naughty.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"On TV Tropes, it's called [Growing The Beard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard) and is the marked moment where a show or similar noticably starts growing better in quality and execution.

The Trope Namer (the work that inspired the site's choice in name) was Star Trek: The Next Generation where Riker started to wear a beard from season two onward, while he was cleanshaven in the first season, which happened because Jonathan Frakes showed up for a script-reading with it one day and everyone considered it a good idea.

It's also when characters started to really find their niches, with Geordi becoming chief engineer instead of just using his VISOR as a plot device. It was also the season with the episode ""The Measure of a Man"", considered one of the best episodes of the show period.

In truth, it's more like ""Firing the dumbass executive producer"" since Gene Roddenberry was no longer allowed to directly affect the direction of the show or wider franchise, after his micromanaging of season one proved abysmal and he was caught fucking around with the film franchise by leaking scripts at fan conventions because he didn't like certain plot points.

Edit: Also, personally I loved the fact that in Season 3 of McDonald and Dodds, they replaced the asshole police chief who constantly bullies and tries to force Dodds out of the police for perceived mistakes with a more professional policewoman who won't constantly breathe down people's necks for fucking up as well as owns up to her mistakes... such as forgetting to refill the beans in the coffee grinder."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,Angel season 5. It completely went from a moody detective agency to managing evil on earth. Complete departure from the previous seasons and it was amazing. Shame it was cancelled
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"I feel like ""caught the shark"" is the wrong phrase. To my mind it feels like that should be the term for when a show (a) was regarded as having jumped the shark and then (b) later did something that caused people to go ""Oh, I get it now"" and what had been regarded as jumping the shark is re-evaluated, What you're talking about seems more like ""owned the shark"".

For example, if Doctor Who had revealed that the timeless child was actually the Master's origin story, then I really think that people would have a totally different opinion about the timeless child as a concept. So, this I would describe as catching the shark.

As to actual example of *this* version of catching the shark? I guess The Wire sort of makes sense. I'm not sure at which point after S2 finishes that S2 makes sense, but it does eventually happen.

In terms of ""owning the shark"", i.e. what you're calling catching the shark, I think I agree with Fring's >!death!< in Breaking Bad. It should feel ridiculous but it never does. Another example would be Agents of SHIELD which literally blew up its whole concept about 2/3 of the way through its first series. Everyone agrees this was a good idea (but the stuff before that moment is seriously over-hated).

I'm a bit torn about Supernatural which someone else also mentioned. I think for most people introducing angels was owning the shark, but for me Supernatural before the angels show up is pretty crap. In other words Castiel's arrival is more like growing the beard than owning the shark. Though that's a bit unfair to S3. The urgency the writer's strike gave the show did wonders for it."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"The phrase you want is ""Growing the Beard"", not ""catching the shark""; it's an established term for the situation you describe. 

It is in reference to ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", where the first season was awful -- but the show became great in subsequent seasons.  Coincidentally,  the character  ""Commander Riker"" was beardless in the first season, and wore a beard in all the following seasons."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Happy Days started out kinda boring, but it hit it's stride after that fun and exciting beach episode. 

I wonder why it got cancelled."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Thankfully, not letting Parks and Recreation be another ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù. Leslie Knope wasn‚Äôt very likeable when they did the first season (and Mark Brandanowitz üôÑ) and the story was meh. 

Then they changed gears and that show is classic comedy gold in every episode season 2 and on. They put the focus on Leslie to be more likeable and flush out all the side characters more."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,The Brady Bunch - when they brought in 'Cousin Oliver'.
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Season 1 of Parks and Rec was the weakest part. Better characterization for Leslie, and addition of Ben and Chris really gave the show legs."

Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"Please let's  not normalize ""caught the shark"" maybe try ""Fonzied"" or something else. Just not caught the shark..."
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,"The second season of the wire is an obvious example but that being said a lot of people actually didn‚Äôt like it.

I think a great example would be supernatural, specifically when the show introduces Angels. I think they introduce them in the first episode of season 4, and then the show proceeds to have the best 2 seasons (4 and 5) of its 15 year run. The show even pokes fun at this a few times, making references to when they just used to hunt Windegos lol"
Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,I think this season of The Orville may have done it. They went to Hulu and made each episode a mini movie. Each episode is about an hour and a half and they did an amazing job with both the soundtrack and the visuals. A few episodes channeled old school Twilight Zone.

Pervin got shot.. Pervin who could have already left...but stayed to get lisha... and then dies because of her.. I saw the signs .. they just should have talked to her more and see that she was brainwashed.."
Caliphate,"Swedish TV show, which is not available in Sweden. Good job netflix."
Caliphate,"Incredible show, hope it gets renewed. If so, here's my suggested plot line for season 2:

Sulle's eyes are finally open and all she wants is revenge on Ibbe and men like him for what he did to her and especially to her friend the repentant bomber. She realizes this in a small way by working with the Swedish Security Service giving talks to girls at her school and those like hers trying to warn girls like her sister and younger self about the dangers of men like Ibbe and push them back onto the right path. In so doing she meets Fatima, who becomes a kind of mentor to her. Turns out Fatima managed to tell the country the truth about what happened with the averted attacks without repercussions, and is deemed a hero and reinstated/promoted while Nadir is ousted. Ibbe disappears. A few years later, Lisha manages to pass on word to Sulle that she is still alive, and desperately wants to escape. Sulle is insistent on going to Syria, this time to bring her sister back, but the SSS wants nothing to do with it. Fatima can't stop her, so decides to join her and help her. Little do they know that Ibbe has also managed to make it back there as well and has taken Lisha as his wife and is hatching his next plot. Fatima and Sulle make it to Syria, and are about to successfully rescue Lisha when Ibbe walks in. Fatima successfully takes him down, allowing the others to escape back to Sweden, but at the cost of her own life. Determined to follow in the steps of--and avenge--her mentor, we see Sulle applying for a job at the Security Service in the last scene of the season...or so we think. Credits roll and then...we see Ibbe recovering in a hospital bed, still very much alive.

More likely, but annoying and endlessly cliche plot line for season 2: Fatima spends the whole season fighting against Nadir and the security establishment and trying to get her job back.

Feel free to PM me with a job offer, Sveriges *Television*."
Caliphate,Just finished it. Wow. Don‚Äôt know how to feel. Maybe they‚Äôll make a second season and follow Lisha. I didn‚Äôt really know that ISIS recruitment was prevalent in Sweden. Although I was wondering how Muslims felt about this - I can‚Äôt tell if the plot was insensitive or not? Hopefully that doesn‚Äôt make me a privileged asshole.
Caliphate,I binged the series and enjoyed it overall. Only issue I had was with the English voice actor for Pervins husband....
Caliphate,Posted few days ago. I binged the whole thing day of release. Soooo good imo.  Captivating and edge of seat throughout.
Caliphate,"Good TV but as a Muslim it sucked for me for the following reasons. As if people needed more motive to hate Islam. You can even make the argument that they do Islam a favour by making the characters say 'this is not true Islam'. However, I would argue that repeated exposure to things like these (along with media in general), will produce a bias in people. We desperately need more Muslim heroes, not villains, since the scale is so awfully tipped towards seeing Islam and more importantly muslims in a negative light. Also, small things like incorrect prayers and the way people acted threw me off and it gave me a very created by non Muslim white people vibe which killed a bit of the authenticity for me."
Caliphate,"So good!! I have so many questions though. Mostly how realistic were the characters and situations? Like how did Hussam and Pervin have/make money? How was he able to use the money from Sweden to buy Lisha as a 2nd wife without arousing suspicion? Was that a lot of money to have? Also, my understanding of Islam is that a man can only take another wife if he can afford it... so wouldn‚Äôt that have set off alarms too? They don‚Äôt seem especially well off.."
Caliphate,"I burst out laughing when someone said alhamdulillah and the subtitles said ""I'm fine ""

Edit : second time it said ""thank god"""
Caliphate,"The last episode! Ibbe did kill Kerima and set off the blast, right?"
Caliphate,"My personal opinion about this series is: I was emotionally involved and couldnt stop watching it after the first episode and I cant say that about alot of series. The directors and actors did such a great job I felt with each and every character, I felt Pervins tension and how scared she must have been! The struggle.. 

Problematic for me is that people who already have a lot of prejudice could take this the wrong way and turn it in to something to prove their point or might scare them even more.
Which doesnt mean I think there shouldnt be a series like this... I just imagine maybe a teenager that is beeing recruted maybe sees this series and realises something I dont know... ISIS is real and teenagers fleeing from Europe to Rakka too... so I think its an interesting topic and should be a topic to talk about or how easy it is for adults to manipulate children and radicalise them and for parents to see the signs of it 
.
maybe for the next season they could bring in an other kind of ""good"" muslim character to balance it out I mean in season 1 we have Nadir and Fatima but how about someone who practices islam more and still knows the difference to radicalism and show a bit more about that character?"
Caliphate,"I finished it. It looks like Homeland but in a Nordic version. Nordic countries have some really good shows outside of their Nordic noir genre.  You should check out Nobel a TV show set in Afghanistan. This show is also similar to Fauda,which was really good. Also Pervin and Hussam are like the villains. This show should get a season 2 as soon as possible. First in Sweden where this show is from,second it will be distributed by  Netflix."
Caliphate,"Yes it‚Äôs good quality, people ask why Netflix is popular globally, this is why."
Caliphate,Adding to my list!
Caliphate,"Something that no one seems to mention, the incompetence of the Swedish authorities. Two young teenagers go off to join the fucking ISIS. And when they are rescued and brought back, you just let them go? just like that? No radicalization or some form of therapy. And one of them tries to kill herself. And you just let her go too? Wtf man! Guess that's what Nadir was talking about. Swedish state is really useless."
Caliphate,Yeah I knew about the $2k but just didn‚Äôt know if it would have been suspicious for them to have that kind of money laying around.
Caliphate,I binged it like mad.
Caliphate,"I usually struggle to focus on series or movies and rarely find something that fully catches my attention.. this series is one of the few I really enjoyed on netflix, although I wouldn't call it a masterpiece.
At some times it's not very realistic, too much drama, the plot could be worked more in depth, the girls who decided to go to Raqqa should have a more consistent back story (like a mental disorder, or a toxic childhood etc since this category of people is most prone to radicalization). 

Despite all this it's overall good enough to watch, entertaining and easy to follow"
Caliphate,Can anyone recommend good Muslim storylines and shows then on Netflix?
Caliphate,"So basically anyone who believes in the Palestinian case or wears a head scarf is a potential terrorist.
I‚Äôve never seen a muslim very ignorant of their religion (doesn‚Äôt even know how to pray) especially if they‚Äôre immigrants to a non muslim country where muslims tend to hang tighter to their religion.

(Spoiler Alert)
Sulle seems like a smart ass but she can‚Äôt google raqqa or isis and believes she‚Äôs gonna live in a villa with a pool? 

The show is full bullshit with good acting skills.
Also the nicest and bravest person dies after all this suffering so what‚Äôs the fucking point"
Caliphate,"I cant get over the ending!!!! I loved the drama and the anticipation of every episode.

I do have some major issues with this series tho, like for example Two teenage girls go off to join ISIS, are repatriated by swedish authorities, but then arent given any kind of deradicalisation or therapy or heck even interviewed really as in not very thoroughly..... theyre just kinda left to return to normal society. There are a few other things, like the fact that fatima is able to seemingly get off scott free from all the sh*t she did? Like i know nadir said he would push it under the rug but how exactly? There were a lot of things she did and i dont really see how one guy saying ""we'll drop it"" is good enough, Among other things that i cant really remember.
Also got general islamaphobia undertones throughout the whole thing.

Dont get me wrong i loved it. But i think they need to have thought a bit more about certain ramifications of potentially harmful ideas theyve portrayed about islam, isis, and the swedish authorities"
Caliphate,"Can someone help explain to me who ,what part Miriam (sic)played ...
who was she ,was she targeted as well by the traveler ...I binged the show but couldn't fully watch some parts ..thank you ..."
Caliphate,"It was a great show so shouldn‚Äôt get distracted by semantics yet here I am...

My main question - are the portrayed borders to Islamic State realistic? The first was hard to get a good look at as it was dark when they got the girls out of the van but the check point Fatima goes through both times seemed very low key. I get that borders were constantly moving and IS wasn‚Äôt a true country but the borders seem to be only manned on the ISIL side of the road and there‚Äôs no war or front around the border on the road. 
And could you just request to enter and exit IS as long as you had a passport?

Can anyone please shed some light?"
Caliphate,"Somebody tell me why on earth there‚Äôs no intelligence services in Sweden? No Counterterrorism division, nothing that Fatima could turn to? Why on earth she didn‚Äôt go to CIA?üòÉ fu@king jock all of this. Crap that mad me loose 8 hours of my life"
Caliphate,"Just watched it. I am not Swedish, and have no bearing or relatability with any of the characters and islam. 

My curiosity got the best of me to learn more about the families whose children get brainwashed into this. I could feel the emotions of their father, who wants to keep them away from radicalization but both his daughters brought his worst fears to life. That was so frustrating to watch! 

I could also see that ""anti-radicalization"" doesn't work on such people. I guess, even if they're back from Syria or any other similar places, they're forever judging and hating infidels/non-believers. My heart went out to Pervin, who realised she'd made this grave mistake and there was no turning back. I think, once you make that big mistake of moving to a war zone or joining terrorists, you're facing a dead end (pun intended). Also, the whole system, bureaucracy is rigged and rife with internal flaws. 
The character Ibbe had this quality about him that whenever he appeared on screen, there was a pit in my stomach, and I'd just know something horrible is about to happen. 

I was also angry and almost thought that those who choose this path deserve what happened to them. I cannot understand who in their right minds would fall for wrong things knowingly."
Caliphate,"I thought the series was great at first but half way through it got a bit ridiculous. It was already enough of a coincidence with Fatima, Dolores, Pervin and Ibbe all somehow being connected through eachother. 

I know it‚Äôs only a show but the tattoo thing with Ibbe was ridiculous, as if no one had ever noticed this was on the video before publishing, or he would‚Äôve got rid of it. Also they really want him to spend all that time recruiting the girls when his planning such large scale attacks? Look at when the Karima almost found the gun in his drawer by living there. Could‚Äôve blown the whole operation if she freaked out and called the police.

This sounds a bit sick of me but absolutely no innocents dying is a bit much of a happy ending for me, takes away the potential grittiness let alone to realism.

Husam is an absolute joke of a man, fucking coward. He committed to IS, killed children and then cause his scared to die, wants to run away. He arguably indirectly talked Lisha into betraying him and Fatima to Omar. Then his basically walking off to freedom with the baby. 

Also, it was really necessary, at that very last minute when Pervin is in the car, that Fatima tells her to go back. Like there‚Äôs not gonna be any other opportunity to rescue her. 

The two brothers leaving a car for a bus wearing all that suspect military gear LOL. 

Oh yeah, the whole thing with the Arab guy from the agency. Stupid. I personally feel the good rogue cop was unnecessary."
Caliphate,"I didn‚Äôt get this part. She obviously was going to something totally different, was promised swimming pools, comfortable hotels and other sorts of fun. Why after staying on her own, all alone in those  appalling conditions, facing the prospects of being married off to some disgusting fart, not knowing the language and witnessing cruelty, she wouldn‚Äôt be terrified to death and wanting only one thing - getting back home? When did she even get a chance to be brainwashed to such extent? It all left me mind-boggled and pissed."
Caliphate,"I was SO mad about Lisha, I get that she's young, but she's still 13. You have no phone, no pools, no luxury apartment but you're still on the side of the people who recruited you and backstabbed the only people trying to help you?!"
Caliphate,"yeah that. like, she wants to see her sister clearly but knows her sis isn't there. why wouldn't she want to leave to see with her. also, she clearly has seen that whatever the recruiters told her are lies so...."
Caliphate,Kill me. Too much feelings.
Caliphate,Frrrrrrr i just finished watching it and I‚Äôm like wtf! When and how did she get brainwashed? I mean she barely appear in the show. Definitely plot twist lol. Little rat! Like they could‚Äôve probably hit her to get her unconscious and take her with them. And Poot Pervin man she didn‚Äôt deserve to die like that T_T
Caliphate,Yo do realize that it's Hussam's fault right for scaring her and putting in her head that her family didn't want her back. Besides kids are stupid. And I hope she freaking goes through hell for what she did.
Caliphate,I guess the whole thing is to just show the audience what 'the real martyr' is like..
Caliphate,"Yes it is, through SVT Play for free. Probably an exclusive deal"
Caliphate,Holy shit. Give this guy a job already ^
Caliphate,Fuck Lisha.
Caliphate,and then everybody clapped in the end?
Caliphate,"I too just finished it and wow what an emotional ending. Am Muslim: practicing, wear niqab; get called a terrorist from time to time when out and about browsing cheap crap in Kmart or going for a walk with my toddler and I do think portrayals like these do add to this kind of fear people have when they see a woman in niqab. 

I enjoyed this series and appreciated the backstory of Kerima especially, but I feel there was no ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù Muslim character - someone knowledgeable in Quran and Islamic jurisprudence, or exemplary in behaviour (so much swearing, rudeness, deception, and disrespect demonstrated by the Muslim characters - all traits that are not cricket for Muslims in real life). So I watched it, enjoying the drama, but thinking that yet again, the only way women who dress like me are portrayed in media seems to be in relation to terrorism. But the manipulation done by the recruiters as well as the vulnerabilities of the recruited was fair and well done.

There were inaccuracies in the way the ritual prayer was shown to be performed, but only Muslims would pick up on those. It‚Äôs not the biggest deal but it does come across as sloppy."
Caliphate,Subs not dubs wins again
Caliphate,You gotta watch it in the original audio.
Caliphate,"I actually thought they did a good job of showing how Muslims are the most vulnerable victims. I can imagine this would challenge the ‚Äúall Muslims are terrorists‚Äù generalization that misinformed people tend to make. 

Other than the few extremists that were in control, every single other Muslim was either a victim or fighting the good fight."
Caliphate,"I really enjoyed the show. Your suggestion is like saying we should just pretend ISIS doesn't exist and not ever make shows about it? I think it's better to shine a light and expose ISIS for what it is, its so mysterious and its easy for a lot of people to think that is what Islam is, but this show made it very clear that it is not. There were very few heroes in the show but the ones that were were Karema (at the end) and Pervin- they were two of the biggest hereos in the whole show and they were Muslim. I think many people already have a bias and I just don't think this show is going to make it any worse."
Caliphate,What they did was show how muslims are convinced that everyone hates islam when it is not even remotely true. And what division and pain this frame of mind brings. Your comment only proves the creators of the show did a good job capturing the reality.
Caliphate,I am not Muslim and I didn't not think it portrayed Islam in a bad way because we got to see what it is like for both sides for those who follow Sharia law and those who don't..it showed how easy it is for young kids to get caught up with these kinds of people.. honestly there is no difference between jihadist and Skin heads/Neo Nazi/White supremacists they all use the same tactics to get people to join them. What infuriated me was the parents of those two girls  why didn't they sit them down and explain to them what Islam really is. Guide them instead of just trying to force their ways on them.
Caliphate,What do you think about the fact that there are over 10 Islamic countries where it is punishable by death to be an ExMuslim. Do you think that portrays Islam in a negative light?
Caliphate,"I'm not even Muslim but the amount of deception in this show is just shocking. There's clearly an agenda behind it and since 90% of people don't even understand the complexity of the issue, the show will create more hate than anything.
The producers are clearly doing this on purpose. It's just pathetic and disgraceful. 
I'm not surprised though, when you take a deep look at the producers of those kind of series and where their money comes from you understand their agenda."
Caliphate,The powers-that-be have no interest in making stories about Muslims in a positive light.
Caliphate,"I would never have picked up on the ""created by a non Muslim white people vibe"" so thank you for pointing that out.

Have you watched Ramy? I thought it was fantastic-- also ""good TV"" but this time created by a Muslim non-white person."
Caliphate,[deleted]
Caliphate,what pissed me off was in one of the episodes when they mention that you should kill apostates in the Quran and the mother replies with the book is a thousand years old the show should have done there research nowhere in the Quran does it say to murder people who don't believe in your religion it is misleading and the book being old does not justify the claim that it says that in fact it says just the opposite and to treat others whether they are Muslim or not with kindness and respect
Caliphate,"They get the money from the ISIS. Terrorist organizations do receive lots of money through streams of donations from supporters in different countries, oil trading and other sources."
Caliphate,Definitely what it seemed like to me. Damn that last phone call was ALOT!! You are reminded that these are just young girls then....
Caliphate,I think so. There's no way he could have hung up for her. We stopped hearing her voice because he detonated the bomb.
Caliphate,"Also you can hear little ""boom"" in the background"
Caliphate,"I don‚Äôt think there are any tbh. Remember that 90% of the media in the U.S. is controlled by the same 6 corporations. It allows them to influence minds to support decisions the government makes. Considering how militarily involved the U.S. (and other western countries) has been in the Middle East, it makes sense why we are often demonized in the media. But ‚ÄúRamy‚Äù on hulu I would say is an accurate portrayed of Muslim life."
Caliphate,"It was summed up when Suleiman asked Calle how do they change the way of thinking, and Calle pretty much said ""I don't know"".

Given Kerima's volatile home life, she is vulnerable. It's understandable that someone in her position, at her impressionable age, is looking for someone or something to give her meaning. That was Ibbe, who took advantage and essentially hypnotized her.

Sulle, on the other hand, comes from a seemingly stable and loving nuclear family. They're Muslim in name only. They are completely secular. Tuba doesn't cover her hair. Sulle plays sports. She and Lisha listen to hip hop. Suleiman is vehemently opposed to any religious practice. He doesn't like Tuba's tradtionalist cousins. He alludes to know what it's like to live under Sharia, so one would assume he is an immigrant striving to assimilate. In Syria, Lisha tells the women she knows nothing about Islam.
What motivates someone from this ordinary family life to want to move to Syria? Sure, that lady partner of Ibbe is a con artist, but that can't be it alone. 

My biggest question is how does Ibbe keep getting away?? Before the big day, Calle tried to corner him for questioning and he jumps over a railing, down the stairs, and that's it? They didn't bother calling for backup that a person of interest was fleeing, knowing that he is very likely The Travellers?

The media said Ibbe was born to a Swedish mother and Egyptian father. Was he radicalized in Egypt during his basketball career? Was that story even true?

It's basically a Swedish take on Homeland."
Caliphate,"I'm thinking because Husam said that Lisha is dead to her parents. That they don't want her back, so she clings to her religion, because at least there she'll feel a sense of belonging."
Caliphate,It was explained pretty well in that scene when husam talked about how lishas parents never want to see her. I dont think she was just brainwashed. I think she was terrified of going back home. How does one even look their parents or peers in the eye after literally joining isis. I know that if that was me id prefer to just die than have to go home and face people I used to know.
Caliphate,"She was brainwashed way before she even got to Syria. Remember how she treated her sister when she stopped wearing the hijab. She definitely looked at all those videos and stuff online, and possibly even brainwashed by the teacher's assistant secretly without the knowledge of her sister - otherwise how did she know they were going to leave for Syria when they did? Unfortunately she was gone by that time, but the fact she still believed all that even after seeing everything in Raqqa is just simply because of her youth & ignorance"
Caliphate,yeah! I know right.... she was terrified when she had to go on alone.. and we never saw how she was recruited that much... I mean she is 13! i just cant imagine a 13 year old girl wanting to stay in a place where she gets married of like a puppet to old men.. she must be terrified... I hope in the second season they will explore why she did that and what is goinh on in lishas mind..
Caliphate,Yeah i hate her..But its just a movie
Caliphate,Husam is such a fucking pussy. What a wet wipe of a man
Caliphate,"Ah, probably why it's not on Netflix then :)"
Caliphate,Then the camera zooms out and it‚Äôs an autistic kid staring at a snow globe.
Caliphate,"Very interesting. You have a really good point, it‚Äôs unfair that the only portrayal of women in niqab were in a bad setting. Have you ever visited Syria/ had the desire to go?"
Caliphate,I'm interested as to why you're choosing a niqab vs hijab or chador?
Caliphate,"was pleased to see your review as my first thought when seeing this on netflix ( i havent watched it yet) was ughhh more evil evil terrorists, the west are saints,  be scared of the evil axis of terror that permeates so many western tv/movies of  the political/action/spy genre."
Caliphate,"Even that was a problem bro. How can the victims be Muslim yet know nothing about Islam at the same time? How could they be so vehement in their distaste for the ‚Äòwest‚Äô and the injustice for Muslim lives but not even know how to pray and live a Muslim life? 

The people who are culturally Muslim and know nothing about Islam are the ones most likely to really want to integrate into western societies. The narrative from that perspective was a mess, that‚Äôs why I said it was sad that they missed opportunities to represent Muslims that way."
Caliphate,"Kerima is no hero. For someone who studies in a European school and receives education, there is no good excuse for being that stupid. 

Ibbe is wanted by the police and she knows that, and is still keeping in touch and agreeing to blow up more people.

I‚Äôm only appalled at how incompetent the Swedish police is tracing Ibbe. Like how is he roaming free and able to meet kerima.  She should‚Äôve been under surveillance"
Caliphate,"There‚Äôs really no definite right or wrong if we are discussing this but I believe it would do a lot of good if non Muslims could get an interesting narrative that involves a reflection of the realities for the overwhelming majority. I do understand what you‚Äôre saying, but the damage is subtle and constant and repetitive. The magnification and overrepresentation of this extremism problem insinuates that it is more common in our communities than it is. It‚Äôs just jarring to see, especially in the context of growing right wing, anti immigrant and anti Muslim sentiments in many, many Western countries."
Caliphate,"You said that it gave you a chance to see those who follow sharia law... but ISIS does not follow sharia law lol. There many things they do that is against Islamic law such as suicide bombings, killing of innocents, spreading terror and havoc in societies and more. Do you see what I mean? This is not a part of Islam, they are a tumour. We don‚Äôt need any more stories like this, we need positive, educational narratives to balance the world‚Äôs view of Islam."
Caliphate,if you make points like that it helps to actually explain them.
Caliphate,truth is always bitter sadly
Caliphate,?
Caliphate,"I think it‚Äôs just  symptom of the demographic that holds the means to produce shows being of a demographic that is not Muslim. Expectedly, they are less sensitive to our issues. The most disappointing thing for me was that there were so many opportunities to convey a powerful and positive message, but they are apathetic to our needs as well. The conclusion we can draw from this is for us to create more realistic and representative narratives"
Caliphate,"Or perhaps consider most the prayers were intentionally wrong because of the demographic being shown. 

They even showed most of them knew very little from Islam and did not grow up with it, but instead learned along the way. 

Even Ibbe was originally from Sweden and lived there most of his life. He, like many of the others, may not have been raised with it. 

Just food for thought."
Caliphate,"No I‚Äôll definitely check it out though, thank you :)"
Caliphate,Don't you realise that you reveal how foolish you are when you comment things like that? You are so ignorant that you are unaware of your own ignorance loooool. Look up the 'dunning kruger' effect
Caliphate,"Uuuuh lol:

9:11-12:

But if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, they are your brethren in faith; and We make the communications clear for a people who know. And if they break their oaths after their agreement and (openly) revile your religion, then fight the leaders of unbelief-- surely their oaths are nothing-- so that they may desist.

9:73-74:

O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites! Be harsh with them. Their ultimate abode is hell, a hapless journey's end. They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong), yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they purposed that which they could not attain, and they sought revenge only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty. If they repent it will be better for them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend nor helper in the earth.

And in the hadith:

Bukhari 3017 :

`Ali burnt some people and this news reached Ibn `Abbas, who said, ""Had I been in his place I would not have burnt them, as the Prophet (Ô∑∫) said, 'Don't punish (anybody) with Allah's Punishment.' No doubt, I would have killed them, for the Prophet (Ô∑∫) said, 'If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.' ""

Bukhari 6878:

Allah's Messenger (Ô∑∫) said, ""The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims.""

Bukhari 6930:

Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah's Messenger (Ô∑∫), by Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah's Apostle saying, ""During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith) and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day of Resurrection.""


Like that's just some of it, and just for apostates. Do you really know your religion so poorly?"
Caliphate,it's on netflix
Caliphate,It‚Äôs a story about Swedish teens being recruited by ISIS. Where would they possibly fit in a positive setting with women wearing niqabs?
Caliphate,"I visited a neighbouring country a decade ago (my first time overseas), so that was before all this trouble started. There were a few Syrian ladies I met through the families I was staying with so heard a little about the place, but didn‚Äôt feel too intrigued to visit Syria for some reason to be honest! They told me taking short trips there by people in neighbouring countries was popularised because of some well known Syrian TV show that everyone loved. Over the last ten years it hasn‚Äôt crossed my mind at all to go there, whether for tourism or to put myself and my family in a war zone."
Caliphate,"Sorry I don‚Äôt know the correct terminology, I was just going off of what the first comment said. In the show, the only time women were in full dress (niqab?), they were actually in Syria. In Sweden, I believe the girls only wore hijab (again, I don‚Äôt know the proper names). I was simply observing different dress in different parts of the show. No malice behind that."
Caliphate,Do you actually live in Europe ? I know several people who have a very similar life trajectory there. Primarily driven by the institutional racism in Europe where second generation immigrants lack identity and cling on to Islam. Do you think all those people who went to fight for ISIS for Belgium were there raised to become extremists ?
Caliphate,"Yeah I thought Sulle lacked proper back story. I expected Lisha to turn into a scared child once they tried to rescue her. 

Kerima‚Äôs case made sense though how she was vulnerable."
Caliphate,"Thats actually like a well known thing. They typically recruit people who have very little knowledge of Islam. Seriously, there are studies and articles about this. They usually recruit people who have little knowledge of Islam."
Caliphate,[deleted]
Caliphate,Kerima has serious mental health issues as she has to deal with an abusive and alcoholic father. Perfectly understandable that she will align with a stronger character that offers her refuge
Caliphate,I really appreciate reading your well-articulated points
Caliphate,"Can you provide sources as to where it is disallowed to kill innocents, spread terror and havoc or even suicide bombings? Because there seems to be a lot of disagreement on that one as suicide bombings are not seen as taking your life in despair, but giving your life and becoming a martyr."
Women Of The Night,HBO to Naughty Dog: ‚Äúima need you to make a third game or we‚Äôll write our own part three‚Äù
Women Of The Night,But did you know that diarrhea is hereditary?
Women Of The Night,Roughly 20% growth episode on episode is insane. These numbers are insane
Women Of The Night,Execs everywhere now combing over every video game ever
Women Of The Night,I‚Äôve been loving this show so much. I‚Äôm so glad someone who actually cares for the source material is making this show.
Women Of The Night,should hopefully keep steady til final.
Women Of The Night,"How do the ratings compare between Friday and Sunday nights in the US? I know there are games on other channels on Sunday, but aren't a lot of people out on a Friday night?"
Women Of The Night,"Crazy thing about well made shows: people watch them. 

Together we can stop shitty entertainment, but we need to work together on this people"
Women Of The Night,"Said it the the second week, I'll say it again

Season finale will have HOTD finale numbers, 10+M."
Women Of The Night,Well it helps that the show is really good. Not many shows live up to the hype this had. As a Halo fan I gave up on the show. I‚Äôm sure the relative loyalty of the source is retaining fans.
Women Of The Night,Aw the IMDB review bombing is working real well
Women Of The Night,[deleted]
Women Of The Night,"The more I enjoy this great show, the sadder I feel about how they absolutely butchered the Witcher and the Wheel of Time..."
Women Of The Night,This show is absolutely killing it!
Women Of The Night,"i have not been a hype man for this show at all and i gotta say it's the best videogame adaptation that i know of. typical HBO quality in regards to everything. every episode has been solid and last week's was phenomenal and reminded me of what the walking dead could have been if it was on HBO.

if they push this to two or three seasons by adapting the second game i can totally see it becoming an all-timer for the network. the people making this show know what they're doing."
Women Of The Night,"recipe to success is very simple

\- simple story

\- complex characters"
Women Of The Night,Have they mentioned whether season 1 is the full game? Because already episode 5‚Ä¶meaning only 4 hours left of story which blows my mind.
Women Of The Night,"**It's the behemoth that keeps on growing:**

>Episode 4 of *THE LAST OF US* delivered another series high Sunday night, with 7.5 million viewers across HBO Max and linear telecasts. Viewership was up 17% from Episode 3 last Sunday and 60% above the series debut night in January. Viewing is based on Nielsen and first party data. The series has grown its audience each Sunday night with the release of new episodes."
Women Of The Night,cant stop the pedro train
Women Of The Night,Season 2 is going to be off the hook.
Women Of The Night,Not that surprising consider this is its first week without NFL playoffs.
Women Of The Night,"I'm one of the people who helped it grow this weekend.  We hadn't checked it out yet, but I kept hearing so much good feedback about the 3rd episode that I finally decided to check the show out.  My wife and I watched the first episode Friday night and were instantly hooked.  What a well written, directed and acted show so far.

The 3rd episode was a masterpiece, imo.  I've never been so emotionally invested in a pair of one-off characters before.  My wife had tears in her eyes for half the episode.  Not going to elaborate to avoid spoilers.  

Only 4 episodes so far, but no clunkers and no filler.  If it keeps up this pace, it will be my favorite new show since The Expanse."
Women Of The Night,"Oh, so you mean all the right wing backlash because episode three had some gay dudes in it amounted to nothing?

Shocker.

These people might be loud assholes, but they‚Äôre the minority and they‚Äôre slowly being relegated to the sad pages of history."
Women Of The Night,A truly impressive video game to TV series adaptation so far. They deviate from the source material when it makes for a better story and I'm here for it
Women Of The Night,"You know what?  Good for everyone involved.  When people make a good product to tell a good story everybody wins.  I'm looking forward to the season closing out so I can watch it all in one go and I'll do the same in the second season, too."
Women Of The Night,"I love how terminally online bigots said it would drop like crazy after the third episode and then this happens. Like even I expected a slight drop, but it didn't come. This is absolutely insane."
Women Of The Night,Surely this can‚Äôt be true. A bunch of people online told me that HBO pushing their woke agenda in Ep. 3 was going to kill the show??
Women Of The Night,maybe an unpopular opinion but i felt Ep. 4 was the best one so far. only wish it was longer. great character development in this one and still some cool action scenes
Women Of The Night,This is easily one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen.
Women Of The Night,"The creative talent behind this show is off the chain. Craig Mazin has done a tremendous job adapting the source material and building upon an already incredible story. The casting across the board has been A+. The decision to have Peter Hoar direct Ep.3 was a stroke of genius, with his previous work on It's a Sin making total sense. Just goes to show what can happen when talented people are passionate about a project and given the means to see their vision come about."
Women Of The Night,"And this is in spite of half of Canadians being left unable to watch it for a couple of hours because our telecom company, bell, is garbage."
Women Of The Night,Praise Druckmann. The man is just on a roll every week with the amazing episodes
Women Of The Night,Dad jokes delivered!
Women Of The Night,"It's amazing what can be achieved when they create a show that is faithful to the spirit of the source material, rather than trying to make wholesale changes in an almost condescending fashion. No one cares about a particular writer or directors idea for how to reimagine a beloved IP just for the sake of making it their own. The audience want the IP. They want what makes that series great.

I don't want an Assassin's Creed movie where the dude is jumping around in some virtual room for example instead of going into the animus as you do in every single game. What the fuck was that even? They completely missed what mattered"
Women Of The Night,I have been doing my part to get as many people into it as possible haha
Women Of The Night,"Pedro Pascal seems like a magnet to drawing viewers. GoT, Mandalorian, Last of Us he‚Äôs doing great"
Women Of The Night,This almost guarantees a third last of us game and probably a 3rd season of the show also.
Women Of The Night,Good show
Women Of The Night,They can easily stretch part 2 into 2 seasons
Women Of The Night,"Everyone and their mother is on this.

Which is great, it's a good story and they're doing a good job since they care.

Thing is that the game is cinematic on its own, and I'm glad new people are exposed to it (which was definitely one of the goals) but don't forget, It isn't totally new. So, I'm glad the adaptation is good but the story existed in the last 10 years at this point.

I guess this main stream we-discovered-something-amazing all of a sudden, kinda bugs me, I dunno."
Women Of The Night,But but but woke broke or w/e!?
Women Of The Night,I think ep4 was pretty mild compared to ep3. So I wonder if that surge will continue.
Women Of The Night,"Last episode was okay, first three were huge."
Women Of The Night,"It's so good. Not to harp on that dead horse velma, but when the wife and I decided to catch up on last of us..we had to get through three velma promotions to find it in the search bar. They're really advertising that sucker hard in front of last of us"
Women Of The Night,"While this news is exciting, the last episode was the least entertaining so far."
Women Of The Night,I must be the only person who felt that the show is severely overrated.
Women Of The Night,I don‚Äôt remember the last time there was so much hype surrounding a show. I‚Äôm trying to wait until the seasons over to binge it but it‚Äôs getting harder each week!
Women Of The Night,So tripping over the fact I watched the new episode with my mom of all people because apparently she is really into it. Pretty cool how its even pulling in people who have no frame of reference of the source material who are just loving it.
Women Of The Night,"Crazy how if you make a good show, people will watch it."
Women Of The Night,"Three seasons would be good, please dont drag it out forever like the walking dead"
Women Of The Night,"I'm curious if the show is also driving sales/downloads of the game. I think it's one of the ps plus classics they're giving away. 

Though it's been out for so long and in the video game world people have been raving about it since release, so I don't even know how big any untapped market could be."
Women Of The Night,"hopefully this sparks tv shows of other games. 

outlast, a good resident evil series, the evil within, amnesia, dying light, bio shock, horizon zero dawn, fallout, dead island, assassins creed. 

there is such a wealth of quality tv show content that could be made from existing video game universes"
Women Of The Night,Oh boy I can't wait for the David episode
Women Of The Night,It‚Äôs almost like good quality and slow releases build audience.
Women Of The Night,I'm surprised that I like it since I can't stand anything zombie.
Women Of The Night,"shows the benefit of streaming, can watch the service instead of having to have cable"
Women Of The Night,Sony must be happy.
Women Of The Night,E3 hit me right in the feels
Women Of The Night,Some would say it is growing like a fungus.
Women Of The Night,It was pretty good.
Women Of The Night,I‚Äôd be one too if hbo max app wasn‚Äôt crap
Women Of The Night,"Bruh i hope season two goes with the longer episodes every time, the shorter ones leave me wanting more but ep 1 n 3 really felt like complete episodes"
Women Of The Night,The show is really great!
Women Of The Night,I‚Äôm trying to get into it but im also still catching up on walking dead and I don‚Äôt think I have the capacity for both.
Women Of The Night,New gay demo is like ‚Äúthis ain‚Äôt what I signed up for‚Äù
Women Of The Night,Netflix would have cancelled it by now.
Women Of The Night,They need an Xbox version. Don‚Äôt hate me
Women Of The Night,I never played TLOU but am familiar with the concept and story line. Because of this show I'm watching a radbrad walk through and rewatched the last 3 episodes this week. Such a great show. Completely hooked.
Women Of The Night,"I'm liking this series so far, and it's really doing the games justice from a drama standpoint, but I can firmly say now I prefer the way the game tells this story.  That ambush scene was pretty disappointing compared to the way it played out the game."
Women Of The Night,"Still haven't seen one thing on this show that hasn't been done so many times before.  Character, plot, world, every single beat has been done so many times already.  Doesn't feel like there's any reason for the show to exist."
Women Of The Night,This just does not happen. Even HOT which was a hit for HBO didn't do it . It was decreasing week after week ever since the second episod premiered. Word of mouth is what selling this show.
Women Of The Night,"For those of you who haven't played the game, you can watch this playthrough of it once the show is over, (or can watch along as the show progresses). It will give you the gameplay experience and the close to a commentary from the creators/makers/performers of the game. Also helps in understanding the difference between the game and the show. Even for people who have this might give you a very good insight.

The playthrough is by Nolan North (performance actor for Nathan Drake of Uncharted, a generally bad gamer but funny person), assisted by Troy Baker (who plays Joel from the game) and more or less each episode will feature the actor who plays an important role in it. 

[Gameplay walkthrough ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeAoBVaD6aozN80rjIss28SHHlKf-mACx)"
Women Of The Night,"When I first heard about this show I just thought oh no another Walking Dead, but I'm happy I started watching it, the first 4 episodes have been great but I hope they don't drag it out too long just to keep the show running. Quality of Quanity is better."
Women Of The Night,This is spreading hugely by word of mouth in my office at work.
Women Of The Night,The latest episode wasn‚Äôt anything special.
Women Of The Night,"The show is definitely doing the game justice. If season one ends where the first game does though, that‚Äôs probably where I‚Äôll jump off. I‚Äôm not a fan of any of what they did in the second game. That whole narrative direction can get f‚Äôed."
Women Of The Night,"It's a good show, I'm enjoying it....but I don't get the insane amount of hype surrounding it. It's good, but not the best thing I've ever seen, by a long shot."
Women Of The Night,"""Go Woke... ~~go broke~~ eeer get a larger audience"""
Women Of The Night,This show is so astroturfed.
Women Of The Night,Episode 5 is about to tank hard since they are (temporarily) moving it to Friday due to the Super Bowl.
Women Of The Night,"7.5 million viewers? If this were Netflix it would have been canceled 15 minutes into the first episode hahaha

/s so the Netflix love brigade does not kill me"
Women Of The Night,Where is the Metal Gear Solid series?
Women Of The Night,It‚Äôs too damn good.
Women Of The Night,"Honestly so far I have loved the show and it has easily passed my favourite shows, I just wasn't very fond of this weeks episode, sometimes we need slower episodes yes, but it didn't feel as good as the first 3 episodes."
Women Of The Night,Love to see it. This story was well written for the game and they have translated it so well to the screen. I hope we keep seeing growth as more episodes come out and I can‚Äôt wait to see the conversations that happens with the last episode and Joel‚Äôs choices.
Women Of The Night,Is this legit good? I've never played the game before but love to immerse myself in a well told story.
Women Of The Night,In episode 4 why didn't they just drive up the hill and cross the road and around the tunnel?
Women Of The Night,"So far this show hasn‚Äôt really been anything new, it‚Äôs not really a breath of fresh air. It‚Äôs hbo so the casting & acting is always elite. So far after 4 episodes I‚Äôd give it around a 7.3/10"
Women Of The Night,"sure it is, the publicity it's getting is also not normal"
Women Of The Night,"Uh, so it went woke but didn't go broke"
Women Of The Night,See what happens when you take the tome to show respect to the ip you‚Äôre adapting? It gets positive results. Take notes Velma üìù
Women Of The Night,"I thought that episode 3 last week was really good, but I am happy that it looks like they are back on track with the game's story"
Women Of The Night,Wow. I wonder what next week's headlines will be?
Women Of The Night,It‚Äôs mostly hype. It‚Äôs already becoming the worst of the walking dead. An hour show where nothing really happens.
Women Of The Night,Boring
Women Of The Night,I might be having a contrarian view out here. But i just don't understand what is the hype all about? This is one of the most disengaging big shows in recent times i have seen
Women Of The Night,So glad to know that episode three still did very well despite the homophobic review bombs
Women Of The Night,Could you imagine if Sony didn‚Äôt drop the ball on uncharted and try to cash cow that movie. That series could have been just as killer.
Women Of The Night,I cried when I finished game one.
Women Of The Night,ima still wait till its all out

Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,This was a great read.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can‚Äôt quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Delta state was the shit!
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,It was on both actually
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might‚Äôve been YTV
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Intro to that crazy show. I really liked it as a kid.

Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,remembering this show felt like a fever dream. only thing i remember with her in it specifically was maybe a song about ....boxing? something about rolling with the punches. and there being a roller blading rabbit.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"I had almost forgotten about this show. The theme song just came rushing back to me. What a trip! Move over, Chip ‚Äòn‚Äô Dale, there‚Äôs a new ear worm in town..."

Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Didn't know John Oliver was in this
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Oh no! She was so freaking amazing. I have some great memories watching this show with my father every morning. She will be missed.

Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,I thought I remembered every show I watched as a child. Holy fuck as soon as I saw that rabbit guy it clicked.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Why did I literally put one of the shows on yesterday for my kid to watch after 20 yrs of never seeing an episode! Coincidentally this shows up on my feed the next day.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,I had nightmares for YEARS because of The Were-hare.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Aww that's so sad. I loved this show as a kid. She was great.

Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"I liked it too, and there's no way that zoobilee zoo people weren't involved with this.  Pretty sure the zoobilee fox was the caterpillar in this."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,I was a kid in the late 90's who LOVED Alice in Wonderland. I found a VHS of a couple episodes of this at the local video store and watched the whole thing in a state of complete confusion and bafflement. 10/10. The early 90's are almost impossibly strange if you didn't live through them.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Welp now I feel old, I would put this show on for a couple kids I used to babysit üòë"
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Drugs weren‚Äôt as creative in the 90‚Äôs.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"The one vivid thing I remember is an episode where the queen hits her funny bone and loses her sense of humor. She tells the Cheshire cat to wipe the smile off his face and he says, ""I can't wipe the smile off the face, but I can wipe the face off the smile,"" and does the Cheshire Cat disappearing trick."
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,"Only episode I remember rovolved around Alice messing up the Queen's favorite chair and getting the mad hatter and March hare to reupholster it but they had to use some blue fabric so it was mostly red but there was this blue triangle and Alice knew she was going to get in trouble, but then it turned out the queen had been gone all day picking blueberries and she sat on the chair before looking at it and then assumed the blue spot was a stain from the blue berries."

Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,Yeah ! that was a great episode.
Shaun the Sheep: Adventures from Mossy Bottom,This was me too. The show started and I always had to leave about 15 minutes in to it. Really enjoyed this show in the mornings as a kid.

Small scale Warhammer game set in the 40k universe. I don't know too much about it other than the buy in is sub $200 but people seem to like it.

There's also many other minis games if you want to get into that hobby:

* Infinty
* Warmachine/Hordes
* Malifaux
* Guild ball
* Arena Rex"
Angels of Death,"Whilst i think a lot of the books are fantastic, one of the best places to lose yourself is the Wiki. 

Start at the beginning of the imperium of man and read outwards, you can literally grab any story thread that interests you and youll probably lose hours just to that.

Angels of Death,"If you're a gamer, buy dawn of war off steam. It's cheap and my all time favorite rts game. The mods are awesome and it's a great gateway drug into the 40k universe."
Angels of Death,You can just look up one of the major factions on Lexicanum and that'll start you on a deep dive i to 40k lore for free. Alternatively you could look for a copy of one of the full rulebooks for 40k from 5th edition onwards. Those have decent chunks of the book dedicated to lore and from that you can jump off to the codex for any faction that catches your interest.
Angels of Death,Eisenhorn Audiobooks.... do it
Angels of Death,/r/40klore is a great way to learn about the lore and universe without painting figures or buying 50 books. 
Angels of Death,Check out /r/Warhammer and ask the community how to get started. Tons of ways to do it to suit your budget and likes. 
Angels of Death,How dare you talk about my boys in blue and gold like that.
Angels of Death,Blood angels are just ultramarines painted red. 
Angels of Death,Space Marine was a great game with an awful name.  Still wish we got a sequel..
Angels of Death,Is it true that third-party (read: cheaper) figurines are generally pretty accepted and can help reduce some cost?
Angels of Death,"\> MUH GRIMDARK

Seriously though, one hive city is enough to create a long series. No need to go big and affect the ""cannon""."
Angels of Death,1d4chan is also a great source for 40k information and not as dry as a typical wiki.
Angels of Death,"> or buying 50 books.

Roughly 53 books in and the Horus Heresy isn't even finished yet!"
Angels of Death,I wanted to see Roberta Girlyman in CG splendor.
Angels of Death,"You could use a flat pieces of cardboard with the word ""Dreadnought"" written on it to play the game, but your mileage may vary, and Games Workshop enforces rules around ""official"" places to play."
Angels of Death,[deleted]
Angels of Death,"That right there sounds like bullshit. ""Enforces"" where you can play. They can fuck right off."
Angels of Death,Robot killingman
Angels of Death,They don't tell you not to play at your local game shop because they sell 3rd party models. They are just strict about what kind of stuff they allow when it comes to tournament and official play. 
Angels of Death,It is a huge sprawling mess across the board. I have the distinct impression that the first few episodes of each season are well thought out and planned and generally pretty good and then the writers just start making shit up as they go. I wonder if they have a huge dartboard with random shit written on it.
Angels of Death,1 and 2 are the good seasons. It just gets worse.
Angels of Death,"Unfortunately, if you don't like the first couple of Seasons, you're not going to like the later episodes.  It gets really bad after Freak Show."
Angels of Death,"No. It‚Äôs always the same problem:

1.	strong, intriguing start
2.	then show runner gets distracted by something shiny about halfway through the season
3.	then it goes off the rails
4.	awful ending

The only coherent season was the one about the girls school for witches."
Angels of Death,"The writers don't understand story structure, and they never figure it out."
Angels of Death,"It's hilarious that you feel this way because most longtime AHS fans feel like the show went downhill after season two with only some redeeming seasons/moments.

Although maybe if you hate the first two seasons you'll enjoy the seasons that the majority of other fans hate."
Angels of Death,"American Horror Story is pretty much always a mess. Each season tends to start strong but loses direction after about 4 episodes and unravels into an incoherent, flabby disaster. S2 is probably the best season so if you didn't like it then it's probably not for you. I still enjoy it but my expectations for it are pretty low."
Angels of Death,If you think those are bad‚Ä¶ just wait until you get to Apocalypse
Angels of Death,"The first season is by far the strongest and most cohesive. Second season is a mess but fun. Third season is a campy mess but fun. After that it only gets more laborious and convoluted and self indulgent. Season 4 is actually infamous for a lot of people not finishing it. I don‚Äôt recommend going past season 3, especially if you‚Äôre already finding it to be this way."
Angels of Death,No it gets way worse
Angels of Death,"Oh god no, lol. I mean, some later seasons are entertaining, but every one of them is a damn mess."
Angels of Death,"My absolute favorite was season 3, American Horror Story: Coven.  That season had excellent story lines, phenomenal acting from the cast and it wasn‚Äôt predictable.  I tried to hang in there with each new season but it just kept getting more ridiculous.  I saw the previews for the latest season AHS: NYC.  The previews always make the show look so juicy and interesting but when you watch each episode, it just turns out to be really campy."
Angels of Death,Lol no. Actually the first 2 especially asylum are the best.
Angels of Death,No
Angels of Death,"If you didn‚Äôt like those, you would have a terrible time going forward."
Angels of Death,Hahaha. Nope
Angels of Death,It doesn't get better. Chekhov's gun is always being violated
Angels of Death,Season 1 is the only one I really liked
Angels of Death,"No. It‚Äôs always like this, just in different flavors."
Angels of Death,"Those are the two best seasons. If you don't like those two seasons, then you just don't like the show. There are some okay seasons following those, but they range from mediocre to what-the-fuck-were-they-thinking level of awful."
Angels of Death,Yeah if you don't like S1 and 2 you may like 3 but otherwise give up.
Angels of Death,"It‚Äôs a fucking shitshow honestly, but some seasons are a ton of fun. I adore coven and 1984 since they‚Äôre just so goofy and cheesy"
Angels of Death,AHS: Coven (Season 3) is the best season of the series. IMO.
Angels of Death,"Every part of this show is a huge sprawling disasters mess. I honestly don't know how people can enjoy it.

I legitimately think they just make it up as they go. The season starts off with an interesting idea, then diverts into 50 different directions and loose ends that go nowhere and plot holes everywhere and nothing makes sense. Rinse and repeat."
Angels of Death,The first one was great. It progressively gets worse.
Angels of Death,"That's how Ryan Murphy runs all his shoes, halfway through her just introduces new characters and plot points when he has wrapped up what has already started and no clear direction for where it's going"
Angels of Death,Kinda seems like its the MO of the show. I will say NYC had a clear metaphor
Angels of Death,Hell to the no it doesn‚Äôt get better
Angels of Death,"Coven, Freak Show, Hotel and maybe Apocalyse are the only descent ones."
Angels of Death,It certainly doesn‚Äôt get ***better*** lol
Angels of Death,Congrats you got through the watchable seasons. Might as well stop now.
Angels of Death,"It honestly was never good to me, but I normally hear people say they at least like the first two seasons."
Angels of Death,I‚Äôd watch season 3 and season 8.
Angels of Death,"Not sure it gets crazier than the  one about the mental hospital, oh my lord."
Angels of Death,No
Angels of Death,I loved it until I got sober.  I don't think it's intended to be consumed that way.
Angels of Death,"Nope it just gets worse. And this is coming from someone that stuck with it for ten seasons. 

American Horror Story is such a great concept. It‚Äôs a shame it wasn‚Äôt in the hands of a more competent director. I wish Mike Flanagan had created AHS."
Angels of Death,"No they get worse!  The stories start out interesting but soon get bogged down in their own mythology.  Like the 1984 season, which I thought was going to be a straight slasher story got out of control at the midway point and never fully recovered.  Plus the same cast each season is getting tiresome.  Sarah Paulson gets on my nerves.  And the overtly gay themes really hinder the series.  Plus the glamorization of real life serial killers is unsettling‚Ä¶"
Angels of Death,"Are you watching these in weekly installments or binging each season? I ask because the series, to me, does not lend itself to binging. You need time between each episode to breathe‚Ä¶ and forgot things. Overall, the entire series is batshit with some seasons having better arcs and episodes than others. Watch American Horror Stories if you‚Äôre looking for something in the same vein but in much smaller doses of absurdity."
Angels of Death,Hahaha I kept yelling at my TV. Lock the doors and stop these weirdos from going into your house! But I did enjoy s1 and first half of s2
Angels of Death,No. They‚Äôre all awful shows that suffer from poor writing and a constant need to shock the audience with cheap tricks. Embarrassing stuff.
Angels of Death,"I had such high hopes for it. The first few episodes of the first season were genuinely creepy. And then it all fell apart. I made it through season 1 & 2, tried 3 and gave up, and occasionally try again and give up every time."
Angels of Death,"No

it‚Äôs just gore for the sake of shock value. Especially in the later seasons."
Angels of Death,If you don't like the first two seasons then quit while you're ahead. It only gets worse.
Angels of Death, not at all
Angels of Death,"Unfortunately not.  The format seems to always start with a premise that's compelling/has promise, does some interesting things here and there, then it goes a bit off-track when it starts to just try to tick boxes for horror in that genre, ends up forgetting/abandoning some of the interesting stuff from the beginning, and then the writers panic trying to wrap-up up as many plotlines as they can in the last few episodes.

The only season that I thought that faired a little better was *Roanoke*.  Though only because it followed the reality TV interview and re-enactment format and then there's a reveal about the veracity of the interviewee statements when all hell breaks loose.  It also featured Kathy Bates, Leslie Jordan, and Stefanie Germanotta.  It's still a heck of a mess though."
Angels of Death,"As an AHS fan no, it gets worse."
Angels of Death,Circus and hotel are legit
Angels of Death,"No. It get more weird in a not scary way. Ryan Murphy grows his ego as time goes on, leaning hard in to identity politics, alternative lifestyles and political positions he disagrees with to create ""horror"". It just comes out outlandish."
Angels of Death,Freakshow was the only good season imo. It actually felt like something resembling horror.
Angels of Death,"I think the total messiness is kind of the charm of the show. It goes so far off the rails in every season and you're just along for the ride and the ""omg"" moments. It's really bad at many points but it's one of a kind at least."
Angels of Death,"Season 3 is pretty amazing. Watch that season at least before bouncing.

I agree though that Season 2 is all over the place without much payoff to the subplots tying into anything."
Angels of Death,"No, it just gets progressively worse."
Angels of Death,lol it gets progressively worse the longer it goes
Angels of Death,"Season 2 was the worst mess in my opinion. They couldn't decide on a villain, so they just put all of them in and called it a day."
Angels of Death,"The entire show, all of the seasons, I would compare to a fresh dog turd! Basically a shitshow to watch and only satisfying for whoever made it! Avoid like the plague!"
Angels of Death,It gets worse and worse progressively.
Angels of Death,"The best seasons by far are season 2 and 11, Asylum and NYC. Everything else is a huge step down."
Angels of Death,"Season 1 is ok, it is descent, it keeps up with a central idea. (for a first season it is pretty good by normal standards )

Season 2 asylum  they improve abit, but it gets confusing with all the aliens stuff. still it is ok 

Then \]coven, freak show and hotel They are pretty good. Hotel to be frank the only thing saving it is lady gaga and mat bomer. but coven and freak show are very good 

Went down hill with Roanoke and cult those are trash 

Apocalypse is a continuation of coven and it ties some of the past seasons together so I like how they did that. 

Then 1984, double feature, and NYC are all trash really."
Angels of Death,"I watched the show completely out of order. I pulled a list of the ones I've seen:

  
Murder House	12	October 5, 2011	December 21, 2011  
Asylum	13	October 17, 2012	January 23, 2013  
Coven	13	October 9, 2013	January 29, 2014  
Freak Show	13	October 8, 2014	January 21, 2015  
Apocalypse	10	September 12, 2018	November 14, 2018  
1984	9	September 18, 2019	November 13, 2019  


I think those are the ones I watched. I'd have to say I really enjoyed 1984 it was a lot of fun but Coven was excellent, I loved the witches. Freaks was the first season I watched and I enjoyed that as well. I love the special guest in Coven and then the start of the one episode just fit so perfectly. But quickly looking at that list, yeah Murder house is my least favorite. Asylum was decent."
Angels of Death,YES
Angels of Death,"They usually start out pretty good, but almost always fail to stick the landing by the end. Some of my favorite stories are the one-off episode flashback stories, because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre best at telling: short, contained narratives. 
With AHS, I found it was best to only watch the seasons that intrigued me from the outset and avoid the others. Murder House, Coven, and Apocalypse are my favorite ones."
Angels of Death,"No, this show was only good for a season. Considerably downhill after that. Weird thing is that all of the seasons turn about 8 episodes in and gets very very odd. Ending almost always sucks to each season. I would, however, recommend Ratchet on Netflix. That was a good series by Ryan Murphy that didn‚Äôt get too twisted or weird by the end."
Angels of Death,It‚Äôs just hit or miss. Asylum and Hotel are among my favorites but even the first season I didn‚Äôt really like. Never finished the most recent season.
Angels of Death,Those were the best two seasons to me. I‚Äôve pretty much stopped completely after Apocalypse.
Angels of Death,No
Angels of Death,It starts turning into shock horror and it's just not for me. I'm sure the kids like it.
Angels of Death,AHS‚Äôs entire writing premise is throw a million zany ideas at the wall and see what sticks. If anything it gets even more incoherent as it goes.
100 Humans,"My wife and I watched it mostly because it was awkwardly funny... and to poke fun at their awful testing methods. Hilariously small sample size, lack of proper control groups, and painfully bad methodology. It sounds like the participants themselves had a decent time, but the most informative parts of the show were the 90 second segments where they let the subject matter experts speak."
100 Humans,"Netflix has historically been very accepting of blatant psuedoscience. They've been a platform for ati-GMO, anti-vaxx, and any other anti-science you can think of."
100 Humans,"I watched the autoplay trailer last night. It looked like they probably hired a couple actors/actresses for the ""scientists"", then found a bunch of people who wanted to be on a TV show for a day, built a really cheap set, and shot the show in the course of a week or two.

Basically the show looked really cheap based on a simple premise. Netflix is trying to churn out a lot of content and some of it (especially these reality-TV-esque schlock) are going to have to be made super cheaply."
100 Humans,"It really is pseudoscience. I didn't even finish the first episode. After the second or so experiment it was just cringe worthy. They were done so poorly and they're so fucking smug about it.

You're right about there being a forced narrative. Very unprofessional and frankly insulting."
100 Humans,"Yeah... it‚Äôs more unfortunate because one of the hosts (Alie Ward) also hosts a pretty good science podcast called ‚ÄúOlogies‚Äù where she interviews all types of researchers in specific fields.

The moment the show put up a graph of the attractiveness score/10 for the uniformed vs. regular people, and then claimed that a difference of 0.2 was enough to definitively say that ‚ÄúUNIFORMS ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO x‚Äù I just closed the tab. Have they not heard of statistical significance?"
100 Humans,"> When did Netflix become a hotbed for pseudoscience?

Ignoring the obvious trash about some pretentious vag candle.  Look at the garbage of Love is Blind.  A cloned show of the Bachelor where they frame the idea of ""personalty only, with no looks involved"" where everyone is both high income and very attractive.  

The shotgun approach to releasing a variety of things is turning into the history channel & TLC method of ""trash gets ratings""."
100 Humans,Where I turned it off was when they told white parents to check on their white children or they might be running around in little KKK outfits because they Havnt been exposed to black children in their play dates lol ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
100 Humans,"I found it really entertaining, but the experiments were super flawed. It's unfortunate that most of the people watching won't realize that and take their results as fact."
100 Humans,Thanks for the warning. I'll remove it from my list.
100 Humans,"I found it interesting , not as in something to take it seriously, but I had so much fun watching it"
100 Humans,"Agreed. Also, this could have easily been titled:


>Watch 100 Humans Debase Themselves 


It was clearly filmed over 3-4 days with a small fucking budget. This was clearly pitched with the low budget being the key selling point."
100 Humans,"I mean, the hosts are comedians. I don't think they are really trying to be scientific - if they were, obviously they'd use bigger samples and wouldn't re-use the same people over and over between experiments. It's a fun pop-science show that is more interested in putting it's 100 person cast in the spotlight, letting the characters among them emerge naturally from the mix by running them through a variety of bizarre experiments. I really don't think you're supposed to take the show as seriously as you have."
100 Humans,I couldn‚Äôt even get through the first episode it was so bad! It was clear they were trying to bias the results or at least they didn‚Äôt screen for bias. I mean for real having a woman who was robbed judge the ‚Äúless attractive‚Äù robber of course is going to bring up the average. Having wildly different people be one type of profession of a uniform was so weird. Like at least make them all similar age/attractiveness to compare the uniforms? It was so obvious that it made it unwatchable
100 Humans,"I felt like the host Alie is supposed to remind us of the redhead from Mythbusters, but this show doesn't hold a candle to Mythbusters. Half of the experiments didn't even make sense. I still don't know what the different age groups building a chair was supposed to prove."
100 Humans,"So many poorly executed tests.

There are many worse examples, but the one that got under my skin was the 'reward vs. punishment' opener where they had to race with a ball twice.  Of course the second time they did it faster, they had practice!"
100 Humans,"Reminds me of the circle on netflix

A reality game show where the only thing the contestants do is talk to each other through the tv is the most boring concept for a tv show I've ever seen. I tried two episodes and couldn't continue."
100 Humans,So many variables. Been picking it apart! I am still enjoying watching it though.
100 Humans,This show has literal garbage experience. 1/4 are good but still missing some variables. It's entertaining but I wouldn't say IK about humans watching this.
100 Humans,"Also feels that among the 100 ""random"" participants, people you more often get to see would be actors/extras bringing this little character of their own creation for the purpose of the ""narration"""
100 Humans,"\>  When did Netflix become a hotbed for pseudoscience? 

I think Bill Nye was the first one with a BS pop-science show. I know that GOOP show is popular now, but I'm sure there's plenty of others that have fallen through the cracks. Hell, Making A Murderer was on Netflix and people gobbled up every word of it and only now are realizing how much of it was biased and bologna."
100 Humans,[deleted]
100 Humans,How funny this post popped up!  It's been on our 15 minute sleep timer this week.  Works like a charm!
100 Humans,Oh god that experiment sounds like they took an episode of What Would You do and mixed it with this scene from the office  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G7DHsrOlbc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G7DHsrOlbc)
100 Humans,"Idk, I thought it was pretty fun."
100 Humans,"I actually just finished watching that segment and felt compelled to go to the internet to rant as well. You could easily tell the couple and I was bewildered with the results. Over all the prompts seemed rigged. I wish they could have made a show similar that is actually good, with more diversity in the answers and hosts. Some of the things they say are also profoundly racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic, and disrespectful towards most every person. A lot of there so called normal people are famous actors"
100 Humans,"This show is supposed to be 100% dry, tongue in cheek and sarcastic, with some underlying interesting science. The American remake didn't really nail that."
100 Humans,"I enjoyed the show and watched the whole thing. However, I definitely agree it has major flaws. I love the sciency parts and testing subject matter that people have questions about, but they did it in an unscientific way and then presented it as scientific fact. Then after that they tried to cover it with super horrible, forced, cheesy humor. 
I personally love shows like Mythbusters and Brain Games that take science and math and STEM in general and make it fun and entertaining, all while teaching something. This show had a good premise and COULD be a great show, but it definitely needs work."
100 Humans,"Totally agree. Another glaring example was pain vs punishment. The cast is divided into rows. Each row passes a beach ball up and down the line. The first time with the promise of a prize for the fastest, the second time with a promise of punishment for the slowest.  The second time (unsurprisingly) the cast was about 10% (if I remember correctly - I may be a bit off, but the difference wasn‚Äôt much). The same people in the same rows were used for each test. It would seem obvious that random variation could explain the small change (they only did one trial) but even a non-scientist could guess that the second time could be faster due to practice. They used this to say they had demonstrated that fear of pain was a better motivator than promise of pleasure.  Another factor: in the first try only one row ‚Äúwins‚Äù so they are trying to be the FASTEST (possibly causing mistakes with more pressure) and the second one, the goal was really ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be the slowest‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbe the fastest. Each and every ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù had similarly huge errors in methodology.  

This type of trash ‚Äúinfotainment‚Äù is dangerous in that it can lead people to believe that the media IS indeed pushing a false narrative, and in these times of Trump - we don‚Äôt need idiots like these demonstrating that (in some cases) Trump is correct. Does similar damage to the ‚Äúthis is your brain on drug‚Äù adds of the 80‚Äôs. Everyone knows smoking pot once won‚Äôt ‚Äúfry‚Äù one‚Äôs brain - which can lead curious youngsters to throw out good information about the possible dangers of addiction along with those bunk messages."
100 Humans,"I'm glad to see someone has made this point. I just started watching it to try it out and it's so bad. The episodes should start out with charts breaking down representation by race, by orientation, by gender (and not just the binary), and more. 

Really the only parts worth watching are the expert parts"
100 Humans,"I like it. Sure it has flaws, but perhaps it needs a different perspective than yours.

Maybe it is bad at being scientifically accurate, but maybe it is really good at engaging young adults and uneducated peoples with math and science when they previously would not have. 

STEM fields have stigmas that prevent access. Simplified shows like this bridge gaps and encourage discussion that can lead to further education. 

I can agree that it has flaws, but from another perspective, I believe the statement, ""it should not have been made"" is slightly hyperbolic."
100 Humans,Ugh completely agree. There was a battle of the sexes to determine which sex used more words. They had a male host give the task and the subjects had to explain how to play tic tac toe to a male New Zealander. Then excluded one of the male subjects that's a special ed teacher because he went on and on to ensure that the women ended up using more words.
100 Humans,Is Explained also full of pseudoscience? Cuz I actually like that show and that would be devastating.
100 Humans,"100% agreed, you articulated my thoughts!"
100 Humans,in the first episode when they picked ‚Äúmore attractive‚Äù criminals vs ‚Äúless attractive‚Äù ones it was so bad lol felt so bad for the ‚Äúuglier‚Äù actors when some of them looked better
100 Humans,I have and I can‚Äôt stand the guy host. He‚Äôs trying way too hard to be funny and he is not
100 Humans,"They bought the concept from Dutch public television. I absolutely loved the Dutch version for the silly comedy-show that it was, hosted by a few celebs knows for their tongue in cheek 'don't take anything too seriously' other shows. They presented it for what it was. A 'scientific' show on par with the average glossy '10 questions to determine if your boyfriend loves radishes more then he does you' quiz.

The assignments and tests are quite often identical, as is the complete setup, but i don't immediately remember the 'match the couple' test. I remember most other tests though, though some results felt like a forced copy because the result were funny highlights of the Dutch version. The first thing I did notice, and kept noticing in the Netflix version is how judgemental it is. The redheaded female especially reminded me of the weird GI-JOE aftershow moral sketches that felt very belittling and demeaning to the audience. Some of the candidates really felt like hired extra's as they shared the typical American overabundance of emotion shown in reality shows reacting very unnaturally jovial.

So, quite enjoyable if you go into it with a blank and open mind, expecting general silliness."
100 Humans,"I know I'm late to this discussion, but everything you've said is correct. They did no hypothesis testing, they didn't correct for obvious confounders, and they didn't test subjects independently. They designed experiments that were biased and then demonstrated no statistical insights beyond showing you averages and raw data. What they did here wasn't science or statistics, it was data collection, and a shit one at that."
100 Humans,"Fuck this show. This show had alot of potential if it actually stuck to truly unbiased experiments instead of designing them so the ""results"" validate their progressive agenda. All their ""experts"" were obviously biased leftist professors. They blammed capitalism for people buying bottled water and polluting the ocean with them. They did some bs men vs woman test that said women were superior. The 3 couple thing was just dumb. I finally had enough after the race bias experiment. Naturally they give the subject a gun and have them determine who to shoot. Each person had 3 sets of 2 people pop out from hiding, one had a cell phone and one a gun, they had to make split second decision on who to shoot. Instead of using the equal amount of each race, the first 2 sets of people where both people of color and only on the last set they put a white and black person together, both with phones. With everything happening so fast plus having the first 2 sets be all poc, the white person sticks out so your eyes go there first. When they notice the phone in the white persons hand, they instinctively shoot the other person.  Not because of race bias but because they intentionally designed it that way by making 5 of the 6 people they see a person of color and by telling them there was one phone and one gun. They concluded by saying everyone is biased but proceed to only show clips of white kids picking on black kids and calling them little racists and showing pictures of people in klan hoods."
100 Humans,"Episode 7 28:41 Text on screen = Experiment #3: Can music EFFECT taste?

Not sure if it was oopsed effect instead of affect earlier in the show, but even a comedic approach should have better proofing than the standard online news article these days."
100 Humans,"Anyone notice that the episode ""are we biased"" was biased on the experimenters end? Especially with regards to the racial bias scenario with the white and black males holding cellphones. White male had a bright green shirt on and a silver cellphone. Black male had a red shirt on and a black cellphone. What if they made the actors both wear the same color shirt, but more importantly, if they both had silver cellphones? A black phone looks a lot more like a gun from a frontal view than a silver phone IMO."
100 Humans,I did not like The agenda they were going for
100 Humans,"I think Alie Ward, that white girl wanna be scientist is the most hypocrite. You could clearly see that she's sexist. Can't hide it by acting funny. The shows ""scientific"" way of presenting data as entertainment kinda pisses me off. Especially since the topics they tackle are sensitive. And who's to say that the people or children whose going to watch this won't believe them? Most people today believe what they saw on tv. 

They use actual specialists for certain topics to explain their findings but there's actually no factual conclusion. They just say that this is the outcome because of their findings. They don't even correct their statements that this ain't actual study. They are projecting it to be true since they used real and actual specialists on the matter and believe they did was actual science. Their pushing their own opinions on the matter that satisfies them. They're just a bunch of bullsh*tt*ng hypocrites."
100 Humans,"I found the show entertaining and interesting. However, the episode on biases was done badly. It seemed like they were just trying to prove how mean and ‚Äúawful‚Äù (literally the word they used) humans are. They didn‚Äôt use controls in these experiments and it came off as them just trying way to hard to be ‚Äúwoke‚Äù. I‚Äôm not a scientist but that episode just seemed so wrong."
100 Humans,"Very well put! My wife and I are watching it now. Being a researcher (ecological-community psychology) this kind of makes me shiver, although a lot of my coworkers I assume would applaud this. There is clearly an agenda being pushed while putting real scientific methods on the back burner."
100 Humans,"My wife started watching this, and I've been fuming about the methodology issues with just about every ""experiment"" I've seen. Pretty much every single one is riddled with major design issues, their limitations are never acknowledged, and statistical significance is definitely never mentioned. If you haven't seen the torture experiment, that'll get your blood boiling. I assume the writers are immensely unqualified and haven't even considered googling ""research ethics."" I thought my brains would leak out my nose from watching this.

This show is not just an unfunny, amateurish pantomime of academic research, but it drifts into the irresponsible and needlessly dangerous when they literally torture people for no justifiable reason. Beneficence? But I don't even know a fence!

They should show this in classrooms for students to brainstorm fatal methodological and ethical flaws. I would pay money for an IRB to go review the experiments in this show."
100 Humans,I agree the show is complete and utter bullshit. You don't have to be a genius to know that the experiments are done terribly and the conclusions make absolutely no sense whatsoever. This show is a waste of your time so unless you want your life to be meaningless you want to stay away form this show
100 Humans,"ok I am with you but for me it is all how subtle it is: black gut with phone is totally in a gun shooting stance, white guy not so much this is purposeful and does a disservice to BML, the reality of racism and as you say motherfather bad science ffs!"
100 Humans,I made it half way through episode 1 when Jody Armour came on and the piece of shit host was joking the whole time. What audience was this aimed at?
100 Humans,Why did you watch it?
100 Humans,"Boring and bland. I made it part way through the first episode where one of the ""experiments"" showed the attractive white people were viewed much more leniently during trial sentencing.

Groundbreaking."
100 Humans,"Someone pretending comprehension of science at a 7th grade level and saying that gender equality and heteronormative societies, among other nonsense issues, being real problems always makes me chuckle."
100 Humans,"I put this on and found your post because I could help but search for ‚Äú100 humans bad science‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs like, extremely dumb."
100 Humans,"This show drives me nuts! They are doing ‚Äúscience‚Äù to push their own agenda.  I don‚Äôt believe these ‚Äúscientist‚Äù are scientists at all. Most of these ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù don‚Äôt have a control. And when they claimed they had a control, THATS NOT A CONTROL. And most of them I am thinking, How does that prove anything?"
100 Humans,That show is a joke.
100 Humans,I need the jig is up when I saw Charlotte Laws. It was the most biased testing I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life and the socio political jabs they made made it hard for me to watch. I quit watching after the first part of episode four I was just done.
100 Humans,I actually used the segments to teach my students on how and what you should not do for a proper research methodology
100 Humans,"Even a couple of the subject matter ‚Äòexperts‚Äô made horribly unscientific statements trying to shoehorn their untested beliefs into the mould of tested fact. For example - the British accent being about ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù and the southern accent sounding less intelligent because there are more blacks in the south. The Mississippi accent portrayed was a definitively WHITE southern accent, not a black southern accent (plus the group could see the actor is white). That type of southern accent is associated with white red necks and never black southerners. Everything was so forced. Even when their pseudoscience didn‚Äôt fit their preconceived notions (the one on societal biases where even (even especially) older people kept a large distance from the older man, they then said that that PROVES that biases are SO strong that they occur even in members of the group the bias is aimed towards. So, if their experiment supported their hypothesis - their hypothesis was correct, but if they got an unexpected result (the results were the opposite of what they defined would support the hypothesis) that made the hypothesis EVEN MORE CORRECT. üôÑ"
100 Humans,Anti-vaxx? Do you have any sources? Specify what is anti-science to you.
100 Humans,Agree the 100 humans are actors and bad ones too
100 Humans,The part about are women as funny as men was terrible. They had a man tell a joke and then a woman tell the same joke. People didnt laugh at the woman because she was a terrible joke teller. But no they concluded that the people didnt laugh because shes an unattractive woman.
100 Humans,"The smugness of the hosts is basically what warranted this write up lol. I just found them incredibly off-putting. I wouldn‚Äôt have liked the show regardless, but they made it so much worse. Especially the white woman, oh my god she was annoying."
100 Humans,"I think it is supposed to be pretty cheesy, not something that‚Äôs supposed to accurate."
100 Humans,As someone with a stats degree. I agree.
100 Humans,">where everyone is both high income and very attractive.

Only 3 of them are confirmed as high income.  One admitted on the show they didnt even work, one was a personal trainer living with 2 room mates, another said he quit his job (managing applebees apparently), and the rest were shilling for MLM or were actors or ""social media influencers""

&#x200B;

The show is more of a hodgepodge of Mr Personality/The Circle/Temptation Island/Married at First Sight than it is similar to the bachelor."
100 Humans,Love is blind was interesting. Wouldn't say it's the best. But I do think the concept was interesting as well as the conclusion. (Mark was retarded tho)
100 Humans,"Not everyone was very attractive in my opinion. And like stated below, one girl literally admitted she was couch surfing and unemployed."
100 Humans,"That was so stupid to me. If the white kids aren't comfortable around black kids, that would be the parents' fault anyway"
100 Humans,"Yes!! Half the time the ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù didn‚Äôt even measure what they were originally asking. While the questions might be interesting, the terrible execution reduces them to whatever findings happen to be found, most of which aren‚Äôt even statistically significant. 
Edit: For example, they believed people would choose closer physical proximity to those that looked similar to them. To measure this, they put individuals one by one in a room with a random subject and were told to ‚Äúobserve them.‚Äù What?! How you stand next to someone you‚Äôre collecting data on is completely different than how you‚Äôd stand next to someone you‚Äôre socializing with. Flawed experiment."
100 Humans,"Yeah, it's about as flawed as you can get. I tapped out about 1/2 way through the first ep. The first blow was the ""attractive in uniform"" segment but they lost me at the ""attractive offenders"" segment where they mixed up the mugshots of criminals with the perfect b&w headshots of actors. Ridiculous."
100 Humans,"Right, it's fun, but damaging fun. It's honestly an unethical show"
100 Humans,"This show might have been forgivable if the limitations of the experiments were discussed, and issues of statistical significance mentioned. It could have been a great teaching tool if they had research experts critique their study designs as an epilogue. As it is, I think it is fucking irresponsible and reprehensible pseudoscience."
100 Humans,"I actually like it.  While it's clearly not science the expirements are entertaining.  Take it for what it is and it's worth watching.  One of my favorites was when they were asked to pair couples, 3 men and 3 women.  Only one person guessed any were gay, that was cool to see."
100 Humans,I would have found it much more entertaining if they stayed away from the serious topics I discussed. Then it‚Äôs just dumb fun I can roll with.
100 Humans,"They shouldn‚Äôt be tackling serious issues then. It minimizes them.

> comedians

They definitely tried to be!"
100 Humans,"If they really wanted to test attraction for criminal offenses, they should have had the same actor but photoshopped to look terrible or something"
100 Humans,"The circle was entertaining as hell, send message"
100 Humans,I kinda liked the circle but I feel it felt flat because by the end the original people only voted for each other. It was like watching high school all over again.
100 Humans,I really enjoyed the Circle and I never like shows like that. It sounds awful on paper but it remains surprisingly engaging as the game goes on.
100 Humans,"I watched that too, at least it came off more as dumb fun than a vehicle for social awareness lol. The Circle definitely didn‚Äôt have interesting results, you‚Äôd probably like the UK version a bit more."
100 Humans,Idk I rarely watch reality tv and I actually really enjoyed this one. The bromance between Joey and Shubi was adorable.
100 Humans,"The British Circle is waaaayyyy better. The US version is not bad but it didn't have the same time for you to get into the ""characters""."
100 Humans,"For some reason I quite enjoyed that show, but I dont think id watch a second season because it did get pretty repetitive."
100 Humans,What parts of Bill Nye were pseudo science?
100 Humans,Props to OP for that. It would be boring to only read reviews of things that reviewers like.
100 Humans,"Well I figured I‚Äôd give my thoughts as clearly as possible. I think the show is detrimental to the causes it backs, and I wasn‚Äôt going to throw out a couple paragraphs and hope people believed me."
100 Humans,Fun and funny but horribly inaccurate about the conclusions they draw. The expirimeents are also not very scientific
100 Humans,"Should we really be starting a conversation from a place of reductiveness and possible misinformation? Reality is what it is, and we should represent it as closely as possible. This show at most turns completely ignores that for the narrative push. For example...

r/AsABlackMan, I don't really enjoy police brutality being boiled down to a contrived FPS simulation that depicts the black dude as the aggressor; he brandishes the phone like a weapon in a way the white dude doesn't. He's basically *trying* to entice the subject into shooting him. How is that representative of reality? Dudes out here getting shot in the back, not whipping out smartphones like Glocks... and even if they were exactly identical in body language (which they weren't) we don't have enough footage to prove people consciously moved from the white guy to the black guy. Hypothetically, two targets with identical body language, you'd shoot at the person you're angled the closest to. The results could have been massively skewed by chance, which brings me to my next point (I know I‚Äôm rambling a bit my bad). Regardless of my opinion there, the bigger point for shit like this is that they do these experiments once and push the results out like ""Yup! Look at the racism."" Replication of your experiment is imperative to conclusively prove it, right?

This show works for fun, little psychological biases like reactions to pain vs. pleasure or criticism vs. praise. It undoubtedly does not work for serious socioeconomic issues, not the way they've done it. Either treat the subject more seriously, more scientifically -- or stick to the fun stuff for entertainment.

I'm secure with believing this show shouldn't have been made by the people behind it."
100 Humans,"Partially true. In statistics, when averages are considered, outliers are typically thrown away. The point of averages is to kind of simulate the question of if you encounter that situation, how likely is something to happen. So in this case if you encounter a man or woman, how likely were they going to use more words. But with outliers as shown in this episode, 1 person can skew an average severely. You can Google up about how outliers are used in stats"
100 Humans,I feel like Explained is just way too short and superficial.
100 Humans,I totally agree‚Ä¶ I would‚Äôve absolutely enjoyed how dumb it was if it weren‚Äôt for all of the political bullshit they were passing
100 Humans,ALL the attractive people were given less sentencing regardless of race or gender.
100 Humans,"We're in a global pandemic where millions of people could die.  Bodies are piling up in Italy that people can't even bury.

But reddit is here to deal with real issues like 'tattoo stigma'"
100 Humans,"I used ""bad ethics"", but basically found this thread with the same search. 

I like listening to docuserieses (that's a word?) while I'm crafting, but this torture episode made me wonder what consent forms were given to participants because they were treading some seriously questionable ethics grounds."
100 Humans,I had this same thought - this is a perfect Goofus example of research methodology
100 Humans,[removed]
100 Humans,She also didn't end the punchline the same way the male one did
100 Humans,Exactly!
100 Humans,"All of the people in the photos were of actors they didn‚Äôt use any real criminal mugshots, they said so themselves"
100 Humans,"THAT is the problem - no one is going to mistake the hook up island show to make any serious commentary on societal problems, but in these polarizing times, a show like 100 humans where the hosts actually wore lab coats (for some unknown reason) and they are supposedly quantifying bias (or whatever the episode is about) makes the left look stupid to anyone on the right with a brain and makes those dumber people on the left think they are being shown factual, tested results."
100 Humans,"But if they did that, the only conclusion that could have been drawn is that each and every attempt at collecting useful data failed miserably. The ONLY way it could have been responsably  presented is as a cheezy battle of the sexes (or whatever) game show type  of dreck OR if at the end - they did an entire episode asking the audience how many of the experiments had any validity and then used that to demonstrate how easily a lot of people can be fooled into thinking trash science is valid and demonstrated the problems each and every ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù has and used it as a training tool to look at information with a critical eye - even when it is PRESENTED as legit science."
Bloodride,"Just finished binging it, wow I loved this series. The acting was superb, the making of mini-doc revealed how carefully they constructed the details and considered the themes, and I am always excited about seeing women centered media (director, writer, costuming, story, actor, etc).

I disagree about the flashbacks being distracting. Often they connected to memories that Esty experienced while navigating new directions in her life. As the film approaches a climax (what will happen with her life) more is revealed about exactly how her past was so traumatic. It shows us what is at stake, why she is fighting for a future.

For the criticism from Orthodox community and reported inconsistencies, remember this is the story of just one specific community/sect of Orthodox Jews, and this can be used as an allegory for many different people's struggles."
Bloodride,"This story of a young Hasidic woman who wants to leave her cloistered way of life is both heartbreaking and uplifting as it pits her courage and determination against the cruelty and arrogance of the insular and ignorant Hasidic community. If you thought the Hasidim were repugnant and obnoxious after watching the Netflix documentary ""One of Us,"" the dramatization of the true story in ""Unorthodox"" will not change your mind.  


One important correction: The subtitles repeatedly read that the Hasidim are praying in Yiddish. They do converse in Yiddish, but for Jews, including most definitely the ultra-orthodox Hasidim, the language of prayer is Hebrew. For those of us who know the difference, in ""Unorthodox"" the Hasidim are indeed praying in Hebrew. The film is correct but the subtitles are wrong."
Bloodride,Just finished. This blew my mind. Sooo moving.
Bloodride,does anyone know the name of the DJ group in episode 3?
Bloodride,"Just a heads up. A lot of Orthodox Jews are a little annoyed at the series for exaggerating Orthodox, and specifically Hassidic, life. The allegedly non-fiction book that the series is based on was also found to have some problematic inconsistencies.

On an unrelated note, Shira Haas's Ruchama was my favorite character in ~~*Schlissel*~~*Shtisel* (up until her weird boyfriend storyline)."
Bloodride,Can anyone tell me about what was happening in the kitchen in the scene where she suspects she is pregnant? It looks like lots of surfaces are covered in aluminium foil.
Bloodride,"Last write-up in this series for a while. Will probably still be posting random stuff on here just won't be watching any new shows for the next 3-4 weeks. Hopefully within a month I'll still have my life and health to continue doing these. 

Next shows I'll be doing when I'm back at this should be Little Fries Everywhere. Also I'm making a 'Top Teen-Dramas of All Time' listicle for some reason idk. üò™

Anyways, stay safe guys!"
Bloodride,Thanks for the list and the review of this series.  Now I have something to watch since I finished Tiger King.  BTW is that one not in the list because it is to new?
Bloodride,Catnapp. The soundtrack for the show is on Spotify
Bloodride,"I haven‚Äôt seen the show (only the trailer) but OF COURSE Orthodox Jews don‚Äôt like it. The Hasidic community is extraordinarily inclusive and they don‚Äôt want people knowing how dated their beliefs are, especially when it comes to women."
Bloodride,"I tried to watch this show, and I'm not even up to anything controversial and can still see why. There's just an underlying disdain for them that makes the show really hard to watch."
Bloodride,"Wow, I went down a rabbit hole of the debunking articles....

Reading that she wasn't really educated in that community, her family apparently supported her going to Sarah Lawrence, and she lived a more liberal Orthodox lifestyle than she claims, changes things. She actually had the kid while she was still married, and didn't leave until he was 7.   The real story sounds far more interesting!!

Shame she felt she had to craft a cookie cutter story to make her story more compelling to outsiders."
Bloodride,"The show is called Shtisel, btw"
Bloodride,I mean...they would say that...the point wasn‚Äôt to portray them in a good light...
Bloodride,"Ruchami‚Äôs boyfriend was everything her father wasn‚Äôt, and she craved the sense of domestic normalcy missing from her home life."
Bloodride,"That scene takes place during the holiday Passover (which lasts for eight days). Part of Jewish practice in general is maintaining a kosher (""clean"") kitchen. During most of the year this includes separating the meat and dairy etc. During Passover, however, this includes getting rid of all of the chametz (leavened bread). The aluminum foil is to ensure that no chametz from the rest of the year gets on their food/their food during Passover is clean. Some people will do a full spring cleaning for Passover but foil works too."
Bloodride,"I believe they were fasting and she was feeling extra hungry because she was pregnant and the food was tempting her,  but she had to wait until the grandfather finished praying to eat."
Bloodride,Have you seen Skam because if not your list won't be accurate.
Bloodride,"I know I'm responding 3 months later but if you want something even more crazy than Tiger King, try Wild Wild Country."
Bloodride,Insular*
Bloodride,"Well sure, there's no shortage of scandals involving that community....but apparently the book is fiction. 

I think she feeds off really dated and unexposed beliefs about Hasidim too, and they're rightfully sensitive to that."
Bloodride,"I mean, there‚Äôs that in Christian fundamentalist (big love) shows as well. Fundamental religious communities do not treat women well, and the protagonist in the show is a young woman. If the main character was an elderly patriarch in the society the tone likely would read different."
Bloodride,"They talked a little about this in the ""how it's made"" portion after. They said that since the author was so well-known in communities surrounding this subject, she wanted to give Etsy a different life than her own. They wanted the discussion to be about the character, her story, and the Satmar community, not about the author. 

Because of this I get the sense that she weaved together a narrative from a lot of different experiences of people who left."
Bloodride,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I was actually wondering about the aluminium foil. I read somewhere else that is to do with keeping the kitchen kosher."
Bloodride,Of course I have lol. Top 3 teen drama!
Bloodride,"Yeah, inclusive is literally the opposite haha"
Bloodride,"Big Love went out of it's way to show them as real people, not caricatures to scorn. That's a great example of a show giving humanity to it's characters. You could argue too much.

I mean, if it's from the perspective of someone who is young and doesn't offer that, and the writers wanted to stay true to that, then it's not great source material."
Bloodride,Would like to point out that Big Love was not based on Christian fundamentalists... it was based on Mormon fundamentalism.
Bloodride,"I think it's also because the real person is problematic, and her stories didn't check out. Why else would they downplay the unique parts of her story and go with some generic cardboard cut out version of a person leaving a traditional community? 

I mean, what really happens here? She isn't happy, she has a mother that's left, she goes to find her, she makes some friends and finds herself drawn to an artistic outlet and gets an opportunity most do not, and during it all, her naive possibly autistic husband chases after her, finds her and gets rejected. In the big scheme of diabolical ""leaving the religion"" stories, nothing happens. The bit with the brother abducting her and the gun, is insane, and if it happened no doubt that was scarring, but then he ultimately walks away, he doesn't actually try to bring her back to NY."
Bloodride,"I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúfundamentalist community‚Äù in Big Love which is out in the desert, which were basically the villains of the show, that the main characters escaped from. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community depicted in this show is an insular fundamentalist community the main character escape from."
Bloodride,"No kidding, but aside from generically assuming all fundamentalists are the same, your comment has little value. Even among Hasidim there are different sects and traditions, and they feud. Some are more liberal while some oppose rock n' roll.  If there's no awareness or depth, then it's just saying ""boo religion"" or ""boo ultra orthodox Jews"", and that's boring unless you're predisposed to hating entire communities and want to feel validated in your hate."
Bloodride,"Okay lol but the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal, they‚Äôre depicting a young girl being forced into marriage and forced into sex. 

So what are you trying to say in context of this argument. I‚Äôm not saying all religious communities are like this, but the specific story being told is of a community that is. So why should they treat that community with any reverence? If the acts they‚Äôre depicting in the show are brutal

And it‚Äôs not Jewish specific. A lot of fundamental communities of every religion, even the Amish, have groups that mistreat women and chalk it up to ‚Äúreligion‚Äù and it‚Äôs no excuse

I would harken back to ‚Äúbig love‚Äù - the community out in the desert in big love is not progressive, they force teen girls to marry the prophet, and are not treated kindly by the show at all. At the same time the main family in Big Love is shown empathy, even though they‚Äôre still a fundamentalist bigamist family, because they‚Äôre not doing inhumane things like the community out in the desert is. 

If this show was about a progressive Hasidic community that was treating young women kindly, why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

Should we just not tell the stories of women mistreated in fundamentalist communities for fear of sounding ‚Äúboo religion‚Äù? This goes for Amish, catholic, Mormon, Scientologist, Islam, Jewish, whatever."
Bloodride,">the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,

Right, does the show bother to explain that?

Also, I'm not claiming to be familiar with her story, I'm reacting to just attempting to watch the show.. but she apparently really went to liberal Orthodox schools earlier in her life, so the depiction of the family isn't entirely accurate.

I see dramas about terrorists that deal with Islamic fundamentalism with more respect and depth.  I see more care with depictions of the Amish community (though improvements could be made for sure). The idea isn't to give reverence but to give characters depth, and that's what makes people interesting, and can influence societal change when it's eye opening.

As opposed to just gawking and demonizing. The fact that you're comparing this story to ""marrying the prophet"" cult like behavior from a group that splintered from the mainstream, is a problem. Big Love carefully explains who the group are and their stature with the more mainstream LDS church. It's a major plotline. 

\>why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

That's ridiculous. People leave religious families they're born into all the time.  I'm on her side with that (unless it's fiction, and a couple seconds on google suggests some of it was). And it's a common narrative in tv and film and theater. It's told all the time. But if you just have one dimensional stereotypical characters, you're not learning anything from that, it's not really exploring the predicament, it's just trying to expose bad people with an agenda against devout religiousness. In this case people think because they got a glimpse into homes they've never seen before, that's sufficient to make up for the lack of depth and humanity in the community it portrays. You can do that and still ultimately show people are wrong."
Bloodride,"**People leave religious families all the time but they don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúescape‚Äù them as is shown in the show. Notice I said ‚Äúflee‚Äù not ‚Äúleave‚Äù. The story depicts an ‚Äúescape‚Äù not just someone turning their back on religion** 

And in regards to the memoir the show was based off of, if you asked me and my mom to recount an argument we had when I was a teen we would both give wildly conflicting stories. That doesn‚Äôt mean either of them are ‚Äúfiction‚Äù, it just means the people involved had different justifications and motivations to act the way they did. 

I believe the author that this is her side of the story, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs portrayed in the show. Her side, her perspective, her interpretation of how she felt. No one can spin that and say it‚Äôs ‚Äúfiction‚Äù unless you‚Äôre her.

It sounds like you just can‚Äôt handle any attack on a segment of Judaism, because my interpretation of it is that this community depicted in the show is very much a fragment of the larger Jewish community in Brooklyn, and they do not all engage in abhorrent behavior like forcing a young girl into sex slavery (aka, ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù), but for the people who are, their story is worthy of being told. 

It might not be ‚Äúmarrying the prophet‚Äù but it‚Äôs forcing young girls into reproductive slavery all the same through societal and financial pressure. These things are happening, in our country, and we have no obligation to give the people perpetrating them ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of character. 

**People using religion to keep women (and LGBT) down are the villains in today‚Äôs stories. So, it‚Äôs not an attack on religion, it‚Äôs an attack on the excuse and bastardization of religion.** 

In our post-post modern society religion has been torn down and disproven as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Catholic priests molest children. Female genital mutilation. Honor killings. Etc etc etc etc. But we‚Äôre still holding reverence for ‚Äúculture‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWomen in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for having pre-marital sex‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs their culture‚Äù

Or 

‚ÄúI had to have sex with the producer for this role‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how Hollywood is‚Äù 

**is no longer an excuse the public will permit**

Now, we‚Äôre dismantling tradition as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Just because your religion/community/ has customs and traditions to uphold, does not mean they will be permitted in the modern world. **Shame, and telling the story in a negative light, is one way of expressing the contempt for ‚Äútraditions‚Äù that do not fit into contemporary human rights and ethics, rather than glossing over violations because we feel it‚Äôs not our place to critique**

Side note: the show does not hold the orthodox community in distain for their differences; the way they dress, language spoken, or traditions. The elements of the show that put a negative light on the community are strictly the scenes that portray human rights violations."
Bloodride,">>the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,
>
>Right, does the show bother to explain that?

You're right, the way they wrote the show I totally thought Esty was fleeing a liberal Hasidic sect üôÑ"
Bloodride,"The movie literally has Yael explain the unique nature of the community. I know this was 12 days ago, but coming into this discussion from the outside, it seems like you are gathering evidence to support your conclusions."
Bloodride,One of the most beautiful posts I've read in a long time. Spot on.
Bloodride,Well said!!
Bloodride,"You don't have to flee an orthodox Jewish family. 

Leaving any family, for any reason involving lack of acceptance, is difficult.  It's a story. If you can't handle a real life complicated depiction of these communities because you just want to bash people, then that's boring.

There is no perspective that can account for a fictional story. 

Her mom was easy to locate and didn't leave when she was a toddler, for example. 

Calling aranged marriage ""sex slavery"" is an extremist viewpoint, in my opinion. Totally dogmatic. Arranged marriages are still fairly accepted in some communities. I've known Indians, and Arabs who accepted their parents arrangements and as horrifying as it sounds at face value, they're happy. Sex slavery is a real thing, please dont' make light of it to feel better about the Netflix show you liked.

Look, some Satmars are nuts, but this isn't a story about one of those victims of nuttery. It's not sexual reproductive slavery or whatever dogmatic bullshit opinion you came to the show pre-formed. And cut the crap, you do care about their traditions which you just called human rights violations. You are Othering these people. It's a step away from claiming they fuck through a hole in a sheet. There are plenty of bad things you can say about Satmars, or any fundamental religious folks of any stripe, but again, in 2020, show they're humanity and stop the caricatures that re-affirm horrible stereotypes, and stop pretending you just watched a show that justified your jackassery biases."
Bloodride,"She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood, went to Sarah Lawrence, and stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show."
Bloodride,My conclusion is the show had an underlying disdain for the community that was hard to watch.... to which people defended it by expressing their disdain for the community. Just stop.
Bloodride,"**It becomes sex slavery, and a human rights violation, when you do not give a woman the means to support herself outside of her reproductive capabilities, and only give the path of being a wife. Which is what is depicted. Raising a child from birth for the sole purpose of them becoming a wife and mother. The women are not even allowed to play musical instruments for fun in the strict rules of the community.**

The avenues allowed to them are to be a wife, or as in the show, run away and be ostracized from their community. Which leads to the ‚Äúleaving/fleeing/whatever‚Äù people being homeless, since they have no real world skills or means outside of their insular community, also depicted in the show. 

**That‚Äôs different than an arranged marriage, which i never said was a bad thing or a human rights violation**

Not giving women the option to choose their path in life, and raising them from birth with one end-goal (wife/mother) is a human rights violation, and raising them with the purpose of them being a reproductive servant. I.e. sex slave. So no, it‚Äôs not a reach.

**And it‚Äôs not ‚Äújackassery bias‚Äù. If a new cult was raising girls for the sole purpose of becoming a bride, raising them from birth, and forbidding them to learn skill or a trade that would be bona fide sex slavery. Just because this is a sect of Orthodox Judaism doesn‚Äôt change that. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying contemporary society will not tolerate ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs our tradition‚Äù, if it‚Äôs not ethical in the modern world it is not ethical in your old-fashioned society.**"
Bloodride,An arranged marriage can be a form of sex slavery for someone who is pressured into it and someone who doesn't want it. I'm not saying that all arranged marriages are like that.
Bloodride,">She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood... stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

This is something you used as an example of liberalism üò¨

>The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show.

I think Hasidic Judaism is a fairly problematic worldview, yes. I am aware some sects are more or less problematic than others, but they're all problematic to some degree. Note I didn't say all Judaism is problematic, I said **Hasidic** Judaism is problematic, in the way I believe all fundamentalist religion (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) is problematic. 

Are you saying no Hasidic Jewish sects whatsoever reflect the depiction? None at all? Because that's really the only way your argument has validity. Otherwise, it's actually showing what some Hasidic women live through, and that's a story worth telling even if it isn't Deborah Feldman specific story."
Bloodride,"Criticism isn't disdain and you've clearly got some personal issues regarding the ability to rationalize differing opinions. I know exactly what happened, I just read through it all. You're wrong."
Bloodride,"You told me you think I didn't respond well to the show because it involved Jews.... which is unintentionally your admission you liked it because it's critical of devout Jews. Too late.

You're not describing ""slavery"" or describing what goes on in Orthodox communities in New York.

It's fine that some of you liked this show, but not fine that in defending it,  you reveal really bigoted presumptions that this show just validated for you."
Bloodride,"She agrees to the marriage and thinks it's what she wants.  Sure arranged marriage can be forced, but that's not what is depicted. She lived in New York, she always had the choice to lead her own life, which is what she did."
Bloodride,"No, it's something this dumb ass series used as an example of her shedding her traditions for a liberal secular life. 

I doubt you know much about Hasidim and that's the problem here. What's really being depicted there that's so outrageous or unique to any Hasidic sect?  I hate all the Jewish characters in the show, including her. You don't have the first clue what they live through, because you projected it, nothing horrible happens in that film that's real or is commonplace. You can't possible think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction or have a brother in law pull out a gun. 

You can't defend this show by saying there are Hasidic stories worth telling...sure, but I'm criticizing this one."
Bloodride,"Disdain is disdain. The series is presenting harmless everyday observances as if they're oppression. The Redditor I was conversing with took it farther. There's a point where criticism isn't an opinion and treads into bigotry.
You jumped into this because you sympathize with hating Hasidim apparently, and that's wrong. You're a clown."
Bloodride,"Lol... I said that because when i compared it to other fundamentalist religious representations (big love) you acted like Orthodox Jews were supposed to be exempt. 

So girls in orthodox communities aren‚Äôt raised to be brides and mothers? Oh my mistake then. I live in Brooklyn, i don‚Äôt see any orthodox women having a job or running a trade. 

But I guess that‚Äôs just not ‚Äúbased in reality‚Äù and it‚Äôs all ‚Äúmy bias‚Äù 

**i‚Äôm against any fundamentalist community; Amish, Mormon, Jewish, that raises girls to be mothers with no other avenues. Or raises men to be fathers and tells them being gay is god‚Äôs mistake**

This is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about, you cannot claim people are being ‚Äúbiased against a culture‚Äù when they point out human rights violations within that culture. Something which is unethical is unethical even when cloaked in religion. 

Maybe the VAST majority of orthodox communities empower their young women, but you cannot negate the small percentage of those who are suffering.

And just to say it louder 

In case you didn‚Äôt hear 

**raising girls explicitly to be wives and mothers is a form of sex and reproductive slavery. If a community is guilty of that, i don‚Äôt give a fuck what religion they practice.**"
Bloodride,"Just flipped through your recent comments, all you‚Äôre doing is calling people biased against Jews for watching this show on a bunch of different threads, weirdo - when you didn‚Äôt even watch it yourself ? Wtf is your problem the character are less ‚Äúone dimensional‚Äù if you watch more than 10 minutes"
Bloodride,"I don't think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction, neither do I think many of them pull out guns. I never thought this and no one here believe the show is making these insane blanket statements except you.

It's clear you are projecting because you are making blanket statements about all viewers based on what you're worried they think.

You like blanket statements so you think everyone else does as well.

Projection."
Bloodride,I'm jumped in because you're psycho
Bloodride,"None of your rant is in the show. None of it.

No small portion of the show featured the Hasidic sects rituals...criticism of their beliefs to the point of ridicule beyond what the show is depicting is pretty blatant of you. 

Who the hell thinks Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust? Piss off."
Bloodride,"I've since watched the series. The fact that it set people full of vitriol like yourself off on hate rants speaks volumes. 

The Jewish characters are all unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated.....and it's supposed to be representative of a Jewish community? If that's normal to you its because ...well, you already went on a bigoted rant."
Bloodride,"Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

You forget what you already admitted earlier in this thread."
Bloodride,"What's psycho is getting upset that some Jews grow their sideburns out. Which is really what that person used as an example of xenophobia.

You jumped in because you dislike some Jews."
Bloodride,"**how can you say that none of my rant is in the show when the central problem in the show is hte main character was raised to be a wife and mother, and doesn‚Äôt know how to support herself outside of her community? That‚Äôs the whole show. Her trying to get a scholarship because she has no real-world skills and no money. That‚Äôs the WHOLE plot**

No one said ‚Äúall‚Äù ultra-orthodox have this experience, but if this is this person‚Äôs story who are you to tell them it‚Äôs problematic/false? 

Many fundy communities fall into the same trap of womb worship. If that‚Äôs not YOUR experience in them, then good for you, but you cannot say others share your experience.  

And i think it‚Äôs you who can ‚Äúpiss off‚Äù. Have fun setting women back 200 years with your pathetic blindness

If you‚Äôre fundy and you like it then good for fucking you, but maybe it hasn‚Äôt been so kind to others."
Bloodride,"The main character is jewish and she doesn‚Äôt seem unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated."
Bloodride,People disagreeing with your faulty assessment isn't a hate rant. Stop.
Bloodride,">Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

I never said any of this. You must have me confused with someone else."
Bloodride,"That doesn't equate ""reproductive slavery"". 

They're a strict religious community so there's lots to be critical of, especially if you dislike religious practices, but the darker more horrific story you describe isn't in the show. You projected your hate on to this community.

Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

Putting pressure on someone to consummate a marriage after a year, or to have a family with kids?.....It's obnoxious but it's not slavery. 

It's also fraud. The real girl went to Sarah Lawrence while observant, and became a writer. 

Hasidim exist in New York outside of their communities, and they work, drive, and have independence, and they can do that within their communities or out. The disadvantages of joining secular culture are not unique, and can't be equated to brutality. 

Nothing happened to this girl that girls haven't felt in the secular world either. Again, the sway the show depicts these people just validated hatred you already had."
Bloodride,"There's nothing sympathetic about a girl who shows up to a top music program and insults them like she can just audition for piano. 

Or invites herself places.

Or who doesn't know what ham looks like, and eats anything put in front of her then panics....or educated about someone who hasn't seen Google (the entire purpose of that scene).

It goes on and on. That character couldn't be more ridiculous."
Bloodride,"People outraged that some Jews don't cut their sideburns, and observe Passover by wrapping food in tinfoils isn't a hate rant.  Then you share their hate."
Bloodride,Then why defend the show? Why are you elsewhere in the thread challenging a self defined Orthodox Jew to tell you what was inaccurate about the show?
Bloodride,"
>Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

The fact you think any criticism of Hasidic Jews equates to what you stated above  is tiresome and unfortunately not at all shocking not shocking."
Bloodride,God you sound like such an insufferable cunt.
Bloodride,I'm Jewish jackass. Lmfao
Bloodride,"The only other person I've discussed the topic with on reddit is not a ""self defined Orthodox Jew"", they said they're ""familiar with the Hasidic world"". All I did was tell him something to the effect of ""saying it's inaccurate is useless unless you give us examples of WHY you think it's inaccurate"". And I'll take this opportunity to say the same to you. What specifically is factually inaccurate?"
Bloodride,"What's tiresome is that you think this series depicts every Ultra Orthodox Jew, because what else did it show? Don't invent shit that's not in the show itself to justify your thirst. 

I don't think any criticism of Hasidim is a problem, there's a lot to criticize, it's unfortunately YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, as depicted with this one dysfunctional family.  You decided its representative... because you have a disdain for those Jews."
Bloodride,You sound insecure on the internet.
Bloodride,Thank you.
Bloodride,"Are you saying there aren't Jews who hate other Jews or Jews that are different than them, or more observant and it make it okay to express hate?  Take a hike."
Bloodride,"You don't even know what you're reading. They literally said ""I grew up ultra-Orthodox"".

I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced your antisemitic ass that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  The fact is the author the story is based on was able to get an education and stopped wearing her wig while still living in Brooklyn.  You're clueless."
Bloodride,"For someone who looks down your nose at others for allegedly making assumptions, you sure make a lot of your own.

>YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, 

When the fuck did I say that? That's not what I think. You have a chip on your shoulder."
Bloodride,"Yikes, if you find yourself wondering why you can't maintain a healthy relationship, I have identified some factors"
Bloodride,"You can't even detail what you think you saw that was oppressive and represents the community as a whole, because you know it would paint you as bigoted.

Yet you're in this thread chastising anyone that doesn't think this is an accurate depiction at all. Take a hike. The reason you're passionate about this at all is because you have the chip you didn't even realize you had until now, and you got called out for it. Feels bad for you I'm sure."
Bloodride,"If you find yourself trying to psychoanalyze strangers on Reddit when they point out the shortcomings of your bigoted posts...you might just get a mirror and write ""sociopath"" and ""hateful"" on it."
Bloodride,"No, pretty much only you and probably not much longer. 

Hasidic Judaism is fundamentalist religion. Sexist roles, xenophobia, ""my-group-is-better-than-everyone-else"" mentality backed by the word of God, virtue signaling taking precedence over actual virtue (not cutting your hair = virtue signal. Covering kitchen surfaces in foil to prevent yeast from contaminating Passover seder = virtue signal), insular bubble...

I'm not saying every single Hasidic Jew is like this, but some/many are."
Bloodride,"You clearly know zero about Hasidim and couldn't site examples shown in the show.

You just rattled off a lot of assumptions that aren't in this series. 

And no, claiming you're an equal opportunist hater doesn't help.

I take it back saying you're a bigot was putting it nicely. You're worse."
Bloodride,"Is [the official web site of a Hasidic sect](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/374918/jewish/Aluminum-Foil.htm) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? The same site also talks about [men not cutting the corners of their hair](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2963669/jewish/Why-Do-Some-Chassidic-Jews-Have-Long-Sidelocks-Peyot.htm). 

Is [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5212069) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? 

Virtue signals are negative things because they tend to serve as a substitute for virtue.

If I'm factually wrong, tell me what I'm missing rather than namecalling me."
Bloodride,"Holy crap, you're a Grade A bigot. You just used examples religious Jews observing their holiday by avoiding bread or hiding it under tin foil as an example of oppression and justifying your hate mongering. Those are harmless customs you are depicting as proof they're bad people.
Men choosing not to cut the corners of their hair is an example of oppression to you?  

You're an idiot, I'm not going to bother pretending you're coming to this from a reasonable place and neither should you. 

It's not ""virtue signaling"" you just used Passover against Jews."
Bloodride,"You're still just namecalling and getting angry at me for saying things you don't agree with, you're not giving me an example of what I'm saying that's incorrect you're kind of just angrily saying ""nuh-uh"". 

You're also not talking about the same thing I am, and you are putting words in my mouth.

**Religious groups, especially fundamentalist ones, have virtue signals. Displaying the virtue signals does not make anyone a bad person. I never said that because I don't believe that. I think virtue signals are problematic, that does not mean I think people who use them are bad.**

I'm not talking about hiding bread under foil or avoiding bread. I'm talking about [this](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1745/jewish/Preparing-the-Kitchen.htm). It's not hurting anyone per se, but thinking God cares about such minutiae is genuinely sad to me and seems pretty unhealthy.

The whole point of the first Passover meal is that the Jews in Egypt had no time to prepare. They were in such a hurry they ate unleavened bread and drank unfermented wine.

This level of intricate, time-consuming preparation performed by many Hasidic Jews is quite the opposite of the original Passover described in the Torah. Passover was a hastily prepared meal in advance of an impending visit from an angel of death. The Jews in Egypt weren't covering kitchen surfaces and heavily scrubbing pots and ovens, they were throwing together a meal as quickly as humanly possible."
Bloodride,"That's a lot of minutia for clueless bigot. Now you're gatekeeping and saying one group of Jews in their diaspora don't practice correctly? You're a fricken Rabbi now? Get a life. It took me two seconds on google to see that preparing for Passover by removing, burning or temporarily hiding leavened bread is part of their custom. You hate some Jews, you're not smart, and you're actually critical of their religious observance as Jews, which makes you antisemitic."
Bloodride,">I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced [you] that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  

Remember how I never said that and don't believe that? The show never said that either. 

>clueless

>bigot. 

>Get a life. 

>not smart, 

>antisemitic

That's a strong argument you've got there. Have a good one. Sorry you're so angry."
Bloodride,"The problem is you're making bigoted lifeless, idiotic, clueless and antisemitic ""arguments"" and you're upset at the response you're getting.

Really...what kind of person gets upset that Jews hide their bread for a week in the privacy of their own homes and uses that as an example of xenophobia, or oppression?"
Bloodride,"I've seen 20 new shows this year so far, that's pretty impressive for me. Will be doing Vampires and Kalifat next. 

And hey, I know these write-ups kinda suck (I'm still learning), but at least I'm not just doing recaping the whole plot of series like most reviews on YouTube and newsletter sites these days. ü§∑

p.s. remember to wash your hands and stay away from me! ‚ù§"
Bloodride,I like it .  Some type of nostalgic feeling or something.
Bloodride,"I think the ratings are well deserved for it, a solid 5 or 6 out of 10 seems the best and shouldn't really go past a 7 judging by it's lack of character building dialogue, anticlimactic ending and (personally) it's choice to kill off a main character."
Bloodride,"I just binged this with my 11 yr old daughter. I didn't think i would like, but was pleasantly surprised"
Bloodride,I watched the first two episodes but it didn‚Äôt really hold my attention. Last watched on Friday and haven‚Äôt resumed it since.
Bloodride,Trailer was bad and I thought the show will follow that trend but I read some good reviews so probably will give it a shot.
Bloodride,"I don't read them all, but I like seeing them."
Bloodride,"The trailer looked awful, along with the acting"
Bloodride,"the show is great, it breaks conventional storytelling"
Bloodride,I loved this show. Better than a lot of vampire shows
Bloodride,love is blind ranks higher than this? i dont think so. i loved this. also i think it should be around ares ranking.
Bloodride,Just watched this and looking for what people thought of it. Gotta say I disagree with literally everything written here. Great show and I'm sad that there's no season two.
Bloodride,"Not every show has to be the most original thing ever, but *Feel Good* is hardly derivative. It feels fresh to me. E.g. its specific, not-just-a-coming-out-story, take on queerness. What it's saying about friendship.

But regardless of what the show's influences are, it's just a good show. *Bosch* is a really good detective show, do we ding it for being a detective show? No, I'd say we celebrate it for that. (Not to say *Feel Good* is playing in any genre close to as solidified as the detective one.)"
Bloodride,"I agree that it's starting to feel like a bit of it's own genre at this point but Feel Good is really good. But look at another Netflix series, Gypsy. Also trying to fit into that ""genre"" and missing the mark by a wide margin. 

In other words, yeah I guess, but it's still great TV. Like every genre, there's good and bad. No sweat"
The Valhalla Murders,"Bron/Bridge, by a long shot."
The Valhalla Murders,"All others have been mentioned already so I'll just say The Chestnut Man which is the latest I've watched, was very good!"
The Valhalla Murders,Bordertown.
The Valhalla Murders,"Jordskott, a folk horror take on ScandiNoir.  

Genuinely creepy imagery and no handholding or exposition at all until like the 5th or 6th episode.  If you don't have some basic familiarity with Scandinavian folklore/monsters you might be lost.  Also S1 you might get super annoyed with the lead calling out her daughter's name all the time

2 seasons used to be on Shudder, now gone I'm afraid :(  There's a dvd release though."
The Valhalla Murders,Has The Killing been forgotten already? Fantastic show.
The Valhalla Murders,"Trapped, The Rain, Borgen, The Sandhamn Murders.  (There are probably more but these come to mind.)"
The Valhalla Murders,"I mean this in good faith, but Mare of Easttown absolutely felt like a Scandi/Nordic Noir minus the fact that it took place in Pennsylvania, USA."
The Valhalla Murders,[Nordic Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-OOpZitfd0)
The Valhalla Murders,Wisting
The Valhalla Murders,"The Bridge for me, followed by The Killing (although the ending was a bit odd)  I like Trapped S01 too.

If you want a good film that's funny/dark try Riders of Justice."
The Valhalla Murders,"Department Q movies, starring Nikolaj Lie Kaas."

The Valhalla Murders,"Not Scandinavian but I'll throw down a mention for Zone Blanche (Black Spot).

French murder of the week with an underlying Stephen King style mystery."
The Valhalla Murders,Bron. Bordertown. Trapped. I‚Äôll throw in Der Pass/Pagans Peak although it‚Äôs Austria/Germany but similar feel for sure
The Valhalla Murders,There‚Äôs a fairly good Swedish comedy series on Netflix called Fallet (The Case) which parodies a lot of Nordic noir (and a couple of other things).
The Valhalla Murders,"I enjoyed [Thin Ice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11721492/) a lot. Quite political and exiting.

Although it's not Scandinavian I can also recommend the Welsh series [Hinterland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575968/). It has some great scandi-noir vibes."
The Valhalla Murders,Broen. Probably one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever watched. Every time I hear that theme music I get chills.
The Valhalla Murders,"Trapped, Case, and The Valhalla Murders"
The Valhalla Murders,">I loved Deadwind

FYI, season 3 got released today in Finland so you can expect it to likely hit Netflix at some point in the near future. Seems like S2 got released in Finland in April 2020 and then NF release in July 2020.

And in case you started watching Bordertown after couple people mentioned it, there was a movie recently released so I'd assume it also makes it way to Netflix at some point."
The Valhalla Murders,"If you still love Deadwind, seems like S3 got released on Netflix."
The Valhalla Murders,man that show is very intense
The Valhalla Murders,Borgen is great! But a noir? It's a series about politics with almost no crime/death/etc.
The Valhalla Murders,Glad to see Trapped getting mentioned!
The Valhalla Murders,"I forgot about Trapped as well. Only saw the first season but loved it, can't wait to watch season 2 when I get the time. So moody and dark."
The Valhalla Murders,"I forgot to mention this one, I really enjoyed it, plot, characters and scenery."
The Valhalla Murders,Agreed. To bad the book author decided to fuck up the series by not letting the film people do their work.
The Valhalla Murders,Loved Der Pass. Season two is coming.
The Valhalla Murders,"Just watched the trailer for Pagan's Peak, looks pretty good. Hopefully I'll find somewhere to watch it with English subtitles."
The Valhalla Murders,[deleted]
The Valhalla Murders,"Well... politics can be ""noir.""  :)"
The Valhalla Murders,"I keep hoping for season 3!!  It's really, really good.  And the fantastic scenery just makes it all the better.

Of course... Wallander.  

I left out one of my favorites:  Katla.  That will have you on the edge of your seat and thinking deep thoughts!  :)"
The Valhalla Murders,"Still haven't seen the latest one, but I'm honestly no so interested now the cast has changed."
The Valhalla Murders,What happened?
The Valhalla Murders,It‚Äôs on Topic. The villain personally is one of my favorites.
The Valhalla Murders,Correct it is one of the many ‚Äúremakes‚Äù of Bron but really just takes the idea of a body on a border and so a cop from both sides investigate the crime. Amazing show.
The Valhalla Murders,"> politics can be ""noir.""  
   
True. A noir is defined by crime, darkness and a bleak mood and these things can obviously appear in a political setting as well. But Borgen does not fit that description unless you reach extremely hard."
The Valhalla Murders,Best scandinavian political series is Occupied
The Valhalla Murders,"Season 3 (or sequel) of Trapped is definitely happening and it's going to be on Netflix.

I loved Katla but I'm not sure if it counts as a Nordic Noir so that's why I didn't mention it.

Haven't watched Wallander but might check it out!"
The Valhalla Murders,"Jussi Adler-Olsen, the author of the book disagreed with the direction and casting, so when the deal of the first 4 books ran out, he basically demanded a new direction, including replacing the entire cast."
The Valhalla Murders,"The first season of Occupied was really well done, and very eerie to watch here in the USA when Putin/Trump was president. The premise was too close for comfort."
The Valhalla Murders,"Well, Katla is Icelandic so it's ""nordic"" and it's certainly ""noir!""  

Wallander is a classic.  Don't miss it!  (The UK version is just the difference between great porridge with blueberries and walnuts and watery oatmeal.  lol.)

Yay for S3 of Trapped!  I will be looking for it."
The Valhalla Murders,"First season was great , unfortunately the level dropped drastically in the following seasons.

For me the best part about it are the characters which start out as the usual cliches, slimy no backbone politician, always do the right thing cop , power small business woman, by the book police chief, find the truth and big story journalist , lone psycho gunman .

But throughout the first season these cliche characters are gradually completely turned around in a really believable way and you don't really know who is the good guy or who to root for.
Makes you really think how you would behave during an occupation and how really not so clean cut  the line is between collaborator and resistance.


Absolutely masterfully done , it's brilliant when you completely accept the completely unrealistic and fictional premise which just serves to present the characters in a unique situation.

Sadly the sophistication massively dropped in the following seasons and it just became one dimensional."
The Valhalla Murders,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn‚Äôt on your list, but I guess it‚Äôs not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler‚Äôs List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

The Valhalla Murders,Interesting to see containment show up.
The Valhalla Murders,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don‚Äôt matter for them at all.
The Valhalla Murders,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
The Valhalla Murders,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
The Valhalla Murders,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
The Valhalla Murders,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it‚Äôs clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
The Valhalla Murders,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
The Valhalla Murders,Damn didn‚Äôt realize Ozark hadn‚Äôt been renewed yet
The Valhalla Murders,How about movies??
The Valhalla Murders,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
The Valhalla Murders,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."

The Valhalla Murders,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it‚Äôs great
The Valhalla Murders,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
The Valhalla Murders,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
The Valhalla Murders,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
The Valhalla Murders,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
The Valhalla Murders,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It‚Äôs bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúJohn B‚Äù and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
The Valhalla Murders,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
The Valhalla Murders,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
The Valhalla Murders,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
The Valhalla Murders,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
The Valhalla Murders,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
The Valhalla Murders,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
The Valhalla Murders,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."

The Valhalla Murders,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
The Valhalla Murders,[deleted]
The Valhalla Murders,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."

Mix: Meisei Story,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Mix: Meisei Story,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Mix: Meisei Story,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area)

Mix: Meisei Story,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."

Mix: Meisei Story,">People aren‚Äôt raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime.

I am, am I not people? It's often the stress reliever I need after watching a stressful match, unless I'm watching down the pub where a few pints does the same job. 

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."
Mix: Meisei Story," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I agree, first 4-5 seasons were excellent. After that, it felt like they needed to keep increasing the intensity and made questionable decisions. This happens to many of these shows. 

The procedurals like Grey's Anatomy, NCIS, etc have it easier."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I watched every single episode of this series until the end. To me, it started to go downhill the Leviathan season and what they did to my Bobby Singer. I'm loyal, but I'm honest. There were ups and downs after season 5, but truly, the worst thing they could have done was what they did to Bobby. Ingents."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Yup. But I personally wouldn't have wanted it cancelled at season 5, cause we had some really banger episodes in later seasons (weekend at Bobby's comes to mind)  
 
So now whenever I do rewatches I go straight through 1-5, then start skipping around to the good stuff for the rest"
Mix: Meisei Story,"The problem with the show in the later seasons is definitely the over reliance on goofy characters. In previous seasons, demons and angels were considered a threat and could be imposing. Then in the later seasons, they become ineffectual comic relief. Every side character becomes a goofy caricature with an over the top accent. The people they meet are cartoons for the most part and the acting is terrible. Sam and Dean also become a bit goofy as well, especially Sam, who‚Äôs acting method seems to be simply a large variety of facial ticks and stuttering grunts. Jensen Ackles has too much charisma to be too bad, he‚Äôs always watchable but for the most part he becomes a goofy guy as well. The beginning seasons have comedic moments that are pretty good and used sparingly, but they really lean into it in the later seasons and lose all the horror that the early seasons had."
Mix: Meisei Story,Yes. I truly pretend season 6-15 never existed and just appreciate seasons 1-5 for what they are. It‚Äôs a great five season arc.
Mix: Meisei Story,"I was kind of obsessed at the time, and really worried they would cancell it before the planned ending on season 5. 

Although, looking back, I think the introduction of angels took a lot of the original charm, it was really good TV"
Mix: Meisei Story,"I definitely grew to miss that really dark aesthetic of the early seasons. I remember a later episode where they're with Rowena rounding up souls in this suburban Canadian neighborhood and it was *so bright* outside. Like distractingly so. 

(It was also one of the few episodes that was very obviously in Canada because the street signs were unlike any I'd seen in the US. But I digress)"
Mix: Meisei Story,"They jumped so many sharks, they had to reuse sharks."
Mix: Meisei Story,"The first season is rough. I love it, I have seen it several times, I can watch any episode but the first season is rough. Like Stargate SG-1 it takes time until it becomes a diamond."
Mix: Meisei Story,"You are correct and there is a clear reason for all of what you said: Kripke only planned the series to be 5 seasons. This is why people call the season 5 finale the ‚Äúoriginal ending‚Äù. But with Supernatural being CW‚Äôs most successful show, CW wanted the show to continue. Kripke obliged but he also stepped down as showrunner, and other people took over running the show post season 5. So seasons 6-15 is basically just repetitive season arc‚Äôs of fan service, whereas seasons 1-5 had a serialized story that all tied together. The only good thing to come out of seasons 6-15 is >!the confirmation that Chuck is God!<, a lot of fans theorized it before, but if the show had ended after season 5 we never would‚Äôve known for sure."
Mix: Meisei Story,"It's a good example of how to transition from ""case of the week"" to overarching storyline in a seamless and exciting way. Still a B-show at best for me, but it was fun when I was a teenager! I never continued after season 5."
Mix: Meisei Story,"With these long-running shows that went downhill in the end it can sometimes be easy to forget there was a time when they were excellent, and that's why they ran long in the first place. Looking at you Arrow."
Mix: Meisei Story,I hate how they literally wrote in plot armor for them into the series.  It cheapened the whole series.
Mix: Meisei Story,The series originally was only planned for 5 seasons.
Mix: Meisei Story,"I always wish it had been cancelled after 5. It would have gone down as a great show, not hokey fan service. And maybe Jared wouldn‚Äôt have become so unbearable."
Mix: Meisei Story,I know people love this show I just don't see it.
Mix: Meisei Story,"I'm going through Supernatural now for the first time and I'm halfway through season 7 at the moment. I actually think season 6 is a contender for my favourite. Even though it's clear they juggled several plots that they struggled to interconnect, it has several of my favourite episodes of the whole shows, less Sam and Dean conflict (which was played out by that point anyway) and the best part: more Bobby. Bobby is far and away the best character in Supernatural, so having more of him was only a good thing. Season 7 is a noticeable downgrade.

There's a lot of season 1 and 2 that feels very simple, which is to be expected when you're starting a new show and building up a mythology. It's like early episodes of Buffy or The X-Files (and probably a dozen other shows), with the monster of the week format and finding out how to kill them. Kind of like a police procedural but with monsters. When they start to delve into heaven and hell, then I think it starts to hit its stride (Kurt Fuller is great). I'm a lot less interested when it's just constant brother drama.

The problem is that I don't really care about Sam and Dean (*especially* Dean) but some of the side characters are great. So far, I think the episodes and seasons focused on Bobby and Castiel are some of the best ones (which is why I like season 6 so much) and it's disappointing they didn't make the most of Ellen, Jo, Ash, Rufus and more."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Is it ""extremely good""? Or is it ""extremely good for a CW show""? There's a big difference. I remember this sub telling me *The Arrow* was 'extremely good', which caused all confidence in that channel to be lost."
Mix: Meisei Story,"More than 10 years since I watched those first 5 seasons and it's still a top favorite of mine.

Somewhere around season 10 was when I stopped watching it weekly. I caught up whenever I had a couple of episodes to binge. After 11 I didn't want to continue anymore. I started a rewatch during that hiatus and I was shocked to finally notice how far the quality had dropped with those later seasons.

After that I came across youtube clips here and there so I have a general idea what the last 4 seasons were like. I did watch the season 15 penultimate episode though and it was just complete garbage. The cgi was so bad the show looked like shit. It looked much better in the earlier seasons. And that was 15 years earlier!

I still watch Kripke's run every other year or so."
Mix: Meisei Story,Agreed. The story was told by the end of Season 5. Personally I hated the angels and especially Castiel who was played by an extremely bad actor. He was okay in 4 and 5 but anything after that involving him or the angels was tedious to get through. It was so clearly not working anymore that they wrote him out at one point but ended up bringing him back because of the backlash from (I presume) viewers who thought he was hot.  Sam was a bad actor too but the chemistry with Dean helped offset his bad acting even though I think he actually got worse as the show went on. Supernatural was a great show for the first 5 seasons but the other seasons and focus on Castiel tarnished it.
Mix: Meisei Story,"Yeah, there's a lot of good stories that could be told post-Season 5, but the post-Season 5 we got usually just did the worst possible version of each of those stories. Case in point, how do you go bigger than the devil? You could go with the living embodiment of chaos, the Leviathan. And post-Season 5 of Supernatural did that! ...But it wasn't just the one Leviathan, it was multiple leviathans, and they had nothing to do with the chaos dragon of lore or any sort of leviathan mythos really, instead just being virtually immortal versions of an enemy the brothers have already fought multiple times.

What gets me though is that Kripke was still writing on the show in Season 6. Yes, he was no longer the head writer, but he was still consulting, directly writing a couple of episodes, and was apparently okay with all of the lore inconsistencies and plot holes that Season 6 produced (unless he only had knowledge about the episodes he was working on and not any of the others).

Because of that and the low points of the Carver era, I think I would still be skeptical of a post-S5 new Kripke era even though those first five seasons were amazing."
Mix: Meisei Story,"While I agree that 1-5 amazing, there were a few standalone seasons that were also very good. I think it's season 11 where they are trying to stop Gods sister, and that was a banger. A redeemed Metatron trying to convince Chuck not to give up on humanity is peak Supernatural.

Of course, then they completely ruin that excellence with the plot twist involving God in the last season.

I think the show had two perfect series finales, S5 and S11. The actual finale got ruined by COVID, so I'd cut them some slack if the rest of the season wasn't terrible."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Money is a helluva drug. 

I pretty much tell anyone interested in the show ‚Äúwatch seasons 1 through 5, pause the last episode of season 5 at the end right when the camera is outside of the house, and pretend that‚Äôs where the series ended and 6-15 aren‚Äôt real.‚Äù"
Mix: Meisei Story,Is it just me who feels supernatural and Smallville are bizarrely similar in later seasons??
Mix: Meisei Story,"I would hardly call ""extremely good"", it was alright

the show was always B tier/CW silliness, especially after season 1"
Mix: Meisei Story,"Extremely good?  I mean come on.  They are OK.  Its a good thing to have on in the background while you're doing something else.  Its B level quantity over quality television, which is fine.  There's nothing really outstanding about it.  Its entertaining enough, but the writing, acting, cinematography, are all pretty meh."
Mix: Meisei Story,"It's difficult to recommend people to just watch 5 seasons out of a 15 season show on good faith. Yet new people will get a bit afraid seeing a 15 season show to pick up, specially one with so many episodes.

Loved those first 5 seasons and the whole 15 were good overall but gee, makes it difficult to recommend the show."
Mix: Meisei Story,"It's actually 2 - 5.  Originally, the brothers weren't meant to continue.  It was going to be a anthology series at first. Their chemistry on screen is what made them stop telling a story about the world with these characters in it, and more about these characters interacting with the world.  Also the budget significantly increases in the second season.  If you watch the end of Season 1, it ends with a car crash with generic ass music playing on the radio.  Season 2 starts and its playing a licensed Ted Nugent song."
Mix: Meisei Story,"It's a good YA show, but it doesn't hold up against other top TV shows. 

Swap Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki out for less attractive leads and the show loses a large portion of its female fanbase."
Mix: Meisei Story,Wasn't Ben Edlund responsible for the show's uptick (ha!) In quality on seasons 2-5?
Mix: Meisei Story,"There are a lot of good episodes in seasons 1-2, but I‚Äôve always felt like the writers strike forcing a shorter season 3 was hugely beneficial. Made them cut out any filler and focus more on the larger plot.

Season 3 also gave us Ghostfacers, so on that alone it‚Äôs my favorite."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Some good with a lot of meh is a perfect description of the seasons post Lucifer prophecy aka season 6 and onward. I honestly enjoy the over arcing narratives of each season, but wow are there a lot of 'skip' moments in each season/episode. Basically any time Sam and Dean start arguing and then later make up became instant skip scenes. At that point they served no narrative purpose beyond starting and episode with drama and ending the episode with a flimsy disagreement conclusion that set them back to their basic positions. 


As a side note, im still annoyed with how they built up Eve, made super monsters, and then just brushed it all away in about 5 minutes of scene time.


While I personally didnt like the final confrontation, I was fine with the finale/ send-off. But yes the first 5 seasons are quite good and season 5 is one that I occasionally go back to and watch again. Mark Pellegrino was a fantastic Lucifer for the earlier seasons."
Mix: Meisei Story,I think there was a drop in quality after Eric Kripke left the show
Mix: Meisei Story,"Just finished a full series rewatch myself and I was thinking the same thing about the back ten seasons, but at the same time I really respect them just for going for it yknow?

A lot of people say they hated the Leviathans but honestly that whole ""arc"" for lack of a better term is probably my favorite just because it was amazing to me that they actually managed to find a new villain after the massive shark jump that was lucifer

And although it started to get stale after awhile everytime they managed to pull a new bad guy out of their asses I was honestly floored

Like when Dean massacred the house of frankstein that was pretty dumb, and when there was that one episode about the monster families that run Chicago that never came up again, I was rolling my eyes at that pretty hard but just the charm of jumping the shark and then finding a larger shark to jump over never wore off on me"
Mix: Meisei Story,"I put the writing of 1-5 of supernatural against any TV show, and it holds up.

I look at it as 6-15 is just a different show. 1-5 takes itself reasonably seriously, 6-15 is fun popcorn television."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I think the only season I skipped in full was season 10. My least favourite choice in the show will always be the dragon copout, too."
Mix: Meisei Story,"First 2 seasons were close to x-files ""monster of the week"". Then when we got close to the characters they added epic story."
Mix: Meisei Story,End last ep of season 5 as it starts to pan away from Dean having a meal with his adopted family and it's perfect.
Mix: Meisei Story,Dean telling Sam what he did while he was in hell is one of the best scenes in TV
Mix: Meisei Story,"Agreed... and disagreed. As much as I love SPN season 1-5, I wouldn't say I like how the female characters in it were written. Save Bela. Bela was fucking awesome.

Then again I also don't like how the female characters are written in 6-15 so... Yeah, I really don't know how to feel about the whole show regarding that."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Yeah Power creep, they beat the devil so the next baddie has to be more powerful, and then the next one, etc.

I still enjoy the later seasons for the monster-of-the-week episodes but almost all of the plotlines are weak."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I used to go on the subreddit and speculate how certain seasons would wind up, and I was always wrong because they would just keep getting more and more ridiculous and then a bigger enemy would emerge in the last episode and one of the brothers would disappear. That show had so much potential for good stories but it became fanservice schlock."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Near the end of the leviathan stuff is when I stopped, good to know I didn't miss out on anything."
Mix: Meisei Story,And then they brought Bobby back! Not the same Bobby but still! I‚Äôm guessing they got a lot of backlash killing Bobby off (and the way they did it) and found a way to bring him back and thought everything would be square lol
Mix: Meisei Story,"''The French Mistake'', ''Baby'' and ''ScoobyNatural''. Fantastic episodes."
Mix: Meisei Story,Seasons 1-5 are the Winchester Gospel. Seasons 6-15 are the apocrypha.
Mix: Meisei Story,"I actually didn't finish season 15. I got halfway through and gave up when I heard the ending had been horrible. I read the synopsis of the remaining episodes and it was just a weird way to end it. Having rewatched 1-5, it makes way more sense to stop there and pretend it actually ended there."
Mix: Meisei Story,And one episode was called jump the shark.
Mix: Meisei Story,"The problem with season one on streaming is that it‚Äôs the only season without the original music used in the show. So you‚Äôll have moments of Dean rocking out to a rock song, but it‚Äôs the not the song that was originally in the show so they have to edit it weird."
Mix: Meisei Story,"After a quick scroll on IMDB i'll give you Bloody Mary, Hook Man, Bugs and Route 666 but I think the rest are watchable to great, even something like The Benders sets up the trope of human enemies always being gross bastards. 18 outta 22 ain't bad."
Mix: Meisei Story,Yeah it took a while for them to figure out the right balance of monster of the week with serialized story. As a whole it's good but you can pick it apart pretty easily episode by episode and ultimately the monster of the week stuff just falls short. The real redeeming factor of the show was that serialized story and you sat through the monster of the week to see the weekly 5 minutes of progression for the overarching plot.
Mix: Meisei Story,"We went to a Supernatural fan panel at a convention. It was our first con and we thought it would be fun. I forget how my husband ended up with the mic, but he said, well we all know Chuck is God. 

Holy crap was the response not what I expected. Half the room cheered in agreement, the other half grumbled and there were a few boos. One of the panelists wanted to know what led him to believe that. It was obvious she disagreed, and a guy in the audience went on about how how was a Christian and Chuck being God would be disrespectful to Christianity. All I could think was, do you even watch the show?

It was realty wild to see so many people refuse to believe it, and then the big reveal happened. I really liked Chuck being God. Everything after with his character was uneven to downright disappointing."
Mix: Meisei Story,The powerhouse they had at Thursday night I believe with Smallville leading into Supernatural made them a ton of money. It‚Äôs not surprising they would milk it even after the creators were out of story.
Mix: Meisei Story,"And that is why they were the best seasons. Still one of the greatest shows in years in terms of music and art direction. 

I get so angry about the Sera Gamble seasons. Big bad talked about in first couple episodes then forgotten and defeated in the last 1-2 episodes. 

Carver wasn't too bad. 

I popped back for the Men of Letters season when Mary was brought back.

Edit to add: I feel bad for everyone who watched it later via streaming after the original music was stripped out. The classic rock used went with the story in most cases and when it was switched it didn't feel the same. I can only watch it on bluray at this point otherwise there is much rage."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Honestly i disagree. While it obviously went downhill after season 5 we still got some amazing and fun episodes along the way up to season 15 that we would have missed. Like my all time favorite one ""The French Mistake"" in season 6. Just that episode alone makes Season 6 worth watching."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Extremely good for a network TV show, not just CW. If you have issues with network TV, those issues are still present. If you don't, it's a fantastic time."
Mix: Meisei Story,"You have a point, but I personally think it's just a solid show for any network (specifically season 1-5). There is a super cringe part of the fandom that overlaps with The Arrow fans that think that stuff was good. I gave The Arrow a shot after hearing the accolades and it was the most meh piece of TV. The latter years of SPN catered extremely hard to these cringe fans (where the early seasons actually made fun of them). I honestly think Twitter/Tumbler fandoms have ruined many shows because a show gets popular so creators turn to the internet to see what the fans are saying and the most hardcore ones are living there creating the absolute dumbest piece of fanfic possible with everyone praising it. 

The WB/CW was a good melodrama network for teens and young adults and then it turned into PG13 Nickelodeon shows."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I think post-5 Kripke was collecting checks and helping the team transition without him. I mean they literally kill him in one episode. After that, he seemed to just get residuals and drop in every now and then. The writing was just terrible after he left though. I know he didn't personally write that many episodes in 1-5, but his showrunning direction must have been what kept things grounded and on a consistent course. 

He seems to be running the Boys like he did SPN and I think that's making people anxious. A big criticism of The Boys season 3 is that it ended just like it started and nothing really changed, just a lot of build up for nothing. To me that's exactly what happened in season 3 of SPN with Dean actually dying and going to hell. He seems to still write like he would for a network TV show instead of a streaming service, and he's said that he's planning to go to season 5 with the Boys. I think he's got good ideas and knows how to string stories along to keep them interesting until they can reach a final episode and come to a conclusion. I'd bet he'd be able to develop a well rounded epilogue to season 5 SPN if he got the chance."
Mix: Meisei Story,"For me the only stand-out late season was 12, when the villains went from being angels and demons to just‚Ä¶ the English. Such a weird choice but I enjoyed the change."
Mix: Meisei Story,1000%
Mix: Meisei Story,Probably cuz they reuse the same local Canadian actors.
Mix: Meisei Story,"You gotta treat it like I did Arrow. It was a shame they canceled it after 2 seasons. I still have such rage over black canary in s3e1.

It's such a shame SPN got canceled after 5 seasons."
Mix: Meisei Story,"You just have to explain to the people that you're recommending the show to that it's not really a 15 season show. It's more like a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. And the sequel shows just retained the title of the original show. But you can jump off at the end of Season 5, the end of Season 11, or the end of Season 15 and still get a full story."
Mix: Meisei Story,I wouldn't call Bad Moon Rising by CCR generic ass music.
Mix: Meisei Story,"I think the anthology series was an idea that got dropped before the pilot even shot. Kripke wanted the scary stories to be front and center with a couple of reporters going around capturing them, but when the studio disliked that he pitched the idea of them being brothers. I think he fleshed out a couple seasons at a time, waiting to see if they would be able to continue before writing any cliffhangers."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Maybe. I followed Padiwhack over from Gilmore Girls. Mainly, I was there for the monster of the week with the supernatural twists. Horror is my bread and butter. 

Even better was the classic rock music. So much good music in those early seasons."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Yea, and he stayed until season 8 but I think he worked better with Kripke there than when he wasn't."
Mix: Meisei Story,"OMFG, I swear it's because Sera Gamble forgot who her big bad for that season was. So much potential just forgotten."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I've never really understood this criticism about the female characters. I understand that many times there was a ""damsel in distress"" type character week to week that Dean usually hit on (especially in the early episodes), but they never seemed purposefully written to be a bad stereotype and his advances were usually batted down and he was made to look like a fool.

Jo and Ellen showed up early in the series and appeared a number of times. Each time they held their own against the bad guys and all of the male characters seemed to respect them.

Ruby and Meg were both demons and did demon things and it never seemed like they were written poorly (just maybe acted poorly at times).

Sheriff Jody Mills helps defeat the bad guy after her family was killed.

Bela was well written and beat the guys quite a bit.

These were all season 5 and earlier characters. I think the overall issue is that there wasn't a prominent female character that lasted a long time. Most of them showed up every now and then, but not like Bobby, Crowley, and Castiel who were often in episode after episode. There's only so much room for the regular cast and they'd already settled into a very male-centric show. Two brothers + dad, then two brothers + Bobby, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel, then two brothers + Bobby and a male angel and a male demon. They seemed to try to rectify this with Rowena and Mary later on, but those episodes were already meh. The crux of the matter is that the show started off as very hetero-focused with Dean being a womanizer. So any woman that was introduced was already being ogled at by one of the main characters. Dean even sleeps with an angel in one episode and Sam sleeps with a werewolf in another episode. The early seasons had women showing up who would eventually swoon for the main characters, except for the ones I listed above. So I think instead of bucking that trend, they just didn't put effort into casting a series regular woman in any role."
Mix: Meisei Story,"I loved the series throughout the entire run, but the power creep was pretty hilarious.

They kill literal death, and eventually they kill the actual omniscient omnipresent God, despite having no actual powers. 

Puts DBZ to shame."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Until eventually they literally killed Death, Lucifer, and even God. It got pretty silly (I still enjoyed the later seasons, but I also know they were ridiculous and not as good as the beginning)"
Mix: Meisei Story,"The extremely meta ""The French Mistake"" in Season 6 is one of the best episodes of a show taking the piss out of its actors, storylines, and fans. There's a reason those gifs are still used today."
Mix: Meisei Story,"Yeah, that's when I called it quits as well. The leviathans were hyped up so much, then were completely depowered by the end of the season. The first red flag was when they pulled that same shit with Castiel already."
Mix: Meisei Story,Just think; that's about half way through the series. Woof.
Mix: Meisei Story,"The single thing I recommend going back for is the Scooby-Doo crossover because it's a standalone.

No, seriously."
Mix: Meisei Story,"So much rage over what they did to Bobby.

Flames! Flames on the side of my face!"
Mix: Meisei Story,"I used to show friends who weren‚Äôt sure if they‚Äôd like the show 3 episodes: Mystery Spot, Ghostfacers, and French Mistake. Always a big hit."
Mix: Meisei Story,This is perfect. Love it.
Mix: Meisei Story,The season 5 ending is the highest rated episodes of the show. The season 15 one is the 3rd lowest out of all the 327 episodes lol.
Mix: Meisei Story,"I watched season 6, eventually. My husband watched every episode. Occasionally he would have me watch episodes that I would 'love' and he was mostly right - if I treated it like fan fiction and not canon. Scoobynatural was HIGHLY entertaining."
Hospital Playlist,"We've gone mainstream, initiate protocol omega"
Hospital Playlist,"Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
Hospital Playlist,Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
Hospital Playlist,Good for Community.
Hospital Playlist,"""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
Hospital Playlist,/u/wikirank please do this every month
Hospital Playlist,Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
Hospital Playlist,"Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens ‚Äî> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks ‚Äî> Professor says something ‚Äî> More talks about feelings ‚Äî> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are ‚Äî> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second ‚Äî> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show‚Äôs success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
Hospital Playlist,"With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
Hospital Playlist,Ozark is so damn good!
Hospital Playlist,Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
Hospital Playlist,You‚Äôd definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I‚Äôm surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
Hospital Playlist,"Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
Hospital Playlist,The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC‚Äôs Dr Foster
Hospital Playlist,I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
Hospital Playlist,So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
Hospital Playlist,"The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
Hospital Playlist,TIL there‚Äôs a Japanese version of *Suits*.
Hospital Playlist,"Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
Hospital Playlist,*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
Hospital Playlist,Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
Hospital Playlist,Damn
Hospital Playlist,"i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
Hospital Playlist,Prior?
Hospital Playlist,First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
Hospital Playlist,Good news for a potential movie too.
Hospital Playlist,Is the show any good after S3?
Hospital Playlist,[deleted]
Hospital Playlist,I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
Hospital Playlist,Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn‚Äôt realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
Hospital Playlist,"It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Qu√©bec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
Hospital Playlist,"I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
Hospital Playlist,"in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
Hospital Playlist,Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
Hospital Playlist,It‚Äôs a dumb translation but doesn‚Äôt take anything away from the show itself
Hospital Playlist,Maybe English copyright issues.
Hospital Playlist,"""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
Hospital Playlist,"If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
Hospital Playlist,Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
Hospital Playlist,they're in their own world over there
Hospital Playlist,"I absolutely agree with you but it's interesting to see that it somehow has a very international appeal. I find their formula boring too, but I wonder if it's something else that is making it universally appealing."
Hospital Playlist,I think it's just another case of reddit living in it's own reality
Hospital Playlist,Sunk cost fallacy
Hospital Playlist,The last season of prison break takes place in the middle east...I wonder if thats why?
Hospital Playlist,"Prison Break just came onto Australian Netflix, was number 7 in Australia all last week. I imagine it's the same for a few other countries."
Hospital Playlist,And it's a year old now!
Hospital Playlist,Survivor is a TV series though
Hospital Playlist,The first two seasons are good imo. Entertaining even if a lot of things don't make any sense at all. But I think is never boring.
Hospital Playlist,"No, it's legit pretty good, not gonna win emmys, but its not trash"
Hospital Playlist,Shit yourself.
Hospital Playlist,Sim
Hospital Playlist,Depends on what you know you're getting into. I found it slow but not glacial. It's one of the few shows where I just love people talking.
Hospital Playlist,#sixseasonsandamovie
Hospital Playlist,S4 is rough but I enjoy S5 and 6 quite a bit. And the finale is really great.
Hospital Playlist,"Mindlessly browsing Netflix is a whole lot easier than Pirating. No ads, no risk of virus, just one click and you‚Äôre watching the show."
Hospital Playlist,Forget pirating..it has been on Hulu for years!
Hospital Playlist,"Pirating is when you have no money and a lot of time. When you have enough money and not enough time, you just subscribe to Netflix."
Hospital Playlist,"I would think it's a rip-off probably, if I was just scrolling through"
Hospital Playlist,"How about ""The Paper House""?

Or maybe even ""La Casa de Papel"", which I believe was actually its Netflix title for like the first week it was available."
Hospital Playlist,"I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs alright. But this is just measuring popularity, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs *uhmayzing*."
Hospital Playlist,"First 2 seasons were good.3rd was average and the 4th was a dissaster.

You can watch the first 2 seasons and stop there since  the series was supposed to be only 2 seasons.Maybe thats the reason why the writing started to get bad."
Hospital Playlist,"You won't get a good answer in /r/television

It is good/great TV, there's a reason its so popular. Its engaging and doesn't require much thinking on your part. Not every show needs to be a Westworld/Better Call Saul."
Hospital Playlist,"Going against almost every comment here and say that I like this show a lot more than Reddit‚Äôs favorites such as Better Call Saul. Besides What We Do In The Shadows it‚Äôs probably the only thing I have genuinely enjoyed watching while in quarantine. Last season of West World was fairly disappointing. Granted I am biased, I have been to Spain a lot and am myself Spanish. Yeah it‚Äôs not The Wire (and neither is Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad) but it is very good."
Hospital Playlist,"Season 4 was straight trash.Writing,acting,music everything.They should have stopped at 2 seasons."
Hospital Playlist,Rude
Hospital Playlist,Kkkkkkkkk percebi que ela ficou muito popular do nada aqui mas n√£o sabia que era por isso
Hospital Playlist,"Fun fact: he said this in reference to the one-season The Cape.  I liked that show, but perhaps maybe not as much."
Hospital Playlist,If you know what youre doing there are no ads and no risk of virus also but that said I still enjoy having netflix to find new stuff I wouldnt have sought out.
Hospital Playlist,[deleted]
Hospital Playlist,"I have a private site with none of those features and everything comes on there about half an hour after it airs.

I still barely pirate stuff.

Cable costs me a dollar, Netflix and Disney plus aren‚Äôt expensive."
Hospital Playlist,In the US. Netflix added Community globally.
Hospital Playlist,[deleted]
Hospital Playlist,"I feel the same. Saw first season, and it was quite predictable. Didn't get why it was so overhyped."
Hospital Playlist,[deleted]
Hospital Playlist,Already the 2nd one was already disappointing
Hospital Playlist,">You won't get a good answer in /r/television

Proceeds to give good enough answer"
Hospital Playlist,But Westworld is garbage.
Hospital Playlist,Apparently I'm the only one that liked season 4 of Money Heist.  AMA
Hospital Playlist,#NeckbeardRage
Hospital Playlist,"I think it's moreso that it would be easier for me to obtain the actual legal rights to something I want to watch, than it would be to teach somebody like my mother how to pirate a movie."
Hospital Playlist,"Its not about being lazy, a lot of people  maybe have an interest in watching something but dont care enough to seek it out and are happy to just wait for it to come to a streaming service and just have a look at whats available at the present."
Hospital Playlist,"Almost everything is easily available though (generally speaking, I don't know about your specific country). Anything not on Netflix will be on Prime Video, HBO or on any other streaming platforms, or on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Store, Youtube movies, you name it.  So we're back to the money question.

Except in rare cases, it's not about availability, not anymore. That was true 10 years ago."
Hospital Playlist,Being predictable isn't a bad thing
Hospital Playlist,I could go into specifics but i dont wanna give spoilers.
Hospital Playlist,"To each his own,but if you already dislike 2nd season you should definitely not waste your time on the 3rd and 4th."
Hospital Playlist,Why is it garbage? I completely disagree
Hospital Playlist,"SPOILERS! DONT GO AHEAD IF YOU DIDNT WATCH SEASON 4.



1.How could Tokyo(not a surgeon) save Nairobi from a sniper shot even with an surgeon guiding her? beside the fact that the they lost the connection with the surgeon and Tokyo had to do it alone.No matter how much the proffesor trained her 6ou do not go from a normal person to a surgeon that does high risk surgeries.

2.Why go thru all this fuss to save Nairobi for in the end to kill her? If you let her die when she was shot the first time,she died with a purpose,Nairobi wanting to see how her child looks but instead she died cowardly getting shot by that special agent.

3.All those scenes with the special agents were like an action movie in which the main character will not die no matter what.And yeah i understand that he was a renown agent but if they wanted to make him powerful they could have done it by making him take smart decisions(tactics)instead of him surving 500 shots.How did that dude not get shot in that scene when he was in the middle and was shot at by both sides,one from the elevator one from the other side? and it wasnt just 3 bullets or 10,it was like 300.Yeah he had a bulletprof vest and helmet but still.

Another Rambo scene is with Nairobi when she died.The special agent tells her that she gonna get shot and the crew just stand by and watches him shot here.After that the crew shot at him but it appears out of 7 people with assault rifles nobody could shot him.

4.Music and sound effects were trash.

5.They could have ended the show in this season but they decided to do another for $$$ and because of this the season felt so slow that i was doing something else while watching it.

6.The development in relationships sucked too.

7.I get it that Berlin was one of the best character in the first 2 seasons,but they have to let him go.Its cool to get 1 or 2 scenes with him after he died but having 35% flashes of the past just straight sucks.

8.There was so more things to talk about but i forget about them since i watched the season a month and a half ago.This season felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie.The only ones who will like this type of season are the ones who are under 15 and like watching series like Riverdale,Arrow, etc.If you are 18+ and watched lots of series like The wire,The Sopranos,Dark,Mr.Robot etc that actually has good writing you will find this series garbage."
Hospital Playlist,What you described is a lazy attitude.
Hospital Playlist,It kills suspense and feels pointless to watch if it's not done right imo
Hospital Playlist,Completely agree. S2 was so bad that I didn't keep watching and wish I hadn't even begun watching
Hospital Playlist,"> felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie

I think you've figured out why Money Heist is so popular"
Hospital Playlist,"No its not. Not everyone cares about tv shows that much. Saying ""I'm interested in watching community so I'll wait for it to come to netflix"" doesnt mean someone is lazy, it means they're not desperate to watch it right now. Believe it or not, people can enjoy tv shows but also its not something they spend a ton of their time doing, so watching if its there vs actively spending time seeking it out on a feasible viewing platform is a decisions based on interests and not laziness. Im an example of that, I love iasip but I spend my time doing other things generally and watch tv shows during dinner etc... so it works better for me to wait for it because I'm not in any rush to see new episodes when they're released."
Hospital Playlist,"That is *so* fucking weird man. You can download new episodes an hour after they air in like 5m max depending on internet speed, then stream them to your smart TV and watch them. It's the definition of lazy, especially on good shows like IASIP."
Hospital Playlist,How is it hard to understand that tv shows aren't a priority to everyone? Like how is it not clear that I don't care about watching new episodes of a tv show an hour after they air? I enjoy tv shows but they're not at the top of my list of activities. The definition of lazy would be if I was absolutely desperate watch new episodes but couldn't be bothered to look for them. Thats completely different to where tv fits into my life.
Hospital Playlist,"Agree to disagree. I only want to watch (what I consider) the best of the best. And I do that searching online, reading certain critics lists, etc. Then I actively seek it out. If I'm just browsing Netflix I would settle for mediocrity most of the time. Which doesn't seem to be a problem for many people, but it is to me. Like Tiger King, basically a documentary, but lots of people gushing about this great new show that was out on Netflix. It's not. It's a mediocre documentary from mediocre filmmakers that, while probably slightly entertaining, is not worth 8 hours of my life. But hey, it's convenient, and it's on Netflix! So that's an easy watch for all the sheep."
Hospital Playlist,"We're not agreeing to disagree here though, you're literally not understanding that 1) not everyone cares about tv shows as much as you and 2) ""the best of the best"" is entirely subjective. I love iasip but if someone else thinks its trash then they're entitled to their opinion. They might love tiger king and not iasip but it doesn't mean they've ""settled for mediocrity"" it just means they have different tastes.

Im normally all for agreeing to disagree but you're trying to call people lazy and your definition of lazy is wrong."
Hospital Playlist,"A lot of people also think 5G causes coronavirus or Trump is a good president. They're also wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that doesn't make them less wrong in certain cases. There are shows just objectively better than others. If someone tells me they like Friends better than The Leftovers, or The Vampire Diaries over Better Call Saul, they invalidate their entire vision on the medium."
Hospital Playlist,"What a ridiculous comment mate. There's objective facts to discredit the first two ""opinions"". What someone enjoys watching on tv is completely subjective. You could write a thesis on why one show is objectively ""better"" than another. But it makes zero difference if someone simply doesn't enjoy watching it. It doesn't make them lazy. 

Again, its all down to why you watch tv, different tv shows exist for different reasons and to be watched in different ways. Your view is just so elitist. Your opinion is worth as much or as little as anyone else's."
Hospital Playlist,"Sure, man. A guitar player that has experience playing for 10 years knows way more about the instrument than a beginner that played a week. Just like someone that has watched way more TV and seeks out the best knows way more about TV than a casual ""I'll watch whatever's on"" type character. Characters and their development, cinematography, acting, dialogue, pacing, symbolism; all kinds of objective standards you can measure. Most casual watchers don't even think about dialogue and character development, they just take it at face value. Which is fine, some people want to just be entertained. But it is an actual art form, and people with background in film that have more of a grasp on how to grade TV shows definitely know more than casual watchers. Why do you think the job of TV critic exists? Stop blurting nonsense and accept that how good a show is is not the same as people's enjoyment of it. Lots of people enjoy watching Friends, but is it a great show? Definitely not."
Hospital Playlist,"Stop blurting out completely unrelated and nonsensical comparisons that don't work. The point is on taste, it doesn't matter how much tv you've watched, or how ""educated"" you think your taste is, your initial point was that people settle for mediocrity and are lazy because they don't seek out ""better"" shows. In entertainment, it doesn't matter how much ""better"" a tv show is, if someone simply doesn't enjoy it then they're not ""settling for mediocrity"" or ""lazy"" by watching something that you wouldn't perceive as being on the same level. 

An example for me would be Hannibal, I can tell its an amazingly well written, acted, shot show. Everything about it is fantastic, but it was only okay in my personal viewing experience. I enjoyed it but despite how technically impressive it is, I only enjoyed it and that's it. I'm probably more likely to watch friends over Hannibal. That doesn't invalidate my opinion and it lends credence to the fact that shows serve different purposes.

To your pointless guitar playing point, I've played guitar for over 10 years and I'm objectively better techincally than someone thats played for 6 months. But if someone enjoys listening to the other person play more than me then it's nothing to do with them being lazy or whatever, its just naturally what they enjoy hearing."
The Circle Brazil,yeah this def. a staple in spanish households
The Circle Brazil,"So many generations have grown up with this show, gave good life advice on numerous occasions"
The Circle Brazil,"I love that someone said ""let's make a show about a young, orphan boy that's homeless, lives in a barrel, and it mistreated by his neighbors, but we'll make it a comedy.""

And it worked."

The Circle Brazil,Lots of great memories of watching these with my grandparents growing up in Puerto Rico
The Circle Brazil,"Dude, this was the thing to watch in Brazil during the afternoons. They aired it every day for years, to the point it was impossible to find a kid that didn't know ""Chaves"" and their quotes. Great humor and wholesome moments, truly a program for the whole family."
The Circle Brazil,Fantastic claymation opening credits
The Circle Brazil,mane i love this show
The Circle Brazil,I watched this as a kid in PR.
The Circle Brazil,I remember this as a kid.  Fuck I‚Äôm old.  Being late 30s suucks.
The Circle Brazil,Truly THE thing that simbolizes latin american culture.
The Circle Brazil,Crazy how my parents grew up watching it and as a result so did I.
The Circle Brazil,"El Chavo! Love this show, used to watch it all the time. The comedy's timeless, to the point it seems prescient today still."
The Circle Brazil,"My god, this unlocked some memories.

I used to watch this when I was a little kid with my grandmother."
The Circle Brazil,It's the guy from fortnite!
The Circle Brazil,An absolute treasure üíó
The Circle Brazil,I can still hear the theme song.
The Circle Brazil,I can still hear the theme song.
The Circle Brazil,"Oh jeez, we watched this in high school Spanish class."
The Circle Brazil,I love this show!!
The Circle Brazil,I literally never watch Spanish things because I can‚Äôt understand them completely and most of them my family watched I didn‚Äôt really care about but I was fine with this one and ‚Äúla familia peluche‚Äù
The Circle Brazil,"However, the sketch comedy show Chesperito, ended up having much more seasons. And that would feature sketches involving El Chavo.

That's why there are two or three characters that I never knew on the original full-length program, because they didn't continue in the smaller sketches that aired on Chesperito."
The Circle Brazil,that episode where everybody is going to the beach except him because he is dirt poor. I'm still traumatized 40 years later
The Circle Brazil,Is that the show that had the bumblebee?
The Circle Brazil,"I just got introduced to this series last week actually!!  I‚Äôm looking forward to watching more!

That being said, it premiered in 1971, so today is not the 50th anniversary.  You‚Äôre off by a few hundred days."
The Circle Brazil,[Here's the show's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chavo_del_Ocho) for curious Gringos like me who have never heard of it and don't even know what the title means.
The Circle Brazil,Does this show have that dude in the bee outfit?
The Circle Brazil,"7 seasons, 311 episodes.  
What the hell constitutes a season?"
The Circle Brazil,"You seen one episode, you‚Äôve seen them all."
The Circle Brazil,Did I just see Mexican Jon Lovitz smoking a stogie?
The Circle Brazil,I hope the creator is burning in hell. What a fucked up show
The Circle Brazil,Thanks to this show Mexico is the way it is . DISABLE
The Circle Brazil,"Not to be that guy but couldn't you have just said that it was a hit in the Hispanic world? Spain and Brazil are Hispanic, this also makes Portugal Hispanic."
The Circle Brazil,I remember going to see Quico. The spinoff .. to the theatre here in Argentina as a kid in .. 2002 or less. There re channels that still transmit it and I leave it on from time to time. While repetitive (episodes from early seasons are literally re executed with other characters in later ones. Same joke. Delivery. Everything) it's still nice
The Circle Brazil,What is Hispanic America? Do you mean Latin America?
The Circle Brazil,I watched quite a bit of this show until we eventually got our own washer and dryer.
The Circle Brazil,Not in Spain.
The Circle Brazil,This was always on at my abuela‚Äôs house in Puerto Rico when I was a kid. At least that‚Äôs how I remember it.
The Circle Brazil,"I grew up in Brasil and used to watch this with my nanny.

The Circle Brazil,"I was about to say, the author of Savage Detectives made a sitcom??"
The Circle Brazil,My friend‚Äôs nick name growing up was Chavo
The Circle Brazil,"This show brings me good memories, I used to watch it when I was 6. It aired at night around 8:00PM on one of the most known free to air channels in Mexico, before El Chavo, SpongeBob SquarePants aired.

I recently watched a couple of episodes and I personally didn‚Äôt find it as entertaining as I used to, some of the humor haven‚Äôt aged that well but that‚Äôs something you can expect from a 50 year old show."
The Circle Brazil,"Is it still? I grew up watching it. I don't have kids, but I find it hard to believe that my nieces and nephews are aware of any of Gomez Bolanos creations."
The Circle Brazil,I can still hear those gem curtains jingling.
The Circle Brazil,Also amazing how the BR dub was kinda its own thing while keeping the spirit of the original and still managed to be iconic in it's own right.

The Circle Brazil,"Of course, the other stories that are told with the same characters are pretty cool. And introduced to us, of course El Chapulin Colorado! Ôøº The red grasshopper! Ôøº The stories involving the two brothers were country bumpkins always getting in and out of trouble or funny. I also enjoy the stories involving Ôøº the two Ôøº burglars were never really good at it. Towards the end they got rid of that and they just put them in charge of a hotel and funny Hijinx ensued."

The Circle Brazil,"A Brazilian TV show once gave the actor a square ball, he later said it was one of the best gifts he ever got."
The Circle Brazil,"Maybe you‚Äôre thinking of this one?

Same main actor."
The Circle Brazil,"Actually '73 is El Chavo's debut as its own T.V. series, before that El Chavo was part of Chespirito's sketch comedy show. When the series got cancelled Chespirito revived his sketch comedy show and integrated El Chavo in there.

As a sketch, El Chavo lasted until 1992 when Chespirito decided he was too old play an 8yo, plus the age meant they couldn't do El Chavo's slapstick humor as they used to be."
The Circle Brazil,[deleted]
The Circle Brazil,"They basically had an anthology of different shows with the same cast members. It started with El Chavo and El Chapulin Colorado. Later on they added El Chompiras, El Chaparr√≥n Bonaparte, Dr. Chapatin, El Chambon, (see a pattern?) and others. They even made a movie and a sequel called El Chanfle."
The Circle Brazil,Mames
The Circle Brazil,Actually it‚Äôs more because of Futbol
The Circle Brazil,"pretty sure brazil and portugal wouldnt consider themselves spanish, which is the meaning of the word hispanic"
The Circle Brazil,They should have said in LATIN AMERICA and Spain cus Brazil = Latin American/do not speak Spanish so not Hispanic. Portugal = European/White. Spain = Hispanic/European/white. This is why I tell people to use the term Latin American instead cus it includes people that don‚Äôt speak Spanish but from the same regions of the americas.
The Circle Brazil,Callate pendejo
The Circle Brazil,No. But yes and no and no.
The Circle Brazil,"Brazil os not Hispanic, we speak Portuguese. Portugal also speaks Portuguese... Hispanic refers to the language, and as hard as it may seem to believe, Portuguese and Spanish are two different languages."
The Circle Brazil,I believe it is the America that speaks Spanish.
The Circle Brazil,"Hispanic America are the countries that speak Spanish, Latin America are the countries that speak a Latin derived language.

The main difference would be Brazil, since they speak Portuguese."
The Circle Brazil,"Was until 2020. The series has been off the air globally for almost three years because of a copyright dispute between the representatives of the original creator and the TV network. But until that year, they showed episodes of the series literally every day here in brazil, with great ratings. Everyone loves this show here, even after 50 years"
The Circle Brazil,"On top of the cartoon that is more recent as the other commenter noted

The merch market is big for this. Plushies and shirts and stuff 

It‚Äôs still big in Los Angeles so it might be a location thing since we have many Latinos. Households where grandmother or grandfather are still in the picture. The kids like the slapstick.

Like once a year a circus comes to town with a character‚Äôs name attached to it. Kinda funny how that works out. ‚ÄúEl circo de la chilindrina‚Äù, or ‚Äúel circo de kiko ‚Äú"
The Circle Brazil,It‚Äôs actually been turned into an animated series so they might‚Äôve actually watched that
The Circle Brazil,I knew it was big in Brazil but I didn't realize how big it was until I saw Neymar dressed up as one of its characters.
The Circle Brazil,"It didn't have a number initially, the 8 was a reference to the channel that broadcasted it in Mexico. It was changed to being his apartment number once it gained international traction, since every country had it in a different channel."
The Circle Brazil,Well I stand corrected.  XD
The Circle Brazil,"Don Barriga is never really portrayed as a bad guy tbh. If anything, he is often the victim and never really has plot lines about him being evil or greedy."
The Circle Brazil,"But those at least made sense.  In terms of premise, you have a show about a bumbling hero, one about inept burglars, and one about a homeless child who gets beat, verbally insulted, and every now and then they feel bad and give him food.

This is the show family show that became the most popular and continues to be loved by most of the country, and I find that extremely interesting."
The Circle Brazil,"Thank you for this. I‚Äôm learning a lot about this show today, when it used to be just some stuff on in the background at my grandmas house or friends parents houses. Hell yeah."
The Circle Brazil,What a strange and avant-garde choice. I would love to see a Behind the Chavo episode about the process to land on this song.
The Circle Brazil,OK I was close
The Circle Brazil,"El Chapulin Colorado was its own show. I read once, the Simpsons writers were holed up together to develop scripts. They had writer's block, so they turned on the television. The television only got broadcast TV so there weren't many channels. They watched El Chapulin Colorado on Univision, thus Pedro Chespirito (Bumblebee Man) was born."
The Circle Brazil,Europe seems fine
The Circle Brazil,The origin of the word comes from the Roman Province of Hispania. The province encompassed modern day Spain and Portugal.

Power Players,The Surprised and the Feckless
Power Players,"Michael Steele buzzed in maybe twice all game, Lara Logan had no idea how to play but still managed to win, and Anderson Cooper got screwed by the name ""Alexander"" twice. Very painful to watch. There were also much fewer clues read that usual because Lara took so damn long"
Power Players,"""I don't even understand the category"" - Anderson Cooper"
Power Players,The SNL skits have become reality. 
Power Players,It was funny how all the contestants gradually realized how little they knew.
Power Players,"I was at this taping. Y'all have no idea how raucous and out of control the practice game was. Laura Logan couldn't work the buzzer to save her life, was cursing in frustration, using the buzzer as a mic, and generally being outrageous. Steele and AC360 were also playing into her antics real hard."
Power Players,"omg yes, I couldn't believe some of the questions they missed. Like when no one could figure out what movie ""Wilson!!!!"" was from"
Power Players,Is there anywhere I can watch this?? 
Power Players,"In retrospect, I shouldn't have been surprised that the show just went downhill after all three of them missed the ""A word that can mean a military vehicle or a place to keep a fish"" clue. Easiest clue in the whole game. A *tank*. 

Plus Trebek spent so long talking to the contestants during the interview portion they ran out of time for the second half of round 1. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have made a difference if they'd had more than 1 minute for the remaining 15 clues, but still.

Monday's game went so well, this was pretty ridiculous. I expect them to do poorly when it's regular celebrities - actors and such - but it's just embarrassing that these journalists and the former Republic whatever he was did so awful when most of the clues were about social studies and stuff you'd think they'd know."
Power Players,What was the final question?
Power Players,So disappointed in Anderson :(
Power Players,They missed a super easy Cam Newton question. 
Power Players,"I really enjoyed seeing Anderson squirm and fail.  I like the guy but that was just good ol' fashioned fun.  

Glad the $$$ went to CPJ.  Good organization."
Power Players,"I didn't watch it, but any time they have special tournaments that don't involve champions, teens, or college kids, the players suck."
Power Players,Lara Logans voice almost made this episode unwatchable for me.  It's almost like she intentionally lowers her voice and prolongs the time between words to sound sultry.
Power Players,Michael Steele is a fucking retard. Same with Lara Logan. The latter is literally married into the MIC. Fuck her.
Power Players,I wish they'd keep the celebs off game shows. They rarely add anything to it and don't boost ratings.
Power Players,[deleted]
Power Players,I enjoyed the sarcastic cheer when Steele finally answered a question near the end of the first round.
Power Players,"""I don't even know Portugese.""

""But I'll bet a thousand."""

Thats a joke your 3 year old tells you and you pretend not to know the answer too."
Power Players,"I forgot about the tank clue. I'm pretty sure AC has reported from Baghdad on top a tank before. It kind of makes you realize that these people seem smart, but they're just queue card readers like the local news anchors."
Power Players,Something about which nation has both Punjabi (from India) and Pashtun (from Afghanistan) people. The answer was Pakistan.

Power Players,"The *response* was Pakistan, the *clue* was about Punjabi and Pashtun people.

Power Players,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
Power Players,so what would be a better idea to you?
Power Players,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
Power Players,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
Power Players,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
Power Players,more scooby doo
Power Players,[deleted]
Power Players,was that supposed to be funny?
Power Players,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
Power Players,this entire post is a joke no?
Power Players,[deleted]
Power Players,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
Power Players,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
Power Players,"It's often a choice to make a show more immersive. If you have actors people recognize, the thought is it may ruin suspension of disbelief."
Power Players,New talent is cheaper.
Power Players,Sometimes the best person for the role isn‚Äôt an A list star. People have to climb the ladder somehow.
Power Players,"Morfydd clark is talented, she was amazing in Saint Maud. Acting wasn't a problem in rop, it was just boring"
Power Players,The cast was fine. Why do you need recognizable names in every show you watch? I like when I don't know who people are.
Power Players,"They didn't need a cast of stars, they just needed people who could act and they got exactly that.

Given the size of the show and the multi-season commitment it got from Amazon, it would probably take an actor like 7 or 8 months of the year to film an entire season and big stars probably don't want to dedicate years or their careers to a show like that. 

Just look at Henry Cavill, he binned The Witcher pretty much so he had time to do new Superman movies."
Power Players,"What? The acting was good in Rings of Power, is this satire? Why do all these big shows have to have a buffet of heavy names? That usually ends up causing ego clashes and actors portraying roles worse."
Power Players,I thought the acting was good..
Power Players,"Regardless of their recognition, most of the cast is extremely good at delivering the material they are given. There are some flaws with the written material for sure but it could easily improve with the upcoming seasons. I liked the show regardless of those issues, mostly ig because I watched it myself before reading tons of unnecessary reviews and articles with an agenda."
Power Players,"This is one of my biggest gripes with RoP! Aside from my issues with some of the writing, I believe they really missed the boat by not casting a few notable names like you‚Äôve mentioned. Having that extra oomph of star power or a well-known character actor could‚Äôve given the show a little more gravitas.

A lot of the cast were basically unknown and while that‚Äôs fine, sometimes a veteran actor can ‚Äúrise above the material‚Äù and add a little extra. And with some of the questionable writing on this show, in my opinion, that would‚Äôve been welcome. 

I just think the casting team could‚Äôve known their audience better. You‚Äôre entering the world of fantasy, they could‚Äôve followed other shows by casting an iconic actor from that genre. Think: Winona Ryder and Sean Astin famous for movies in the 80s in Stranger Things, Sean Bean famous for LOTR in Game of Thrones, Matt Smith famous for Dr. Who in HotD. It was just such a missed opportunity considering their budget! I think the casting for RoP was okay, but sometimes I watch a show just for a famous actor. And not having one gave me another reason not to be as excited for the next episode. 

(Also how could you forget the brilliant Emmy nominee and BAFTA winner Fiona Shaw absolutely killing it in Andor! üòã)"
Power Players,"They spent a tonne of money just getting the rights to it and then on the VFX, so it kind of makes sense they skimped a little on lesser known talent until they see how it goes down. I imagine if the acclaim grows and viewing figures support it there will be new additions further down the line with bigger draw."
Power Players,Only desperate actors would have read the script for Rings of Power season 1 and thought it would be smart to sign up to play the main character for 5 seasons over 10 years.
Power Players,"I think unknowns can do a great job when they are cast properly. I‚Äôd imagine Amazon blew most of its budget on securing the rights, so they didn‚Äôt want to spend more on known names. 

The thing is, good acting is good acting. What you get with a name brand is recognition ‚Äî it‚Äôs marketing. The real trick is to cast one or more out of work big names from the past. You get recognition and experience that way for a lower cost."
Power Players,Money and maybe they wanted unknowns to play characters.
Power Players,"In a show like this where the characters are generally more known to audiences and fans of the lore, it's sometimes better to avoid having a recognizeable face in a big role.

Tbh, I would venture to say in HOTD 99% of the people watching haven't seen D'Arcy or Cooke in anything. And even someone like Ifans is a bit more of a character actor and I'm willing to bet most people didn't realize he was the Lizard in the Amazing Spider-Man."
Power Players,Maybe everyone else was busy and someone realized you need to hire someone else eventually because Skarsgard can't star in literally every TV show.
Power Players,"Although I was disappointed with the show, I don't have a problem with the cast.

The actors have work experience and they have gone through a casting process.

It makes no sense to cast well-know actors just because hey are well-known. Well-known is not the same thing as talented.

And it's not like the actors are completely unknown. Morfydd Clark for example was praised for her work in the theater and in film before she landed a part in Rings of Power.

Daniel Weyman is also a respected theater actor and was praised for the parts he played in several television series."
Power Players,"I would guess it's some combination of wanting to keep the cast salaries lower and wanting to make sure that the cast they got wouldn't have a ton of scheduling conflicts as they'd be required to film five seasons in New Zealand. It's also possible that Amazon Prime, as a newer studio, has a tougher time getting big-name actors to join their shows than established studios like WB and Disney do without paying out the nose for it. 

Will Poulter was originally supposed to be in the show and had to drop out because of scheduling conflicts. Guessing any known commodity would have had the same issue.

FWIW I think the cast is solid and not at all a problem for the show."
Power Players,"Well money is one thing, A-list actors aren't cheap and before you pull up the whole ""1 Billion"" argument there are a whole lot of other things that money is spent on other than just actors, like props, location permits and vfx artists among other things.


Plus as others have mentioned it gives a chance for newer talent to flourish, Owain Arthur (Durin), Sophia Nomvete (Disa), and Ismael Cruz (Arondir) have all played their characters fantastically."
Power Players,"The cast of RoP is great. 

It is the writing that is terrible."
Power Players,"No, you don‚Äôt understand.

We must continually ask for the same small pool of actors and actresses and then complain that they aren‚Äôt bringing new talented individuals to the table."
Power Players,"I was not asking for A list stars, just one who are recognized for previously doing quality work."
Power Players,Yep Clark is a talented up and coming actress who has been getting praise recently for her work.
Power Players,"No no no you're supposed to shit on it because it's Rings of Power. Everything it did was bad and also a crime, because it isn't the PJ movies. How thoughtless of you, jeez."
Power Players,"I don't know about extremely good, but mostly not bad. I do not think the actress playing Bronwyn is very good, however"
Power Players,So... actors getting job security means they're desperate?
Power Players,"Wow, ok I can break down a lot of this. I hope this gets you started as you asked like 20 question, which would be an entire college course in media and distro finance, not a reddit thread

The first thing to realize is self-produced vs. acquired content.  For example, Disney owns Star Wars/MCU, makes it themselves, and distributes it. Everything is done in house.... and well self-produced content can (and nearly almost is) much more profitable (or better to say, less expensive) than acquired content, its a lot cheaper to make and you can do wonky stuff with moving around costs.  For people making this, well, Disney is paying itself, so its not relevant really, for like actors and such, they just get a flat fee, which is often more than they would otherwise since this is the only time they will ever get paid on the show.

In acquired content.  In streaming, the distributor, like Netflix (netflix acquires nearly all its content). Pays for a product thats already done, or pays a production company to make it and they get distro rights. These are generally done on a cost-plus basis for streaming. That means they pay ALL the production costs, plus more as pure profit. This is because they generally get exclusive rights and the show wont have any more way to sell to other distributors ever, its a one and done so they put profit in. It can be alot. These are generally MUCH more expensive than self-produced content. Like way more expensive. Netflix pays a lot more than other companies for content. In regular TV, generally a distributor would be ~80% of production cost, but only get limited distro rights (such as first run linear rights in the US) and the production company could then sell all the other distro rights to others and make back its money + profit. Selling to streaming is free money.

As for how long exclusive deals on acquired content go... its negotiable. For self-produced content, you own it, you can do whatever you want with it or sell rights to someone else

>What if Netflix announced they are willing to pay 3 billion USD a year for streaming rights to all Star Wars properties, does that mean Disney is obliged to match 

In theory, Disney (and Netflix) both have to do business in the best interest of their shareholders. There is at least some number that makes sense for Disney to sell rights, but what that number is, who knows, its probably really high."
Power Players,"Ok, imagine I run a streaming network. 

Scenarios 1)

I make a tv show ‚Äúin house.‚Äù We come up with the concept, we write the scripts, we cast the actors, we hire the creative crew (directors/cinematographers/editors/etc). We make the show and launch it on our platform. The platform owns the show.

This is how Disney‚Äôs Star Wars and MCU shows work. 

Scenario 2) 

A producer at my network reads a novel and thinks it is bananas. My network ‚Äúoption‚Äù or licenses the novel and uses it to make a tv show. We own the show, the author owns the book. Depending on the contract they can take the option somewhere else when/if it expires.

This is how Daredevil worked between Netflix and Disney.

 Scenario 3)

We read the book - we buy the rights outright. We make a show. We own everything.

This is how Amazon‚Äôs Rings of Power works.

Scenario 4)

Someone else makes a show. We love it. We license the show and air it on our channel for a certain length of time. The license expires, the show‚Äôs creators take it somewhere else.

This is how Breaking Bad and Better call Saul on Netflix worked.

Scenario 5)

Someone else makes a show. We love it and we buy it - we own the show. The show‚Äôs creators pitch a sequel/interquel/prequel based on concepts tied to the show. We pass. They take their pitch to one of our competitors who options it provided they not use ideas we defined. We get paid a little.

This is how Avatar: the Last Airbender worked.

> residual values of shows

I have no idea how residuals work in streaming.

Tv shows and movies used to be available for syndication - which was when a secondary or tertiary network bought the rights to air episodes of a popular show a certain number of times for a certain length of time. 

That doesn‚Äôt happen with streaming shows. I can only think of one streaming show that was brought back after cancellation (Tucca and Bertie) - it just doesn‚Äôt happen like it used to."
Power Players,"Streaming residuals are insanely complicated and havent even been fully worked out yet. Its why you see such huge upfront payments to the above the line people, because they arent getting their typical percentages."
Power Players,"Some of the more popular franchises are owned outright. Disney full on bought Marvel comics and such over a decade ago. They don't own Spider-Man in film because back in the 90's Sony bought the film rights. So Sony can do whatever it wants with Venom, Madame Web etc. Some of it gets real funny like how Disney has Spidey cartoons because apparently the contract lets Disney use animated Spidey stuff also long as it's under 44 minutes. Meanwhile Sony can do animated films like Spiderverse. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch being related to both the Avengers and X-Men let both Avengers Age of Ultron and the Fox films have a Quicksilver. Disney had Marvel Comics retcon that Magneto is not actually their Dad though and that's still in place despite Disney buying Fox and having sole rights to the characters now.

So suffice to say, Star Wars won't come up for sale, Disney has their own long-term pans for a Star Wars theme park. So it won't matter if Netflix wanted to pay for it.

Netflix itself has it's own contracts for the shows. It made Marvel shows but those got cancelled and now Disney got the streaming rights back for those since they own those in the first place.

Sony owns Columbia Pictures and has a decent sized TV library but has no interest in a streamer for whatever reason. So they let Seinfeld stream on Netflix for a long-term contract a few years ago. But they basically have a monopoly on anime streaming in the West now with CrunchyRoll and Funimation.

Warner is doing the real baffling stuff now with Discovery merged and in charge. They apparently want ""big IP"" like Harry Potter and DC in house but are also letting a new Batman cartoon from Bat-master Bruce Timm be shopped to 3rd parties after axing plans for it to be on HBO Max. This is all way above the heads of most showrunners.

if you're a producer like Greg Berlanti with like a dozen shows on multiple platforms it's better but Berlanti doesn't have total control over everything. Flash show is still DC/Warner for example despite being Berlanti's production company."
Power Players,">however the shows themselves belong to the creators/producers/production companies

There is no reason why that has to be true.

The short answer to who owns a show is always: it depends on the deals that have been made.

Those deals can be very complicated, but we will see more and more that streaming companies will try to have full control over the distribution rights, or even the copyright itself.

Some additional information about copyright and licensing.

I often buy stock photos, technically I buy a non-exclusive license with limitations to use those photos.

Who owns the copyright? It depends. Under US law the person who makes the photo owns the copyright, unless there is a written agreement that states otherwise.

If I hire a photographer, I make the photographer sign an agreement that makes it clear the photographer makes the photos as 'work for hire' and the company I work for owns the copyright and the full and unlimited distribution rights.

If I use a model, the model has to sign a contract as well. That contract also contains some article that protect the rights of the model, so for example, the company I work for is not allowed to use the image of model outside of the original context."
Power Players,It depends on the contracts. We just saw with black widow video sharesand big screen shares are not the same
Power Players,">But does Disney really ""own"" Star Wars and MCU, any more than Netflix ""owns"" Stranger Things and The Witcher, or Amazon ""owns"" Ring of Power?

Yes.

I guess it does get more complicated. Warner Bros. owns Sandman and Batman but was able to shop Sandman around ending up at Netflix and there's a bidding war for an animated batman series. 

>What if Netflix announced they are willing to pay 3 billion USD a year for streaming rights to all Star Wars properties, does that mean Disney is obliged to match that to keep Star Wars on Disney Plus? Because otherwise they'd be screwing over the creators and whoever else is entitled to a share of Star Wars earnings?

presumably Disney who owns Lucasfilm needs it to prop up disney+ which will long term make more than enough."
Power Players,"Disney owns the SW characters and mostly owns the Marvel characters.  Amazon owns their original characters within RoP but doesn't own a lot of the stuff with the IP.  The Witcher is based on a book series (or the game that spawned off of it, I'm not sure of the ownership).  Stranger Things I think is also not owned by Netflix but I don't know of the details there.

A lot of companies are trying to distribute products they produce as it's more profitable.  Disney owns a lot more IP than Netflix does.  They do still have to pay residuals to creators, but they don't have to pay out to a production company when they are the production company.

The companies are publicly owned and have to maximize profits.  If Netflix were to offer 100 billion/year for Star Wars, Disney would probably be legally obligated to accept that deal (or pay out residuals to the people who made it as if they made that deal).  But if it's a reasonable figure, Disney can say that it's more profitable for them to keep it housed under Disney+ than they would make by selling it to another service."
Power Players,I read that some of the royalty's on hbo max content was based off of how many subscribers they have which was one of the reasons that they took away some content that was not being watched by many people
Power Players,"Hey thanks for the examples!  That's a really good way of showing how a particular show can be made, owned, and commoditized.

I guess my initial take is that Disney's method of buying major franchises for a large lump sump fee, but then having the ability to develop those franchises however they want by using hired creatives and then owning the resultant shows and movies outright for perpetuity is gonna be a lot more cost effective than Netflix acting more like a distributor and partner to production companies that makes many of its shows, but it does hinge on whether Disney can continue to milk the Star Wars and MCU properties for years to come. 

In regards to residuals,  I guess my question is more about who ""owns"" how much of each show and therefore who gets his much of its LONG TERM income. The example is always how much Jerry and Larry had made from Seinfeld, because they presumably own a large chunk of the show itself,  so as long as the show makes money,  they get a large cut. 

Is that still the norm in the industry today? Or is it more like the studios like Disney, Sony, Paramount etc more own the properties and simply pay producers and showrunners a mostly upfront cost to make shows for them. For example does Beniof and Weiss own a chunk of GoT, or did they just get paid (handsomely) to make the show,  but now Discovery Warner gets the bulk of future earnings going forward."
Power Players,"One caveat is that while Stranger Things and Star Wars belong whole to respectively Netflix and Disney, there are parts of MCU that don't belong to Disney (Spider-Man, Incredible Hulk), while in case of Witcher and Rings of Power companies have TV filming rights and own each TV series, they do not own books, movies or games publishing rights."
Power Players,"So are you saying because Disney actually owns much of the Star Wars IP, it is still much cheaper for Disney to keep streaming Star Wars than Netflix? As in say the residuals cost 10%, and Netflix goes crazy and say we'll pay 10 billion a year for streaming rights, Netflix would actually have to pay Disney 10 billion dollars, and then Disney takes 1 billion as residuals to pay the creators. But if Disney wants to match that and keep Star Wars, Disney would essentially just need to pay 1 billion as residuals and sort of ""pay itself"" the other 9 billion dollars? Which means it would cost 
Netflix prohibitively more money to try to stream a property like Star Wars?"
Power Players,">  LONG TERM income

That depends on contracts.

People like the South Park guys keep selling pieces of the show.

Someone with less clout might not be able to do that.

Someone like the Game of thrones guys - who are hired guns - probably make much less than George R R Martin, who can sell and resell and sell and resell.

I can say that if you look up certain creators + contract + like Variety you can find out details of big contract.

Ex:

https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/george-rr-martin-hbo-deal-b1824207.html"
Power Players,"FYI it appears undetermined if Netflix actually owns Stranger Things. They have distro rights, but who owns the underlying IP and such might be 21 Laps (production company)"
Power Players,"More or less.  But Disney needs to make up that $9 billion somehow.  They need to maximize shareholder value, and if streaming it on D+ is only worth $1 billion, then they're not maximizing it and should sell the streaming rights to Netflix.  They can do creative accounting to say it's worth $9 billion to grow the D+ brand or whatever, but they need to have some logic to do so."
Power Players,"From the article (no NSFW images, but the text is disturbing enough):

>Although not featuring any explicit nudity or sexual content, the comic consists of a virtually unhalting stream of images clearly designed to evoke various violent sexual situations, from the endless streams of viscous, white liquid that frequently splatter over the scantily-clad-to-nude cast members, to cowering, flush-faced, teary-eyed girls pressed against walls with their hips raised into the air, to the most (in)famous of all, the distinctive image of the Legion's blatant penis-tongue, leaking goo from a goddamn urethra. Putting the cherry on this sundae of depravity, the manga employs an art style that uses proportions specifically and deliberately designed to make the vast majority of its female characters appear as though they are underage (despite the fiction identifying them as being at least old enough to drive).

[...]

>Reactions ran the gamut from outright disgust to comedic derision, with most fans agreeing that the transformation of a children's toyline into borderline pedophilia was a ""bad thing"". There were a number of people who claimed, amazingly, that there was absolutely nothing wrong with such a thing, and that everyone else simply wasn't understanding it was a ""cultural thing,"" ‚Äî ""it"" being... the enjoyment of rape imagery, apparently. This, of course, is in defiance of the fact that many Japanese fans were themselves openly decrying Kiss Players, fearing that American fans would think that this was somehow accepted as ""normal"" in Japan. The line's writer/designer, Yuki Ohshima, even admitted that he crafted the series in this manner because he wanted to ""make people's jaws drop"". Mission accomplished, it would seem."
Power Players,"Curse my morbid curiosity. 

Amazing, it's like the worst possible fanfic you could imagine but a canon work. Looks like Tvtropes didn't even document it outside the ""horrible anime"" page. "
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,This was a great read.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can‚Äôt quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon

Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Delta state was the shit!

Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,It was on both actually
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might‚Äôve been YTV
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,[deleted]
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.

Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Thank you for making this thread, so the front page isn't half Rings of Power reviews lmao"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"The common thread in every interview seems to be that it‚Äôs visually spectacular - no surprise there. 

The division is at whether the plot, writing and characters are any good, which is more or less what I assumed would be divisive from the very beginning.

I‚Äôll hold my ultimate judgement until after the season finale (keep in mind most critics only got the first two episodes), but until then I remain a bit skeptical that Amazon Studios has what it takes to produce HBO level prestige television.

Edit: Something to keep in mind - it seems like everyone besides LA Times (who got 6 episodes) only saw the first two, which are undoubtably going to be worldbuilding heavy. Considering that a lot of recent Marvel/Star Wars offerings on D+ seem to start off promising and become gradually more divisive in reception, it‚Äôs plausible that ROP is the opposite. There‚Äôs some heavyweight talent on the writing staff which is basically the only reason I have some optimism."

I‚Äôve never read LOTR so feel free to disregard my opinion.

Rather than just throwing people into the LOTR universe. And I prefer for shows to take their time rather than having 5 minutes if world building and that's it and roll the action.

Also I imagine it will be hard to compact 2 or 3000 years worth of story into several seasons."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I find it kind of annoying that everyone frames their take around how expensive it is. It‚Äôs not like you or I had to pay for it. I don‚Äôt see why it matters
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,[removed]
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Seems like its visually spectacular (which you would hope considering the insane pricetag) but so far we haven't got much meaty or satisfying characters or story yet. Lets hope they can deliver some solid character work considering they've only got three quarters of the seaosn left.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,How long are the first two episodes?
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Saw the premiere last night at my local theater and loved what I'm seeing so far. First episode is slow setting things up, but I'm already familiar with the characters, their motives, etc. come the second episode. Can't wait for more next week!"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, very intrigued to see how things play out. The guy on the raft could not have looked more like Vijo Morganstein if they tried. I assume he'll have something to do with Numenor. Also, I loved Frankenstein Gandalf."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"How's is bezos Washington Post giving it the worst.


That's oddly funny..fuck Bezo btw.

But I hope this show is good"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Color me cautiously optimistic.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I rate it 19 out of 20 rings of power.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,It seems like it's too early to tell if it's good or if it just looks good.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Would like to say the Grace Randolph review is pretty funny
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Why does it just screams‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúThe story is just slow as hell‚Äù
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Just saw the first two episodes in a fan screening. As a mild Lord of the Rings fan, I really enjoyed them.

Visually it's absolutely gorgeous. I haven't been so inspired and awestruck by sets and locations like this in years.

As far as writing goes I'm very excited with the direction and setup. I know a handful of people who think Lord of the Rings is boring. I don't think so but I understand why. I'm exaggerating here but they're kinda like watching a textbook of events that occured. It's similar to Peter Jackson's King Kong. There's a lot of characters and they try to inject warmth and relatability into the characters but at the end of the day it feels like it's more about the plot and getting from point a to point b than exploring characters. I feel like to get the full experience and to love the characters completely I'd have to go research their lives.

Rings of Power however already does a lot more groundwork introducing the world and characters in a way that in my opinion isn't boring and builds more of a rapport between the viewers and the characters. Already I feel closer to and care about many of the characters nearly as much as I do the Lord of the Rings characters. I found them very charming. I chuckled a lot and even characters I was unsure about ended up being my favorites. Take this with a grain of salt though, because as I stated I'm a mild fan. I haven't read any of the books and am not bringing textbooks of lore into my opinion.

I keep seeing this compared to Game of Thrones which is just a bunch of tribal marketing in my opinion. The way I see it Game of Thrones is great for all of the politics, intrigue, scheming, and human interactions. And I think Lord of the Rings is great for it's fantasy, wonder, adventure, and beauty. So I think it's completely reasonable to like one more than the other or both (in my case) for different reasons.

Anyways. Ask me anything if you want."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"The AV Club just released their review, and they grade it an A-, saying it's ""one of the most captivating fantasy worlda in TV history"".

https://www.avclub.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-review-1849479930"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"so, Prime is the only service I don't have, so I may have to end up sailing the high seas for the premiere of this one, man, why couldn't this be on HBO?"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Its amazing tonsee the massive disconnect from professional critics and audiences. To critics, this show is a masterpiece. To the actual viewers, who make the show money, its a disasterl... mostly. Sitting at high 30s on RT right now and no better elsewhere for viewer reviews. 

Everyone seems to agree that the show is visually stunning. Its amazing looking, but thats what throwing an ungodly amount of money at a show will do. However, most agree that the rest of the show is just bad. There are a variety of reasons given. Bad acting, bad writing, ignoring set lore, injecting real world social views into a world that it doesnt fit into.... then we have actors on social media making things worse, as usual these days when a show was likely doomed to fail to begin with. 

I watched it. Not a fan. I loved the previous entries. I even rewatched and read everything again before. Its something I like to do when things like this come out. I was let down. They ignored the source material. They ignored established lore and changed it. In ky eyes, they solidified that this can not and will not be canon too. 

I was excited at first, despite the bad press. I was let down. I was bored and disappointed. I made it to the second episode and I am done. I wont watch any more. I am one who gave it a bad review. If you are going to base a show on an established world with a lot of rich lore, you need to actually follow that lore. You need to try and add story to the world, not change it. 

Thats my 2 cents on the matter. Agree with it or dont. Watch if you want. If you enjoy it, great for you. Thats awesome. I dont. I think its a polished turd and nothing more. Shiny on the outside but inside, its still just a turd."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"I don't like it, struggle to stay awake after 4 episodes."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Far better reviews than I expected.

I had hoped it wouldn't be review bombed. I have friends and family who worked on this show and they all are very positive with the results."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Why is this sub pretending this is already some kind of massive failure? 71 MC is not bad. Hell, it's even slightly higher than House of the Dragon."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Why is rottentomatoes site so fucked? RoP and HotD are only showing like 5 reviews
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,So far it's not a disaster is what I'm getting from the reviews. I'm hoping they can pull it off. Please be better than that Nexflix Shannara series!
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"""It either races through astonishing action scenes, or lingers on a single conversation or meaningful look.""

At least they're successfully emulating that aspect of Tolkien."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"From the 'positive' reviews:

>there‚Äôs potential in this adventure‚Äîeven if we can‚Äôt see it yet.

> It's the kind of show that deserves to be seen on the big screen instead of on your phone.

> but I also kept thinking that what I really wanted to do was rewatch the movies.

>It‚Äôs true, the pace of The Rings of Power‚Äôs first two episodes is slow and deliberate

>It may take a while for ‚ÄúThe Rings of Power‚Äù to sort itself out

> The pace, too, is a little all-or-nothing...in the end, the spectacle wins.

>The somewhat flawed series 

> flutters to life in bursts,

> even if some of that exposition lags... even if some of the effects and epic scale diminish a tiny bit."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,It's better than The Hobbit trilogy at least
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"To be fair game of thrones season 1 took a while to gather some  to steam 

Problem is you have a very entitled fan base who have decided there is no room for error (which is ironic considering there‚Äôs plenty Peter Jackson changed and everyone loves his version)"
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Anything has to be better than the Hobbit movies.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Damn. Entertainment Weekly had every exclusive leading up to the release and threw it right under the bus once all the marketing money was paid. Gangster. That means they probably tried to be as nice as possible even in a negative review. Can only imagine Bezo's rage reading that review.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Hopefully it looks like Lord of the Rings and not The Hobbit.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,[deleted]
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,I'm not going to write the whole show off based on two episodes but these reviews don't give me much hope.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Someone explain to me how you can spend a billion dollars and fuck up this bad. No coherent story line. 2D characters. No back story. The acting was trash. Everyone is saying that it looks good but you can tell it's just cgi. I'd rather watch Amy Schumers comedy special. 

1/10 would not bang."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"I did a double take because I read many of the reviews blurbs in your post before noticing you had sectioned it off as positive at the top and mixed/negative at the bottom. Reason why is many of those positive reviews sound very mixed or maybe backhanded complimentary at best.

I feel confident no matter what happens we should all get out our popcorn for the discussions around this show coming up."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"What you're going to see in this thread:

Cherrypicking parts of reviews to confirm this sub's predetermined opinion that the show is going to fail. They said it looks gorgeous? That must mean the content sucks!

It's been hilarious watching the run up to this and HOTD. It's clear which show this sub wanted to succeed and which one it wanted to fail. The Amazon hate runs deep."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Who knew that a mega thread of Rings of Power reviews would have so little comment on this sub. Apparently, reddit is upset."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,It‚Äôs just never gonna beat the trilogy is it? Why bother
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Lots of buts in those positive reviews.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Imagine seeing the shit show of the star wars sequel trilogy and thinking ""Let's do that to Lord of the Rings."" Damn, as soon as I saw JJ Abrams being involved with the show runners I knew this show was a lost cause."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,Karendriel is not a great character.
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Most reviews seem surprisingly honest, that it is OK but not brilliant yet - i was really expecting a lot of 10/10 best show ever shill reviews."
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,[deleted]
Mighty Little Bheem: Festival of Colors,"Ick, I love the Washington Post and subscribe to it, but the critic apparently cannot spell ""appendices."" She spelled it ""appendixes"" twice within 4 words, but I would only spell it that way when speaking about the organ."
Restaurants on the Edge,"Lisa Kudrow was let go from Frasier. 

The show recast the role of Roz with Peri  Gilpin."
Restaurants on the Edge,"and after Friends, Perry had a seemlingly endless stream of failed sitcoms"
Restaurants on the Edge,so what you're saying was courtney cox was the missing ingredient
Restaurants on the Edge,"So, the gist of the story is that actors had acting careers?"
Restaurants on the Edge,I remember before Blossom there was a very short lived sitcom starring Mayim Bialick that had her as a rambunctious kid and Jennifer Anniston played her older stuck up sister.  Only thing I remember from the show is Jennifer Anniston getting a plate of spaghetti dumped on her head
Restaurants on the Edge,"If memory serves right, The Edge was a sketch show (based on an interview with Alan Ruck from a few years ago where he mentions having worked on it) and not a sitcom"
Restaurants on the Edge,"This isn't that surprising, most actors spent quite a while as failures before they find success. The reason *Party Down* is so true-to-life is that the show's creators (Paul Rudd, Adam Scott, Rob Thomas) all worked shit jobs for years before they got their break."
Restaurants on the Edge,"Top of the Heap was pretty funny, like a Married with Children type show with a father and son con artist"
Restaurants on the Edge,"Here‚Äôs my power rankings of Friends stars before they were on Friends based on well known they were.
1. Courtney Cox - had a supporting role as Alex‚Äôs girlfriend on Family Ties. She was also in Bruce Springsteen‚Äôs Dancing in the Dark video.
2. Matthew Perry - had a supporting role on Growing Pains as Carol‚Äôs boyfriend who died in a drunk driving accident. He was also in a lot of shows that only lasted a single season plus he had a supporting role in the River Phoenix movie A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon.
3. Matt LeBlanc - he did a lot of commercial work as well as a recurring role on Married With Children that led to his own sitcom.
4. Lisa Kudrow - had a recurring role as Ursula on Mad About You and in three episodes of the Bob Newhart sitcom, Bob.
5. Jennifer Anniston - starred in the cult classic, Leprechaun and as Ferris Bueller‚Äôs sister in the very short lived Ferris Bueller tv show.
6. David Schwimmer - he was mostly a stage actor before Friends, but had a memorable storyline on the first season of NYPD Blue and a role on the short lived Henry Winkler sitcom Monty."
Restaurants on the Edge,"Jennifer Aniston had two shows with Friends and another one playing about the same time in different networks. So if the second show got second season, she would have to quit Friends and do the other show the then CEO of NBC put the second show against strong competition for it to be ratings flop and not to be renewed"
Restaurants on the Edge,"All I remember was Matt LeBlanc sitting a bottle of ketchup on the the edge of a top of a building, then buying a hot dog from a street vendor, plain. Then behind the back, a perfect pour of ketchup from the sky.

Idk why I remember that I was fairly young when that commercial came out lol"
Restaurants on the Edge,"Lisa said it was a blessing, and I don't blame her. Frasier is incredible but Friends is a global and a cultural phenomenon making Lisa millions 30 year after it debut. So yes a blessing it was."
Restaurants on the Edge,But she had a recurring role as Ursala on Mad about You.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Fun fact, Lisa Kudrow has a guest role on an episode of Cheers in the eighth season, which is sort of weird to think about just because Cheers just feels like a MUCH older show than Friends."
Restaurants on the Edge,Some great ones though. Go On was a really funny show with a fantastic supporting cast. It really deserved another season.
Restaurants on the Edge,I miss Studio 60.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Go On is legitimately hilarious with a great cast. I don't normally care if a sitcom gets renewed or not, but I was upset with that one."
Restaurants on the Edge,"She was on the drama ""Dirt"" on FX. It wasn't bad, but I definitely stuck around for her."
Restaurants on the Edge,Masters of the universe and ace Ventura prepped her
Restaurants on the Edge,Molloy
Restaurants on the Edge,"Came here to say this. I watched The Edge as a kid (and even have a VHS-quality DVD bootleg), and it was a sketch show--not a sitcom."
Restaurants on the Edge,It even had a backdoor pilot on MWC
Restaurants on the Edge,"This list is strange to me. Everyone i knew all knew Joey as the bimbo guy from married with children. He was by far the most famous in my social circle. 

I was pretty young at the time tho."
Restaurants on the Edge,"> 2. Matthew Perry - had a supporting role on Growing Pains as Carol‚Äôs boyfriend who died in a drunk driving accident.

He was also unfairly fired from this role, actually.

Kirk Cameron became a Born-Again Christian shortly after the show started and caused a shit-ton of problems for the programme by refusing to do things on account of his faith. For example, frequently forcing rewrites of jokes or even episodes because he didn't want dirty jokes in the show. And the executive producers were forced to comply because he ended up becoming *the* face of the show as the most popular actor.

He nixed the original plan for the ""Holiday In Europe"" storyline to actually film the entire set of episodes on location in Europe, the entire cost of production being covered by the tourism boards of numerous countries, because it would've meant not going to church so they filmed it on an island off the coast of California instead.

He also had two actors kicked off the show. His first on-screen girlfriend was fired at his orders for featuring in Playboy and he had Perry fired for being an ""Agent of Satan"" due to his issues with addiction.

Cameron ended up getting the show cancelled because the executive producers found out that he tried to go over their heads in regards to a joke and directly complained to then-CEO of ABC Bob Iger as well as outright slandering them. They just said they were done producing the show, locked down the rights and moved onto other projects."
Restaurants on the Edge,"It was probably a blessing for Frasier too, she would have made a very different Roz. One I would not like to have seen."
Restaurants on the Edge,Cheers went off the air a full year-plus before Friends debuted on NBC.
Restaurants on the Edge,She also led Cougar Town on ABC (and later TBS). Great fun.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Fox saw the talent Matt was so they put him in another show, *Vinny and Bobby*. He was the same Vinny as MWC and TotH."
Restaurants on the Edge,"You can argue about where the others fall on the list, but Courtney is by far the most well known when that show started. She was in the first Ace Ventura movie which came out five months before Friends premiered. Her pre-Friends IMDb credits is also a lot longer than the rest of the cast which isn‚Äôt too surprising considering she is the second oldest cast member after Lisa."
Restaurants on the Edge,Kirk cameron never comes off looking good ever and it seems like everyone hates working with him.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Understood, it just feels like an old show whereas I've never thought of Friends as ""old""."
Restaurants on the Edge,He got blacklisted by Hollywood because his costar on Growing Pains didn't want much else to do with him. It's why he exclusively works in Christian media now.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Probably because an Irish bar with floor to ceiling dark wood hasn't been built in over 50 years, and coffee shops with couches in them are a 90s/early 2000s thing"
Restaurants on the Edge,"FX is the king of sleeper hits you wouldn‚Äôt have even considered   

I‚Äôll give any of their shows a try at this point."
Restaurants on the Edge,Oh shit it‚Äôs Lip from Shameless. That guy‚Äôs a damn good actor. Definitely down for a watch.
Restaurants on the Edge,"We found that one of the reasons we felt such anxiety the whole season is that you would have a phone ringing in the background nonstop. Like god damn, someone get the phone!"
Restaurants on the Edge,"*Yes, chef*"
Restaurants on the Edge,"So, like working in a restaurant?"
Restaurants on the Edge,CORNER!!!
Restaurants on the Edge,"""69 all day, Chef!""

\*edit\* it clearly shows here I wrote ""chef"" but for reason it came out ""boss"" ...huh"
Restaurants on the Edge,"Carmy‚Äôs jacked. If he spends all his time and energy at the restaurant, how is he so jacked?"
Restaurants on the Edge,"Great show I binge watched it in one sitting. Jeremy Allen White is exceptional, I hope this gets him more roles. Matty Matheson is my hero and plays a great part."
Restaurants on the Edge,That ending had me in tears. >!Everything after he made the connection with Mikey and the sauce cans was some of the best TV I‚Äôve seen in recent memory.!<
Restaurants on the Edge,"Let it RIP....You don't have to agree with me, but Jeremy Allen White's acting in scene where he talks about him and Mikey..is some of the BEST piece of acting I have ever seen"
Restaurants on the Edge,Agreed.   Episode 7 when the shit hit the fan ....reminded me  of my pharmacy when everyone wanted everything  at once. I left and finished the Episode in the other room .  This is almost like a less dysfunctional version of Shameless... another Jeremy Allen-White  program  that was on Showtime
Restaurants on the Edge,"This has been compared to Uncut Gems in terms of making the viewer uncomfortable and stressed. That was one of the first movies to incite that uneasiness in me. I'm not sure I am ready to do that to myself again.

*edit : After all your lovely comments I went and watched the first two episodes. Holy fuckballs. This show is absolutely fantastic. I.have no doubt the drama will be heavy as well when they get into the brothers death, but the pacing, acting and dialog are killer.

Thanks all for setting me straight! Might be my.second favorite show of 2022. I mean, Better Call Saul will always have my top prize. Although I am a bit biased because I got to film with Bob last year. Look for me in the Gene scenes in Ep 10, July 23rd ;)"
Restaurants on the Edge,"It's a great show, cousin."
Restaurants on the Edge,"Definitely one of the best things to come out this year. Short and sweet, they knew what they wanted to do and did it."
Restaurants on the Edge,Episode 7 gave me the only panic attack in my life that I actually enjoyed. Felt so real.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Its a really great show but I couldn't watch it.

Its like the other great show on FX is the old man, and that's like secret agent stressful, the Bear is like my shitty job stressful I can't deal. 

Great show, not for me."
Restaurants on the Edge,Brought back so much stress and latent PTSD from my line cook days. Love it. Favorite new show.
Restaurants on the Edge,My favorite thing is Hulu promotes the show as a comedy.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Ok, I thought it was just me and my anxiety issues that made this so stressful to watch.  I had to get up and pace because I almost couldn‚Äôt handle it.  I hung in there because Jeremy Allen White is SO FUCKING GOOD.  That monologue in the last episode.  Jesus Christ.  I‚Äôve been thinking about it for days."
Restaurants on the Edge,"For anyone who likes The Bear, I recommend a recent Stephen Graham film called Boiling Point.It follows the same 'nightmare day at work' feel in a restaurant, and is entirely done in one take."
Restaurants on the Edge,Lip just can‚Äôt get out of Chicago.
Restaurants on the Edge,Did anyone else get boyfriend vibes from Marcus and his roommate Chester? I feel like they are more than just friends
Restaurants on the Edge,"Wife and I binged the whole show on Sunday, it's great"
Restaurants on the Edge,Heard.
Restaurants on the Edge,"‚ÄúAny of you incel, Q-anon, 4chan, Snyder cut motherfuckers wanna get out of line now?!?‚Äù"
Restaurants on the Edge,This show gives me anxiety. It's somehow fantastic lol
Restaurants on the Edge,"Great show, but I don't get the ""cousin"" thing. I've never heard people call each other cousin like that. Is that a Chicago thing?"
Restaurants on the Edge,"As someone who has worked in restaurants for 10+ years, this is the closest a show has ever gotten to accurately depict what it‚Äôs like to be in the kitchen. Plus, Ayo Edebiri is a fucking star."
Restaurants on the Edge,"Episode 7 ‚Äúthe review‚Äù is the most amazing, loud, weird, and emotional and thought provoking episode on current tv. 
Highly recommended!"
Restaurants on the Edge,"It‚Äôs really quite a show.

I worked for a chef recently who came from the 3* world and the personality similarity is shocking. It really captures the feeling of some different parts of restaurant service amazingly, though there are some details that aren‚Äôt *quite* right.

I also lost my best friend 18 months ago and those notes have resonated pretty highly with me, I‚Äôve cried a few times in the first two episodes."
Restaurants on the Edge,This show is well done but I had to bail because it‚Äôs just so anxiety inducing to watch
Restaurants on the Edge,"One of the best shows anywhere right now. Just a great show that really gets your heart rate up. Totally know this family, totally understand the dynamics. Totally gets the work place. It's just too real that's what makes it so good. The writers, producers and directors need to be given a fuck ton on money."
Restaurants on the Edge,Episode 7 was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time.
Restaurants on the Edge,How does it compare to films like Boiling Point.
Restaurants on the Edge,Just wrapped it up in 3 days‚Ä¶it is genuine and an adrenaline ride. Loved it and would highly recommend!!!
Restaurants on the Edge,This show is really good! Have 1 more episode to go.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Man, I really tried to watch it.  The conflict is too stressful for me.  I don't understand why, as the rightful owner of the restaurant, he didn't threaten to fire all those disrespectful chucklefucks halfway through the first day.  Instead he just kept screaming ""Please!  Please!"" all the time.

When I correctly predicted some mobster type would show up to shake him down, because no way they wouldn't take the opportunity to add to the drama, I decided it's not for me."
Restaurants on the Edge,Still waiting to watch it in Canada
Restaurants on the Edge,"Unless you‚Äôre in canada and can‚Äôt watch it, even though it was advertised that you‚Äôd be able to."
Restaurants on the Edge,This is not the first time I‚Äôve seen this exact post title posted on Reddit. This is a paid spam/shill account.
Restaurants on the Edge,Article is almost unreadable due to the constant movement of the text as more and more ads get pumped onto the page. What a disaster.
Restaurants on the Edge,I want to give this show a try but I'm worried it's just misery porn.  Does it have levity and humanity or does it just leave you feeling bad?
Restaurants on the Edge,"I‚Äôve watched a few episodes and the acting has been terrific, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out the point? Like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the arc?  This might be like Mad Men. Everyone loves it, but nothing ever really happens."
Restaurants on the Edge,"Yeah I'm not sure who binged this. They're either stronger than me, or have never worked BOH."
Restaurants on the Edge,"This is funny bc my friend and I started watching it this weekend and 5 minutes in I said, ‚ÄúThis is giving me anxiety, I can‚Äôt watch it.‚Äù I just had to up my Lexapro. I‚Äôll give it a whirl after it kicks in."
Restaurants on the Edge,"I‚Äôm 5 episodes in. 7.5/10 for me so far, it‚Äôs good not great. Maybe that opinion will change by the end"
Restaurants on the Edge,I know what you mean. I really enjoy it but I‚Äôm tired after watching. It‚Äôs really intense.
Restaurants on the Edge,"If you love the character [Neil Fak (Matty Matheson)](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8274309/) do yourself a favour and check out his show ‚ÄòJust a Dash‚Äô on YouTube. It‚Äôs his hilarious and surreal cooking show that demands to be seen.

Restaurants on the Edge,Feels like I‚Äôm watching the Gallaghers all over again. Love it!
Restaurants on the Edge,Watched it in 2 days. I want 50 more episodes.
Restaurants on the Edge,"It‚Äôs a great show. We‚Äôll written and superbly acted. But I really have to give the entire crew props for their long camera shots and one shots. 

There are some really long scenes in this show without camera edits or cuts, whether it‚Äôs focusing on one character doing a several minute monologue, or in one case they do a 10-15 minute one shot following various characters around during the chaos of a dinner service, all in one take. From a technical perspective it is incredible to watch."
Restaurants on the Edge,Is this an ad?
Restaurants on the Edge,"Episode 7, that was filmed in one take, was honestly one of the best episodes of TV I've seen in a very long time. It was so stressful, but so absolutely brilliant. This whole series is stellar."
Restaurants on the Edge,Yes Chef!
Restaurants on the Edge,"It's basically just Lip running a restaurant that's also in Chicago, but it's so damn good"
Restaurants on the Edge,I tried to watch it. Too much for me. That's a compliment.
Restaurants on the Edge,"Just finished this last night. It is my personal opinion that this year, only Severance is a better show and even that's debateable. Just phenomenal television and I hope to see them get what they deserve this year come award season."
Restaurants on the Edge,The title give me have a stroke
Restaurants on the Edge,It‚Äôs Uncut Gems in a kitchen.
Restaurants on the Edge,I'm not from the service industry but a fan/musician into hard rock and punk and the most stressful part of the show is never hearing the rest of that Refused song.
Restaurants on the Edge,"loved this show, just finished it today..gave me flashbacks of working in the kitchen !!! Not for the weak"
Restaurants on the Edge,Episode 7 was one of the best episodes of the year easily
Restaurants on the Edge,It was just on the edge of too manic for me. If the episodes were any longer i couldnt do it.
Restaurants on the Edge,"After he sold his ragged denim for meat, had to turn it off."
Restaurants on the Edge,I am glad to hear it is not just me that found it stressful. I stopped watching though...it was too anxiety provoking
Restaurants on the Edge,Lol the title ‚Äúgive you have you‚Äù. Are titles hard OP?
Unstoppable,The Sandman
Unstoppable,"1st **Veneno** (2020; Atresplayer/HBO Max)

2nd **Severance** (2022; Apple TV+)

3rd **We Are Lady Parts** (2021; Channel 4)

4th **Pachinko** (2022; Apple TV+)

5th **The Queen's Gambit** (2020; Netflix)"
Unstoppable,"I would say Reacher. Really surprising action-thriller show, with fantastic pace, great cast, characters and the whole direction. I really enjoy the fort season and cannot waited for next one. It really reminds me Banshee.

Then Legend of Vox Machina also on Prime. Really funny animated fantasy series. And probably only watchable fantasy on Prime. Really good.

Pachinko, Apple did wonderful job with this Korean drama on which also worked Kogonada. 

Another really good stuff - How To With John Wilson, Dave, Mythic Quest, Perry Mason, Severance...

And then Andor. Currently the best live-action series from Star Wars Universe with really good atmosphere, and cast."
Unstoppable,I think it‚Äôs too early for severance. The first season was good but it feels like a lot of mystery/atmosphere and we don‚Äôt yet know if there will be a payoff. It reminds me like lost where the mysteries were more intriguing than the answers we eventually got.
Unstoppable,"Ted Lasso, Invincible, Yellowjackets, The White Lotus, House of the Dragon.

If we're including miniseries then 1883, Mare of Easttown, and The Underground Railroad."
Unstoppable,"So there's a ton I haven't watched, but my absolute favourite is Severence. I'm highly anticipating the next season.
Generally am more into sci-fi, horror and westerns so my lists are definitely biased that way.

**Other Great Shows in no real order:**

Ted Lasso (Fully expected to dislike this show, and was blown away)

1883

Outer Range (Great for the niche audience who like westerns and sci-fi)

Yellojackets

Star Trek: Strange New Worlds

Hunters

Mayor of Kingstown

Maid

Squid Game

Alice in Borderland

Mare of Easttown

Upload (Another surprise on how much I enjoyed it)

House of the Dragon

**Worth Watching**

Devs

Reservation Dogs

Unstoppable,"* I think **""Underground Railroad""** was great - but it's a mini-series/limited series, and that makes it somewhat easier to be consistent: the beginning, middle and end are SO clear, especially since it's adapted from a novel. (for similar reasons, I LOVE **""Five Days at Memorial""** and the not-adapted-from-a-source-material mini **""It's a Sin""**, but I'm insecure if they should be on best-of-the-decade lists.)
* if **""Andor""**s second half / second 12 episodes continue on this level of quality, I can absolutely see it making such a list.
* I understand that people love **""Severance""**, but I think the capitalism-as-religion-thing is too one-dimensional and trite so far and I'm not sure if a second season can be quite as good. I can see this going in the ""Lost"" direction: getting quirkier and more specific with each season, but losing some of the more... universal profoundness of the premise.
* and **""Interview with the Vampire""** was unexpectedly great so far, but I think it's too early to tell."
Unstoppable,"The list can change but what immediately comes to mind in no particular order is:

Station Eleven

Midnight Mass

Fleischman in Trouble

Reservation Dogs

Underground Railroad"
Unstoppable,"AEW Dynamite - premiered on Oct. 2nd 2019, so I'm going to count it just because it was just kicking off at the end of the year.

The Hangman Page saga that went the few years was great. The Pandemic Era took a moment to find footing, but it had some great matches, moments, and stories. The rise of the Redeemer, Kenny Omega's descent into madness, The Dark Order, Darby Allin's rise, the Cody-verse (results may very)

It has been a hell of a trip and there is weekly great action."
Unstoppable,"Ted Lasso

Unstoppable,"That '90s show, hands down."
Unstoppable,"Ted Lasso

I Am Not Okay With This

Why? Because I really enjoy them."
Unstoppable,Decade? No. Early 2000s had some good shows. Since 2010 nothing good ever happened. Wokeness took over
Unstoppable,"What I'm seeing is I need to watch more Sky Italia.  Is Anna really better than Station Eleven?  Because Station Eleven was great - not just because of the performance and production value, but the timing of its release made it even more impactful."
Unstoppable,"Ongoing shows:

Severance

We Are Lady Parts

Miniseries:

I May Destroy You 

Station Eleven

The Underground Railroad 

The Queen's Gambit 

Maid"
Unstoppable,"I had never heard of Veneno or We Are Lady Parts. They both look interesting, will check them out."
Unstoppable,"> Veneno

great pick... great pick. 

> Severance

I'd have to see with Severance. All the other shows I picked have self-contained stories... where as, they wouldn't necessarily need a 2nd season (though second seasons of Squid Game and Blindspotting are coming), but Severance is the kind of series where it all goes down the drain if they aren't able to give us a payoff that's both satisfying and makes sense. kno what i mean?"
Unstoppable,"I love Reacher so much, I end up regularly putting it on whenever I'm having a ""what do I want to watch moment"" and end up bingeing it within a day again."
Unstoppable,I'm hoping that Severance is the true follow up to Mr Robot that we all deserve. But only time will tell if that hope becomes a reality
Unstoppable,The Cody-verse insists upon itself.
Unstoppable,Is that the only show you‚Äôve seen?
Unstoppable,"Both shows are on the same level imo. But Anna is way more brutal and disturbing, so some people hated it because of that."
Unstoppable,We Are Lady Parts is really good and fun to binge.
Unstoppable,Yeah they really nailed the cast. I hope we can enjoy season 2 within this year.
Unstoppable,Channel 4?
Unstoppable,"I watched it on Peacock, I think?  Maybe Hulu?"
Unstoppable,"Jon Bernthal kills it as Wayne fuckin Jenkins, phenomenal performance."
Unstoppable,Jon Bernthal is so good in anything he does
Unstoppable,Friend of mine was a guard where Wayne Jenkins was held.  Said he was constantly in lock up because he kept scheming and getting caught in all sorts of shit.  Said he was a true asshole.
Unstoppable,"In a sense it's like The Wire because it focuses on multiple storylines and how the actions of civilians/drug dealers/politicians/police affect one another. But the core focus of the show is the police and their rampant abuse of those who they vowed to ""protect and serve"". It was infuriating but extremely fascinating."
Unstoppable,"Too many people I‚Äôve talked about this show with had no idea it was a true story and the main characters were all dead or in jail. The fact that it‚Äôs all true is the most important detail differentiating it from The Wire, imo."
Unstoppable,"The Wire is a masterpiece.

I say this as an Australian, I have no idea if it's an accurate representation or not.

Be interesting to see if this show is half as good."
Unstoppable,"I really enjoyed it.

It felt a little forced and preachy with those in power speaking to the solutions, but hey anything to convince the public and our leaders to end the war on drugs works for me."
Unstoppable,"Much different lens than The Wire with the social justice, feds, and civil rights angle on this series. I love how The Wire introduced a new perspective each season. This felt like an evolved extension of that."
Unstoppable,"HBO has a doc called The Slow Hustle, about Sean Suiter.  I watched it right after We Own This City.  Recommended for sure."
Unstoppable,Don‚Äôt want to detract from the horrible Baltimore cops but bernthal‚Äôs hair in this is a crime in itself
Unstoppable,WHERES MY WINE COOLER?!
Unstoppable,"Surprised this isn't getting more love on this sub.

Show of the year for me."
Unstoppable,"The DOJ scenes were absolutely horrible: they were pretty much all tell-not-show... and worse than that, they were frequently ""speeches"" to the audience.  

There were worse examples, but one that really tested my patience was the completely unnecessary scene where Nicole Steele told her and her brother's her story to Ahmed (I think end of episode 5?).  It got me thinking that if they had removed all the DOJ scenes, maybe they would have saved an hour?  Put in some Commissioner Davis scenes to tell his viewpoint and maybe one more homicide investigation by Sean Suiter to reinforce the citizens' point of view and you could have gotten across all the same messages by telling a story instead of lecturing the audience.

The writers just didn't trust the viewers.  A couple small non-DOJ examples: the two scenes involving jury selection: one was sufficient; and also the two primary investigators in court explaining  exactly what happened during the verdicts.  There were so many of these small bits that bothered me.

The rest of the show was great: the actions of the police showed who they were well enough... there was no need to lecture us.

Ultimately, IMO the show was, strangely, a disappointment despite a large majority of it being great."
Unstoppable,"The end text recap of the latest in Baltimore politics, after watching things unfold across 6 episodes delivered a TKO level of despair."
Unstoppable,"David Simon gave me Homicide: Life on the Streets

Andre Braughers best performance. 

He only makes amazing/important shows."
Unstoppable,Thanks for mentioning this show. I was unaware of its existence.
Unstoppable,It‚Äôs like the wire because it‚Äôs set in Baltimore.  The show is way different than the Wire.
Unstoppable,"Was talking to a buddy about the show after he watched it by my recommendation‚Ä¶ after realizing that this was all based on real events, he commented that any city with two HBO shows about corruption in two decades is probably pretty fucked up. Sometimes I have to wonder if it‚Äôs not a little exploitative. It hurts my heart to see how fucked up the citizens have it, but I also enjoyed watching the show. I dunno, maybe some good will come of this? Although I did just read an article about Governor Hogan‚Äôs billion dollar debacle with MDOT (negatively impacting black and brown people, naturally) so I don‚Äôt have a lot of optimism. 


On another note, Jon Bernthal is just so fucking good at being a total shitbag. He‚Äôs always good, but MAN. If he doesn‚Äôt get an Emmy I‚Äôll be disappointed."
Unstoppable,We Own the City was great.
Unstoppable,"I really got into this show, but I hated how things ended up for suiter. Seemed like it went from 0-60 for him, without a lot of introspection as up why. 

Hated hersl more than Jenkins.  

I wish there was an option to watch it chronologically, versus jumping around. That version of the narrative would have worked better for me, I think."
Unstoppable,I live in Baltimore and ‚ÄúWe Own This City‚Äù is an excellent recount of the Gun Trace Task Force and what they did here.
Unstoppable,"I got detained by BPD. I was driving for a mold remediation company. The owner is very wealthy and owns several companies. My trucks paperwork was in the one companies name, while the insurance was in another company name. Pig didn‚Äôt like the fact that the owner had it in different names and refused to let me leave until it was under one name! I asked ‚Äú is there a law that makes it illegal to own several companies in the US?‚Äù No. ‚ÄúThen what‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù Her reply ‚Äú You need to tell him to get his paperwork in order!‚Äù ‚Äú Ma‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt need to do anything. There is no crime here. You confirmed it.‚Äù She threatened to detain me as long as it takes. Wanted me to pull over in another area. I refused to move blocking a lane. Her Supervisor made her let me go. 45 minutes for nothing. BPD are idiots."
Unstoppable,Excellent show. Very claustrophobic. The worst of policing and also great systemic critique.
Unstoppable,"It was great. But then David Simon shows never disappoint me. 

I heard it was true story. Sick cast.

I love seeing the wire actors in it."
Unstoppable,Great show.  You can tell that it's just so disturbingly authentic.
Unstoppable,"For anyone interested, HBO released The Slow Hustle in 2001. It‚Äôs a documentary on the death of Sean Suiter, and it touches on the real life events depicted in the show. Seeing the real Hersl in action as well as the actual staged video of the safe opening definitely added context to the miniseries."
Unstoppable,"I enjoyed it. But I didn't like how much the timeline hopped around. It's one thing if they show the present then start at the beginning and work their way back to the present. Or even flip between two timelines. But they went way further than that. We'd get present day, then 2007, then 2013,  then 2008, then 2015, then 2007. It made it hard to follow. That can be a useful tool when you're building different story arcs. Like if we had a story arc where Jenkins boss influenced him to be corrupt it would make sense to hop around to see the moments where that happened. Or it would make sense to jump around a bunch to hide some big reveal. But none of that happened. The cops were corrupt the whole time. We just hopped around in time kind of arbitrarily. It was fine, but kind of unnecessary and confusing."
Unstoppable,I am an idiot and wasn't aware it was based on reality until the last episode. Kinda punches you in the face if you go in blind. Incredible
Unstoppable,Fucking Wayne Jenkins Day *slams Mike‚Äôs Hard Lemonade*
Unstoppable,"The Wire is also based on true stories. It was written by an ex cop from Baltimore IIRC.

Edit: he was a former police reporter.

Edit2: The idea for the show started out as a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner¬†Ed Burns, a former¬†homicide detective¬†and public school teacher."
Unstoppable,"Just moved out of Baltimore, lived there for three decades. They have good city cops, I‚Äôve met them, but they also have serious problem people too. Back in October they fraudulently gave every parked car on Barclay street a ticket for out of date tags ‚Ä¶ even though most of the people, including me, had in date tags with years left on them. You had to pay them because once three unpaid tickets got on the car they booted and towed it. You could appeal the ticket in city court if you took the day off work to fight it but you had to pay it first because by the third day they would tow the car for three unpaid tickets. 

I also had a homicide detective come to my door and incorrectly tell me they had found the body of my mother. I let him know I had just got off the phone with her and he was wrong. He just said ‚Äúoh, ok, sorry‚Äù and didn‚Äôt even ask me for proof, just walked away.

Also had to deal with getting arrested for a night and had a hit and run charge until the prosecutor dismissed it in court because I slid off an icy road and walked to a nearby house to call for a tow truck. There was literally no damage, my car was just stuck in the snow next to the road. Cop seemed chill and I told him what happened. Then he said ‚Äúyou hit the curb and left the scene, that‚Äôs hit and run right there.‚Äù

All of that was just this year too. Really happy I moved outta that city."
Unstoppable,"Happy Wayne Jenkins Day, motherfucker!"
Unstoppable,"""Jenkins robbed a midget stripper"""
Unstoppable,"Just finished this the other night, and was quite floored by it‚Äîhave been thinking about it for days. Very much in the vein of The Wire.

It seems as though Simon was only partially involved, having written a couple of the six episodes and likely helping getting it green-lit."
Unstoppable,"This show is great, it left me thinking about it for days after watching it. And Wayne Jenkyns is such a fantastic character, an incredibly believable piece of shit. Jon Bernthal was perfect"
Unstoppable,"Enjoyed it. John Bernthal delivers a tour de force. Worth watching if only for his performance

However, it is nowhere near the level of The Wire."
Unstoppable,"I love pointing out to random people that police departments are essentially powerful gangs that maintain control of the turf.

 In 1973 a gang within the LAPD called ‚Äúlittle devils‚Äù assassinated a journalist/civil rights activist by deliberately headshotting him with a tear gas can..

In 1985 the Chicago PD bombed and leveled a suburban neighborhood and killed kids because a cult leader wouldnt leave his house to come get arrested

and countless instances where departments fostered their own ‚Äúcliques‚Äù that stole and trafficked drugs"
Unstoppable,Anything Bernthal is in is worth watching for his performance alone.
Unstoppable,"Took me a couple episodes to get into it (it does jump around quite a lot) but holy fuck it was worth it.

Man that ending really made me feel hopeless for baltimore, and it's such a shame bc it's an incredible city."
Unstoppable,Brent Hal is absolutely amazing in this role. The show is fantastic.
Unstoppable,"I'm from the area, I live in the area and there were parts of the series that were really uncomfortable to watch for that reason. But I have the privilege of living out in the county. I can't imagine how painful it was for the people who these morons hurt."
Unstoppable,"Sheeeeeeeeeeet, nice to see a lot of alumni in this new show"
Unstoppable,And very disturbing. They‚Äôve been caught on multiple occasions planning drugs on people And then getting caught by their own body camera
Unstoppable,"If you liked the show, I recommend reading the book it‚Äôs based on as well.  Great book."
Unstoppable,And he nailed the Baltimore accent.
Unstoppable,"Could be pretty much anywhere really. Lots of movies and shows have been based on the LAPD‚Äôs sordid history of corruption, NYPD too"
Unstoppable,Jon Bernthal makes everything good.
Unstoppable,Dammit written by David Simon main actor Bernthal. Guess I have to watch it even though I hate cop shows. Except the wire of course
Unstoppable,Watched this last week. Outstanding show.
Unstoppable,"The Wire was based on true stories too. David Simon was embedded within the cities various departments to get the story straight. Book is called, ‚ÄúHomicide: A Year on the Killing Streets‚Äù and no, it‚Äôs not a warm-fuzzy kinda book."
Unstoppable,Isn‚Äôt that in most police departments?
Unstoppable,Great show
Unstoppable,"I enjoyed it quite a bit, but thought it fell way short of what the wire did. I love how open to interpretation the wire was. It really focused on showing and presenting questions about society rather than answering them. It had an overall point, but We Built This City just feels way too on the nose for me."
Unstoppable,"This is the first time I‚Äôve watched a Simon and Pelecanso TV show and thought it was kinda feckless and meandering. I appreciated what it was trying to do but the parts didn‚Äôt add up into a strong, cohesive story in WOTC the way they usually did in *The Wire*, *The Deuce*, *Show Me A Hero*, etc."
Unstoppable,And yet so many folks blindly still support the cops
Unstoppable,I hate when they add fake characters to shows like this one did. I honestly didnt really enjoy this show like I did the Wire
Unstoppable,I love this show but can get a bit preachy.
Unstoppable,I‚Äôm just glad to see bernthal working. Where do I watch this?
Unstoppable,This show was pretty good but I dont think in the same league as the wire or even treme...
Unstoppable,I love the wire and this feels tonally similar but I‚Äôm five episodes in and the story has not evolved beyond ‚Äúthese cops are pieces of shit‚Äù
Unstoppable,This show is good but hard to watch
Unstoppable,"IIRC The Wire is also based on real events. i think i've read that in Freakonomics...something about a journalist spending time with drug dealers and having access to their books, and thats how they got the stat about McDonalds workers making more money than drug dealers...and that journalist either wrote The Wire or his stories inspired it..."
Unstoppable,The Chicago Code was a great show.
Unstoppable,Every week something would happen on there and I‚Äôd say to myself ‚Äúno way that‚Äôs true‚Äù then I‚Äôd google it and the tv show is less absurd than real life.
Unstoppable,"He‚Äôll surely get an Emmy for this. On a side note, this is just one example of police being caught engaging in gross corruption. Just imagine how many cops have done the same, but have been blindly protected by their unions and management. These are surely not the only cops that have engaged in this kind of shit, they were just the ones that were greedy and foolish enough to get caught."
Unstoppable,"Love The Wire and enjoyed this show, but find it to be too didactic at times. There were tons of scenes with people sitting around talking about crime, politics, and police culture. It was all interesting but it didn‚Äôt feel like tv drama, felt more like a sociology lecture. Though it did illuminate how all the work that went into the report couldn‚Äôt accomplish anything due to city politics centering around budget deficits. So yeah, interesting stuff, but not quite as riveting as I had hoped."
Unstoppable,Um. The wire is all based on true stories as well.
Unstoppable,was the wire not based on true police corruption in baltimore
Unstoppable,Too much politics stuff. More of the police corruption would‚Äôve been nice to see.
Unstoppable,"‚ÄúBased on‚Äù is a very loose term with plenty of room for creativity. 

And The Shield did this based on the Rampart Division in LA."
Unstoppable,These tv shows seem to suggest that Baltimore sucks. Is that the case?
Unstoppable,If anyone you know has any doubts about the validity of the BLM movement then recommend this show to them.
Unstoppable,Decent adaptation of a true story. Overall felt the show was underwhelming - a lot of talking heads in rooms.
Unstoppable,"Watched the first episode, felt like preachy trash. Found the dialogue extremely forced and it beats you over the head with it's meta narrative.

This is nowhere near The Wire's quality."
Toy Boy,"Things worth noting:

- It was an excellent second week for Inventing Anna. After a middling first week (7.7 million) it got the equivalent of 19.5 million complete viewings in its second week. That brings it in line with the best weeks of Netflix hits like Cobra Kai, The Witcher, and Emily in Paris. Though those shows did two weeks of that type of number rather than just a single week. It performed similarly to All of Us Are Dead!

- All of Us Are Dead (44.2 million), In From the Cold (12.8-14.5 million), and The Woman in the House (39.3 million) completed their 4 week run that Netflix loves. Two of the bunch were big hits. In From the Cold‚Ä¶not so much. Both the other shows topped the 4 week total for the latest season of Ozark (35.3 million). Impressive stuff! 

- Sweet Magnolias and Raising Dion chugged along in their third weeks with 3.5 million and 3.3 million complete viewings respectively. Not bad but neither show are big hits. I‚Äôll be super interested to see if these middling ratings performers are going to do good enough for a third season renewal. 

- Space Force s2 and Young Wallander s2 failed to chart in their opening week. Which meant less than 3.4 million for Space Force s2 and less than 2.7 million for Young Wallander s2. Pretty poor for both! It shows why the performance of shows like Raising Dion and Sweet Magnolias might be good enough to stick around! Murderville failed to chart again on week 2 meaning it got less than 3.3 million. All flops. 

- One of Us is Lying got 2.4 million complete viewings week one in the charts. Not bad for a show that is not on in its biggest market (The US). 

- Cuphead was a big winner! I did not expect it to pop up in the charts due to its tiny runtime but thanks to the fact it got 5 million complete viewings in its first week it made the chart! 

- Both Fishbowl Wives (2.8 million) and Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire (4.7 million) charted in their opening weeks. Pretty solid for Devotion! I‚Äôd expect a drop second week though as both got an unusual Monday release. 

I never did the numbers for Love is Blind but it is clear the show is another reality hit for Netflix. 

Vikings: Valhalla is the big release to look out for next week. On the foreign language side we have another South Korean show in Juvenile Justice to look out for as well as Fame Game from India."
Toy Boy,Space Force only came out on the 18th. I assume it will be on next week.
Toy Boy,It would be nice if these numbers were adjusted for the length of the show. A half hour show with the same amount of episodes as a full hour show has to get twice as many viewers to get on these lists.
Toy Boy,"Its crazy to me that Inventing Anna is doing that well. The source material is great, but the execution is a disaster. I'm happy for Anna Chlumsky tho."
Toy Boy,"None of that appeals to me at all, glad I cancelled Netflix. I'm even a cuphead addict but I'm not going to support that garbage."
Toy Boy,You are getting downvotes but I agree with you. I‚Äôd rather they gave the equivalent completions data. I‚Äôve calculated a bunch of that data myself and included it in my own post. The viewing hours metric absolutely favours shows with long run times.
Toy Boy,"You‚Äôre being downvoted but there are literally only 2 shows here which have above average critic scores. Most of them don‚Äôt even have reviews lol

This is why I don‚Äôt like how people get defensive when someone complains about the quality of Netflix material. Sure they produce the same amount of good stuff as other streamers, but it‚Äôs frustrating when they do so despite releasing so much more content than other streamers."
Toy Boy,Thank you. I've been paying for Netflix for 10 years but 3 weeks ago let it cancel and my wife hasn't even noticed yet. She prefers peacock or even Pluto tv with tons of ads.
Toy Boy,"Things worth noting:

- It was an excellent third week for Inventing Anna. Week three (13 million) beat week one (7.7 million) and that is still pretty rare for Netflix shows. It is a sign of good word of mouth. It has racked up the equivalent of just over 40 million complete viewings over three weeks and should hit around 45-46 million by the week four mark. That will make it a decent hit for Netflix and have it just behind stuff like Cobra Kai and Emily in Paris and about level with All of Us Are Dead. 

- It was an OK opening week for Vikings: Valhalla. It got the equivalent of 11.9 million complete viewings. That is solid. If it jumps week two we can consider it a hit. 

- One of Us is Lying got 5.2 million week two. Pretty solid considering it is not in the US domestic market. It beat stuff like Space Force, Murderville, and Young Wallander comfortably and those shows were everywhere! It has been a solid pick-up. 

- Space Force s2 finally charts with 3.8 million week two! Pretty awful. This must be headed for cancellation. It cannot be cheap to make with the talent involved and it gets beat by limited region buy-ins like One of Us is Lying and animated shows like Cuphead! 

- Raising Dion s2, Sweet Magnolias s2 , and Dark Desire s2 wrapped their 4 week run with totals of 20.2 million, 17.7 million, and 15.4 million respectively. Solid but unspectacular for the English language shows but pretty impressive numbers for Dark Desire! 

- Cuphead exceeded expectations again by growing from 5 million week one to 7.2 million week two. It is definitely a surprise hit! 

- Terrible start for Juvenile Justice. It just got the equivalent of 1.6 million complete viewings opening week. By far the worst of any post-Squid Game South Korean original by a large distance and easily being beat by licensed weekly shows like Forecasting Love and Weather and Twenty Five, Twenty One both of which only released their opening couple of episodes. 

- Two new foreign language shows Fame Game and Back to 15 failed to chart opening week putting them below 1.8 million and 3 million respectively. Not a great start for either show though they probably did not fare much worse than Juvenile Justice!  

- Fishbowl Wives and Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire chart again but with 1.9 million and 2.6 million they are definitely not big hits. 

- Poor Young Wallander s2 joins After Life s3 and Murderville as rare English language shows that just fail to make the charts. 

Overall it looks like viewership at Netflix was down this week on the whole compared to previous weeks. Mostly thanks to shows like Space Force, Young Wallander, Disenchantment, Murderville, and Juvenile Justice all flopping and not holding or gaining any decent numbers. 

Next week Pieces of Her is the big English language release to look out for in the charts with Midnight at the Pera Palace, Lies and Deceit, and Savage Rhythm the non-English titles due for release."
Toy Boy,"Vikings is at number 1 now. It was released on the 25th (end of the week) which is presumably why is 2nd here.

Agree about Space Force, but wish it was higher up as I really want this to continue. Guess it depends on what the budget was."
Toy Boy,Almost done with Inventing Anna. What a Bullshit show that wastes so much time getting to the fucking point. This should be 4-6 hours tops.
Toy Boy,"Things worth noting:

- All of Us Are Dead held well in its third week on the chart and was the top TV show of the week not only by viewing hours but by the far more relevant complete viewings metric. It pulled in the equivalent of 9.3 million completions this week. It has more viewings in three weeks than the latest season of Ozark managed in four weeks. It has been a big hit for Netflix!

- Inventing Anna had an OK start but nothing special. It got the equivalent of 7.7 million complete view in its first week. It will definitely do better week two but how big the jump is will be crucial for how successful this show ends up being for Netflix. 

- Sweet Magnolias (6.9 million) and Raising Dion (5.6 million) both did OK in their second weeks but are not trending to be one of Netflix‚Äôs more popular English language series. Sweet Magnolias second week increase was a little disappointing while Raising Dijon‚Äôs week two decline was also a bit disappointing for it. Both have performed OK over the opening few weeks so I‚Äôll be interested to see if that is considered good enough for renewal or not by Netflix in the coming months. Sweet Magnolias in particular does not look an expensive show to produce. 

- The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window has been an excellent performer for Netflix. It got the equivalent of 6.5 million complete viewings in its third week. That puts it at around 36 million total over its first three weeks in the charts. That is good! Netflix finally have a hit comedy and unfortunately it was a limited series! 

- In From the Cold just made the list in week three with 2.4 million complete viewings. It has been one of the worst performing English language shows of recent releases. A few comedies like After Life and Murderville failed to chart but for all we know might have performed better. The charts do not favour shows with short overall runtimes. 

- Dark Desire s2 had a decent second week with 5.1 million complete viewings but Toy Boy s2 had a quiet opening with just 2.4 million completions in its opening week on the chart. Until Life Do Us Part, a Portuguese dramadey, failed to chart in its opening week. 

Space Force s2, Young Wallander s2, and One of Us is Lying are the big English language TV shows to watch out for next week while in the foreign language category we have Devotion: A Story of Love and Desire, Fishbowl Wives, and Secrets of Summer all hoping to make an impression on the chart!"
Toy Boy,"I always expect these ""top watched shows"" correlate with whatever Netflix wants on the frontpage. Like, back when I had netflix the most watched was often the one highlighted. It's not really that much of a surprise. Like, take a terrible show/movie and put it on the frontpage + tell everyone that this is the most watched show/movie = profit."
Toy Boy,Season 2 of Raising Dion was......Interesting
Toy Boy,"All of Us Are Dead is a hit and Sweet Magnolias looks like a solid mid level performer for them 

Disenchantment Season 4 flopped, for a returning veteran show I expect at least one solid week in the top 5. It didn't even show up on the other Netflix top 10 thing.

In from the Cold and The Silent Sea are the most DOA of new Netflix shows of the last few months"
Toy Boy,Thanks for the break down.
Toy Boy,I think just throwing up various minutes watched for various length shows with world wide viewer data is already munging things up enough that it's impossible to tell what actually is and isn't popular.
Toy Boy,"The Silent Sea performed decent enough. It got the equivalent of around 15-17 million complete viewings over four weeks in the charts. Nothing special but better than a lot of shows. The big negative for The Silent Sea is the fact it was the least popular of the 4 Korean shows that have followed Squid Game. D.P, the Korean show that released before Squid Game, got renewed with a 4 week viewership of under 9 million. Though it is fair to say it was not as expensive to produce as The Silent Sea. 

For perspective Narcos Mexico s3 got 13 million over the same timeframe. Locke & Key s2 got about 18 million. After Life s2 got around 7 million. Lost in Space s3 got 18 million. Archive 81 got around 18-20 million. 

All is not lost for The Silent Sea!"
Toy Boy,I agree.
Toy Boy,"Maybe. My method is to track by netflix top 10 (giving 10 points to #1, 9 points to #2), since I started tracking in December Silent Sea is my lowest ranked new show of the ones that made it with 5th on its debut and then off the chart. In from the Cold did 9, 6 then off, Bebop had 2, 9 then off."
Toy Boy,"Tracking by viewing hours or equivalent views (my favourite metric of those available) is far more relevant than tracking by Top 10 points. If only because where you land in the Top 10 can vary by competition but viewing hours and equivalent views are solid regardless. 

Which is to say some weeks the 5th placed Top 10 show or movie could beat the best in another week. Just depends on when a popular run of shows come along. Unfortunately for The Silent Sea it got released alongside four of Netflix most popular shows of the last 6 months in Money Heist, The Witcher, Emily in Paris, and Cobra Kai. Those shows were absolute monsters and that made an OK performing The Silent Sea look bad by comparison.

Bebop was a massive flop by every metric. It only got around 10-11 million complete viewings. Even In the Cold is going to beat that!"
Toy Boy,You appear to be using global which is also why you have the total hours viewed and why shows like Emily in Paris do better than in my ranking where it is more of a mid level success. I am using US.
Toy Boy,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn‚Äôt on your list, but I guess it‚Äôs not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler‚Äôs List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Toy Boy,Interesting to see containment show up.
Toy Boy,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don‚Äôt matter for them at all.
Toy Boy,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Toy Boy,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Toy Boy,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Toy Boy,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it‚Äôs clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Toy Boy,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Toy Boy,Damn didn‚Äôt realize Ozark hadn‚Äôt been renewed yet
Toy Boy,How about movies??
Toy Boy,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Toy Boy,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Toy Boy,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Toy Boy,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Toy Boy,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it‚Äôs great
Toy Boy,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Toy Boy,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Toy Boy,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Toy Boy,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Toy Boy,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It‚Äôs bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúJohn B‚Äù and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Toy Boy,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Toy Boy,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Toy Boy,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."

Toy Boy,Pandemic boost

Toy Boy,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Toy Boy,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Toy Boy,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Toy Boy,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Toy Boy,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."

Toy Boy,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Toy Boy,[deleted]
Toy Boy,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Toy Boy,"I feel like Nickelodeon came up with the tween concept with SNICK. Clarissa Explains It All, Alex Mack, etc.

In the 90's, for the most part, Disney Channel was mostly cartoons and black and white movies (Elvis)."
Toy Boy,Dear Diary
Toy Boy,">Point is, I feel like there has always been kid of a lack of a between ""Kids stuff"" and ""Teens stuff"" in media, and that ""tween"" over time, just started becoming an excuse to let 8 year old girls pretend they're teenagers.

LMAO that you're singling out girls. Beyond that though, your post - for all its effort - feels rather ignorant; the ""tweenage"" target audience has pretty much always been around, what corporate calls it shifts every few decades because marketing to children, more so than any other group, shifts radically with their social interests.

When you're making something for kids, basically everyone knows you have to stratify it more intensely than other age groups because the minds of pre-adolescent (or tween) children vs. a kid in the early and middle stages of childhood are vastly different. Shit like ""Nanalan'"" made for kids still going through early childhood, might appeal to someone still in the middle stages of child growth; but isn't likely to offer much to a preadolescent who, by then, is going to want something more directly stimulating and engaging to their mind.

And yes, it's largely just a naming scheme to better market to that specific group. What do you think does better in reaching their target audience? A TV block aimed at ""preadolescent children"" or ""Hip Tweens""? And you get it in every age group, not just the tweens. A lot of teenage media is focused on treating the viewers how they want to be treated; with respect, like they're small adults capable of making their own decisions and that their parents are just boring and don't get them. That kind of shit flies way better than ""cartoons for adolescents""

The in-between stage of development between childhood and adolescence is literally pre-adolescence, that 9-12 demographic who are at that point in their life where they do tend to be leaving their old toys and games behind and rushing towards more ""adult"" interests as their personality starts to shape and bodies and minds develop. When you complain that it's just ""an excuse to let 8 year old girls pretend they're teenagers""; my dude, that's literally what most preadolescent kids want - to be older and treated like they're older because they're starting to feel like they're not a kid anymore, while simultaneously not quite being *there* yet. It's why media aimed at them tends to be soft ball versions of more ""adult"" media - sitcoms and the like."
Toy Boy,Disney basically took what Nickelodeon was doing and combined it with something like Saved By The Bell.
Toy Boy,Great writeup!
Toy Boy,Nick got the concept started. But Disney effectively built an entire network around it that eventually became one of the company's biggest cash cows in the mid-late 2000s.
Toy Boy,"It sounds like in some places you just missed the point entirely. 

Jet was a character designed to morally challenge the main characters. His motivations, hatred of the Fire Nation, were correct, but he went so far out of his way that regular people were being put in harm‚Äôs way. It makes our main characters re-evaluate their conflict and their own actions.

Aang‚Äôs blue tattoo isn‚Äôt because he‚Äôs an Avatar, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs an air nomad, and most people really don‚Äôt care to notice him. Whenever they go into enemy territory, where people *would* recognize him, especially towards the end when he goes to the Fire Nation, he wears a disguise or hides himself.

Zuko and Azula‚Äôs character arcs are really well done by the end. Azula went completely crazy as a result of wanting to be desired and praised by her father (which was never going to happen), and Zuko learned to move beyond hatred and anger and found forgiveness in his heart. He finally moved past his own self-hatred like Iroh pleaded with him to. Their final Agni Kai isn‚Äôt just a big explosive action scene, it‚Äôs representative of an internal battle for Zuko, as he‚Äôs fighting against someone that is as ruthless and angry as he used to be. Katara saving the day & helping Zuko is also representative of her finally forgiving him instead of resenting him for what he had done. They finally became true friends in that moment. 

Both Zuko and Aang‚Äôs stories are mature. Aang‚Äôs people are dead, he‚Äôs a child, oh and by the way he‚Äôs been told his whole life how he has to save the world or else it‚Äôll die. He acts childish as a coping mechanism for the unbelievable stress of being ‚Äúthe chosen one‚Äù at age **10**.

Sokka‚Äôs plans are oftentimes stupid and don‚Äôt work at the start, hence why nobody listens to him. His entire character arc is learning to be a good soldier, but an even better leader. By the end of the show, his plans work and are even the key to saving the day a number of times. He *is* the comic relief character, but it‚Äôs because he has to learn to grow up and stop ‚Äúplaying‚Äù soldier. By the end he is a mix of funny and serious in a way that he wasn‚Äôt before.

The magic system IMHO is liked because there is no ‚Äúbest power‚Äù. Every power is balanced, powerful, and yet weak when confronted with other factors, and even the most powerful abilities like lightning-bending are extremely dangerous and could kill the user. It‚Äôs also a visually exciting system as it combines magic & martial arts, leading to visually stunning moments.

Finally, the finale of the show is literally the culmination of everything it‚Äôs set up. Aang has finally mastered the elements, and Ozai is in his most powerful state thanks to Sozin‚Äôs comet, which is always how the show was going to end from day one. The ‚Äúlife-bending‚Äù from the Lion-Turtle isn‚Äôt a deus ex machina, it‚Äôs a skill the character learned in an earlier episode that was not shown to the audience to make for a great reveal. If Aang had life-bended without the island episode & Lion-Turtle setup, then it would‚Äôve been a deus ex machina. Furthermore, his taking away of Ozai‚Äôs bending is hugely impactful, because he finally found a way to stop him without killing him, as everyone told him he was supposed to do. Life-bending itself isn‚Äôt without consequence either, TLA & Korra both show that it is a grave and irreversible punishment, but it shows that Aang has grown to be mature enough to accept that he has to do what needs to be done, but does not need to go overboard. 

You don‚Äôt have to like it, everyone is entitled to an opinion, but to post this haughty word salad of a post on here and then to tack on the ‚ÄúI can name ten animated shows far superior‚Äù at the end just makes it seem like you‚Äôre farming for outrage. Like it or don‚Äôt, but don‚Äôt come on to Reddit and act like you‚Äôre some trailblazer for having an opinion."
Toy Boy,It's pretty good for being a kids cartoon
Toy Boy,"I used to think it was overrated too.

Then I watched it."
Toy Boy,Its actually one of the best written cartoons of all times with an extremely well thought out story arc that incorporated a rich backstory with characters with clear motivations that is very hard to duplicate. Almost every character and location is a full fleshed out idea and could be its own show.
Toy Boy,"I‚Äôve seen it mentioned that Combustion Man didn‚Äôt stop because by that point it was personal. Having lost a group of kids twice already he wanted to take them out. 

An Earth bender could have taken out the Fire Nation capital, but perhaps they want minimal collateral. Fire Nation works just take everyone out, but that doesn‚Äôt mean other nations would. 

Admiral Zhao vs the fish. They were the moon and the ocean spirit. They‚Äôd taken on a physical form on Earth so by killing the moon spirit, Zhao effectively broke the moon and water bending. 

Wood is not a bendable item. That was the whole issue with that jail cell

Azula had hinted in The Island (or whatever the episode was called) that there were skeletons in her closet where she says my own mother thought I was a monster. Then there‚Äôs the whole party scene that happened where she opens up to Ty Lee. After The Day of Black Sun she comes after Zuko. You can argue there that she has begun to slip. Then there‚Äôs The Boiling Rock where she loses Mai and Ty Lee and then Sozin‚Äôs Comet where the one person she had also leaves her. That all leads into her paranoia and her collapse

Jet was being blinded by his hatred for the Fire Nation, going after the innocent. His crew were trying to tell him that sometimes you should let things go. Katara and Aang were too naive that she trusted him when she shouldn‚Äôt have

The Great Divide wasn‚Äôt that good. However, spiders in real life can climb vertical objects. Avatar doesn‚Äôt have real life animals in it (other than the Earth King‚Äôs bear , Bosco) so who knows what they can do. Also, you‚Äôre complaining about realistic physics in a show where bending and spirits exist

As for Ozai, didn‚Äôt they have a whole scene where they realised the guy is just a normal looking dude from his baby photo. That was probably to show that anyone can end up a bad guy. The episode where there was that dance party was more of the same really. Showed that not everyone in the Fire Nation is bad.

Downvote guy and the turtle was pulled out of nowhere

Katara did ruin the Agni Kai but I‚Äôve heard it said that by attacking Katara, that‚Äôs where Azula lost. She broke the rules

Which of Zuko and Aang‚Äôs story is childish? One deals with genocide and the other abuse. Nothing childish here"
Toy Boy,"You raise some good points. For example, the deus ex machina ending is definitely a popular criticism of the show. It helps that Korra does a good job using it, and it fits into the themes of Atla. But it's definitely a valid criticism.

What isn't though is the vast amounts of minor nitpicks you have about the show. It's not that it's exactly bad to have them, but they take up too much of your argument, they are really minor details that every show has, and especially a lot of them can easily be explained in the show itself. 

The wooden cage criticism is especially bizarre. The fire benders know it's prisoners are earth benders. It makes complete sense to lock them in there for the time being. That season has also shown many times that other nation bender's live in the fire nation. So I'm not sure why you're confused they have wooden cages. 

Boom man is another example. I'm not sure how more obvious the show can make it that he has a personal vendetta again the gang. 

For future reference I would stay away from nitpicking. It's really hard to do correctly and just weakings your overall argument.

Also you should definitely try checking out Korra it's in my opinion a way better show. While the overall show is not as consistent as Avatar. It does a lot of more interesting things in its characters and plot than Avatar ever attempted."
Toy Boy,Hello 30 yo guy who just found out Avatar.
Toy Boy,"Eh, I'm a fan of Avatar and I think it's overrated. In terms of children's cartoons (90% of which are trash & have no thought put into them), it's the GOAT, but I don't think it's the best show ever made. I don‚Äôt even think it's a masterpiece."
Toy Boy,">  I can name 10 right away that are far superior.

Yes, do that, at least this post will give me a watch list then."
Toy Boy,"I agree with you in regards to comedy, it falls in to those constant anime tropes. That was my only criticism."
Toy Boy,"I enjoyed it. It was definitely a kid's show as you never truly felt that the main characters were in peril.

You're right about Azula's turn to crazy being a 1 episode thing - it came on fast like in Game of Thrones when Dany turned evil for reasons to wrap up the show.

I still enjoyed it for what it is."
Toy Boy,[deleted]
Toy Boy,"Most of this is so wrong lol. But I‚Äôm only going to address the Azula part. She was starting to lose it even before the finale. Once Mai and TyLee betrayed her she became increasingly paranoid and stressed. So much to the point her bending style changed. Notice as early as the southern raiders she started using closed fists when firebending. She never did that anytime else prior, it was always two fingers. Also, her facial expressions and the things she was saying were definitely out of character. It progressively got worse until she started hallucinating and then having a full breakdown after losing in the finale.

You‚Äôve seemed to have missed A LOT of detail in this show overall and made some very bold statements that indicated you didn‚Äôt really pay attention or understand a lot of the episodes or characters.For example somehow you think Sokka was supposed to be the equivalent of a comedian. No, Sokka was cringey as hell and downright awkward. He wasn‚Äôt mean to be actually funny lol. Or even questioning why combustion man didn‚Äôt stop when Zuko ordered him too‚Ä¶. like dude Team Avatar had already injured him by that point and it was personal. Besides, the fire lord would‚Äôve rewarded him far more than Zuko ever could have. 

Therefore, I don‚Äôt think your judgment can be accurate. Also‚Ä¶ Appa didn‚Äôt fly super fast across the avatar universe. It took them weeks on end just to get from the northern air temple to the northern water tribe. But your opinion is your opinion I guess. And.. that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to touch out of your essay lol."
Toy Boy,"I think they HAD to be able to look at the eclipse, so that they could know when it was about to end and be prepared for the fire nation soldiers getting their powers back.

It's about knowing how much time you've gt in such a critical mission."
Toy Boy,"I guess you are right about Jet but he should've been in series longer or atleast his death should've had more impact.

And I can see your Katara not listening to Sokka, but he has had great plans too.

Katara had already forgiven him, there was an entire episode dedicated towards that, that doesn't justify the moment she stole from Zuko and my problem isn't that Azula became crazy but she did it in like one episode, having authority can possibly make her crazy but not so fast.

I know Aang's childish he's 10. I'm just saying the feel and tone of his story doesn't flow well with Zuko's many times.

Yeah still not a fan of bending, Earth Bending just felt way too OP for me.

Spirit bending is dues ex machina, It literally fits perfectly in the definition of a dues ex machina, Aang has a conflict what do we do? Conveniently gets a power that allows him to win without killing Ozai, not only has Aang already killed before this conflict just came out of nowhere. Aang didn't went out to learn it or anything, he just was swept away and he got it from the turtle, he just got it. Keeping it a surprise doesn't make the moment better. Just because we saw scene with Aang & lion turtle doesn't mean it's not a Deus ex machina anymore.

Here's a video that might explain it better 
https://youtu.be/jdBnR_Dx4ow

And farming for outrage really? Anyone with different opinions than you is farming for outrage now? I literally gave the positives of the show at first and never called it a horrible show, even if I had I can have my opinion that a show is garbage or a masterpiece, and I literally gave reasons on why I think it's overrated unlike what people at r/unpopularopinions do"
Toy Boy,"Yeah I agree, but it's not one of the best shows ever, it isn't even one of the best animated shows imo"
Toy Boy,I used to think it was great. Then i watched it and didn't like it.
Toy Boy,Opposite for me
Toy Boy,"I watched twice(One alone, one with my girlfriend), yeah is one of the best cartoons produced ever in America, but that shows how bad the system is.  


Personally, I wouldn't say is a 9.2 in imdb, maybe a 8.5 at most, but even stuff like regular show is better than Avatar."
Toy Boy,If this is one of the best written cartoon there must not be that many great cartoons then
Toy Boy,"Combustion man was literally doing that for money and Zuko told him he'd pay more.

Jet was a good character that could've been fleshed out so much more, he just died and no one remembers him now.

Wood isn't bendable but you are in """"fire"""" nation, do you still don't get the problem?

IDC what Katara did that was Zuko's moment, not hers. Didn't Zuko just learned a pure form of fire bending? So that shouldve been used.

Zuko's story is mature while Aang's story is childish, they are just having fun meeting fun characters and occasionally running in problems.

The turtle thing and his conflict just came out of nowhere."
Toy Boy,"That's the thing some shows or stories try bigger and more ambitious things and fail in parts but does many things right, I'd take that way more than a show perfectly going from a to b predictably

And how more accurate can show than boom man is against the gang? Let him say Zuko screw your money, I'm gonna kill them that's it.

Yeah some of the points really are small but I did also say about big things like disappointing characters"

Queen Sono,"Disappointing. This show definitely had potential and you could see that everyone involved in the production put in a lot of effort. At the rate they are cancelling shows, I‚Äôm left wondering what Netflix is thinking."
Queen Sono,"Oof, another instance of Netflix cancelling a show, having previously announced another season."
Queen Sono,"I wish if they were gonna keep doing this, they'd just give us more like Haunting of Hill House - one season, only meant to be one season, perfectly contained in that one season. 

I know for me, their library of original shows canceled after one season isn't really enticing me to keep subscribed. I'm not sure why it would invite anyone who isn't already subscribed to then do so."
Queen Sono,"yup, it also ended on a cliffhanger which is an even bigger ""yikes"""

Queen Sono,Netflix is so 'diverse' now they can't make anything anyone will watch. Hence all the competition coming. 
Queen Sono,"Ah yes, Netflix, where you legitimately cannot find a show that doesn‚Äôt make white people look bad in some way. I challenge anyone reading this comment to find one show or movie on Netflix that doesn‚Äôt make out white people to be: crazy, very stupid, violently psychotic. 

Do it. I‚Äôll wait. People are paying to be brainwashed. "

Queen Sono,"It's a good enough example. None of us have to play nice with this dipshit and waste our days combing through the vast libraries of media to find the one that will pass all the appropriate purity tests he'll inflict upon this argument as time goes on. Narcos has obvious depictions of good guy white people, so therefore his entire premise is countered. "
Queen Sono,"Nitpick, but Israel isn't in africa.."
Queen Sono,Is that really a nitpick? It seems like a pretty weird mistake rather than just a detail
Queen Sono,"That's not nitpicking, its called an expectation, that people know basic geography"
Queen Sono,"Its not nitpicking. Of all the countries in the world, its the one that owes the most of it fame to where it happens to be situated."
Queen Sono,just checked the map n ur right it's just outside africa. im a dumbass my bad.
Queen Sono,OP comes from an alternate universe where Israel never gave back the Sinai Peninsula.
Queen Sono,"This is how Netflix described it:

[First Netflix Original Series in Africa to star South African actress Pearl Thusi](https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/first-netflix-original-series-in-africa-to-star-south-african-actress-pearl-thusi)"
Queen Sono,Suddenly those jimmy Kimmel videos make more sense
Queen Sono,"Idk man, America being in America also says a lot.

The UK geographically is also kinda important right now with all the brexit stuff."

u do realise that is a pretty big deal right? ....."
Queen Sono,How is it a pretty big deal they are people not some super being. I have been constantly saying it shouldn‚Äôt matter about race it should matter if it is a good show or not
Queen Sono,"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/netflix-orders-first-french-original-728789


https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/1983-netflix-first-polish-original-series-launches-november-30th-2018


https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/australia-s-first-netflix-original-is-finally-here-but-don-t-let-that-fool-you-20181214-p50mfh.html

God forbid you describe a show as what it literally is."
Queen Sono,"Do you just live in your own little community not knowing about the rest of the world and its history or something? lol. 

But please note, this is not about race (though the series is about Africa so naturally it does get racial), this is about the progression of a continent that have been very overlooked when it comes to film & tv, and it is about Netflix's advancements to tap into that market, because no one else has. 

So yea, it was heavily marketed as the ""first African Netflix original series"", the same way Tidelands was marketed as their ""first Australian original series"" because that's what gets a lot of people interested or at least curious. 

Sometimes in cases like these it doesn't even matter whether the series is ""good"" or not, you still gotta appreciate the progression to represent Africans and their culture in film and tv on a worldwide stage. But the series is quite good though, very ambitious, you should check it out, [i did a write-up on it a month or so back](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fbzuml/queen_sono_netflix_first_african_original_series/)."

Queen Sono,I had was hoping OA would get a season 3
Queen Sono,Glow for sure bothers me. Daybreak was fun and definitely santa Clarita diet
Queen Sono,"I'm not sure what you expect. From shows i've personally watched on this list, Altered Carbon, Luke Cage, Age of Resistance - they finished their current arcs. They might not have Big Finale, but they don't leave some main plots unresolved. Cage and Iron Fists were also cancelled due to Disney pulling their license. Glow got  kinda fucked and got cancelled due to increasing costs of production under COVID regulations. Mindhunter (i assume you mean Netflix production without  *s*) stalled production due to Fincher overthinking everything and moving to other projects.

A lot of best shows in history doesn't have Big Finale. They just... End, and the life continues after cameras are shut down. It doesn't make them in any way bad. Just not every story need Endgame as a finale to tie everything up in neat package. 

For clarity  i would recommend moving all non-originals on the bottom of the list."
Queen Sono,"Deadly Class isn't a Netflix show.

October Faction got cancelled though."
Queen Sono,"My take: very few shows stick the landing. Most shows have to stop, because the audience lost interest, usually because the quality dropped far enough. Why should their finale be anything memorable/mind blowing now? If nothing sticks with me after a series ends, it might as well end on a cliffhanger. Of course I'm sad about premature cancellations of shows I'm currently watching, but it isn't the first and won't be the last time. And when I'm sad about it, then it means it at least entertained me enough to care."
Queen Sono,"Kim's Convenience The last episode they put the lights out, that is not a ending?"
Queen Sono,"I can't do a list, but I know for a fact that I Am Not Okay With This was cut off at a clifflhanger, but to me it still felt quite satisfying. I hope I helped a bit ^^"
Queen Sono,"If it‚Äôs not a Netflix Original, it‚Äôs not a Netflix show. Take them off the list lol. This thread‚Ä¶"
Queen Sono,"I love this subreddits Netflix hate boner‚Ä¶ how is this a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù for the service?  Networks have canceled shows forever, good and bad, the only difference here is that those mainly disappear from a catalog and Netflix has them there still.

This isn‚Äôt a new practice.  Maybe the idea of this thread isn‚Äôt a bad one, but it‚Äôs phrased in the same overly dramatic way anything about Netflix is posted here."
Queen Sono,"If you're going to put Iron Fist and Luke Cage on here, you could put all of the other Marvel shows (Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones) on here too. Although I'm not sure they fit as neatly because generally all of the Marvel shows did have resolution to their season plots, just left some foreshadowing for the next seasons open."
Queen Sono,Insatiable
Queen Sono,"Daredevil

The Get Down - it had an ending, but it was clearly very rushed and the fates of certain characters were never revealed

Dogs of Berlin - Netflix never announced a cancellation, but it‚Äôs been 2.5 years since it was released and the final episode was inconclusive"
Queen Sono,Crazyhead
Queen Sono,Friends From College.
Queen Sono,Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
Queen Sono,Hemlock Grove had an ending.
Queen Sono,Is altered carbon worth watching without a true ending? I was *just* about to start binging it.
Queen Sono,"I'd love someone else's take, but I wouldn't say Designated Survivor fully had an ending. Netflix took over in Season 3, and then cancelled it."
Queen Sono,"Thanks for adding Messiah, that show was shockingly smart"
Queen Sono,Everything ends brother
Queen Sono,"Probably Glitch Techs, but it still hasn't been officially announced as cancelled."
Queen Sono,It's Bruno does not fit on this list. The first season was very self contained.
Queen Sono,I think you'd be better off with a list of finished shows. That would be very short list.
Queen Sono,The Mist?
Queen Sono,"You have to define what you mean by *ending*. I would not consider many shows on your list, e.g Mind Hunter, need an ending."
Queen Sono,Omg guys calm the fuck down. Its just words its not gonna hurt you. go out and touch some grass or some shit
Queen Sono,[deleted]
Queen Sono,V wars is apparently cancelled
Queen Sono,Sense8 ever get a real ending?
Queen Sono,Tidelands and Altered Carbon.
Queen Sono,Cursed and Jupiters Legacy
Queen Sono,Gypsy
Queen Sono,"4400. Not a Netflix show but being streamed there. Got cancelled just as it was getting good.

Also The Beauty and The Baker. Again, not a Netflix show but streaming."
Queen Sono,"Sword of trust. Actually a great movie, until suddenly it ends very annoyingly & with no real resolution.

I heard that a woman who directed & wrote it died, & that's very sad but releasing it without a real ending was a total bummer."
Queen Sono,"La Revolution and Black Spot

Still salty about those two."
Queen Sono,You could be meta with The OA and say that they're in our world lol
Six Windows in the Desert,Has there been any news on when is City Primeval airing? I think it is unlikely that it will air in Spring now since it will miss the Emmy deadline.
Six Windows in the Desert,"I'm in the middle of my re-watch right now! Just as good as the first time around.

*We dug coal together.*"
Six Windows in the Desert,Already on CTV app for free
Six Windows in the Desert,"Uh it‚Äôs on Amazon Prime now in Canada. 

Source: am rewatching it now."
Six Windows in the Desert,"Pro tip: if your seven year old starts saying to your mom ""Grandma June, as I live and breathe,""  your D+ parental controls aren't set up right"
Six Windows in the Desert,"*""Just* ahead of?"" Where does this come from? No release date has been announced, and while I don't think ""Decades ahead of"" is likely to be true, ""Just ahead of"" is ridiculously misleading. So ... clickbait, right?"
Six Windows in the Desert,"Good news for Canada, awesome show."
Six Windows in the Desert,"I wish we could get more seasons of both Justified and Santa Clarita Diet, I need more Olyphant in my life."
Six Windows in the Desert,"Justified season 1 to season 6 are there in amazon prime guys 

Check it out!!"
Six Windows in the Desert,"Primeval?
     
Transmat firing!"
Six Windows in the Desert,Shut up and take my **streaming** money!
Six Windows in the Desert,Why would they only put it on Disney+ in Canada?
Six Windows in the Desert,Great show but the last season is pretty bad.
Six Windows in the Desert,The first few seasons are great but the show gets very repetitive
Six Windows in the Desert,[deleted]
Six Windows in the Desert,Next ones coming faster
Six Windows in the Desert,I look at the original Justified TV show on wiki and it says the ratings are only about 2 million but it seems to be very popular. Why the low ratings ? And does such ratings justify a revival?
Six Windows in the Desert,I hope they add Justified even in Europe to Disney+ alongside The Americans and Sons of Anarchy. (or Man Seeking Woman). But I am really looking forward to this one.
Six Windows in the Desert,Probably end of the year/end of summer.
Six Windows in the Desert,"‚ÄúThere is still a sizable amount of money missing.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow sizable, Raylan?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell over ten dollars.‚Äù"
Six Windows in the Desert,That is my favorite line
Six Windows in the Desert,And on FX on demand but not for long I fear with exclusivity contracts and all it would be so nice if they could share between providers and not not just lock it behind one single source.
Six Windows in the Desert,I've been watching it for the first time. I'm on season 6 now and I'm going to miss this show once it's over. It's also on the CTV app.
Six Windows in the Desert,Don't meet many 7 year olds who are Aunt Helen fans.
Six Windows in the Desert,"Won't lie, I read that like Raylan was saying it"
Six Windows in the Desert,We've had it on prime video for some time already. We weren't lacking.
Six Windows in the Desert,"I'm not one for reading the article, but the title implies we're very close to getting new justified episodes?"
Six Windows in the Desert,I heard he‚Äôs in the new Daisy Jones show?
Six Windows in the Desert,Also on the CTV app for people who don't have prime.
Six Windows in the Desert,"It's on Hulu in the US, like most of the Disney-owned ""adult"" properties.

Edit: Also it's an FX show, and that's where they keep the FX stuff."
Six Windows in the Desert,Wish it was Disney+ in the U.S. would love a rewatch but not spending more on another streaming service
Six Windows in the Desert,Everyone's entitled to their opinion but I'm not quite sure how you managed to arrive at yours.
Six Windows in the Desert,"I feel like the opposite is true, and it starts a little repetitive but finds its footing?"
Six Windows in the Desert,Do you mean first few episodes? Because it becomes anything but repetitive
Six Windows in the Desert,Disney+ in Canada also has Hulu content since we don‚Äôt get Hulu up here. Plenty of FX shows end up on there. It‚Äôs pretty great.
Six Windows in the Desert,"seems to be what they're doing in most places, putting everything on Disney+. whereas in the US, aside from the Marvel TV shows (Daredevil, Jessica Jones and such), they put the 'adult' stuff on Hulu instead"
Six Windows in the Desert,"eh, that's nothing really out of the ordinary for a show on cable tv these days. everyone here (rightly) loves Better Call Saul and that averaged barely above 1 million viewers in its final season. those numbers don't factor in people watching shows on streaming services or whatever"
Six Windows in the Desert,"""Well if I had that kind of money I would be in Mexico.""

""Boyd, I've been to Mexico and I don't think you'd like it...""

""And how's that?""

""Because there are a lot of Mexicans."""
Six Windows in the Desert,"My friend. 

You‚Äôre in for an amazing finish. 

And rejoice cuz some of us have felt it‚Äôs absence for so so many years. 

Now it comes back and he‚Äôs finally gonna deal with Detroit and the villain they cast is Boyd Holbrook and Tarantino producing it from an amazing source book. 

I have missed Raylan for so so long. 

He‚Äôs Dixie Batman, his rogue gallery is almost as good as Bruce‚Äôs."
Six Windows in the Desert,"Yes, but it is one off miniseries, I would love more seasons."
Six Windows in the Desert,"> Daisy Jones 

never heard of it, thanks for the tip

looking it up seems like a smaller role though"
Six Windows in the Desert,Its crazy for the longest time you couldn‚Äôt find it in any major streaming site same as The Americans. That why I think both shows became a bit forgotten about.
Six Windows in the Desert,"oh we dont have hulu in nz so hopefully it comes on d+ here (although tbh it could be on there already and i just haven't checked yet, but if not hope it does)"
Six Windows in the Desert,"It's not Disney owned show. It's made by Sony, for FX."
Six Windows in the Desert,You can get Disney+ for $2.99 if you have Hulu.
Six Windows in the Desert,I havent seen the show in quite some time. I just mean that every season is a new baddie that raylan has to get
Six Windows in the Desert,"It starts off as a case of the week, procedural before slowly switching to a more serialized arc.   I always figured it was always intended to be more serialized but they had to ease into it to get everyone on board."
Six Windows in the Desert,I believe Tim said in an interview never say never about them doing more in the future. I think he's always open to it anyway.
Six Windows in the Desert,"Haven‚Äôt watched yet, too bad :( I‚Äôll just continue along through season 4 of my justified rewatch."
Six Windows in the Desert,"i know The Americans was on Amazon Prime for a pretty long time until recently moving to Hulu. i *think* that might've been the case for Justified, too"
Six Windows in the Desert,You‚Äôre right. I meant that Disney had the license for streaming and didn't clarify my original comment after the edit.
Six Windows in the Desert,Disney owns FX
Six Windows in the Desert,That's more than zero dollars.
Six Windows in the Desert,"Well, considering the main character is a LEO then what else could the show be about?"
Six Windows in the Desert,It was. Both were on Prime for a few years before switching to Hulu.
Six Windows in the Desert,"Yeah I know. But Sony is the official distributor of that show. They make it for FX but at the end of the day, they hold international rights for the show. Looks like a licensing deal between Disney and Sony is allowing this show to be streamed on Disney+ in Canada. Justified has been licensed to Prime Video where I live."

Six Windows in the Desert,The irony of Station Eleven potentially becoming a forgotten piece of media is hilarious
Six Windows in the Desert,I remember damage.
Six Windows in the Desert,"Loved the book, loved the series."
Six Windows in the Desert,You **must** watch *Station Eleven* before Zaslav ghosts it. Amazing show.
Six Windows in the Desert,"He also explains his side of the weird DVD/Blu Ray situation - Viacom/Paramount did a random made-to-order run a while ago, featuring a hodge podge of ""uncurated"" deleted scenes, but nobody involved with the show were aware this was the case until afterwards. Paramount then ""helped them out"" and removed some things they didn't want out there, which seems to refer to a few scenes being made available on Yahoo when the discs were released. 

Somerville managed to buy 4 sets of DVDs himself, but they are now sold out and reading between the lines it seems unlikely another run will be made - contrary to what's said there, they are not currently available for another round of preorders. In fact not even all the orders were fulfilled in the first place, and the Blu Rays were BDRs, with faults reported with the 4th disc in many sets. 

(So incidentally if you did get a working set of discs with those deleted scenes, you've got quite a rarity, because they're probably not going to show up again *anywhere* ever again)

The bottom line is though that he does seem concerned the show might be another casualty. 

So if you haven't seen it yet, *now is the time*, because I would bet all the money I wish I could have spent on a Blu Ray it's going to vanish. There's even a Christmas theme!"
Six Windows in the Desert,"Until Zaslav, nearly every show HBO produced for decades has been available (the exceptions were risqu√© shows like Real Sex and Cathouse)."

Six Windows in the Desert,Post-pan and pre-pan kids is so relevant.
Six Windows in the Desert,"> ‚Äú**TV world is very weird right now,**‚Äù the writer and producer noted in a social media thread that highlights the topic from a creator‚Äôs perspective.


> Somerville said that a DVD of his Paramount TV Studios-produced series was now available even if the creative team had been ‚Äúcaught off guard‚Äù by its appearance. 

> ‚ÄúThe only way to really ensure shows remain available is that they generate too much interest (and completion) for anyone to justify removing them,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚Äú**If you take anything from this thread, take this‚Äî even the people who make shows have no fuckin‚Äô idea what‚Äôs gonna happen tomorrow**, just like the execs who passionately fought for them for years have no idea if they‚Äôll be employed tomorrow. That runs all the way up to the CEOs.‚Äù


Long live the DVDs!"
Six Windows in the Desert,"Watch this show if you haven't. One of the best miniseries ever. Seriously. Its on the level of Chernobyl for recent comparisons, frankly its probably better than that too. 

Content wise, I guess something close to compare it to would be Lost and the Leftovers (at least for parts of the show), part of the show has a Lindelof vibe, but also goes in a very different direction for many other parts. Lots to love. For anyone wondering about ""cancellation"" or anything, this is miniseries and fully complete story."
Six Windows in the Desert,Could they play it in the middle of Lake Michigan because I would walk across the frozen lake for this watch party.
Six Windows in the Desert,The definitive scripted Covid-19 series.
Six Windows in the Desert,"To me this TV show was, in a way, equivalent to Cormac McCarthy's The Road.

By that I mean it made me think a lot about things I hadn't considered before experiencing it, and they are both pieces of work that I routinely remember and think about."
Six Windows in the Desert,God the dude running HBO max is a DICK
Six Windows in the Desert,"I'm surprised how many people think the kids/mines thing didn't go anywhere - the whole last episode is Kirsten trying to avert a repeat of it. 

She hears Captain Nutcase rambling about ""the beacon"" summoning the kids, but doesn't know what it means until she sees the tower blow up. Once it burns, she realizes hundreds of insane kids with landmines are on their way and there's going to be a bloodbath unless she thinks of some way to defuse them. That's her whole focus in the finale.

The reason we see Miranda's last act at that point is because Kirsten is unconsciously following in her footsteps in trying to save everyone in the airport."
Six Windows in the Desert,"This was the best show I‚Äôve seen in years. It is honestly incredible. The music, the editing‚Ä¶I cried multiple times. 

High high high recommendation if you haven‚Äôt seen it."
Six Windows in the Desert,"It‚Äôs insane that this is a very strong possibility.

I assume it would move to Paramount+"
Six Windows in the Desert,I‚Äôm I the only one that thought that show was just okay?
Six Windows in the Desert,"If you like station eleven, try to find Anna, a post apocalyptic show with a similar poetic vibe. I actually liked it better than station eleven. It's a limited six episode series, adapted from a book by its own author. I don't know how good of a writer he is but judging from the show he's an amazing adapter and director

It's an Italian import. I think it was on AMC+"
Six Windows in the Desert,"I was just looking for new shows to watch that were supposed to be good and I may have missed. This one came up a lot and very glad I watched it. It's crazy that I never heard of it before now, I'm sure I could have just missed it but it did feel like this didn't get much attention. I know the entire show works as a whole but I will say I was much more interested in the past than the present."
Six Windows in the Desert,I want this on blu-ray
Six Windows in the Desert,"How close is it to the book? I was planning on reading the book first, but I might have to go against my rules and watch it right away."
Six Windows in the Desert,"Logically, I know that the Mojave desert is a place. But my brain refuses to accept that and I just picture this guy making a mod to play the show on loop in Fallout New Vegas."
Six Windows in the Desert,JEEEEEEEEEVAAAAAAAN
Six Windows in the Desert,Such a gorgeous series
Six Windows in the Desert,Great book and fantastic adaptation.
Six Windows in the Desert,Great show
Six Windows in the Desert,I would actually pay money to keep this show forever. It was THAT good. Top 3 best shows I‚Äôve ever seen.
Six Windows in the Desert,"I really disliked the show, so many unlikeable characters and the one charismatic one only appears in the first ep"
Six Windows in the Desert,‚ÄúThank you for walking me home.‚Äù
Six Windows in the Desert,I thought it was beautiful.
Six Windows in the Desert,"Favorite series of 2022 (technically began in December 2021 but whatever). Such a beautiful series, such wonderful music. Same composer who scored *Beasts of the Southern Wild*, I recognized it immediately. 

Just a truly beautiful example of storytelling, and incredibly fulfilling."
Six Windows in the Desert,"God damn, they better not cancel that, too. I *loved* the series. And I just started the book the other day and am loving that, too."

>In the follow-up movie, Monk, a brilliant San Francisco-based detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder, returns to solve one last, very personal case involving his beloved step-daughter Molly, a journalist preparing for her wedding.  

  
>Series creator Andy Breckman is writing and executive producing the film, with Shalhoub executive producing in addition to starring. Randy Disk, who executive produced the series and directed nearly three dozen episodes, will direct and executive produce the film.

>Shalhoub, Ted Levine, Traylor Howard, Jason Gray-Stanford, Melora Hardin, and Hector Elizondo are set to return"

Followers,It‚Äôs a jungle out there
Followers,Awesome!  I am happy to see they‚Äôre getting a movie.
Followers,I hope that's a working title
Followers,I love Tony Shalhoub so much. I wonder if Monk will be as OCD as before because at the end of the series he wasn‚Äôt. I hope they don‚Äôt kill off the step daughter that would crush him.
Followers,I love the idea of seeing Adrian and the gang again but that title has me concerned.
Followers,"Damn I thought I had all the time in the world to rewatch the series and then finish the last season which I missed at the time. I'd start now but Im already rewatching Futurama to prepere for that revival. I guess this is an odd modern dilema to be in. Finishing shows before their inevitable revival comes out.

On that note, with how fun the Psych revivals are, I really wish Peacock (I think it was them) didnt completely destroy the 30 Rock reunion with far too many in universe ads"

Followers,"I used to watch Monk with my grandma when I lived with her for a few months. We both loved it. She recently passed away a year back, but I will definitely be watching this thinking of her."
Followers,I never for gave the series for firing his original costar because she didn‚Äôt even ask for pay parity but for a raise commensurate with the amount of work she does for the series and they decided to fire her rather than just pay her more money like she was entitled to

Women of Mafia,"This article is a lot of words but not a lot of information. Of the parts of the article that have numbers they are all statistics, which are sometimes used so they don‚Äôt have to tell the whole story. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a 40% increase in viewership!!‚Äù But what does that mean? 40% of what? Furthermore, the other half of this article just random rambling which gives away his worldview beliefs, so not super objective."
Women of Mafia,Unprecedented in that they are now broadcasting women‚Äôs sports.
Women of Mafia,"the reason why women sports in general are not watched a lot compared to men is so very simple. how many women do you know who watch womens sport on tv?

just look at how many women watch reality tv, like temption island, big brother, the voice , ex on the beach etc. if all those women started watching womens sports, you would have surge. but as long as that does not happen. women sports will never be as popular on tv as male sports. 

so the question is. why do women not watch women sports so much?"
Women of Mafia,"Nah.

Outside of very rare occasions, women's sports, excluding tennis, have basically zero viewership. They get some when people leave their TV on ESPN is all they can hope for.  No company is willing to pay for the rights to the sports, the women's leagues can barely even give away distro rights. There's no money in it from a TV perspective.

Hell the WNBA finals ratings are like a 0.4. 8 hour Spongebob reruns destroy it.

Oh yes its up, but its easy to go higher when your start is so low."
Women of Mafia,I‚Äôd rather watch a Netflix series about the WNBA than actually watch the WNBA
Women of Mafia,even women don't watch women's sports
Women of Mafia,"I tell you what I don't watch many sports but to any blokes out there looking to follow some women's sports, I've found the pole-vaults and long jumps pretty amazing.

Womens MMA is mad too."
Women of Mafia,"Good shit. Watched the Liverpool v Chelsea WSL game yesterday, was a good match."
Women of Mafia,"I'm a big hockey fan and I remember this commercial that basically said it is sexist to say women's hockey is boring. I think that is total bullshit because there is the CHL (Canadian Hockey League) that doesn't allow people over the age of 20 to play, I also find that boring so does that make me agist???

About this article, if people are watching it should get more air time and the athletes should be paid accordenling"
Women of Mafia,"I don't watch much women's sports on TV, mostly college volleyball and softball, and some pro and college basketball, but for my money, women's sports is much more fun to watch than much men's sports programming.

Well written article or not, this is nice to hear."
Women of Mafia,"Oh, more than one viewer"
Women of Mafia,I bartend at a sports bar. And my opinion is no they aren't. Occasionally we will have someone ask to put on their colleges women's team during end of the season tournaments that's all. Never once had a customer ask for a WNBA game
Women of Mafia,That is happenning because original production is falling. Female sports are good filler. African soccer on brazilian television is similar and reaches a supririsng amount of audience.
Women of Mafia,Which I great. Just don‚Äôt expect me to watch it just beacause it‚Äôs female. The quality of play just isn‚Äôt on par.
Women of Mafia,"All men here patting themselves on the back for their ""sick burn"" comments for God knows what reason. 

Women's sports are making decent strides and will continue to make progress with our support, and that's what I'll do - support. I love it when we're all winning. 

I know the numbers are nowhere close to men's, and it's fine. It's incredible to think that just a few years ago, where we are today itself would've been unthinkable. I also realize that men enjoy a physical advantage over women and will always demonstrate more raw power, but that doesn't take away the fact that women possess the sporting skills just the same. With training and support infrastructure, they'll get better. 

Cynical men who revel in chiding others are fit to do exactly that and absolutely nothing more. They're most certainly not on the same level as these women who fight everyday."
Women of Mafia,"Im sorry but this is a farse, yes more viewership but its a small percentage and mostly because volleyball was moved to a prime channel. The article doesn't have any specifics."

Women of Mafia,Good to see. Everyone should be given a chance to succeed.
Women of Mafia,Women soccer it‚Äôs just not good
Women of Mafia,These MFers broke the precedent!
Women of Mafia,Why not! They are incredible athletes. Another reason is that with mens sport demanding more and more cash for broadcasting there is more money to be made in womens sports right now.
Women of Mafia,"American womens sports like the WNBA seem to have made a mistake in creating their own teams, instead of just having a womens version of a mens team. You get so much more baked in support."

women' football is really not a great watch to me, I love their enthusiasm but the abyssal difference in agonism, athletic level and quality doesn't make for a compelling watch. That's not to say men's is ultra exciting, it's been sucking for years"
Women of Mafia,"the male sports fans in these comments are the EXACT reason why women don‚Äôt watch or participate in sports as much. literally nothing but snide cowardly remarks that hold no truth in reality. here are some quotes i‚Äôve seen from *top comments*

‚Äúunprecedented in that they are now broadcasting womens sports‚Äù
‚Äúwomens sports lacks star power, strength, and explosiveness (??? in what world)‚Äù
‚Äúthere‚Äôs a reason why women don‚Äôt compete against men in tennis‚Äù

every single thing either completely opinionated and untrue, not based in reality, or just straight up sexist. im not entertaining any dude that‚Äôs gonna disagree with me, im not replying to anyone. argue with the wall, you are the problem."
Women of Mafia,Well yeah their good athletes and make amazing plays and do tremendous things. It also turns out when you put attractive fit woman in small to semi small outfits people will watch it.
Women of Mafia,"That's because men's sports have become so god damn boring.

It's all about numbers and stats now, even though an athlete could do better, doing less actual improves their stats and gets them to the finals. The brad pitt & jonah hill movie, Moneyball, is about this.

Women's and minor leagues have become hugely popular in the past 5 years or so, and the reason most people give is what I said above; when they're not so good at it that they can still make mistakes, it makes it interesting, and human. It's not like watching the stock market anymore."
Women of Mafia,"I think the women‚Äôs divisions in the UFC are a unique example where women have a chance to be seen by as many people as the men, given the fact that the pay per views are usually stacked with a few women‚Äôs fights each time. I typically don‚Äôt watch a lot of sports, especially women‚Äôs, but I am an avid fan of women‚Äôs UFC, and think the number of people who would also claim so is steadily rising."
Women of Mafia,"A couple years ago I started subscribing to the WNBA's League Pass, and I ended up latching on the the Aces (mostly thanks to Shea Serrano, lol), which turned out to be good timing since they won everything this year. Yeah, some teams aren't that fun to watch, but the Aces (as well as Seattle and Chicago) had some legitimately talented teams with serious ballers. The Aces were hella fun to watch, with their high pace style of play (thanks to Becky Hammon). Even though they only play 10 minute quarters instead of 12, they still averaged over 90 points a game and were legitimately entertaining. I'll be re-upping again next year."
Women of Mafia,"Doubt it, audience wise"
Women of Mafia,Doubt
Women of Mafia,"I think there's a problem where some women's sports are wildly more entertaining to watch than others.

Women's MMA seems to lose almost none of the physicality or technique of the men's game, so I enjoy watching it.

Women's football looks like you have 22 players with half the physicality and a third of the technique of the men's game. I don't know why but that's what it looks like.

Also: Almost no bloody women watch sports. And even those that do seem to ingore the women's game. 

I'm already at my maximum capacity for football viewing. I'm not going to replace some of it with qualitatively inferior content."
Women of Mafia,very nice advice
Women of Mafia,"I will say, women‚Äôs boxing has been getting a lot of love lately. I don‚Äôt have the stats, but I don‚Äôt remember hearing about it much, growing up. Now you got big fights and stars in women‚Äôs boxing."
Women of Mafia,"There's been an insane push for women's sport, football especially. 

No one wants to tell the truth that women's football is essentially bankrolled by income from men's football. Even the women's teams of top premier league sides actually attract a few thousand viewrs a week, paying something like a tenner at best.

Meanwhile men's teams for the same clubs bring in 40 to 70k per week, paying closer to 10x the price for tickets.

Don't begrudge women wanting to succeed in sport, but the attitude from women athletes and many who promote it fucking stinks."
Women of Mafia,Shhhhhh......
Women of Mafia,"Your comment is really confusing to me. 

> Of the parts of the article that have numbers they are all statistics

This sentence doesn‚Äôt make sense.  You might as well have said, ‚ÄúOf the part of the menu that include cheeseburgers they‚Äôre all sandwiches.‚Äù

The ‚Äústatistics‚Äù are what the whole article is about.I think you‚Äôve taken attacks on news so deeply you don‚Äôt understand when valid news is presented to you. They have several bullets of factual information you‚Äôve completely dismissed because someone has convinced you you that statistical data isn‚Äôt valid or something?

A ‚Äú40% increase in viewership‚Äù means that 40% more people are watching per event than used to. That‚Äôs the *what*: ‚Äúviewers‚Äù. The fact viewership has gone up is what matters. You don‚Äôt need to exact number, the hypothesis wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄúX people will watch‚Äù it was ‚ÄúMORE people will watch,‚Äù and that‚Äôs what happened.

The article has a ton of information, and backs up its claims with multiple stats across multiple channels. It‚Äôs strong article with valid numbers and reasoning. Your comment being the top comment is ridiculous. You‚Äôre wrong, not just about the article but about what a valid argument looks at all.

I mean, I get it. It‚Äôs an article about legislation to help equality working. If that gets out we might keep doing it..."

Women of Mafia,can you imagine the laughing stock i‚Äôd be if i tried to talk to the average male sports fan about *womens sports*? you can‚Äôt be serious. we are laughed out of the room basically every time it‚Äôs mentioned.
Women of Mafia,"> so the question is. why do women not watch women sports so much?

And a bigger question, what's stopping men from watching women's sports?"
Women of Mafia,I did some googling and I guess the most recent women‚Äôs NCAA title game drew 4 million. That doesn‚Äôt seem too bad even though the men‚Äôs games get more.
Women of Mafia,I would like to add Women‚Äôs MMA and Women‚Äôs Tennis seem to pull the most numbers. Interesting that a lot of it is individual sports over team ones
Women of Mafia,Today it was the WNBA finals and I doubt it pulled more than most of the games on NFL Sunday. The sports are getting more popular that's a fact but not at the levels they are usually bragging about. Many of the sports have a lot of their revenue come from the demand of their TV broadcasting rights but no one is really fighting for those in the female side of things.

Women of Mafia,"Maybe people wouldn't have to revel in your struggles if you showed some humility. But considering what most male sports fans hear: that they're pieces of shit for not supporting women's sports and how it's racist or whatever to not be entertained by the quality of play you often see in women's leagues, they're entitled to be smug. Women's sports fans are constantly smug and rude yet deserve respect."
Women of Mafia,the self loathing feminist male has spoken
Women of Mafia,I am Cynical enough to know the large push is because betting companies have realized they can enjoy a nice double dip.
Women of Mafia,"So, by this logic........there's no reason for anybody to watch college-level sports. And high school sports, much less have any passion for it.

Women of Mafia,"That's a good point, as well.

The names they have feel like when you go to the grocery store and they have the store brand version of a popular soda or cereal.

Those 32 original team names took years and years of repeating to the point where they feel normal to the average viewer. And its really hard to think of cool team names, in general."
Women of Mafia,That can also prove annoying. If I'm in the pub watching my team and get a notification that Villa have beaten City 4-3 it can take me sec to work out what universe I'm in. Though that's probably more the fault of the reporting.
Women of Mafia,"I‚Äôd rather watch Sunday league football then the mens game. The game has to stop every five minutes because someone brushed their shin on the other players leg and we have to watch them scream on the floor for a while, all while his teammates are crying and screaming about how awful the whole situation is and then start crying tears of joy when he jumps up and makes a miraculous recovery worthy of Lazarus."
Women of Mafia,"I would bet that the Qatar numbers are going to dwarf that, no problem. Even a game that hasn‚Äôt got England playing."
Women of Mafia,"I mean the examples you gave are both based in reality and proven true. ""there‚Äôs a reason why women don‚Äôt compete against men in tennis"" 
Top ranked women tennis player lost to ranked 203rd male player. 

Watch professional women soccer and you can see how poor they are at basic stuff especially the defense and goalkeeper. 

You can say that women sports need support which I also believe but to deny reality in order to shore support is dumb and turn people off. I love watching women's badminton rather than men because the rallies are longer and it's more exciting rather than just jumping smash all day long in the men's game. But to deny that there's a difference in strength and explosiveness in women sports is hilarious."
Women of Mafia,"what do men's supposed snide remarks have to do with women not going to stadiums or watching female sports? Stop ascribing everything that doesn't work in a woman's world to men, it's a truly pathetic way to see life"

What do you mean by that, if I may ask?"
Women of Mafia,"Most premier League clubs lose money, as do lower levels so the women's game has huge financial issues to overcome especially as it's starting with low crowds"
Women of Mafia,The advertising is getting so fucking annoying. In the UK before every EPL match Sky/BT do an intro advert for the upcoming women's football matches and still barely anyone watches them. I'm almost certain if they created a channel dedicated to women's football it'd be going off the air in 2 years time.
Women of Mafia,"I‚Äôm not begrudging women or hating on them for wanting a fair shot. But keep in mind, you‚Äôre talking about European sports and I‚Äôm specifically referring to American female sports. The fact that what you‚Äôre describing, this same issue, is happening in two distinctly different markets, cultures, and countries is a big tell.

And for anyone thinking I have an agenda against women I assure you I do not, just the political aspects of how this is used. The article even discusses how American female soccer league ‚Äúfought for equal pay‚Äù. Your comment hit the nail on the head! A large part of a leagues revenue (regardless of the sport) comes from the viewership of watching live games and re-running prerecorded matches. Since this whole discussion is about fairness, is it ‚Äúfair‚Äù for the male and their league to pay more in the name of fairness that isn‚Äôt actually fair? The face value this looks like pay discrimination, but like most things, once you peel back the onion and dissect the situation then the real story emerges. But also like most things, people wanted the female leagues to earn more because of feelings, not because of facts."
Women of Mafia,You and me both! I know I‚Äôm not supposed to speak out about things that are ‚Äúuniversally accepted‚Äù but when it‚Äôs bullshit you‚Äôve got to
Women of Mafia,"20 million people watched Sport A last year. A 40% increase would mean 8 million additional viewers.

1,000 people watched Sport B last year. A 40% increase would mean 400 additional viewers.

These are wildly different numbers. You understand why you need to know the baseline when dealing with percentages?"
Women of Mafia,"Don‚Äôt fully agree with your take. Giving percentage increases isn‚Äôt very valuable when you don‚Äôt know the base number. To continue your menu example, if a sandwich shop has a huge sign that says ‚Äúwe now have double the amount of burger selections!‚Äù. Then you go in and there are 2 burger options instead of one. It will feel misleading, despite being true.  
  
The only number provided is how espn now has 25,000 hours of female content across its platform which can also be deceptive since even if it hadn‚Äôt increased the rate at which it‚Äôs adding content to its streaming services stayed the same (or even decreased the rate) the number will still increase.  
  
So giving percent increases without the actual numbers isn‚Äôt very helpful at best."
Women of Mafia,"Example, I‚Äôm a business owner and I‚Äôm looking to advertise. I want you to spend your money at my establishment so I throw some facts your way. I tell you that I‚Äôve increased my female hires by 100% and you‚Äôre a huge supporter of efforts like these‚Ä¶ Tell me, what‚Äôs 100% of 1? What if I have 100 employees and 99 of them are males? I am not lying to you, I did in fact increase my female demographic 100%. It‚Äôs not a lie but it‚Äôs also dishonest. Media outlets do this all the time, because regardless of how objective they are, they all have agendas and biases. Some of the biases are more obvious and deliberate. Fox News, CNN, BBC, NPR, newspapers, magazines, all of them have biases and it‚Äôs necessary to ask questions about what they are reporting.

A better and more factual way to explain this is with solid numbers, such as, ‚Äúviewership has grown to X.X million in the last 5 years. Or in the male league they have XX million viewers on average per game, whereas the females have X.X million, a growth of XX% since last year.‚Äù Now as the reader you get a real sense of the situation. For all we know, the female league sports viewerships could be in the hundreds of thousands, but we don‚Äôt know cause it‚Äôs mostly percentages."
Women of Mafia,"No, yours is the most Reddit ass comment, a meaningless statement that adds nothing to the conversation."
Women of Mafia,"Well, you start with attendance at the games themselves.   TV stations want to air games when they think they can make money selling the commercials.  If you have a local team that's selling out every game and has developed a local fan following, then the local TV station is going to have an interest in broadcasting the game because they know they can sell ad time.   If you have a local team that's struggling to get more than family members in the stands, then the local TV station isn't going to have that interest because those ad spots won't sell."
Women of Mafia,"Exactly, people need to see what they're missing out on. I'm glad they're making progress in viewership."
Women of Mafia,8.06581752 √ó 10^67 is a hell of an audience.
Women of Mafia,"Generally speaking, women watch less sport because they didn‚Äôt play sports when they were kids. 

Anyone who has a athletic daughter has experienced the very small number of sports available for their daughter, run into the sexism of coaches, other parents, and their sons who don‚Äôt think girls should be playing sports, the lack of a competitive path for the competitive girls versus just the recreational girls, and eventually most of them drop out when the local opportunities to play dry up. 

Culturally, there‚Äôs a general bias that tells girls sports are for boys and manly men, not them. And especially not competitive team sports. So, girls are pushed towards individual sports, like gymnastics, or figure skating, or MMA these days."
Women of Mafia,"Someone opened a bar in Seattle dedicated to women's sports because they got tired of no one being willing to put women's games on tvs or being relegated to the shitty corner TV. The audience for both women's basketball and softball in college has continually grown. Title IX was passed in the 70s, all the male leagues have decades of growth to get to their current viewership numbers."
Women of Mafia,[deleted]
Women of Mafia,"i really have no idea. i asked my girlfriend, but for her it is simple. if her girlfriends were interested in watching woman sports, she might watch it. but her girlfriends all watch those tv shows like the voice etc because her girlfriends watch them as well. so they have something to talk about with each other.

and this is actually the same for sports for me with my male friends. i watch it with my male friends, because we like to talk about it with each other. strategies. who will win, transfers etc."
Women of Mafia,"wow is your wife andrew tate??? /s

but really you've underscored the problem with women's sports in general. if the product itself is not appealing, no amount of shoving it down someone's throat is going to get  them to watch."
Women of Mafia,"she absolutely does not represent the majority of women‚Äôs opinions on this, that‚Äôs for damn sure. there are a million reasons as to why womens sports isn‚Äôt watched as much by women, and it has to do with the cesspool of a fan base sports already has."
Women of Mafia,[deleted]
Women of Mafia,"Only so many hours in the day. Why stop watching what you already watch and love to watch something that‚Äôs arguably less exciting. 

Women sports can still be watched, but tons of people just want to watch Men‚Äôs because they think that men‚Äôs sports are higher intensity and a higher skill level."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"No Malcolm in the Middle?

Bruh"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Man I loved Wilfred, such a poignant look on mental illness"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Trick question what happens in every supernatural episodes 

Nothing it's all filler"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Wait, you've watched all these shows from start to finish? Or did you include shows where you watched just a few seasons? How did you fit big shows like Supernatural, Gossip Girl, The Office, Parks and Rec etc? Now I'm curious as to how many I've watched this year. lmao"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Meanwhile I've watched the entirety of LOST 3 different times in the past year.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,What are your top ten?
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I liked the The Guest Book on hulu and Brooklyn 99, Happy Endings, Better Off Ted, The Mindy Project."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I‚Äôve watched more tv this last year than the entire previous decade combined. Not proud of it but nothing to do.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Did you also watch all the naruto filler?
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,love death and robots is stupidly good! loved it! s2 is coming
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"You are missing stuff. You need to watch Deadwood, Rome, Jericho, Spaced, Peep Show, Extras, True Detective season 1, battlestar galatica, Deadwood again, and then probably watch Deadwood one more time. 

I'm sure you have already watched some of these, just my recommendations."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Stath lets flats.  Get on it!
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Great show list.  I‚Äôve been on a re-watching spree too.  If you enjoy crime drama/thriller stuff, some faves of mine I didn‚Äôt see on your list that you might like: The Wire, Dexter, Mind Hunter, Absentia, Jessica Jones, The Fall and Liar."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Now time to calculate how many hours you spent... Supernatural and Naruto alone would probably be 50% of the time spent watching.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,No 12 Monkeys Show üôÅüôÅ It's one of the best TV shows man watch it
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I've seen a lot of these too in the last year, especially liked Unorthodox, The QG, and Mrs America - all top quality. Haunting of hill house was better than I expected. 

Devs is great too if you can find it, lots to think about black mirror type of scifi. 

Also caught up with some brilliant old stuff that I never would have bothered with if it wasn't for lockdown:

End of the F****** World

The Sinner

Happy Valley

The OA

Marcella

Top Boy

Whiplash"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Should add some Venture Bros to that list.  Very much worth it.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Dude, you need to get out and get some fresh air and some vitamin D"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Anyone else just watching same few shows over and over?
Community
What we do in the Shadows
Pushing Daisies
Dead Like Me"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Watch Ted Lasso. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Try **Dance Academy**
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I am very legitimately curious how many actual hours of TV this is
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I watched a lot of TV this past year too but jesus christ man, not this much... I'm going to assume you are a minor still in school and not an adult with a job lol"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I sorry but do you do anything but watch TV? If you watched supernatural 8 hours a day 7 days a week for a month you would finish it, Bones would take almost a long as well.  I just can't imagine having this much free time anytime in my life"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"[I've seen over a 100](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/l7uqu0/within_the_span_of_a_year_ive_seen_nearly_100/), I'm sure."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,You watched pieces of shit like Gossip Girl and Bridgerton and you never saw The Americans or The Wire? That's terrible.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Impressive! I'm assuming these are just randomly numbered? Do you have a #1 from this list, or like top 3?"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,And your favorite was?
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,ok now sort them from best to worst
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,The Expanse? The Americans? Insecure?  Lovecraft country?
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Surprised you had enough time to get through all of Supernatural
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Of all the ones on there, the only one I'm surprised about is Bones lol."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,bruh you missing Better call saul!!
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Check out Dickinson! That show is sooo good. And then ZeroZeroZero, another hidden gem."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Now throw them all in https://www.bingeclock.com and see how many hours it took!  Something tells me it‚Äôd be close to 5-6 hours a day, right?"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Great list. 

If I was that guy I would say *What no Crazy Ex-Girlfriend?*"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,No wonder the economy is in shambles.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I just discovered new girl and I'm addicted
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"How did you keep track of all the shows that you watched? If there a way to do this that I‚Äôm missing? I have a hard time remembering all the shows that I‚Äôve binge-watched. Some are memorable and some aren‚Äôt and once I start binge-watching a show, I go through it very quickly."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Maybe give Justified a shot. One of my all time favorites
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,What did you think of Maisey?
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Watched it 3 years ago all the way through so I didn‚Äôt include it
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I love it too, very underrated until that lady was accused of committing sex crimes"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I'll admit, some of these shows, I only finished watching because mama ain't raise no quitter."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Supernatural 1-5 have some absolutely amazing one off episodes and a fantastic overall story. Hardly call them all filler. Later stuff? Sure.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Dean! Sam! Dad? Dean! Sam! Daaad! Sam! Dean! Sam! Dad.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Yeah it definitely gets old after awhile. They really lost me with the Angel crap.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"These are ONLY the shows I‚Äôve watched from start to finish. Granted, shows that I‚Äôve watched multiple times already like The Office, Parks and Recreationp, Community and Rick and Morty, I watched to fall asleep, so there have to be some episodes that might not count because I was half-asleep watching them. But I didn‚Äôt include the shows that I watched the most recent season of, like Riverdale and Big Mouth"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Dude you like notice something new every time you watch it. I can watch the pilot a 100 times and probably  see or learn something new.

Also Desmond is the best."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Lost was the first show I pandemic watch and it‚Äôs still my favorite
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Crazy how much harder it hits upon rewatch, too. Honestly turned the ending for me from an ""ehh"" to a ""wow"" after like the 3rd time."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I actually watched Brooklyn 99 this past year too, and The Mick, I just forgot to include them. Also I remember Better Off Ted! I watched the first season, and I was disappointed when it was canceled. ‚ÄúThis is the first time I‚Äôve eaten a carb in 10 years and they think I‚Äôm pregnant!‚Äù always sticks with me every time I eat a bagel lol I watched Mindy Project when it first started but never stuck with it, I‚Äôll have to get back into it!"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"This might be true for me. If it is though, it's only because for most of the decade I mostly watched movies."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"No, I skipped about 30 episodes. There are almost 100 episodes of filler. I tried to power through. I should‚Äôve included a disclaimer lol. I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore towards the end lol I‚Äôm on shippuden now"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Damn is Deadwood that good? It was recommended to me after I watched True Detective, which I loved"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"*San Francisco COCKSUCKAH!*

That show is Shakespeare. Maybe better.

Rome is #2 on the GOAT list as well."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I watched The Wire all the way through a couple years ago and I‚Äôve watched Dexter all the way through twice. But the ending always makes me so angry that I always regret watching it. I‚Äôm definitely gonna check out those other ones though!
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"When you skip the intro and the credits, each episode of Naruto is only like 15 mins long lol Supernatural on the other hand, took forever"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I‚Äôm looking for a new show to watch, I‚Äôll check it out. I‚Äôm watching The IT Crowd right now"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I watched 6 episodes of Devs in one day, and then the next day I started watching something else and never looked back. I need to get back to it though, I really enjoyed it! Thanks for the recommendations!"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I rewatched Venture Bros two years ago for the 3rd time. One of my all time favs
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"No worries, I have a pup that gets me out of the house! Plus I‚Äôm back at work now, so I have a lot less time for tv, unfortunately"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I usually will watch a new show and if I don‚Äôt like it, I‚Äôll go back to something I know I like, as a palate cleanser. You don‚Äôt wanna know how many times I‚Äôve watched The Office, Parks and Rec and Community"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I‚Äôve been trying to figure out how to watch this! I‚Äôve only heard good things. Does Apple+ require a subscription?
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I want to know, but I also don‚Äôt want to know, ya know? It‚Äôll just make me think of all the time I could‚Äôve spent working out and bettering myself lol"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Actually, I am an adult who was both working full time and going to school full time until last year.  I was furloughed for 6 months and have been working part time since going back to work, and doing school online."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"My job closed for about 6 months last year, so I had a lot of free time. I would put shows on while I cooked, did laundry, cleaned, did art projects, and then watch it on my phone when I took the train. When I start a show, I commit."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Lol what? These are the shows I watched THIS past year. I‚Äôve watched both The Wire and The Americans in previous years. The Wire is one of my all time favorite shows
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,This is the single most reddit comment I have ever seen in my entire life
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"It‚Äôs hard to pick, but I would probably say:
Snowfall
Mr. Robot
Rick and Morty

But that is almost an impossible question because the shows are so different."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Lovecraft Country is on there! The Americans I watched while it was still on, but it‚Äôs due for a rewatch. I watch Insecure too but I didn‚Äôt include it because I didn‚Äôt rewatch it from the beginning, I just watched season 3 last year. Issa needs to stop playing around and make the episodes an hour long"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I used to love the show when it was airing so I thought I‚Äôd go for it. You spend so much time waiting for them to get together and then when they do, it starts to suck lol RIP Sweets"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,It‚Äôs #51!
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I‚Äôve always skipped over it, would you recommend it?"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs all my fault. My bad everyone!"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I had the same problem. On Netflix, under the settings of your individual profile, you can find your viewed shows. I scrolled back all the way to the end of January. I‚Äôm not sure if Hulu, HBO and Prime have the same feature, I just scrolled through the ‚ÄúContinue Watching‚Äù to jog my memory"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Man it's good. On a watch-through right nowü§ô
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Check out Baskets. It's another show that ""has heart"" in a similar way as Wilfred."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Btw snowfall season 4 episode 1 comes out in 2 days gets on hulu in 3 if you didnt know
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,That was the hypest shit in my opinion
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"> Also Desmond is the best.

itstrue.gif"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,And the Constant is the best episode.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,See you in another life brother üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,I have to watch the Mick! It looks funny!
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Yeah same for me. Less time investment. But I probably also watched more movies last year than any other year as well
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I did the same. I tried to just power through for the original Naruto series but when it got to the second half of Shippuden they were just ruining things so i ended up skipping loads. If you look at Naruto + Shippuden, i'm pretty sure i read that 40% of all episodes are filler to some extent"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Yes
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"""We need to see how much juice they got""

Wu: rubs fingers together ""Jews?"" 

Yeah the parts with Wu and Al are amazing. My favorite part is probably when Charlie Utter kicks the shit out of Wolcott. Classic."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"The Wire was awesome.  And I agree about Dexter, it was literally the most infuriating finale I‚Äôve ever seen in my fucking life.  The only other finale that upset almost as much as Dexter was Game of Thrones.  I‚Äôll spare you my rant lol.  Six Feet Under was another great show.  As heart breaking as that finale was, it was fitting and I appreciated the way they wrapped up that show."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I'm guessing you're not including Shippuden then? I always think of them as the same show, and that's 700+ episodes."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I was worried for the ending but it does satisfy, really hope you do get back to it. I'll look at your list for some things I've missed, we seem to have similar taste (eta Gabriel Fernandez RIP)."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,RIP you beautiful dumb death prone Venture  brothers.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I think so, though the high seas always provides. One of the best shows of 2020 without a doubt."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,You can get a weeklong free trial of Apple TV+. That's how I watched Ted Lasso.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"I get about 3 hours per week to watch tv, so this list is wild to me."
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"So 6 months with nothing to do but watch tv, now it makes sense lol"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Did you watch them all the way through at once or where you watching multiple shows at a time.  I can't imagine watching every episode of supernatural consecutively for a month (and I like the show).  What did you think of What we do in the Shadows? It is my favorite mock reality show by far.
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,Oh
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Yeah, I can see where it'd be hard to narrow down but thank you! I was looking for another series to start. :)"
The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez,"Parts *Parks & Rec*, *New Girl*, *Search Party*, *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt*, *Community*, and the best music outside of *South Park*."
I Am Not Okay With This,I'm not okay with this
I Am Not Okay With This,I have a feeling we are going to get a few more articles about this happening to shows in the next couple of weeks.
I Am Not Okay With This,"The society was the closest i was ever gonna get to an adaption of Gone :( bro, fuck covid"
I Am Not Okay With This,The Society needs to have a proper ending
I Am Not Okay With This,I‚Äôm Not Okay With This was one of my favourite Netflix shows in a long time. Damn
I Am Not Okay With This,"Goddamn.  I Am Not Okay With This was so damn good, and really left the viewer wanting more."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Hey, Netflix has a new excuse!"
I Am Not Okay With This,‚ÄúDear coronavirus: Go fuck yourself.‚Äù
I Am Not Okay With This,I can‚Äôt believe this! I Am Not Okay With This was so good... I wonder if someone might pick them up.
I Am Not Okay With This,"I am not okay with cancelling 'The Society'. They renewed the show back in July 2019. They could have started the 3 months filming long before the pandemic hit the world.

The first season ended on a cliffhanger & now there won't a resolution."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Sonofabitch.

I really enjoyed The Society and was looking forward to the next season."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Sounds like all the scripts for the season were written for both shows, would be cool if those got released or summarized in some way. 

Lots of talented young actors across both shows, hope they find new projects filming in safer areas."
I Am Not Okay With This,Damn... I really enjoyed I Am Not Okay With This and was excited to see where they would go in season 2
I Am Not Okay With This,"Being a not so young adult. I actually enjoyed watching The Society. I mean, I had some frustrations about some aspects of it... but I liked the whole Pied Piper of Hamelin meets Lord of the Flies vibe. The way that different factions were forming and breaking. It was really cool.

I can see the production issues being impacted by social distancing. I would just hope that they'd postpone the filming. But I guess you can't keep everyone on hold indefinitely without knowing if/when it will be safe to work."
I Am Not Okay With This,Damn... I just wanted to know who Becca‚Äôs baby daddy was
I Am Not Okay With This,"The Society wasn‚Äôt great, but it created enough good ideas that I was interested to see where it would go. This is too bad. 

I‚Äôm starting to get pretty tired of Netflix randomly canceling things and now that we can‚Äôt even trust a renewal by them makes it even worse."
I Am Not Okay With This,That's a real shame...I blew through The Society in a matter of a couple days and was truly hoping for a conclusion. Another Netflix casualty sadly.
I Am Not Okay With This,Fuck Netflix.
I Am Not Okay With This,"Sucks that now we have to worry about shows getting canceled after they were already renewed.

Have a feeling this will be the first of many to come.  Bubble shows won‚Äôt get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to scheduling production when things ramp back up and there is limited space available."
I Am Not Okay With This,"damn all those ppl on every trailer netflix drops asking ""where is The Society season 2?"" are gonna be pissed. üòÇüò©

also, I Am Not Okay With This was a fucking gem man. fuck covid, and fuck all you motherfuckin' americans who didn't want to stay home."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Is this for real? I'd been waiting for The Society S2 for a while, they literally renewed it and not it's cancelled? It doesn't make sense!!"
I Am Not Okay With This,Had meant to check out The Society for Kathryn Newton but never got around to it. This sucks!
I Am Not Okay With This,"I loved The Society. This fucking sucks, i was so excited for the new episodes too"
I Am Not Okay With This,Damn and I know the Society was like a week out from filming before everything shut down.
I Am Not Okay With This,"Oof, two of the few shows I actually watched on Netflix."
I Am Not Okay With This,"[Bullshit!](https://media.giphy.com/media/TEHn0Ly4cyvPBXPAjR/giphy.gif)

I enjoyed The Society when I watched it, but now that it's cancelled it feels like a complete fucking waste of my time. Nothing resolved, cliffhangers aplenty, you'd have to be insane to start watching it now if you haven't already. In some ways I feel sad for the cast more than anyone else; that we won't get to see how their characters grow and develop, when there was some pretty damn fine acting in there.

I haven't yet started watching I Am Not Okay With This but I was really looking forward to doing so. I'm going to be fucking gutted if the consensus is ""you'd have to be insane to start watching this now.""

I have a horrible feeling that overall we may be entering a situation that's like the WGA strike of 2007 times a thousand :| How many more shows will be cut down in their prime, or without even being given a real chance?"
I Am Not Okay With This,God damn it lol. I actually liked The Society.
I Am Not Okay With This,Not ok with this. The society was going to be a hit
I Am Not Okay With This,Devastated by The Society‚Äôs cancellation. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I Am Not Okay With This,"Honestly it's getting more and more tempting to drop Netflix, because they keep pulling this utter bullshit. I'm overly mad about this but I waited so goddamn long for the society season 2, and I am not okay with this is great too. How the FUCK are you going to make 3 ""the kissing booth""s, but ditch these? They don't know their audience and it's embarrassing."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Bro, what the fuck!!!!! Thats bullshit"
I Am Not Okay With This,"Bummed about ""I am not Okay With This"".  It really seemed like (once they were able to film again), it would be cheaper to produce since the episodes were shorter."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Hopefully another streaming service can pick up ""I Am Not Okay With This"" because I really enjoyed it. One of the better coming-of-age genre mash-ups I've seen."
I Am Not Okay With This,"Dammit, these were two of the best teen shows out there."
I Am Not Okay With This,"They KEPT Outer Banks and got rid of these two shows?! Make it make sense, y'all."
I Am Not Okay With This,"two of their best teen shows, easily. don‚Äôt know how these two get whacked but boring ass outer banks gets a s2."
I Am Not Okay With This,"I'm surprised a bit that *I Am Not Okay With This* was cancelled - [I wrote about it a little at the time](https://alexmoreland.co.uk/2020/02/28/weve-seen-i-am-not-okay-with-this-before-but-thats-the-point/), and the way it felt so much like it was written by a Netflix algorithm would've made me think it's the sort of thing they'd try hard to keep. Suppose that's just the nature of it with Covid, though, and I wouldn't be surprised to see quite a few more of these cancellations soon."
I Am Not Okay With This,And here I was waiting for news of season two of I am not okay with this
I Am Not Okay With This,"Honestly surprised more shows haven't been cancelled because of COVID-19.  How many of them are filmed in the US?  Most of them?  Foreign filming is happening but it's going to be a while for the US projects can open up.

All the while Netflix has to fulfill their content obligations and... where are they going to get content from in like 3 months time?"
I Am Not Okay With This,"Netflix should add a new genre to their library called ""Cancelled"""
I Am Not Okay With This,"DON'T YOU DARE MESS WITH *DEAD TO ME*, NETFLIX"
I Am Not Okay With This,"""The Society""?!! C'mon.    
Other movies and series have been put on hold for years."
I Am Not Okay With This,"""due to covid related circumstances""

is such a cop-out.

both shows could be put on extended hiatus until the pandemic is over"
I Am Not Okay With This,Shit like this makes me glad I axed my Netflix account.
I Am Not Okay With This,"I get it, but it sucks.  I feel like there are going to be so many stories that we've been looking forward to being told on TV and in movies, and so much is going to be scrapped now because of Covid.

I haven't mourned this much for filmed entertainment since the writer's strike, but this feels worse because no one can be blamed for it."
I Am Not Okay With This,I really dug I Am Not Okay with This. Damn..
I Am Not Okay With This,"Damn, I am not okay with this was a good show and I was really looking forward to seeing where it went"
I Am Not Okay With This,But somehow they will manage another Witcher Season with Covid going... Not that I'm upset I liked The Witcher TV show.
I Am Not Okay With This,"Our whole society here in the US is being cancelled by Covid, and I'm not ok with this."
I Am Not Okay With This,"I'm pretty fuckin mad about this. I really loved I am not okay with this. I am *not* okay with this.

My loyalty to my Netflix subscription is becoming seriously waned with my lack of confidence on starting new shows without knowing for sure they will get a satisfying resolution."
I Am Not Okay With This,Awesome. Happy I wasted my life investing in watching the first season of IANOWT with no resolution
I Am Not Okay With This,"I am not okay with this surprised me, I really liked it and was looking forward to more."
I Am Not Okay With This,Okay are we going to at least find out what was supposed to happen to I Am Not Okay? Huge huge cliffhanger
I Am Not Okay With This,Dead canceled or temporarily canceled? I am not okay with this was better than most of the other Netflix originals I‚Äôve seen lately
I Am Not Okay With This,Why?? The barely scratched the surface with her powers!
I Am Not Okay With This,I‚Äôm so tired of Netflix doing this to almost every show I like.
I Am Not Okay With This,I'm getting pretty tired of Netflix cancelling every single show I enjoy. Think it's time I finally cancel my membership after being a nonstop member since year 2 of them existing.
I Am Not Okay With This,"AKA, let‚Äôs get rid of the actual good shows so we can afford to make a shitty live action Avatar the last Airbender"
I Am Not Okay With This,"Yes, sure, whatever the fuck you say Netflix. Covid is going to be here for probably the rest of our fucking existence, so lets be real here Netflix, you just cancelled them, don't pin this on the virus.

'I Am Not Okay With This'was fucking brilliant.

Netflix, you're very close to becoming worse than cable TV at this point. You actually make great originals, but cancel shit before anything really concludes, or you let them go on until you'll have a 'Lost' situation where those creators won't be able to write themselves off that fucking Island. Marco Polo was amazing and had so much potential. Sense8 was interesting enough and I'd like to have seen it play out as it was intended, but you actually did some good faith to fans. OA is a fucking travesty that it will never conclude.

Yeah lets make more shitty original films where we might actually get 1 good hit out of 100. Just fucking stick to original shows, but FUCKING LET THEM FINISH!"
I Am Not Okay With This,"Fuck you Netflix! I‚Äôm done with you leaving shows open ended and ruining anime with live action reboots. I had hope for Avatar but you fucked that up too. You already lost Friends and soon The Office. Not to mention you raise your prices every year and for what?! So you can green light every show you can just to cancel them with out proper conclusions. I will stick with Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime, etc. There‚Äôs just nothing special about you anymore Netflix."
I Am Not Okay With This,I Am Not Okay with This sounded familiar i hoped it wasn't show that i thought but after googled it yeah i loved that show. I wonder if there was no COVID would they cancel it? I hope they can bring it back in the future.
I Am Not Okay With This,How are they filming shows and movies at all with all the covid stuff happening
I Am Not Okay With This,"Ironically I watched all of ""I Am Not Okay With This"" while i sat at home, 90% sure I had Covid"
I Am Not Okay With This,I watch both of these shows and was excited to watch the next season for both of them wtf
I Am Not Okay With This,My girl Kathryn deserves better üòî
I Am Not Okay With This,This is not okay.
I Am Not Okay With This,What!!! What happens to Carrie 2.0???
I Am Not Okay With This,"Both shows are amazing, they just should of gone on hiatus."
I Am Not Okay With This,Figures. I binged I Am Not Okay With This last week. It‚Äôs hard enough to have free time to watch TV and now I wasted it all.
I Am Not Okay With This,I am also not okay with this
I Am Not Okay With This,Hope channel 4 Uk pick up I am not okay with this they co produced end of the fucking world and it‚Äôs the same director so there could be a chance.
I Am Not Okay With This,damn....i was looking forward to both. I need major closure for The Society though ...
I Am Not Okay With This,The Society has an horrible season ending with huge cliffhanger. They at least could do a movie or 2h episode to say what was the f...ing mistery.
I Am Not Okay With This,I was REALLY looking forward to a 2nd season of Im Not Okay With This
I Am Not Okay With This,"Nooooooooooooo! I Am Not ok with this was a great show.  
Guess I‚Äôll go watch Dark again...and again"
I Am Not Okay With This,Lame. Can't we just postpone it?
I Am Not Okay With This,So disappointing about INOWT... and I‚Äôm still mad about the cancellation of The OA
I Am Not Okay With This,Fuck! I loved 'I'm not okay with this'
I Am Not Okay With This,Figures! You get into a show and they pull the plug .
I Am Not Okay With This,Fuck the society was such a good show. Left such a huge cliffhanger and mystery. Hopefully a different platform picks it up
I Am Not Okay With This,The Society is shut down by covid. fitting.
I Am Not Okay With This,Was it the lack of dancing minors?
I Am Not Okay With This,Dude man FUCK Netflix for this shit! Wasting my fucking life ffs
I Am Not Okay With This,I am not okay with this society
I Am Not Okay With This,Fuck. I really enjoyed both of these shows. The Society literally has the second season written and was supposed to start shooting right before the shutdown too. What a waste.
I Am Not Okay With This,"So Netflix is running a show showing borderline child pornography, but canceled two well received shows when they could have just put them on hold? Unless I‚Äôm missing something here this is bullshit"
I Am Not Okay With This,What does that even mean? It‚Äôs not like the disease killed creativity...
I Am Not Okay With This,"Damn, that sucks. IANOWT was insanely entertaining (and far too short)."
I Am Not Okay With This,I‚Äôm pretty annoying by this news. Does this mean there won‚Äôt be another season of The Society or there will only be 2 seasons?
I Am Not Okay With This,What is the point in watching Netflix if you dont get to experience the full story? Stop cancelling good show. Either do full production or dont expect monet from the audience and go bunkrupt.
I Am Not Okay With This,Why is it canceled or not suspended? Isn't everything else is suspended right now?
I Am Not Okay With This,Booooo
I Am Not Okay With This,So very bummed was really enjoying I am not ok with this
I Am Not Okay With This,Ffs
I Am Not Okay With This,Really liked both of these. Fuck...
I Am Not Okay With This,"So I guess I can take ""I Am Not Okay With This"" off my watch list."
I Am Not Okay With This,I'm crying
I Am Not Okay With This,So The Society & I am not okay with this?
I Am Not Okay With This,"Fuck, I watched and enjoyed both of these shows, especially 'I Am Not Okay With This.' Both of them ended on cliffhangers too :("
I Am Not Okay With This,What is the show about?
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Well, it's only one episode in, so it's hard to really get a sense of the season as a whole. The episode was a pretty solid start to the season, though there remains the potential for it to end up repeating the villain's motives from the first season.

I enjoyed the first season for the most part. What did you find lacking about that twist?

Akane can be a bit annoying at the start, but she grows over the course of the first season, and you kinda see that in the first episode of the second season."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"There weren't any official posts of Demon Slayer's animation material, so I picked the next best thing. You can also find stuff for the Fate/stay night: Heavens Feel movies on YouTube through unofficial sources."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Unlimited Budget Works
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Unlimited tax evasion.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I don‚Äôt really care either way, but it‚Äôs really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[removed]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[removed]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to ‚Äúpartner‚Äù with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn‚Äôt need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn‚Äôt at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that‚Äôs all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here‚Äôs hoping at least."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Rat King is coming
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don‚Äôt think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Translation: ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn‚Äôt mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there‚Äôll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[removed]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,The lack of action started in episode 3
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. ü§£"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn‚Äôt feel like there was any‚Ä¶"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clich√©d and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clich√©s. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clich√©s, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"It‚Äôs not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don‚Äôt care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would‚Äôve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs because I  didn‚Äôt play the video games but I didn‚Äôt have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I‚Äôve watched. I don‚Äôt think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that‚Äôs a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it‚Äôs pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<‚Ä¶Hitchcock would‚Äôve been proud."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[deleted]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,The real monsters were the uninfected.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I‚Äôm assuming most people who liked it didn‚Äôt play the game."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"That‚Äôs super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it‚Äôll ruin why the show is so great"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Who‚Äôs complaining about the lovely personal stories?
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that‚Äôs it.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúa lot more infected‚Äù I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat‚Ä¶weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn‚Äôt to say I didn‚Äôt love the show, it‚Äôs an amazing adaptation, but it‚Äôs fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I‚Äôm happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead‚Äôs bit after the show.  

There‚Äôs plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,I look forward to the complaints that there‚Äôs too much action
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Why does this sound like it‚Äôs gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,We gonna get the rat king.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn‚Äôt just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we‚Äôll probably see some in the next season."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[removed]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,[removed]
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,A lot more‚Ä¶ considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don‚Äôt exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn‚Äôt everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded ‚Äúoh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies‚Äù is what made it work in my opinion.
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn‚Äôt mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
Psycho-Pass Sinners of the System,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"

"Hi Bye, Mama!","Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Good for Community.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
"Hi Bye, Mama!",/u/wikirank please do this every month
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens ‚Äî> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks ‚Äî> Professor says something ‚Äî> More talks about feelings ‚Äî> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are ‚Äî> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second ‚Äî> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show‚Äôs success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Ozark is so damn good!
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",You‚Äôd definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I‚Äôm surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC‚Äôs Dr Foster
"Hi Bye, Mama!",I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
"Hi Bye, Mama!",So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
"Hi Bye, Mama!","The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",TIL there‚Äôs a Japanese version of *Suits*.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
"Hi Bye, Mama!",*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Damn
"Hi Bye, Mama!","i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Prior?
"Hi Bye, Mama!",First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Good news for a potential movie too.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Is the show any good after S3?
"Hi Bye, Mama!",[deleted]
"Hi Bye, Mama!",I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn‚Äôt realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Qu√©bec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
"Hi Bye, Mama!",It‚Äôs a dumb translation but doesn‚Äôt take anything away from the show itself
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Maybe English copyright issues.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",they're in their own world over there
"Hi Bye, Mama!","I absolutely agree with you but it's interesting to see that it somehow has a very international appeal. I find their formula boring too, but I wonder if it's something else that is making it universally appealing."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",I think it's just another case of reddit living in it's own reality
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Sunk cost fallacy
"Hi Bye, Mama!",The last season of prison break takes place in the middle east...I wonder if thats why?
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Prison Break just came onto Australian Netflix, was number 7 in Australia all last week. I imagine it's the same for a few other countries."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",And it's a year old now!
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Survivor is a TV series though
"Hi Bye, Mama!",The first two seasons are good imo. Entertaining even if a lot of things don't make any sense at all. But I think is never boring.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","No, it's legit pretty good, not gonna win emmys, but its not trash"
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Shit yourself.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Sim
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Depends on what you know you're getting into. I found it slow but not glacial. It's one of the few shows where I just love people talking.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",#sixseasonsandamovie
"Hi Bye, Mama!",S4 is rough but I enjoy S5 and 6 quite a bit. And the finale is really great.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Mindlessly browsing Netflix is a whole lot easier than Pirating. No ads, no risk of virus, just one click and you‚Äôre watching the show."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Forget pirating..it has been on Hulu for years!
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Pirating is when you have no money and a lot of time. When you have enough money and not enough time, you just subscribe to Netflix."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","I would think it's a rip-off probably, if I was just scrolling through"
"Hi Bye, Mama!","How about ""The Paper House""?

Or maybe even ""La Casa de Papel"", which I believe was actually its Netflix title for like the first week it was available."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs alright. But this is just measuring popularity, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs *uhmayzing*."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","First 2 seasons were good.3rd was average and the 4th was a dissaster.

You can watch the first 2 seasons and stop there since  the series was supposed to be only 2 seasons.Maybe thats the reason why the writing started to get bad."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","You won't get a good answer in /r/television

It is good/great TV, there's a reason its so popular. Its engaging and doesn't require much thinking on your part. Not every show needs to be a Westworld/Better Call Saul."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Going against almost every comment here and say that I like this show a lot more than Reddit‚Äôs favorites such as Better Call Saul. Besides What We Do In The Shadows it‚Äôs probably the only thing I have genuinely enjoyed watching while in quarantine. Last season of West World was fairly disappointing. Granted I am biased, I have been to Spain a lot and am myself Spanish. Yeah it‚Äôs not The Wire (and neither is Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad) but it is very good."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Season 4 was straight trash.Writing,acting,music everything.They should have stopped at 2 seasons."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Rude

"Hi Bye, Mama!","Fun fact: he said this in reference to the one-season The Cape.  I liked that show, but perhaps maybe not as much."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",If you know what youre doing there are no ads and no risk of virus also but that said I still enjoy having netflix to find new stuff I wouldnt have sought out.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",[deleted]
"Hi Bye, Mama!","I have a private site with none of those features and everything comes on there about half an hour after it airs.

"Hi Bye, Mama!",#NeckbeardRage
"Hi Bye, Mama!","I think it's moreso that it would be easier for me to obtain the actual legal rights to something I want to watch, than it would be to teach somebody like my mother how to pirate a movie."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Its not about being lazy, a lot of people  maybe have an interest in watching something but dont care enough to seek it out and are happy to just wait for it to come to a streaming service and just have a look at whats available at the present."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Almost everything is easily available though (generally speaking, I don't know about your specific country). Anything not on Netflix will be on Prime Video, HBO or on any other streaming platforms, or on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Store, Youtube movies, you name it.  So we're back to the money question.

Except in rare cases, it's not about availability, not anymore. That was true 10 years ago."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Being predictable isn't a bad thing
"Hi Bye, Mama!",I could go into specifics but i dont wanna give spoilers.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","To each his own,but if you already dislike 2nd season you should definitely not waste your time on the 3rd and 4th."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Why is it garbage? I completely disagree
"Hi Bye, Mama!","SPOILERS! DONT GO AHEAD IF YOU DIDNT WATCH SEASON 4.



1.How could Tokyo(not a surgeon) save Nairobi from a sniper shot even with an surgeon guiding her? beside the fact that the they lost the connection with the surgeon and Tokyo had to do it alone.No matter how much the proffesor trained her 6ou do not go from a normal person to a surgeon that does high risk surgeries.

2.Why go thru all this fuss to save Nairobi for in the end to kill her? If you let her die when she was shot the first time,she died with a purpose,Nairobi wanting to see how her child looks but instead she died cowardly getting shot by that special agent.

3.All those scenes with the special agents were like an action movie in which the main character will not die no matter what.And yeah i understand that he was a renown agent but if they wanted to make him powerful they could have done it by making him take smart decisions(tactics)instead of him surving 500 shots.How did that dude not get shot in that scene when he was in the middle and was shot at by both sides,one from the elevator one from the other side? and it wasnt just 3 bullets or 10,it was like 300.Yeah he had a bulletprof vest and helmet but still.

Another Rambo scene is with Nairobi when she died.The special agent tells her that she gonna get shot and the crew just stand by and watches him shot here.After that the crew shot at him but it appears out of 7 people with assault rifles nobody could shot him.

4.Music and sound effects were trash.

5.They could have ended the show in this season but they decided to do another for $$$ and because of this the season felt so slow that i was doing something else while watching it.

6.The development in relationships sucked too.

7.I get it that Berlin was one of the best character in the first 2 seasons,but they have to let him go.Its cool to get 1 or 2 scenes with him after he died but having 35% flashes of the past just straight sucks.

8.There was so more things to talk about but i forget about them since i watched the season a month and a half ago.This season felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie.The only ones who will like this type of season are the ones who are under 15 and like watching series like Riverdale,Arrow, etc.If you are 18+ and watched lots of series like The wire,The Sopranos,Dark,Mr.Robot etc that actually has good writing you will find this series garbage."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",What you described is a lazy attitude.
"Hi Bye, Mama!",It kills suspense and feels pointless to watch if it's not done right imo
"Hi Bye, Mama!",Completely agree. S2 was so bad that I didn't keep watching and wish I hadn't even begun watching
"Hi Bye, Mama!","> felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie

I think you've figured out why Money Heist is so popular"
"Hi Bye, Mama!","No its not. Not everyone cares about tv shows that much. Saying ""I'm interested in watching community so I'll wait for it to come to netflix"" doesnt mean someone is lazy, it means they're not desperate to watch it right now. Believe it or not, people can enjoy tv shows but also its not something they spend a ton of their time doing, so watching if its there vs actively spending time seeking it out on a feasible viewing platform is a decisions based on interests and not laziness. Im an example of that, I love iasip but I spend my time doing other things generally and watch tv shows during dinner etc... so it works better for me to wait for it because I'm not in any rush to see new episodes when they're released."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","That is *so* fucking weird man. You can download new episodes an hour after they air in like 5m max depending on internet speed, then stream them to your smart TV and watch them. It's the definition of lazy, especially on good shows like IASIP."
"Hi Bye, Mama!",How is it hard to understand that tv shows aren't a priority to everyone? Like how is it not clear that I don't care about watching new episodes of a tv show an hour after they air? I enjoy tv shows but they're not at the top of my list of activities. The definition of lazy would be if I was absolutely desperate watch new episodes but couldn't be bothered to look for them. Thats completely different to where tv fits into my life.
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Agree to disagree. I only want to watch (what I consider) the best of the best. And I do that searching online, reading certain critics lists, etc. Then I actively seek it out. If I'm just browsing Netflix I would settle for mediocrity most of the time. Which doesn't seem to be a problem for many people, but it is to me. Like Tiger King, basically a documentary, but lots of people gushing about this great new show that was out on Netflix. It's not. It's a mediocre documentary from mediocre filmmakers that, while probably slightly entertaining, is not worth 8 hours of my life. But hey, it's convenient, and it's on Netflix! So that's an easy watch for all the sheep."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","We're not agreeing to disagree here though, you're literally not understanding that 1) not everyone cares about tv shows as much as you and 2) ""the best of the best"" is entirely subjective. I love iasip but if someone else thinks its trash then they're entitled to their opinion. They might love tiger king and not iasip but it doesn't mean they've ""settled for mediocrity"" it just means they have different tastes.

Im normally all for agreeing to disagree but you're trying to call people lazy and your definition of lazy is wrong."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","A lot of people also think 5G causes coronavirus or Trump is a good president. They're also wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that doesn't make them less wrong in certain cases. There are shows just objectively better than others. If someone tells me they like Friends better than The Leftovers, or The Vampire Diaries over Better Call Saul, they invalidate their entire vision on the medium."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","What a ridiculous comment mate. There's objective facts to discredit the first two ""opinions"". What someone enjoys watching on tv is completely subjective. You could write a thesis on why one show is objectively ""better"" than another. But it makes zero difference if someone simply doesn't enjoy watching it. It doesn't make them lazy. 

Again, its all down to why you watch tv, different tv shows exist for different reasons and to be watched in different ways. Your view is just so elitist. Your opinion is worth as much or as little as anyone else's."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Sure, man. A guitar player that has experience playing for 10 years knows way more about the instrument than a beginner that played a week. Just like someone that has watched way more TV and seeks out the best knows way more about TV than a casual ""I'll watch whatever's on"" type character. Characters and their development, cinematography, acting, dialogue, pacing, symbolism; all kinds of objective standards you can measure. Most casual watchers don't even think about dialogue and character development, they just take it at face value. Which is fine, some people want to just be entertained. But it is an actual art form, and people with background in film that have more of a grasp on how to grade TV shows definitely know more than casual watchers. Why do you think the job of TV critic exists? Stop blurting nonsense and accept that how good a show is is not the same as people's enjoyment of it. Lots of people enjoy watching Friends, but is it a great show? Definitely not."
"Hi Bye, Mama!","Stop blurting out completely unrelated and nonsensical comparisons that don't work. The point is on taste, it doesn't matter how much tv you've watched, or how ""educated"" you think your taste is, your initial point was that people settle for mediocrity and are lazy because they don't seek out ""better"" shows. In entertainment, it doesn't matter how much ""better"" a tv show is, if someone simply doesn't enjoy it then they're not ""settling for mediocrity"" or ""lazy"" by watching something that you wouldn't perceive as being on the same level. 

An example for me would be Hannibal, I can tell its an amazingly well written, acted, shot show. Everything about it is fantastic, but it was only okay in my personal viewing experience. I enjoyed it but despite how technically impressive it is, I only enjoyed it and that's it. I'm probably more likely to watch friends over Hannibal. That doesn't invalidate my opinion and it lends credence to the fact that shows serve different purposes.

To your pointless guitar playing point, I've played guitar for over 10 years and I'm objectively better techincally than someone thats played for 6 months. But if someone enjoys listening to the other person play more than me then it's nothing to do with them being lazy or whatever, its just naturally what they enjoy hearing."

> Amazon, sources say, is fast-tracking **an untitled Western from True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto**, which Nick Pepper, its head of U.S. wholly owned series and development, is considering the streamer‚Äôs version of the Taylor Sheridan favorite. 

**Netflix**

> Netflix is doubling down on the genre with **'The Abandons'**, a show from Sons of Anarchy alum Kurt Sutter set in 1850s Oregon in which outlier families pursue Manifest Destiny, and **'American Primeval'**, a limited series about the birth of the American West starring Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and written by Eric Newman (Narcos). 

**Other projects**

> Other projects ‚Äî **including a farm-set series from Sheridan himself ‚Äî are also in the works** as multiple sources say execs at both linear networks and streaming services have put out the word that they‚Äôre all looking to cash in on the success of the Kevin Costner-fronted Yellowstone. **The franchise has already spawned spinoffs 1883** (with Sam Elliott, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill) and **1923** (starring Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren) ‚Äî both of which have already been renewed for second seasons ‚Äî with the David Oyelowo and Dennis Quaid drama Bass Reeves, 1923 sequel **1944 and 6666 (named after the flagship‚Äôs ranch) also in various stages of development**...


**'Yellowstone'**

Frasier strolling into wine club/saloon like Clint Eastwood at the end of Unforgiven."

Unabomber - In His Own Words,I remember when Mad Men was a hit and the regular networks tried to follow that 1960s nostalgia trend (notably with Playboy Club and Pan-Am) but diluted the content for network sensibilities.

Unabomber - In His Own Words,"This is a bit reductive, remember that TLOU as a game faced (and still faces) a *LOT* of criticism for basically being a game structured as movie-like as possible, which makes adapting it *way* easier than nearly any other franchise out there. You would basically have to actively *try* to fuck it up while adapting it."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"I don‚Äôt think studios actively are trying to make bad adaptations, but some popular adaptations are difficult to properly do. The last of us is also fucked long term, because the second season will likely be less popular (the game was controversial to say the least) and they won‚Äôt have material for anything further"

Yeah. My parents were big fans of western movies, so when I was a kid, I watched a lot of those movies with them. Those westerns introduced me to great actors like Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, and Gary Cooper etc. 

Now, in my adult years, I don't care that much for the genre, but I do watch the really good ones like ‚ÄòUnforgiven‚Äô & ‚ÄòWyatt Earp‚Äô."

Unabomber - In His Own Words,"I have a feeling we're going to hear about a TLOU3 sooner rather than later. Game studios love making trilogies. They can't help it. If it takes place long enough after TLOU2, it may even provide an excuse for any hiatus after season 3 (they've said TLOU2 will be split into two seasons)."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Eh, I dont think that puts comedy in the same conversation as westerns and cop dramas. I think that's more of a sign of the state of comedy itself at the time."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Well in my case I watch and like getting all of this western content because I grew up on the genre a western was always playing when I got home from school growing up and we haven‚Äôt had a lot of output in the genre so I enjoy seeing stories in it
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"I feel like *Dead Space* is far better suited to a film series than a show, though more for narrative reasons than budgetary ones. Hard to maintain the kind of tension you'd want for this story across multiple episodes, let alone multiple seasons. 

*Red Dead*, on the other hand, could definitely support a series, but there's a lot of adaptation that would need to be done to flesh out the story and the characters for the different medium. 

Stuff like the Gray's versus the Braithwaite's works in the game because you can supplement the narrative with the open world, but as a story it is pretty bare bones. Ditto the stuff with Angelo, your time in Guarma, etc."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"I think the only way Dead Space could be done as more of a Mini Series with no filler. 3-5 1HR Episodes per ""season"", covering the entirety of a game.

I worry about films because they are under so much pressure to cut the runtime down. This leaves you stretching the events of a single game , book, whatever your poison is, either out across multiple films *or* condensing it down so much you risk compromising the story."

Unabomber - In His Own Words,"This life size baby is weighted (about 3-4lbs) and sized about the same as a newborn-3mo. My 4 year old loves it but still prefers her lighter bitty baby to this one. We got out some of her baby clothes I have saved to put on her new doll which was so fun for both of us. What you cannot see in any of the pictures is alllllll the hair! She has a head full of hair that my 4 year old just isn't ready to take proper care of. It is kind of long (like a bowl cut or shaggy boy cut) an is now a knotted mess. She bought this doll with her birthday money and picked it out on her own. There were no pictures online showing the doll without the hat so we had no clue if it even had hair. My daughter loves it...which is what matters (but the messy hair drives me crazy). Over all, it is a great gift for a pre-school age or older child. I would not recommend this for someone younger than 4...it would be too big to handle."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,I‚Äôm pretty sure I did see this tv show. Wasn‚Äôt it just politics in the last 6 years?
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"The original thread was removed because its title was ""too short"" so I extended it. My original idea was to use all 300 characters."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,And it's 12 year old news that's been in development hell.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Just those few seconds of The Presence on the teaser trailer for the album are genuinelly terrifying. 

Analog horror before analog horror was a thing."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Think you could find it? Sometimes fan works end up being really damn good!
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"The 3 EPs he did have a sci-fi vibe to them I think. Bad Witch, Shit Mirror, and Not The Actual Events."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Sadly the Watchmen series was like seeing a dog being cooked alive. 

The story is very political, just like any other dystopian story out there, so I see it possible that it could be made for a streaming service. After all, The Man in the High Castle was made. 

The Budget would have to be low but I can see it being made as it takes place in the current year. Literally."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,That could work!
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Agreed - TR as usual way ahead of everyone else!
Unabomber - In His Own Words,I was trying but there are so many recent random year zero videos now so no luck :(
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Very true! Love those EPs too! 

His score stuff and 2010s NIN music is some of my favorite music like, ever ever, so!"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Ah! But High Castle is much more of a fantasy scenario than the depressingly possible future Year Zero lays out. 

I don‚Äôt know the story enough to judge just how low the budget can go without looking like it was filmed in a basement, but I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs too cheap!"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Darn, would've loved to see it."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Nothing hits quite like Year Zero imo. Fantastic album.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"What‚Äôs so funny is I‚Äôve never actually heard it in full! I actually mostly know and listen the albums that came after it!

Starting with Ghosts and going from there."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"The Downward Spiral, The Fragile, and Year Zero are three of the best albums ever made and are really made to be listened to from beginning to end in the sense they're all concept albums. Highly suggest listening to all three all the way through if you haven't yet. Seriously changed my life."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,You're in for a treat if you sit down and give it a full run through.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Thanks for the recommendation! 

I did listen to Downward spiral 8 years ago. I really liked it, but found it deeeeeeeeply depressing. 

I also listened to Fragile, and liked it a lot too! Just haven‚Äôt visited it a lot due to how much I like the post-Ghosts stuff.

I also actually spent a lot of time listened to Trent‚Äôs influences. 

So Coil, Skinny Puppy, Ministry, Throbbing Gristle and Caberat Voltaire, David Bowies Berlin Trilogy, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, etc. 

Check those out if you haven‚Äôt yet!"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Thanks for the recommendation! I actually spent a lot of time listened to Trent‚Äôs influences. 

So Coil, Skinny Puppy, Ministry, Throbbing Gristle and Caberat Voltaire, David Bowies Berlin Trilogy, Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, etc. 

Check those out if you haven‚Äôt yet!"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,What did you like so much about The Ranch?
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Justified ü§ù. We dug coal together
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Queen's Gambit at #9 seems a little low to me.  The Ranch seems too high.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,I would personally swap 1 and 2... no comment on the rest
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"This, and only this, will be your legacy."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,You've seen House of the Dragon but not Game of Thrones? Interesting.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,I mean sure? I guess I agree that those are the shows you watched in 2022? I don't know that there's any evidence to the contrary.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"After seeing Better Call Saul take the top spot, I don‚Äôt even need to see anything else. That alone makes it an objectively fantastic list."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"It would help if you added your age range and preferred pronouns, for reference."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Lol you got obi-wan but not the Sopranos?  Nothing more to see here
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"House of the dragon was my absolute favourite but the more I watch it, the more inconsistent it gets."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Nathan For You is so fucking good lol. I know the awkward cringy humor is not for everyone but it‚Äôs one of my favorites.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Justified will go down as one of the most under appreciated shows of all time. I highly recommend The Americans too. It was created by the same person and features a similar moral ambiguity around the main characters.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"I think it just resonated with me personally. I saw a lot of my own life in the characters & setting, which helped me connect to the overarching story. I also thought it was just generally hilarious and heartfelt. The first few episodes are very cheesy and took me a while to get through, but I‚Äôm so glad I stuck with it. It‚Äôs a comedy, but when it goes for emotion I felt it really hit those notes. I almost never cry and was honestly brought to tears at some parts. It‚Äôs definitely not a show for everyone, but I loved it."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Queen's Gambit was incredible. I've already rewatched it two times.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"It‚Äôs an unpopular opinion, but I agree with OP. I liked The Ranch as a guilty pleasure."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy, I know he swapped those numbers!‚Äù"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Why do you think they haven't seen GoT? This list is only from shows they watched this year.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"It‚Äôs a ranking, as it says in the title. We all have subjective opinions. Do your subjective opinions align with mine based on what you‚Äôve seen? It took a lot more effort to write out your comment than it would‚Äôve to keep scrolling."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Maybe you have a disorder, so I‚Äôll be nice. The title says ‚Äúwatched for the first time in 2022.‚Äù Considering The Sopranons doesn‚Äôt fall into that categorization, it doesn‚Äôt qualify for the ranking. Thanks for your input though!"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Good TV should definitely make you feel something if done right, so that‚Äôs a great explanation for why you enjoyed it so much"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"Good point, turns out I didn‚Äôt read the title properly"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,It took zero effort to read the sub rules yet here you are breaking Rule 4 plain as day.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,You didn't post any rankings.
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"I did read the sub rules. I also took the effort to search the sub for ‚Äúranking‚Äù posts, in which I found dozens of posts just like the one I made. If the mods are going to make an example out of this posts, I‚Äôd hope they go back and remove all of the others as well."
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"How so? A ranking is just an order or standing within a group. The group here is TV shows that I watched, and they are ranked 1-24. If it doesn‚Äôt include an in depth review of each show, is that not a ranking?"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,"There's no numbers on my end, it's bullet points.

Must be a formatting thing then. /shrug"
Unabomber - In His Own Words,Oh Weird. I numbered them 1-24. 1 is on top. Hope it‚Äôs not showing up that way for everybody.

Hyena,"First off, I love Rosie.  I miss her.  I watched every day during her own talk show and often watch clips.  I watched every day when she was moderator on the View and every day she came back.

But she's been very honest about the fact that she has a very flight-or-fight response to whether she feels she's in a good place with her crew, producers, and co-presenters.  

When she felt safe and her interests were protected, she was the hilarious and Emmy-winning Rosie we love. 

When she wasn't -- had conflicts with producers, showrunners, executies, co-hosts, worries about her partner or her kids overwhelmed -- she just can't fake that she is unable to turn on her charm and gets shut down by her own demons.

I still love her, though. I hope she finds the right safe venue for her to shine again. I loved her pandemic vlogs and podcasts.  She's a gem.  I'm aware many people disagree with me, and I'm okay with that."
Hyena,"It didn't work the second time, because Rosie wasn't the moderator. She's much better in that role than Whoopi, but Whoopi wouldn't give it up. I think that caused tension between the two of them from the start, and honestly, the rest of the cast was just really boring. I don't think she meshed well with any of them and was able to have the kinds of conversations and disagreements like she did her first time on."
Hyena,[deleted]
Hyena,"You‚Äôre on the television sub, bub."
Hyena,[deleted]
Hyena,"I just tested positive for Covid, and I too was vaccinated and boosted"
Hyena,"‚ÄúSo Jimmy I heard you have Covid?‚Äù

*slaps desk* HAHAHAHA!"
Hyena,i hope he starts filming at home again and that his kids keep upstaging him
Hyena,"Ayeeeee, I just tested positive as well, vaccinated as well and to top it off I'm an introvert who goes nowhere."
Hyena,*Boostereded'ed
Hyena,"How is individual people getting Covid still newsworthy?

Omnicron is so prevalent and transmissible that basically everyone will be exposed to it"
Hyena,Am I wrong? But I thought the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent infection but rather reduces the severity and symptoms. Is this not true?
Hyena,"""Jimmy Fallon? The only thing he should host is a virus."""
Hyena,[deleted]
Hyena,[deleted]
Hyena,"Doc: How are you feeling?
Jimmy: üòÇ"
Hyena,"""which made me lucky enough to only have mild symptoms.""

That bit really should've been part of the headline."
Hyena,You can still catch it. He almost certainly won‚Äôt get seriously ill.
Hyena,Yep that happens. What a non story.
Hyena,Jimmy Fallon will do *anything* to try to be popular.
Hyena,"Fallon got a positive test result on 12/18 and is back at work, according to the article. The headline is a bit misleading"
Hyena,"So, what is the news here? Vaccinations don't **prevent** you from catching COVID."
Hyena,I don‚Äôt get why people say I was vaxed and boosted and I got Covid like they don‚Äôt know why the still got it.  When I say it‚Äôs the same as getting the flu shot as it don‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt catch it you Just won‚Äôt get as sick and they say are you sure. I just can‚Äôt anymore an i stop talking about it. Smh
Hyena,He's also Jimmy Fallon. He who sees hundreds of people a day and is constantly in contact with new people and germs.
Hyena,Vaccinated does not mean you can‚Äôt catch it‚Ä¶.. also digital pedo is so weird.
Hyena,And he‚Äôs going to be fine.
Hyena,Not a shock. You can still get covid even with both. You just typically don't die from it or end up in the ER.
Hyena,"I don't think enough people understand that the vaccine and the booster don't make you immune, they cut the severity of symptoms drastically"
Hyena,I bet he laughed and clapped his hands when he said that.
Hyena,Round table of tonight show hosts let kenan go first
Hyena,Vaxxed/boosted here too and I currently have Covid. I know it's bad everywhere but it's fucking bad here around NYC. I'm not surprised Fallon caught it.
Hyena,"Wait, did he do his laugh after saying ""boostered""?"
Hyena,Leading with ‚Äútested positive despite being vaccinated and boosted‚Äù is like saying ‚Äúgot into a car accident despite wearing his seatbelt and having a drivers license.‚Äù You are opening up this article to the ‚ÄúWhy Bother!!!‚Äù Interpretations. It is a deeply flawed and potentially lethal take. This headline is irresponsible.
Hyena,You can still very much get Covid even when you‚Äôre vaxxed but your symptoms won‚Äôt be as heavy as if you were unvaxxed. You probably won‚Äôt die or need to go to the hospital and be ventilated.
Hyena,He probably already got the antibody treatment too lol. must be nice to be rich.
Hyena,Vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent you from getting it. Just helps you body fight it.
Hyena,Well getting vaccinated prevents hospitalization and death not infection.
Hyena,"So is herd immunity only a thing with real covid infections?  Because I remember fauci saying when we had like 50% vaccinated that we wouldn't be seeing the kind of surges like we have in the past, and well.... yeah"
Hyena,Sadly covid is mutating very quickly. The vaccine may not make you 100% safe but It‚Äôs still way safer than nothing.
Hyena,"I love how shitrags like People say the celebrity ""revealed"" they had a positive test like it's some shameful secret.

News Flash: Pretty much everyone is likely to get COVID. It's just that people who aren't vaccinated are way more likely to have a bad time."
Hyena,Newsflash:  The vaccine doesn't make you COVID-proof.  Stop trying to use positive infection rates among the vaccinated as proof that the vaccine doesn't work.  It works exactly as it is supposed to.
Hyena,[removed]
Hyena,"From Dictionary.com: **vaccine** (noun) - ""any preparation used as a preventive inoculation *to confer immunity against a specific disease*, usually employing an innocuous form of the disease agent, as killed or weakened bacteria or viruses, to stimulate antibody production."""
Hyena,"Why do people act all surprised when they get Covid and say, ‚Äúbut I was Vaxxed and Boosted!‚Äù 

Being vaxxed and boosted just keeps you from going to the ICU, not from getting actual Covid."
Hyena,It's not impermeable armor. It's risk reduction. I know some folks who got it before they had a chance to get the booster. They were down a day or two. I have an antivax family member and it kicked his ass for well over a week.
Hyena,It kind of bothers me that people assume that the vaccine keeps you from getting the virus.
Hyena,and because you were vaxxed and boosted you‚Äôre not laid up somewhere with pneumonia having her foot halfway up your ass‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not about getting covid anymore‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about surviving that bish.
Hyena,god I find him annoying as fuck
Hyena,But did you die?
Hyena,"I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs hard for people to understand that you can still catch it if you‚Äôre vaccinated and boosted.  It just hopefully keeps you out of the hospital or cemetery, it‚Äôs not a magic fucking force field."
Hyena,[deleted]
Hyena,So does everyone. Who cares.
Hyena,Those vaccines and boosters really doing a great job at creating immunity üëè
Hyena,‚ÄúI will shut down the virus!‚Äù -Joe Biden. 800k deaths later he is pushing for this useless vaccines.
Hyena,"It's almost like vaccines are not a magic shield that prevents viruses from entering your body, but more like a defence system to protect you from getting too sick when they do."
Hyena,"I mean, the vaccine and boosters don‚Äôt prevent infection but do help preventing serious illness. Why do so many people that get it after vaccines and booster react this way?"
Hyena,"*cracks fingers* Ah, time to go on a misinformation reporting spree."
Hyena,Do ya get it yet?
Hyena,I wasn‚Äôt the one who asked
Hyena,"Just because you‚Äôre vaccinated and boosted doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt get infected, just that the symptoms will be significantly less serious and your likelihood of transmitting it will also be less. I feel like the attitude expressed by the headline has the wrong idea about what the vaccine does"
Hyena,"Vaccinated and boosted (probably double masking too, at least when the people are paying attention) you say?

Baaaaahahahah, now we can all fake laugh at dumb shit."
Hyena,Well we all know the vaccine and boosters don‚Äôt prevent you from getting covid but it does a good job at preventing death. Borderline shit title
Hyena,No one cares Jimmy. You are a hack.
Hyena,These articles are so dumb. Vaccine doesn't make you immune. Just helps fight against infection and getting sick enough to go to the ER. These posts just fuel my co workers who don't want a vaccine.
Hyena,"Nothing surprises me with Covid anymore. I went to a small family wedding and three days later, literally half of us have Covid. Idek where I could have gotten it from because we were so spread out."
Hyena,Nobody cares
Hyena,Yes yes and you're all going to live because of it now stop whining fucking nancies
Hyena,Means it‚Äôs working ü§°
Hyena,No one cares
Hyena,Y‚Äôall know getting the vax and boosted doesn‚Äôt mean your immune‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a vaccine not a cure people.
Hyena,"Now hardcore types are saying,‚ÄùSEE?! It doesn‚Äôt work!! They are tracking him!!‚Äù"
Hyena,"Fallon may be a prick, but I hope he recovers well"
Hyena,So? People may still catch after getting vaccinated and getting the booster shot but most will not get severe disease or get hospitalized.
Hyena,So you‚Äôre saying you can still get it and be vaxxed? YOU DONT SAY!!!!!!
Hyena,Maybe he just didn‚Äôt have enough vaccines /s
Hyena,I know of a couple friends that got vaccinated but have gotten Covid and more then once.
Hyena,"cue Ken Jeong saying ""but did you die?"""
Hyena,Finally got my vaccine and now I've been sick a week straight. Literally haven't been sick in ages.
Hyena,"I've seen so many talking about having covid and annoyed because they were vaccinated and had the booster. Those are not meant to stop you getting it. Its to stop you from getting it so bad that you need hospital treatment. If we didn't have a vaccine, many more would need to go hospital and there simply isn't enough staff or ventilators so its a choice on who gets to live or die and many would die that didn't need to."
Hyena,[removed]
Hyena,"Oh no, not a great guy like Jimmy Fallon, the three people left watching his show will be super disappointed"
Hyena,"Wow it's almost like the vaccine does nothing to prevent you from getting covid. 

Who woulda thunk"
Hyena,[removed]
Hyena,We must mandate the vaccine to the extreme since its creating sooo much protection against the virus for the vaccinated and tripple vaccinated üôÉ
Hyena,"I mean I noticed the trend was to laugh at anyone who got Covid that was not vaccinated, so does this trend continue with ppl that are vaccinated? asking for a friend"
Hyena,Jimmy Fallon is one of the most annoying talking heads on tv
Hyena,Well it seems he has common cold symptoms. Because he is vaccinated and bolstered. Good job jimmy
Hyena,"No shit. The vaccine is more or less useless to stop the spread of covid. It just reduces your symptoms a bit. It's a complicated form of Tylenol.

It's why vaccine mandates are nonsensical, it doesn't stop the spread."
Hyena,Can we just jump to the point where we stop with the jabs forever jabs for always mentality?
Hyena,Boy these vaccines work great!
Hyena,"Can we just admit that at least in BioNTech‚Äôs case it‚Äôs just a third shot? 

This whole booster lingo is so misleading. There aren‚Äôt like extra flintstone vitamins in it."
Hyena,Did he die‚Ä¶..
Hyena,ü§£ü§£ü§£
Hyena,I don‚Äôt understand why this is still news. Getting vaccinated doesn‚Äôt stop you from catching it. We‚Äôve known this forever.
Hyena,Isn't the point of the vaccine and booster(ed) to reduce severity of infection by introducing strains of the virus to your body and not to necessarily prevent infection?
Hyena,If I was vaxxed and boosted and still got Covid - I‚Äôd have some questions
Hyena,[removed]
Hyena,"Okay serious inquiry here:  if you can still catch and pass on COVID with the same viral load as unvaccinated individuals despite being vaccinated, but those who are vaccinated have less severe symptoms‚Ä¶ why exactly are the unvaccinated a threat to the vaccinated? I understand reducing hospital overfill but‚Ä¶ what other reasons are there?"
Hyena,"Covid is irrelevant these days, please stop posting articles about people getting it unless they actually die. Thanks"
Babies,I will always remember cocaine trenchcoat John Mulaney
Babies,"His first standup special since his relapse, breakdown, divorce and birth of his child. This will be interesting, that's for sure."
Babies,Good to see more Asian representation on Netflix.
Babies,So there I was cheating on my wife who was half my standup content...
Babies,"I‚Äôd be so much more excited if his series of terrible life choices hadn‚Äôt changed my outlook on him. Like, it‚Äôs not like he did anything illegal, (apart from copious amounts of cocaine, anyway) but the way he just left his wife out to dry like that after she saw him through rehab is just such a dick move."
Babies,"I say this as someone whose been a Mulaney fan since I saw him open for Mike Birbiglia in 2006‚Ä¶

IMO His new stuff, while funny, can be boiled down to; ‚Äúman who has lived life without consequences continues to do so‚Äù"
Babies,"My wife and I were legitimately obsessed with Mulaney for the longest time. We‚Äôve seen all of his specials about five times and we saw him live when he was touring Kid Gorgeous. We used to quote him constantly (and we still do occasionally) and he was one of those celebs whose involvement in something made it instantly appealing to us.

But then the stuff with his divorce left such a sour taste in our mouths that we lost all interest in him. It sounds absurd because, obviously, we don‚Äôt know him at all, but the whole thing was just so scummy. He had this wife who he talked about all the time in his routine, who clearly loved him and who stuck by him as he relapsed and had to go to rehab, and then he divorced her. Then, like a week later, he‚Äôs with Olivia Munn. Either he immediately moved on, or he was cheating; either one is shitty. Now he has a baby with Munn, which has to make the whole situation sting extra badly for his ex-wife."
Babies,I imagine this is what he was touring with and it‚Äôs well worth the watch
Babies,Please tell me he isn‚Äôt going from child free standup jokes to getting up there and talking about his kid constantly. Please. It‚Äôs such a fucking trope when comedians do that.
Babies,"Was gonna say essentially the same thing as the current top comment; my wife and I loved Mulaney and now feel incredibly, incredibly weird with him. The entire thing with his ex wife and Olivia Munn and the baby, it was just a lot."
Babies,"I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ after he knocked up that other woman while still married to his wife, I just don‚Äôt find him charming at all and think he‚Äôs more annoying than funny. He gives me the ick now and I don‚Äôt care about his new special because I‚Äôm not going to watch it."
Babies,Dude went from likably quirky to fuck this asshole real fast.
Babies,"god i used to love mulaney but after what he did to his loving wife who he made the center of a lot of his stand up, i don‚Äôt know how to move past it and enjoy his work again. gonna give it a shot but i can‚Äôt help but feel anger towards him over a situation i had absolutely nothing to do with"
Babies,Used to enjoy him‚Ä¶ used to.
Babies,Pass. He‚Äôs a dick.
Babies,Saw his standup at the Bourbon Room in LA back in Jan. Pretty much all rehab jokes. Still high-larious though!
Babies,Trash
Babies,"Not really interested in this guy any more.  I used to be attracted to his wholesome brand, but he treated Annamarie Tendler like complete dogshit (and if you think that's an understatement you probably have not read into it very much) and ruined that.  I'm sure he's got some new image that's working for some people, but I'm not trying to elevate yet another dirtbag."
Babies,"I was at the taping for this special and my favorite parts were the lighting shifts and watching him redo a joke if something went wrong. For instance he did a joke where he was walking, but his tie was moving too much so he walked backwards and redid it."
Babies, He‚Äôs funny but not funny enough to make up for being a douche
Babies,Aaahhhh I just don‚Äôt like him anymore. Anna was one of us (artists) and he was using so much stories of her being cool and shit and he treated her like that? Fuck him
Babies,I‚Äôve matched with his ex-wife on two separate dating apps. We talked about Kusama and public perception but never ended up going out.
Babies,"John Mulaney's entire schtick is, ""Woe is me. I've had absolutely no adversity in life and couldn't stop doing cocaine."""
Babies,I can't wait to not watch it
Babies,"I saw From Scratch earlier in the tour and unfortunately didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. I‚Äôm a huge fan of all his previous work. I‚Äôm looking forward to checking this one out though, hopefully he polished up a lot of the routine and it‚Äôs significantly improved."
Babies,Meh. He‚Äôs shown his scummy side. I‚Äôm good.
Babies,I hope he and Pete Davidson make it through.
Babies,Probably gunnu pass on this one. Given .. ya know.
Babies,Boo hiss
Babies,This guy is such a shitbag.
Babies,Saw him live and he's still got it
Babies,Meh
Babies,Parasocial relationships are weird.
Babies,I saw him on this tour. It‚Äôs about 80% drugs/rehab related material. But he‚Äôs still fuckin‚Äô got it.
Babies,am i the only person who doesn't really find him very funny or appealing?
Babies,I‚Äôm looking forward to this. It‚Äôs been a while and he has had a lot of changes in life so I am sure he had a lot of new material
Babies,"So excited to see this, I saw him early on during his From Scratch tour when he was still working on material and LOVED the set."
Babies,I saw this live. It's incredible.
Babies,"Oh boy it's gonna be so fun to hear jokes about how emotionally abusing his wife was funny, actually"
Babies,He sucks
Babies,The bit he does about his college asking for money is still one of the best stand up bits I have ever heard.
Babies,"To quote John Mulaney and his mother, ‚Äúoh this oughta be good‚Äù"
Babies,Is Baby J the name of one of the many young women he slept with while cheating on his wife or is it his newborn daughter that‚Äôs also a result of cheating. Just trying to follow along.
Babies,From ‚Äúnot wanting children‚Äù with his wife to having a baby with Olivia Munn. Sounds like he fixed two things with the divorce
Babies,I saw him do From Scratch live and I remember it being really good but forget individual jokes I'm excited to watch it again
Babies,‚ÄúI WAS ON THE BENCH!‚Äù
Babies,Ooohhmm. üò© I‚Äôm sorrrrry.~
Babies, My favorite comedian for the last seven years (though I haven't actually counted the years)!
Babies,I have a feeing this is going to be watched as much if not more than the Chris Rock stand-up.
Babies,"If this is based on his last tour, I laughed so hard my face hurt."
Babies,i love when there is stuff to look forward to (that is like just for fun). Last season of Barry is out in April too
Babies,I caught this show in Memphis last fall and it might be his best. Definitely worth watching when it drops on Netflix.
Babies,Gonna see him live in Vegas about a week before this airs.  Curious as to how much overlap there'll be.
Babies,I got to go to one of the tapings last month.  Looking forward to watching it on Netflix!
Babies,Because we're Delta airlines and life is a fucking nightmare üòÇ
Babies,"Mmmmmm pass. 

His wife seems like a really nice person and didn‚Äôt deserve what he and Olivia Munn did to her."
Babies,90 minutes of his Muppet voice? No thank you.
Babies,Hell yeah. I saw him on his tour right after cleaning himself up and he‚Äôs still got it. Best stand up show I‚Äôve seen. Really looking forward to this.
Babies,"My fianc√© hates him! Which is fair. Douchebags can still be funny, but should I support him by watching though‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not quite a Louie C.K. situation - I won‚Äôt touch that guy‚Äôs material anymore"
Babies,Is he still sober?
Babies,So many people are mad that a famous person got divorced. Lol. What year is this?
Babies,"If this mirrors his recent standup shows he has been doing around the country, this is gonna be a great special. His post rehab humor is great!!"
Babies,"God i hate reddit sometimes 

Everyone judging this guy on personal life shit when nobody knows a damn thing about it other than vague news headlines.

I will judge the only aspect i do know from this man, his publicly available comedy, and enjoy it if it is good. Dont care how many divorces he had, or if he was cheating according to reddit math."
Babies,"Some people are understandably miffed at him for cheating on his ex, I'm miffed that he let Chappelle open for him and hugged him despite it being in the wake of him being a transphobic piece of trash."
Babies,Yay!!!
Babies,Imma watch the shit out of that.
Babies,"Please please please don‚Äôt be another ‚Äúold comedian airs out their grievances‚Äù special, and extra please if he can not talk about cancel culture lol"
Babies,Am I the only one who likes this guy more now
Babies,wow lots of moralizing weirdos ITT
Babies,"Very excited for this, I saw this show live and Baby J still got it.

Less excited for internet people being weird about him again, I'm sensing a disturbance in the force."
Babies,"So is he finally done with his ""Days of Girlhood"" Tik Tok series?"
Babies,Finally. The man is hilarious.
Babies,"Why are a lot of the comments in here obsessed with his personal life? If he makes you laugh, enjoy it. If he doesn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt watch. 

No need to get caught up in his personal life drama that has nothing to do with you."
Babies,HE BACK BABY
Babies,I‚Äôve never been more excited for a special.
Babies,This was the funniest standup I‚Äôve ever seen - I‚Äôm pretty excited to watch it when it comes out on Netflix
Babies,[deleted]
Babies,I hope it doesn't have that p.o.s. Dave Chappelle in it.
Babies,[Anna Marie Tendler‚Äôs instagram.](https://instagram.com/annamtendler?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)
Babies,"So it appears that John‚Äôs younger brother died when John was 4, and they visited his grave every year. He also has ADHD, which has a history of stimulant abuse, sex and uppers. The pandemic happens, he ends up back on drugs for whatever reasons, perhaps due to lack of stimulation. This causes tensions with his wife, which leads to John finding escapism in other women on social media allegedly. John goes into rehab, relapses, gets an intervention, and then goes into rehab again. After that he cheats on his wife with Olivia Munn, getting her pregnant, though it‚Äôs possible John and Anna were separated by beginning of 2021, not announcing it until May, meaning it‚Äôs only kinda cheating? John‚Äôs child with Olivia is born in November, and John and Anna divorce January 2022.

I suspect that John going into rehab gave him some sort epiphany leading to everything happening with Olivia Munn. This is common for people who get off drugs, they make large life decisions pretty impulsively. Why John got into drugs in the first place confuses me. Perhaps he wasn‚Äôt being stimulated per his ADHD, or perhaps things with his wife were never as good as they appeared.

All in all, I feel sympathy for John. Addiction is hard, ADHD is hard, and COVID was hard. All that at once led to him making a lot of big bad decisions. I feel especially sorry towards Anna."
Babies,"üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Well, I‚Äôll still watch it to see if his material is good or not. I don‚Äôt give a fuck about his marriage issues drama like the rest of you.  
  
I WILL SAY HOWEVER, the other night I watched the Chris Rock standup special on Netflix and it fucking sucked. Bro was talking about how he identifies as poor, but then goes on to specifically talk about how ridiculously rich he is and how ridiculously spoiled his children are. I never felt so disconnected with a comedian. I doubt I‚Äôll ever go out of my way to watch a Chris Rock standup ever again."
Babies,Is it just me or does he really really not look or sound like the kind of guy who would be an alcoholic and drug addict?
Babies,People still use netflix?
Babies,"Man- some people here are clearly perfect people with no blemishes in their past huh? 

It‚Äôs fair to have a bad taste because of his ‚Äúscandal‚Äù but to me that‚Äôs pretty shallow and quite naive to think stand up content is an accurate account of their marriage. Again I get it. But if you actually listen to his jokes he was very open about his drinking and drug use and always was pretty open about not being this perfect person. It‚Äôs just because he presents dorky that everyone imagines him as a choir boy and we‚Äôre shocked when an addict relapses and perhaps makes questionable decisions. 

I always said I never wanted kids - after my divorce I realized that I do. I just didn‚Äôt want to with them. People change. Things change.  

Shame on his ex-wife for compromising her values and desires (wanting children) if that‚Äôs true because I don‚Äôt know but have seen it written many times. Don‚Äôt marry someone thinking they will change their mind on massive things like kids. 

Don‚Äôt assume you know someone because of their stand up set. And it‚Äôs okay to enjoy someone‚Äôs comedy who is less than perfect."
Babies,"Anytime he's brought up all his old parasocial fans, who have now transferred those feelings to his ex-wife come and tell us all about how they don't like him anymore. So predictable."
Babies,I didn‚Äôt even know anything went on with this guy until I read this thread. Even before this I never understood why anyone thought he was funny. An easy way to know that someone has no sense of humor is if they tell you this dude makes them laugh.
Babies,[deleted]
Babies,"I'm glad Mulvaney got work. Hope it pays decent - he must have some alimony to pay & he needs dollars to raise the baby. I hope we ALL learn from our past mistakes and make better choices. I'll watch his special, he makes me laugh most of the time. But I'd never want to know him personally - he seems untrustworthy. Sorry, Dude."
Babies,No one cares.
Babies,"This turd isn't funny, I don't care how many famous funny people claim otherwise."
Babies,"Apparently Reddit believes cheating on your wife is akin to being a sex criminal. For god‚Äôs sake, stop acting like fundamental Christians."
Babies,Over confident loud mouth nerd
Babies,"A comedy special not named after cancel culture, I thought that was illegal in the comedy business these days"
Babies,...What my mother always called my Dad in arguments...
Babies,"Well you know what they say, can‚Äôt bake a pie without losing a dozen men hehe"
Babies,Wow glad to see 2023 is the year of sleazy comic comebacks. He should do a tour with Louis ck they probably have the same fan base
Babies,"This is a garbage human. What he did to his wife was truly horrifying, I won‚Äôt give him any more of my pennies. #TeamAnnaMarie 4eva"
Babies,Seeing his content constantly on the tic tac has turned me off. His voice is so fucking annoying.
Babies,Yeah. No thanks. I hate comedians
Babies,K
Gentefied,The way the second season ended I assumed they weren‚Äôt planning on continuing. It was a pretty natural ending.
Gentefied,"I never even heard of this one.

They release so much stuff it‚Äôs requires some buzz for me to notice."
Gentefied,"To be entirely fair, I figured it was over at the end of season 2 anyway. It was all wrapped up very nicely, and had an ending that was perfect for a series finale. Yeah I'm a little bummed knowing there could have been more, but I'm satisfied with the ending we got."
Gentefied,Not sure even marketing would help this one. Some shows just don't have the makings of a varsity athlete.
Gentefied,"This is disappointing. It's a lovely little show- charming characters, fantastic actors, sweet and painful, real & silly family story. I was looking forward to following the characters- and I love the 4 lead actors: Joaquin Cosio is a tremendous character actor, deserves more great work- and Joseph Soria - what a mug that kid has. He broke my heart a few times - somebody give him another great role stat. The other three- Kerrie Martin, Annie Gonzalez, and Carlos Santos are so good-looking & charismatic, I found it occasionally distracting (""Her hair is so cute!"") from their comic timing and lovely little serious moments too. Anyway, I hope everyone involved in the show feels proud of the work they did and the stories they told. 

Making a few good hours of TV, telling a complex story of a good family facing real social, cultural, and economic challenges in a way that represents a specific place & people with dignity while also being universal- well, that's pretty special. I think so anyway! I'm glad they got to tell their stories - it was entertaining and warm and just what I needed, I guess, these last few years."
Gentefied,"Netflix needs to make more Limited Series lol. Just watched Alias Grace, it was great and didn‚Äôt have to worry about cancellation or a dragged out storyline."
Gentefied,I really liked the first season.  Haven't finished the second yet though.
Gentefied,This was such a good show üò≠ they barely promoted it spent all their stupid money on Emily in Paris
Gentefied,First season was great! Second season I couldn‚Äôt get past the 2nd episode. Don‚Äôt think it was bad I was just not as into it as the first
Gentefied,A Netflix show canceled after two seasons?! This is unheard of!
Gentefied,[removed]
Gentefied,Season 2 just wasn't that good.
Gentefied,Terrible decision‚Ä¶
Gentefied,I'm going to stop reading this thread before I find out how season 2 ended. But I feel like Netflix didn't do a great job promoting the show. I literally just found out about it two days ago and today I find out there won't be a season 3. Kind of lame.
Gentefied,Noooooooo
Gentefied,And the Trash Emily in Paris is not canceled
Gentefied,"Netflix are having an awful time with comedy shows. They cancelled 4 of their 6 comedies that debuted in 2021 (soon to be 5/6 when Pretty Smart inevitably gets officially cancelled) and cancelled 13 (two of that 13 are not official but we can take it as a given they got the chop at this point) of the 18 debuting comedies in 2020. 

The chopping of Gentrified means that one of the five 2020 renewed comedies got chopped after season two. The Baby Sitters Club will likely suffer the same fate and jump that number to 2/5. Leaving just Never Have I Ever, Emily in Paris, and potentially Space Force still standing from 18 shows in 2020. 

To make matters even worse a lot of older comedies are wrapping up in 2022. After Life, Dead to Me, Grace & Frankie, and Family Reunion are all wrapping this year. Not much left on the roster and no new comedies scheduled for the first two months of 2022. 

Comedy has been a bad area for Netflix for a while now. Hopefully they can turn things around. They did change the senior TV executives in 2021. Hopefully that means the newer shows show more signs of life."
Gentefied,Hey let's create a show that no one will watch because we will give it an unweildly awkward title.
Gentefied,"Jesus, what the hell is going on at Netflix? It feels like they're canceling promising shows left & right, it's absolutely ridiculous. Do they seriously expect anyone to get invested into shows when they don't even know if they'll get a proper ending, or if some lowest common denominator crap will get renewed over great shows like this? Never watched a single episode of this shit btw"
Gentefied,Never got to this one because the trailers I saw (which were probably selling it short) made it look pretty crap.
Gentefied,"If the first time I read a shows name is the announcement that is been cancelled, it's not difficult to guess why it's been cancelled."
Gentefied,"Tried watching the show but made it half a season. Sorry for those who liked it, but it was a dud."
Gentefied,"With all there bs of white supremacy, and latinx crap how are they best show? Majority of hispanics dont liie that bs madeup word latinx, and this white supremacy crap, with african americans being friends with hispanics is bs also

Surprised it even had a 2nd season

If hispanic from hispanic country understand english, they would know that their values align more with the conservative views"
Gentefied,Second season sucked and lost first season charm
Gentefied,Poem ciri
Gentefied,i saw season 1 and really liked it. i didn't even know there was a season 2.
Gentefied,"All I will say is that I'm not surprised that it got canceled.  Season 2 was probably their weakest.  At times , the editing felt choppy and some of the episodes were not that great. My favorite ones was the Stanford episode, the Christmas episode, and the Halloween Episode. 

I truly enjoyed Season 1 for how the quirky characters, the storylines, and how they shot certain scenes of East LA. As a Latino, it was great to see this marginalized community being recognized on TV. 

Will definitely keep an eye on the next project that these writers will do."
Gentefied,I loved this show! So well-written! I loved all the characters and the storyline. I was really looking forward to more :(
Gentefied,"They are. They only launched 6 new comedies in 2021 but had 9 limited series. 

No ongoing comedies scheduled for the first few months of 2022 but 2 limited series with start dates."
Gentefied,"This. I‚Äôm watching Mare of Easttown specifically because I found out it was a limited series. Even though there are rumors of a season 2, the fact that I don‚Äôt have to worry about a cliffhanger that either ends up getting canceled or waiting years for resolution, is a much better experience."
Gentefied,"The first season was so breezy and funny and conflict-free, but they seemed to have over-corrected in the second one because it was just endless drama. Definitely not as enjoyable as the first season, although the ending felt pretty close-ended, so I don't think anyone involved expected another season."
Gentefied,"Same here. I really enjoyed the first season, just watched it a second time so my wife could catch up. Started season 2 right after and....it just doesn't feel the same. Too much drama, way too much time spent on peripheral characters. Struggling through the last few episodes."
Gentefied,Same. Thats probably why it's cancelled
Gentefied,"Maybe it's just a bad show and that's why you never heard about it. 

Why's everybody in here all mad that a show you didn't watch got cancelled?"
Gentefied,Because people actually _WATCH IT_
Gentefied,why is it hard for people to comprehend that netflix is a business?
Gentefied,"It should be emily in paris which get cancelled, this show is terrible and awful.....

I know it about the number, but sad ppl still watch this trash, while other good show get cancelled"
Gentefied,Every network has an awful time with most every genre.
Gentefied,Looks like *I Think You Should Leave* and *S.M.A.S.H* will be doing a lot of heavy lifting for comedy connoisseurs on Netflix.
Gentefied,"Yeah Netflix comedies have been absolutely terrible. They have a couple good sketch shows (Tim Robinson, Aunty Donna's) and animated shows (Disenchanted, Inside Job), but they can not figure out how to make a successful sitcom. So sick of all the trashy laugh track shows they keep producing. Hopefully Space Force season 2 does better."
Gentefied,">Never watched a single episode of this shit btw

So why are you even complaining about this?"
Gentefied,"Nothing is going on. They continue to have some of the absolute biggest shows in existence.

What's going on is people like you who don't seem to understand that. Or who completely ignore how the entertainment industry _works_ or _has worked_ for literally decades."
Gentefied,I‚Äôm still salty with GLOW
Gentefied,Dumb question: what's the best source for finding limited series across streaming? I usually have to dig around in TV listings and it's not exactly the right place.
Gentefied,"Because they don't want to admit to themselves that their tastes are more niche.

They should though! That's interesting!"
Gentefied,Did that shit have like 30 episodes? It seemed like my wife watched it for two weeks straight.
Gentefied,That‚Äôs a real ignorant way to look at people and their hobbies
Gentefied,I agree. That Emily in paris is insipid. Gentefied was 10x's better!
Gentefied,"18/24 cancelled over the last 2 years. 75% is above the industry standard. Well above their own cancellation rates from previous years and above their cancellation rates for dramas. 

HBO Max renewed 5/7 over the same time span. 
Amazon have renewed 1/4 but have both Harlem and With Love (recent releases) still pending.
Apple renewed 5/8 with only one cancellation and two new releases still pending.
Hulu renewed 4/5. 
Paramount+ renewed 1/3 but have two recent releases still pending and no confirmed cancellations.
Peacock renewed 3/5 with a recent release still pending. 
Showtime renewed 1/2.
HBO renewed 2/3.
Disney+ 2/5 with one still pending. 
FX renewed 1/1. 

Those are Netflix‚Äôs contemporaries. You see the data proving Netflix are struggling in the comedy market? 

The data also shows just how much more shows Netflix produce than their rivals in the market."
Gentefied,"Too bad nobody watch this show then. If its good then people will watch, if it's not then people won't. Or are you one of those ""those plebs don't know a good thing"" kind of person?"
Gentefied,"They both had their flaws. 

Emily is mindless fun, Gentefied REALLY stumbled on the opening of it's second season. They painted themselves into a corner where the show couldn't really continue, without being insanely predictable, at the end of season 1.

For as empty as Emily is, Gentified tried too hard to dive into diversity. It was both making fun of the art promoter for being so crass in pushing her background & sexuality, and then the show doubles down on that same act everywhere it can."
Gentefied,So sad. She had a lot left to give the world. Just like everyone reading this.
Gentefied,"Not that it matters but *Gentefied* is a good show too. What a loss. R.I.P.

Gentefied,"i don't know who she is but it's heartbreaking that she died so young. my condolences to her family & friends.

EDIT:

just read the article and learned she committed suicide.  i know how bad depression can get. i hope she's at peace now."
Gentefied,"I hate seeing trans people taking their lives. Hopefully transitioning would have helped them, but depression is a son of a bitch hard battle."
Gentefied,[deleted]
Gentefied,"Haven't watched it yet, but it looks really good.  I imagine she was quite talented to have a Netflix show at 28."
Gentefied,Noo!  That's so sad.
Gentefied,41
Gentefied,"Im kind of interested in knowing if its due to discrimination or finding that transitioning does not solve all their self perceived problems. 

Im not 100% supportive of the ""trans post transition are 100% the gender they transitioned to"", but i do believe that they should be respected and supported, and taking your own life should be absolute last option if an option at all...

EDIT: problems are solved by facing them and understanding them, not by calling them a trans issue and then saying no one is allowed to address them but trans people.

If you feel like your life is worthless and you want to end it, you should be able to reach out to ANYONE for help, not just a gatekeeped community."
Gentefied,Wow. This is so sad. I hope she found peace. ‚ù§

Gentefied,"Another satisfied Bing user.  

RIP"
Gentefied,You over estimate my worth.
Gentefied,My friend's partner has recently had their transition surgery and has opted out of the therapy that they strongly suggest go with it. I'm ....very worried.
Gentefied,[removed]
Gentefied,[removed]
Gentefied,What
Gentefied,Being transgender is not a mental illness. Try again.
Gentefied,What do you mean by that?
Gentefied,Nonsense.
Gentefied,"Under estimate if anything. You have so much value and worth, friend. I wish you could look in a mirror and see how it stacks to the sky."

Gentefied,Golly that‚Äôs where therapy comes in. Or ya know you could stop talking about them in this manner.
Gentefied,[removed]
Gentefied,[removed]
Gentefied,"It is, by sayin it isn't you are denying them help to manage their illness."
Gentefied,"As sweet as that is, I've accepted my place in life."
Gentefied,"Yeah, the pop culture like to make it seem one surgery and a few hormones will totally flip ones sex and fix gender dysphoria.

What they dont like to show is after ""transitioning"" you are still left with the same body, just permanently, altered you arnt male, you arnt female, and you have to take hormones habitually, and you can still be left with that feeling of not belonging in your own body."
Gentefied,"Therapy for what? We cant change their biological sex

I support trans rights and trans people, but you have to realize that they can never completly change their sex, pretending they can is part of the problem"
Gentefied,[removed]
Gentefied,"any theories has to why the suicide rate is so high in the trans community? really worries me.

Edit: I'm asking an honest question here.

Resources I find 

https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-study-reveals-shocking-rates-of-attempted-suicide-among-trans-adolescen

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6798808/"
Gentefied,"Therapy for their mental wellbeing. 

I‚Äôm a nurse. I realize the technical aspects very well. I‚Äôm not going to undermine anyone‚Äôs wishes regarding their bodies."
Gentefied,"Not Trans myself, but from what I gather it's mostly because people aren't as open to the idea of other people being Trans, or themselves being trans, as they are to things like being gay.

So what you get is trans people who spend a large chunk of their lives feeling bad about themselves, not realizing why they're feeling wrong and having people around them not understand them. That's tough and might cause depression"
Gentefied,Because changing your outside appearance doesn‚Äôt fix what‚Äôs broken inside. You won‚Äôt feel more whole. Your problems won‚Äôt be solved. Gender changes can be seen as ‚Äústarting new‚Äù. Until it‚Äôs done and you realize nothings changed.
Gentefied,">high in the trans community? 

It comes with the territory.

1) Disorders (especially such a hard to deal with as gender dysphoria) are often accompanied by depression.

2) They can cut their dicks or breasts off, but it won't magically turn them into women or men. Some of them always know this despite whatever transgender activists claim and it obviously must affect their mental state of health.

3) The ordinary people suffering from gender dysphoria face lots of negativity that has got worse after insane transgender activists started ""fucking"" with kids who are just not conforming to gender stereotypes, pushing their agenda on them, bullying straight actors, infiltrating women's safe spaces and obliterating women in sports."
Gentefied,you dont deserve to be a nurse.
Gentefied,I appreciate the answer. And the rate in teens seems to be higher than in adults. That's heartbreaking.
Gentefied,"So sad. I can‚Äôt imagine one‚Äôs whole body feeling... I‚Äôm not sure of the correct word.... ‚Äòwrong‚Äô ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô, I wish there were more literature so people like me with NO understanding of trans and NO trans friends could learn. Her life wasn‚Äôt in vain because of this."
Gentefied,Roflcopters. The fuck??
Gentefied,"The word you're looking for is ""Dysphoria"""
Gentefied,"Thank you. And does that apply solely to the trans community or to everybody? Have looked up the definition and it seems it could be applied to anybody ‚Äòdisplaced‚Äô? 
Hopefully my question isn‚Äôt offensive!"
Gentefied,"So there is gender dysphoria and gender euphoria. That is, there are things about one's appearance or perception that causes distress in a person relating to their gender, and conversely things that presenting counter to that that causes joy. You don't necessarily need to be dysphoric to be trans, and being trans isn't necessarily a binary thing. For example, there are non-binary gender identities and there are varying gender expressions.

I don't really think I can encapsulate everything that I've learned in the process of my own discovery over the course of the last year here, so I would just recommend to spend some time lurking on trans related subreddits like /r/asktransgender /r/transgender /r/NonBinary /r/egg_irl and /r/genderqueer"
Gentefied,"I'm familiar with the term ""gender dysphoria"" to describe the feeling some Trans folk have. However I'm not trans myself and don't know if that's a feeling ALL of them have, so you might want to wait for someone else to reply"
Gentefied,Thank you so much for your reply. It seems to be an extremely complex area.
Gentefied,"This was dope af and hits so many beats on family, identity, love, evolving in a new environment, and of course gentrification. I can't believe nobody is talking about it!

Fantastic show with great cast and touching story"
Gentefied,"This show made me wish I were a better Mexican. And I'm not even a bad Mexican, I'm a bad Puerto Rican."
Gentefied,"I expected more people to be discussing this show, if only because Netflix told me it was ""trending."" I watched a couple of episodes. It's ok. I cannot at all relate to any of the characters in any way, shape or form... not even in the way some of them talk. Could be because I'm a Mexican from Texas and not Cali. Regardless, it was refreshing to see something diverse on TV rather than be relegated to the sideline. And I encourage America Ferrera, and other Latin American Hollywood Heavies, to continue to ferret out and get behind these types of shows, because if it REALLY is trending, it must mean the Latinx community are hungry to see themselves represented on screen, as the main characters. I know I was."
Gentefied,"The first few episodes were a bit rough, but once the show expanded to other perspectives, it really became beautiful. It did a great job of showing that Everyone involved was in a difficult position, and there were real drivers for their decisions and actions. The people I found incredibly annoying in the beginning, had amazing backgrounds and stories. 

The episode with the mariachi was great. At the beginning of the episode, he only spoke Spanish and was dedicated to his dream. And once he realized that it was unattainable, he spoke with perfect English for the first time in the episode. Even his singing in English was great. It showed that he had the talent to do it, but it clearly pained him. Very well executed."
Gentefied,Really good show
Pup Academy,"I was about to ask how the fuck The Last Dance wasn‚Äôt on your list, but I guess it‚Äôs not on Netflix in the US haha

I really have to wonder, though, about some of these shows. Netflix obviously tries to push certain content (how are Tiger King and Epstein shows related content to Meet the Parents and Schindler‚Äôs List?). But just how many of these shows only appear on this list (or to what degree are the numbers inflated) because Netflix sort of pushes specific shows they want the viewer to watch."

Pup Academy,Interesting to see containment show up.
Pup Academy,Those CW shows man. The ratings on tv really don‚Äôt matter for them at all.
Pup Academy,I love this! Any chance we can get Rotten Tomatoes ratings in the chart?
Pup Academy,"That's great, but most of the ""status"" looks likes a small square."
Pup Academy,correction... supernatural hasnt finished airing yet.
Pup Academy,I was a bit skeptical about this idea when it debuted but it‚Äôs clear that this was a master stroke by Netflix.
Pup Academy,"What do the different status symbols mean? What's the different between the ""end"" emoji and the ""check""."
Pup Academy,Damn didn‚Äôt realize Ozark hadn‚Äôt been renewed yet
Pup Academy,How about movies??
Pup Academy,No Witcher? Wasnt it reported to be like one of the most watched shows?
Pup Academy,"I guess I've never found it in me to care which shows are popular on Netflix? But upvote for dedication and effort.

My assumption has always been that, in general, shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable."
Pup Academy,You got linked in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/06/13/netflixs-top-10-most-popular-shows-since-the-top-10-list-was-introduced/#78de986432c3)
Pup Academy,"It literally took over my tiktok page. The videos made under outer banks hashtag have 1.9Billion views collectively

For comparison mandalorian has 400 Million views"
Pup Academy,If you want a teen soap drama national treasure type of show with bad writing and acting then it‚Äôs great
Pup Academy,Its a pretty good young adult adventure/mystery show - I enjoyed it for what it was
Pup Academy,"Yes. Outer Banks is basically like The Goonies mixed with The Outsiders (SE Hinton) the last four episodes were insane. I ended up staying up until like 3:30 to finish it. 

The main characters half to deal with the most ridiculous shit sometimes."
Pup Academy,"I enjoyed it.

But you are not missing out on anything amazing if you skip.

But i dont know your taste in tv, so just i would just check out 1 - 2 episodes and you will see if its for you."
Pup Academy,"The show isnt like the best show ever, but its good for a teen drama and its not as bad as it could have been. Im hoping for a second season"
Pup Academy,"Watched it all due to quarantine loneliness. It‚Äôs bad, and like 4 episodes too long. 

Pet peeve: The main character‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúJohn B‚Äù and everyone says it as much as possible. The dialogue is super stilted every time someone says it, and they sure unnaturally force it in there a lot."
Pup Academy,"I actually enjoyed binging it. Although it wasn't the best comedy series, I definitely got a good deal of laughs from it and really liked watching Steve Carell and John Malkovich together. They played off of each other really well, and hopefully if they get a second season, Lisa Kudrow will have more screen time, because I think she and Carell would also be great together."
Pup Academy,"I hope it gets renewed for a second season. This first season was a ***huge*** ""meh"" for me, but hopefully it gives them a chance to flesh out the characters more and figure out what they want the show to be. It seemed like they wanted it to be a drama with humor sprinkled in, but most every joke just fell completely flat for me."
Pup Academy,"Kimmy schmidt interactive was classified under movies list. But because of it, the TV show also got a boost up and got in the list. It is extremely unusual for a Netflix original to trend after its release hype and between next season."
Pup Academy,[deleted]
Pup Academy,Pandemic boost
Pup Academy,He write it at the end of his post.
Pup Academy,Last 100 days
Pup Academy,"> shows on any network are cancelled because no longer profitable.

Or rather relatively least profitable.

Even if a network only had profitable shows, they may cancel the weakest one(s).  Or if a network had only a few hits, a few duds may stay, because they perform better than 60% of their line-up."
Pup Academy,Damn this journalist didn't even ask for my permission
Pup Academy,"I might actually check it out. Missed it, but have been waiting and asking for something in the mystery-treasurehunter-vacation-crime-drama whatever genre for years. Looked more for either Castles Nathan Fillon or James Bond Daniel Craig ex-cia tonality than... teen drama, but maybe it scratches the itch just a little bit."
Pup Academy,"It has surprising rewatchability, even though the writing is meh. It has potential, but they need figure out the side characters way more. The hand shaking invention story was fucking hilarious"
Pup Academy,"I've posted this elsewhere in this subreddit, but it's interesting to me that Greg Daniels' other new series, Upload, does the same mixing of comedy and drama, yet does it far more naturally to me. I can see a similar signature in both series, yet one (Space Force) totally flops on it. I'm guessing it's a combo of different writing teams and directional / editing styles (I think SF has more of a drama directorial style all around, while Upload seems to be able to shift the direction and editing to set up the jokes better). Enjoying Upload far more than SF, even with SF having a more stacked cast. If it weren't for the cast of SF I don't think I'd even bother to finish it."
Pup Academy,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_programs_distributed_by_Netflix

Thank you for that other correction"
Pup Academy,"Of course but how did people even find it. No one watched it when it aired, aside from myself. CW blew it off in the summer."
Pup Academy,"Oh whoops. Completely missed that, thanks!"
Pup Academy,That's why I thought you should know...
Pup Academy,[deleted]
Pup Academy,"I watched it when it aired ,  cried like a baby when a certain person died.  I could not rewatch the show right now."

Pup Academy,Thank you. What a scummy guy
Pup Academy,"> which are just licenses from third parties

Most Netflix Originals are that.   For example House Of Cards or Orange Is The New Black were that too.

Netflix barely produces any series themselves or owns them."
Pup Academy,[deleted]
Pup Academy,"> There is technically a fourth option where some stuff is exclusive to Netflix either everywhere or in some countries but isn't marked as an Original for some reason

My guess (and I would bet money on it) is this:

Netflix Originals are shows, in which Netflix is part of the ordering parties.  Netflix was part of the networks that ordered the shows, or maybe jumped in later for new episodes (for example Orphan Black).  

That is different to shows which were already ordered or underway, before Netflix picked up the option."
Pup Academy,You got any extra addy?
Pup Academy,">worried that it will take a crude ""family guy clone"" approach

Mindy Kaling is directing it. It's not going to be a Family Guy clone. It's also a TV show, so they won't be pushing extra gore into things to get an R rating.  I don't know if it'll be good or bad, but it sounds like it will be a Scooby Doo flavored mystery show.  Which doesn't seem as far removed from the franchise roots as folks are suggesting."
Pup Academy,There is already a lot of gore and nudity so lol.
Puerta 7,The OA cancelation made me not too happy.

Puerta 7,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
Puerta 7,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Puerta 7,">When They See Us

One of the hardest shows to watch. Damn I felt bad for them."
Puerta 7,Dark should be top this list
Puerta 7,"There are a lot more Netflix originals that I really like that unfortunately didn't make the list: Unorthodox, Mindhunter, The Queen's Gambit, Quicksand (St√∂rst av allt), Unbelievable, Altered Carbon, Sintonia, Bridgerton, Easy etc.  
  
Also, as for other acquired/co-produced content that I chose to not put on the list: Alias Grcae, Kalifat, Parfum, La Casa de Papel, La cocinera de Castamar, Crash Landing on You etc. are all great television.

Puerta 7,What's going on with that Master of None write up?
Puerta 7,[deleted]
Puerta 7,"Thanks, cool list! Some shows I havent heard before"
Puerta 7,I would say that Babylon Berlin and BoJack Horseman are the best.
Puerta 7,"Way late to this post but definitely recommend ‚Äúthe last kingdom‚Äù one of their best shows, just finished its last season and then will end with a movie. Also the show ‚Äúrussian doll‚Äù had a fantastic s1 and returns for s2 in 1 day, highly recommend that one as well, very quick watch too because it‚Äôs 30m episodes and only 8 per season."
Puerta 7,"Maid, Unbelievable and Mindhunter."
Puerta 7,I loved Hemlock Grove.
Puerta 7,"Lilyhammer was so good. But unfortunately it was cancelled too soon, the show does not have an ending :("
Puerta 7,I like The Haunting of Hill House a lot.
Puerta 7,"I've seen everyone of those besides Between, Helix and Cobra Kai. And I'm almost sure they're not Netflix originals."
Puerta 7,Bloodline season 1 was one of the best seasons of television I‚Äôve ever seen. Unfortunately season 2 killed it and 3 buried it in an unmarked grave. Should have been a limited series.

Puerta 7,Man the first season is peak television
Puerta 7,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
Puerta 7,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
Puerta 7,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"
Puerta 7,Actually a better comparison is Medici as a historical drama about real life characters and one I notice often gets left out of these discussions
Puerta 7,"I'm just saying that Cobra Kai is a Netflix original, I did  not say that Cobra Kai counts for OP list. It doesn't count because OP is excluding Netflix originals that did not start on Netflix, like Black Mirror."
Puerta 7,"Sure, just wanted to clarify that you guys seem to be operating under different definitions"
Puerta 7,"Not really, he said that those three shows are not Netflix originals, which is incorrect."
Glitch Techs,First season of this rocked. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2
Glitch Techs,Technically it‚Äôs the second half of season 1.  They‚Äôre just calling it season 2 for some reason.
Glitch Techs,"Ugh, Mitch is still here. He better be redeemed or fired üòí"
Glitch Techs,What‚Äôs it about?
Glitch Techs,"Netflix does that alot with their animated shows.

**She-Ra**'s 2nd season got split into two, so they became S2 and S3... while the actual S3 became 4th and S4 the 5th.

**Voltron** had two seasons do this two, which turned 5 seasons into 8 by series end."
Glitch Techs,"> *Glitch Techs* centers on teens Hector ""Five"" Nieves and Miko ""Me-K.O."" Kubota in the city of Bailley, where a group of people are secretly dealing with glitches that cause video game characters to manifest as energy beings into the real world that operate based on the coding of their affected games, and thus create havoc. To stop such Glitches, these Glitch Techs, working at a local game store as a front, must use their gamer logic with their equipment to counter and win. Only then can they be able to capture the Glitches, and proceed to fix any damage and erase any memories to prevent further panic. Now, after unexpectedly becoming the newest Glitch Techs, Hector and Miko will have to use their skills as gamers to help out."
Glitch Techs,"It's sort of like ghost busters, but instead of ghosts, video games just randomly glitch and spawn monster versions of their characters outside the game. The team works for something like GameStop, but goes around dealing with the glitched game characters."
Glitch Techs,"*Trollhunters* had the opposite. Season 1 was two seasons long, finale halfway through and everything."
Glitch Techs,"Nickelodeon has a cable channel, and doesnt know how to use it.

Too many of their shows end up produced  but put on hold for years, while they shop it around."
Glitch Techs,"I don‚Äôt understand, why are they shopping around a show? Why can‚Äôt they put it on one of their own channels?"
Glitch Techs,"Nickelodeon has expectations of its network from ratings to analytics, shopping it allows content that might not fit on their network have a chance to be made and find an audience. You don‚Äôt see shows like this on Nickelodeon and there‚Äôs a reason for it, it isn‚Äôt a modern Nickelodeon type cartoon. It isn‚Äôt their market anymore. Shows with  serial plots aren‚Äôt on Nickelodeon or really many cartoon networks anymore."
Glitch Techs,">or really many cartoon networks anymore

Not sure I 100% agree with this. Cartoon Network has Infinity Train which is very serialized. And many of their others shows at least have some serialized overarching plot threads even if most of the individual episodes are largely episodic. Over The Garden Wall was serialized, though that's a mini series so maybe doesn't count.

For Disney, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil and Gravity Falls had a fair bit of overarching serialization as well, though again most episodes had an episodic main plot, but the serialized background elements were pretty prevalent. Same with the various Star Wars cartoons.

Netflix isn't a cartoon network, but has a fair amount of cartoons, many of which are pretty serialized. The Dragon Prince, Trollhunters, and Kipo are all serialized. I assume She Ra and Voltron are as well, but haven't watched those yet."
Glitch Techs,[deleted]
Glitch Techs,I'm pretty sure Infinity Train is getting another season though.
Glitch Techs,"Infinity Train has already had two seasons. And seems setup to have more, so I wouldn't really call it a limited series."
Glitch Techs,"Got all the hallmarks of a great 90s cartoon:

- Team of kids inexplicably tasked with saving the world

- Radically multiethnic ‚Äúcatch ‚Äòem all‚Äù team

- Bad haircuts

- Monster of the week"
Glitch Techs,I feel like this should've premiere on Nick also. Plus this has been in production since 2016
Glitch Techs,"Glad this finally managed to find a home after Nick fucked it over to high heaven, seemed like an interesting premise for a show"
Glitch Techs,"Love it, like a modern Danny Phantom"
Glitch Techs,"So it's basically a cross between Ghostbusters, Men In Black and Pixels? Could be neat."
Glitch Techs,Looks pretty good!
Glitch Techs,Can we get stretch arm strong s3 after this?
Glitch Techs,"But does it have a teacher that all the kids think is a stick in the mud but is actually a gold-hearted, if gruff, mentor like character?"
Glitch Techs,"> Radically multiethnic ‚Äúcatch ‚Äòem all‚Äù team

We remember the 90's *very* differently.  I think the most representation I got was Speedy Gonzales - who for the record is a boss."
Glitch Techs,"Magic School Bus, Captain Planet, Rocket Power, Hey Arnold, Recess

Everyone had their token minorities."
Glitch Techs,"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveTokenBand
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultinationalTeam
There were a lot of these in the 90s and 2000s"
Glitch Techs,"Technically this is just the last half of season 1. They made it all at the same time but for some reason netflix split it into two parts so bit of clickbait.

The second part of season 1 is out in August, the article should say"
Glitch Techs,Great show. Lots of fun watching
Glitch Techs,That's a pretty quick turnaround.  Just renewed and already coming out in a few weeks.  Those animator's wrists must be really tired.
Glitch Techs,You're right about that. I guess it's easier for Netflix to call it as the second season rather than saying it's part 2 of season 1.
Glitch Techs,They do that because people binge it right away and they don‚Äôt want you to forget about it by the time the actual next season comes around which would normally be another year or so.
Glitch Techs,"The initial order was for 20 episodes. Netflix for some reason does this thing with some animated shows where they order a bunch of episodes at once, and then announces they have ""renewed"" the show shortly before they plan to drop the next installment even though they had actually renewed the show months/years ago. Prior to the ""renewal"" announcement they won't even confirm that they have already renewed/made the show even when outside sources regarding how many episodes were produced/ordered don't match the number released. I guess they figure there's more hype/anticipation this way or something."
Glitch Techs,It‚Äôs such a great show!
Glitch Techs,"Honestly, it was a pretty entertaining season"
Glitch Techs,I wasn't aware a season 2 date had even been announced and I'm usually pretty on top of stuff like that. I'll watch it over the next few days. Or possibly binge the whole thing tonight.
Glitch Techs,"Has anyone watched this yet? The trailer looked interesting so I was planning to, but I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on it."
Glitch Techs,"I‚Äôll give it a shot. Looks interesting enough to at least try

Edit: watched all of.  Love it. Can‚Äôt wait for more!"
Glitch Techs,"Watched all 10 episodes (Ep1 is a two parter Netflix put together as 44 min), and I personally think it's fantastic. If you enjoyed things like Men in Black, Ghostbusters, Scott Pilgrim, or Danny Phantom, I think you'll love Glitch Techs. As a heads up tho, some of the editing is a bit strange, due to the show developed as a television series. It wasn't until they were partway through S2 that production was frozen and Nickelodeon eventually shopped it to Netflix. You can easily tell where commercial breaks were supposed to be."

Glitch Techs,"I just watched it. It was pretty good, but I would have liked the overarching plot to progress a bit more. They set up an overarching plot at the end of the third episode, but then never mentioned it again. Since it appears they made 20 episodes and have only aired the first 10, maybe it features more in the back half."
Glitch Techs,I think glitches develop regardless of their tech. Making the perfect console just isn‚Äôt possible. Something is bound to cause a glitch
Glitch Techs,"It was pretty good, but while I'm fine with it being mostly episodic, I would have preferred if it touched on what is clearly eventually supposed to be the overarching plot more than in one single 30 second scene in the third episode. I would have thought they would have brought it up again at least in the final episode of the season, but they didn't. Though if they've made 20 episodes so far and that was just the first half of season one, then I guess that makes sense."
Glitch Techs,By overarching plot are you referring to that scene in the tutorial episode with the inspector ? Because that's episode 2. Just want to make sure i didn't miss anything
Glitch Techs,Yes
Glitch Techs,Better or worse than Captain N?
Glitch Techs,I'm really enjoying it.
Glitch Techs,Definitely better.
Glitch Techs,"Here is a link to the creator's full post explaining the situation in full. 

https://www.instagram.com/p/BsbYVDKhBQk/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=183knb0doibo1

To keep it short, he and his crew have been working on this show for the past two and a half years. The entire first season has been completed,and work on the second had been underway when Nickelodeon suddenly decided to put the show on a production hiatus. Apparently they want to gauge reception to the show before letting the crew finish the episodes that were ordered. A LOT of hard work, love, and pure talent has been put into this, evident here in the highly energetic theme song. Giving this show a simple view when it finally premieres would be GREATLY appreciated, and would hopefully let Nickelodeon see the potential the show has. "

Glitch Techs,"They‚Äôve given up on cartoons a long time ago. It‚Äôs a cheap network that would rather create cheaper live action shows. That‚Äôs how they make money. They have what, three cartoon series now? Otherwise it‚Äôs just reruns. "
Glitch Techs,"Live action shows are cheaper and easier to produce. Good animated shows require effort, which nobody at Nick is willing to do."
Glitch Techs,Pete and Pete reboot now.
Glitch Techs,Arent they getting ready to turn the Rocko reunion movie into a series?
Glitch Techs,"Back in the day, Nickelodeon was all about live-action shows (sketches, game shows, etc.) and Cartoon Network was the channel for Cartoons.

Funny to think about back then and reading this now."
Glitch Techs,"I seriously doubt the cartoons will be going anytime soon. Loud House I think gets pretty great ratings, TMNT still sells a ton of merchandise, and Spongebob is a pop culture icon among the likes of Mickey Mouse, Darth Vader, and Pikachu. Plus everyone seems to ignore that Nick Junior's cartoons are still very profitable. I mean have you even seen how massive Paw Patrol is with 3 year olds?!"
Glitch Techs,"Pinky Malinkey got shipped to Netflix, Avatar TLA live action remake is gonna be on Netflix... I think Nicktoons may be outsourced or more infrequent. Animation is expensive and many of their recent shows were failures outside of The Loud House, which had a sexual misconduct scandal. 

So yes you may be right. Check out the good Netflix and Amazon shows like Hilda, Danger & Eggs and others if you want stuff similar to CN/Nick shows. "
Glitch Techs,nickelodian hasnt rlly had a show that interested me since korra ended. tho the harvey beaks op goes offfffff
Glitch Techs,"I don't know entirely the environment for advertising for children's channels, but in the UK because of strict guidelines a lot of them streamlined their output to compensate for it. I'm guessing this could be a case here too?"
Glitch Techs,I just want a nick channel completely dedicated to the og  snick shows and the og nick showers from the 80s and 90s
Glitch Techs,"I hope not 
"
Glitch Techs,It amuses me when grown adults have serious in-depth opinions on content intended for 9 year olds
Glitch Techs,Haven't watched since they Teen Titans Go'd TMNT.
Glitch Techs,"You know saying that ,it makes me wonder if they would have completely removed every cartoon from their channel anyway if they are no longer interested in them except they still keep spongebob and the loud house including TMNT because they are the only animated cash cows they got."
Glitch Techs,"> Live action shows are cheaper and easier to produce.

Hasn't that always been the case though? Why did they start making cartoons to begin with? Variety? Creativity? "
Glitch Techs,Sadly true if only they have more budget to make better shows and then maybe go back to making cartoons.
Glitch Techs,Yes sir! Rewatched the entire series recently. It still stands today!
Glitch Techs,"Yeah ,seems likely"
Glitch Techs,That hasn‚Äôt even aired yet. It‚Äôs finished too. I‚Äôm worried for it cause the hey Arnold movie didn‚Äôt get the ratings they hoped for (even tho they barley promoted it.) The creator even said if the Arnold movie did great nick would renew them for a new season. Now he‚Äôs tryin to shop it to netflex and other places last I heard.
Glitch Techs,The Ren and Stimpy through Rocko's Modern Life era was glorious
Glitch Techs,"I have a 3 year old and I have the Paw Patrol theme song permanently stuck in my head.  Somebody shoot me.  

On the positive side, it works great as his off switch if I need to get something done or if he gets a reward for something.  "
Glitch Techs,">  Loud House I think gets pretty great ratings, TMNT still sells a ton of merchandise, and Spongebob is a pop culture icon among the likes of Mickey Mouse, Darth Vader, and Pikachu. Plus everyone seems to ignore that Nick Junior's cartoons are still very profitable.


True but for how long?

>plus everyone seems to ignore that Nick Junior's cartoons are still very profitable. I mean have you even seen how massive Paw Patrol is with 3 year olds?!

No kidding,I mean pre school kids like these type of  shows even dora the explorer.

"
Glitch Techs,I wonder how much of the merch sales Nick gets for TMNT. 
Glitch Techs,">Pinky Malinkey got shipped to Netflix, Avatar TLA live action remake is gonna be on Netflix... I think Nicktoons may be outsourced or more infrequent. Animation is expensive and many of their recent shows were failures outside of The Loud House, which had a sexual misconduct scandal.

Yeah and if nickelodeon transfers all their cartoon properties to Netflix (eventhough it will be its co-production) or their own streaming service that mostly focuses only on nicktoons then Nickelodeon will only air live action shows only and a cheap one too (""Mr krabs like"" that is) especially that spongebob will likely be cancelled sometime in the near future along with the loud house"
Glitch Techs,Don‚Äôt know why u got downvoted for having an opinion. Harvey beaks got screwed over the network so bad too.
Glitch Techs,indeed
Glitch Techs,"Yeah,I understand how you feel"
Glitch Techs,"if I tell you a site that plays constant classic Nick shows for free, do you promise NOT to post it on Reddit? They even have a classic Nick Jr and Nick @ Nite block, the site is free 24/7"
Glitch Techs,me too
Glitch Techs,Cartoon Network has put out cartoons that appealed to older demographics. Cartoons doesn't mean kids only. 
Glitch Techs,It amuses me when people shit on other people for basically no good reason
Glitch Techs,"Cartoons, music videos and gameshows were all kids watched in the 90s lol"
Glitch Techs,I have the first two seasons they put on DVD and for whatever reason got the urge to rewatch them over the weekend. Goddamn what a comfy show.
Glitch Techs,"> even tho they barley promoted it.

Was their promotion as bad as it was with Legend of Korra?"
Glitch Techs,"Yeah, Ren and Stimpy through Nickelodeon created the modern era of children‚Äôs cartoon shows. Nickelodeon did it when Cartoon Network was still just Hanna Barbera reruns."
Glitch Techs,"Real Monsters, Rugrats, Angry Beavers, Doug, Rocko, Ren and Stimpy, Hey Arnold, Kablam, Catdog, Wildthornberries, Rocket Power...

Yeah, 90s Nick was incredible"
Glitch Techs,Can‚Äôt say I blame ya. Just got back from seeing some family members for the holidays and it‚Äôs been stuck in my head since Christmas after seeing my cousins watch it so many times. I don‚Äôt know how much I can take anymore.
Glitch Techs,Hopefully a decent amount if the previous show was able to last 5 years despite the reruns not airing that much.
Glitch Techs,which i weird cuz ch green blatt made the best thing to ever air on nickelodian ever (the sponge bob episode: band geeks)
Glitch Techs,Yes
Glitch Techs,It really is like a wholesome 1950's sitcom with a 1990's gloss. There is so much of my childhood linked to this show - I love the smoking crossing guard. Imagine that on Nickelodeon today! What's your favourite episode?
Glitch Techs,"Please don't remind me about how Nick ruined Korra.

""Okay you get one season, wrap it up at the end."" 

""Gotcha""

""Okay this is way more successful than we thought, you can have another season but that's it.""

""But we already wrote like...an ending...okay whatever, we'll do it.""

Repeat until season 4 when Nick spontaneously decided to slash their budget resulting in a flashback montage episode. Oh, and then also stopped airing it on TV and put the final three episodes online with zero promotion. Fuck you Nick."
Glitch Techs,Yeah pretty much. Ninja turtles got bad promotion as well. Though I‚Äôm always seeing promotion for the new episode of Henry danger every week. :(
Glitch Techs,"Subsequently, the Dexter's Lab and Courage the Cowardly Dog era of CN was also a golden era."
Glitch Techs,That would be amazing 
Glitch Techs,"The pilot with the squid Big Pete kills, and the one where Little Pete has that douchebag coach and they play dodgeball."
Glitch Techs,"Power Rangers as well, resulting in different episodes premiering at random days of the week.

If you weren't a show that had license to print money (i.e. Spongebob), you were getting shafted in promotion."
Glitch Techs,"I agree, I just thought 

> Back in the day, Nickelodeon was all about live-action shows (sketches, game shows, etc.) and Cartoon Network was the channel for Cartoons.



was incorrect"
Glitch Techs,"Hahaha! Yes, I always remember the episode where Big Pete has to go on a car journey with his Dad and he's worried that he will have nothing to talk about so he wrote cue cards!

Oh, and I love when Little Pete sells the house while the parents are on holiday! Ahhh, there are so many."
Spectros,"I might give it a go.

It's set in Liberdade in Brazil, home to one of the largest Japanese population, hence the Japanese themese in the story. I always wanted to visit that district but wasn't able to."
Spectros,"Just FYI, the showrunner for *Spectros* is [Douglas Petrie](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0677956/), he used to be a writer on *Buffy.*"

Spectros,"Jesus christ, just how bad was ragnarok that you gave it a lower rating than fucking Luna Nera???"
Spectros,Oh I didn't know that. Lol this makes sense for some reason.
Spectros,"> I gave up on the very 1st episode because of the amateur camera work.

Lol yea I mentioned this in the post. I don't know wtf was going on with the camera in episode 1 but it does get better though.

Not recommending that u give it another shot if you didn't find anything appealing though. Im glad I'm not the only one who noticed, maybe I'm not such a bad critic afterall. üòÖ"
Spectros,"I've only season the first season but diablero pissed me off so much. It was good at first but the characters just grew so stupid. I don't wanna spoil but they only managed to stop that thing that happens by pure fucking luck. Like, they literally gave zero fucking shits about what was happening, like, no urgency at all. I was practically screaming at my phone for them to actually do something and hurry the fuck up. And like, the priest was the most boring character ever and there wasn't any real reason for him in show because he basically did nothing, useless tbh."
Spectros,it was [this bad](https://streamable.com/cl2co).
Spectros,"i can't, lmfaoooo


And isnt that his sister, wtf???"
Spectros,"Just finished binging it, wow I loved this series. The acting was superb, the making of mini-doc revealed how carefully they constructed the details and considered the themes, and I am always excited about seeing women centered media (director, writer, costuming, story, actor, etc).

I disagree about the flashbacks being distracting. Often they connected to memories that Esty experienced while navigating new directions in her life. As the film approaches a climax (what will happen with her life) more is revealed about exactly how her past was so traumatic. It shows us what is at stake, why she is fighting for a future.

For the criticism from Orthodox community and reported inconsistencies, remember this is the story of just one specific community/sect of Orthodox Jews, and this can be used as an allegory for many different people's struggles."
Spectros,"This story of a young Hasidic woman who wants to leave her cloistered way of life is both heartbreaking and uplifting as it pits her courage and determination against the cruelty and arrogance of the insular and ignorant Hasidic community. If you thought the Hasidim were repugnant and obnoxious after watching the Netflix documentary ""One of Us,"" the dramatization of the true story in ""Unorthodox"" will not change your mind.  


One important correction: The subtitles repeatedly read that the Hasidim are praying in Yiddish. They do converse in Yiddish, but for Jews, including most definitely the ultra-orthodox Hasidim, the language of prayer is Hebrew. For those of us who know the difference, in ""Unorthodox"" the Hasidim are indeed praying in Hebrew. The film is correct but the subtitles are wrong."
Spectros,Just finished. This blew my mind. Sooo moving.
Spectros,does anyone know the name of the DJ group in episode 3?
Spectros,"Just a heads up. A lot of Orthodox Jews are a little annoyed at the series for exaggerating Orthodox, and specifically Hassidic, life. The allegedly non-fiction book that the series is based on was also found to have some problematic inconsistencies.

On an unrelated note, Shira Haas's Ruchama was my favorite character in ~~*Schlissel*~~*Shtisel* (up until her weird boyfriend storyline)."
Spectros,Can anyone tell me about what was happening in the kitchen in the scene where she suspects she is pregnant? It looks like lots of surfaces are covered in aluminium foil.
Spectros,"Last write-up in this series for a while. Will probably still be posting random stuff on here just won't be watching any new shows for the next 3-4 weeks. Hopefully within a month I'll still have my life and health to continue doing these. 

Next shows I'll be doing when I'm back at this should be Little Fries Everywhere. Also I'm making a 'Top Teen-Dramas of All Time' listicle for some reason idk. üò™

Anyways, stay safe guys!"
Spectros,Thanks for the list and the review of this series.  Now I have something to watch since I finished Tiger King.  BTW is that one not in the list because it is to new?
Spectros,Catnapp. The soundtrack for the show is on Spotify
Spectros,"I haven‚Äôt seen the show (only the trailer) but OF COURSE Orthodox Jews don‚Äôt like it. The Hasidic community is extraordinarily inclusive and they don‚Äôt want people knowing how dated their beliefs are, especially when it comes to women."
Spectros,"I tried to watch this show, and I'm not even up to anything controversial and can still see why. There's just an underlying disdain for them that makes the show really hard to watch."
Spectros,"Wow, I went down a rabbit hole of the debunking articles....

Reading that she wasn't really educated in that community, her family apparently supported her going to Sarah Lawrence, and she lived a more liberal Orthodox lifestyle than she claims, changes things. She actually had the kid while she was still married, and didn't leave until he was 7.   The real story sounds far more interesting!!

Shame she felt she had to craft a cookie cutter story to make her story more compelling to outsiders."
Spectros,"The show is called Shtisel, btw"
Spectros,I mean...they would say that...the point wasn‚Äôt to portray them in a good light...
Spectros,"Ruchami‚Äôs boyfriend was everything her father wasn‚Äôt, and she craved the sense of domestic normalcy missing from her home life."
Spectros,"That scene takes place during the holiday Passover (which lasts for eight days). Part of Jewish practice in general is maintaining a kosher (""clean"") kitchen. During most of the year this includes separating the meat and dairy etc. During Passover, however, this includes getting rid of all of the chametz (leavened bread). The aluminum foil is to ensure that no chametz from the rest of the year gets on their food/their food during Passover is clean. Some people will do a full spring cleaning for Passover but foil works too."
Spectros,"I believe they were fasting and she was feeling extra hungry because she was pregnant and the food was tempting her,  but she had to wait until the grandfather finished praying to eat."
Spectros,Have you seen Skam because if not your list won't be accurate.
Spectros,"I know I'm responding 3 months later but if you want something even more crazy than Tiger King, try Wild Wild Country."
Spectros,Insular*
Spectros,"Well sure, there's no shortage of scandals involving that community....but apparently the book is fiction. 

I think she feeds off really dated and unexposed beliefs about Hasidim too, and they're rightfully sensitive to that."
Spectros,"I mean, there‚Äôs that in Christian fundamentalist (big love) shows as well. Fundamental religious communities do not treat women well, and the protagonist in the show is a young woman. If the main character was an elderly patriarch in the society the tone likely would read different."
Spectros,"They talked a little about this in the ""how it's made"" portion after. They said that since the author was so well-known in communities surrounding this subject, she wanted to give Etsy a different life than her own. They wanted the discussion to be about the character, her story, and the Satmar community, not about the author. 

Because of this I get the sense that she weaved together a narrative from a lot of different experiences of people who left."
Spectros,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I was actually wondering about the aluminium foil. I read somewhere else that is to do with keeping the kitchen kosher."
Spectros,Of course I have lol. Top 3 teen drama!
Spectros,"Yeah, inclusive is literally the opposite haha"
Spectros,"Big Love went out of it's way to show them as real people, not caricatures to scorn. That's a great example of a show giving humanity to it's characters. You could argue too much.

I mean, if it's from the perspective of someone who is young and doesn't offer that, and the writers wanted to stay true to that, then it's not great source material."
Spectros,Would like to point out that Big Love was not based on Christian fundamentalists... it was based on Mormon fundamentalism.
Spectros,"I think it's also because the real person is problematic, and her stories didn't check out. Why else would they downplay the unique parts of her story and go with some generic cardboard cut out version of a person leaving a traditional community? 

I mean, what really happens here? She isn't happy, she has a mother that's left, she goes to find her, she makes some friends and finds herself drawn to an artistic outlet and gets an opportunity most do not, and during it all, her naive possibly autistic husband chases after her, finds her and gets rejected. In the big scheme of diabolical ""leaving the religion"" stories, nothing happens. The bit with the brother abducting her and the gun, is insane, and if it happened no doubt that was scarring, but then he ultimately walks away, he doesn't actually try to bring her back to NY."
Spectros,"I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúfundamentalist community‚Äù in Big Love which is out in the desert, which were basically the villains of the show, that the main characters escaped from. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community depicted in this show is an insular fundamentalist community the main character escape from."
Spectros,"No kidding, but aside from generically assuming all fundamentalists are the same, your comment has little value. Even among Hasidim there are different sects and traditions, and they feud. Some are more liberal while some oppose rock n' roll.  If there's no awareness or depth, then it's just saying ""boo religion"" or ""boo ultra orthodox Jews"", and that's boring unless you're predisposed to hating entire communities and want to feel validated in your hate."
Spectros,"Okay lol but the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal, they‚Äôre depicting a young girl being forced into marriage and forced into sex. 

So what are you trying to say in context of this argument. I‚Äôm not saying all religious communities are like this, but the specific story being told is of a community that is. So why should they treat that community with any reverence? If the acts they‚Äôre depicting in the show are brutal

And it‚Äôs not Jewish specific. A lot of fundamental communities of every religion, even the Amish, have groups that mistreat women and chalk it up to ‚Äúreligion‚Äù and it‚Äôs no excuse

I would harken back to ‚Äúbig love‚Äù - the community out in the desert in big love is not progressive, they force teen girls to marry the prophet, and are not treated kindly by the show at all. At the same time the main family in Big Love is shown empathy, even though they‚Äôre still a fundamentalist bigamist family, because they‚Äôre not doing inhumane things like the community out in the desert is. 

If this show was about a progressive Hasidic community that was treating young women kindly, why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

Should we just not tell the stories of women mistreated in fundamentalist communities for fear of sounding ‚Äúboo religion‚Äù? This goes for Amish, catholic, Mormon, Scientologist, Islam, Jewish, whatever."
Spectros,">the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,

Right, does the show bother to explain that?

Also, I'm not claiming to be familiar with her story, I'm reacting to just attempting to watch the show.. but she apparently really went to liberal Orthodox schools earlier in her life, so the depiction of the family isn't entirely accurate.

I see dramas about terrorists that deal with Islamic fundamentalism with more respect and depth.  I see more care with depictions of the Amish community (though improvements could be made for sure). The idea isn't to give reverence but to give characters depth, and that's what makes people interesting, and can influence societal change when it's eye opening.

As opposed to just gawking and demonizing. The fact that you're comparing this story to ""marrying the prophet"" cult like behavior from a group that splintered from the mainstream, is a problem. Big Love carefully explains who the group are and their stature with the more mainstream LDS church. It's a major plotline. 

\>why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

That's ridiculous. People leave religious families they're born into all the time.  I'm on her side with that (unless it's fiction, and a couple seconds on google suggests some of it was). And it's a common narrative in tv and film and theater. It's told all the time. But if you just have one dimensional stereotypical characters, you're not learning anything from that, it's not really exploring the predicament, it's just trying to expose bad people with an agenda against devout religiousness. In this case people think because they got a glimpse into homes they've never seen before, that's sufficient to make up for the lack of depth and humanity in the community it portrays. You can do that and still ultimately show people are wrong."
Spectros,"**People leave religious families all the time but they don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúescape‚Äù them as is shown in the show. Notice I said ‚Äúflee‚Äù not ‚Äúleave‚Äù. The story depicts an ‚Äúescape‚Äù not just someone turning their back on religion** 

And in regards to the memoir the show was based off of, if you asked me and my mom to recount an argument we had when I was a teen we would both give wildly conflicting stories. That doesn‚Äôt mean either of them are ‚Äúfiction‚Äù, it just means the people involved had different justifications and motivations to act the way they did. 

I believe the author that this is her side of the story, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs portrayed in the show. Her side, her perspective, her interpretation of how she felt. No one can spin that and say it‚Äôs ‚Äúfiction‚Äù unless you‚Äôre her.

It sounds like you just can‚Äôt handle any attack on a segment of Judaism, because my interpretation of it is that this community depicted in the show is very much a fragment of the larger Jewish community in Brooklyn, and they do not all engage in abhorrent behavior like forcing a young girl into sex slavery (aka, ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù), but for the people who are, their story is worthy of being told. 

It might not be ‚Äúmarrying the prophet‚Äù but it‚Äôs forcing young girls into reproductive slavery all the same through societal and financial pressure. These things are happening, in our country, and we have no obligation to give the people perpetrating them ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of character. 

**People using religion to keep women (and LGBT) down are the villains in today‚Äôs stories. So, it‚Äôs not an attack on religion, it‚Äôs an attack on the excuse and bastardization of religion.** 

In our post-post modern society religion has been torn down and disproven as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Catholic priests molest children. Female genital mutilation. Honor killings. Etc etc etc etc. But we‚Äôre still holding reverence for ‚Äúculture‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWomen in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for having pre-marital sex‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs their culture‚Äù

Or 

‚ÄúI had to have sex with the producer for this role‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how Hollywood is‚Äù 

**is no longer an excuse the public will permit**

Now, we‚Äôre dismantling tradition as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Just because your religion/community/ has customs and traditions to uphold, does not mean they will be permitted in the modern world. **Shame, and telling the story in a negative light, is one way of expressing the contempt for ‚Äútraditions‚Äù that do not fit into contemporary human rights and ethics, rather than glossing over violations because we feel it‚Äôs not our place to critique**

Side note: the show does not hold the orthodox community in distain for their differences; the way they dress, language spoken, or traditions. The elements of the show that put a negative light on the community are strictly the scenes that portray human rights violations."
Spectros,">>the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,
>
>Right, does the show bother to explain that?

You're right, the way they wrote the show I totally thought Esty was fleeing a liberal Hasidic sect üôÑ"
Spectros,"The movie literally has Yael explain the unique nature of the community. I know this was 12 days ago, but coming into this discussion from the outside, it seems like you are gathering evidence to support your conclusions."
Spectros,One of the most beautiful posts I've read in a long time. Spot on.
Spectros,Well said!!
Spectros,"You don't have to flee an orthodox Jewish family. 

Leaving any family, for any reason involving lack of acceptance, is difficult.  It's a story. If you can't handle a real life complicated depiction of these communities because you just want to bash people, then that's boring.

There is no perspective that can account for a fictional story. 

Her mom was easy to locate and didn't leave when she was a toddler, for example. 

Calling aranged marriage ""sex slavery"" is an extremist viewpoint, in my opinion. Totally dogmatic. Arranged marriages are still fairly accepted in some communities. I've known Indians, and Arabs who accepted their parents arrangements and as horrifying as it sounds at face value, they're happy. Sex slavery is a real thing, please dont' make light of it to feel better about the Netflix show you liked.

Look, some Satmars are nuts, but this isn't a story about one of those victims of nuttery. It's not sexual reproductive slavery or whatever dogmatic bullshit opinion you came to the show pre-formed. And cut the crap, you do care about their traditions which you just called human rights violations. You are Othering these people. It's a step away from claiming they fuck through a hole in a sheet. There are plenty of bad things you can say about Satmars, or any fundamental religious folks of any stripe, but again, in 2020, show they're humanity and stop the caricatures that re-affirm horrible stereotypes, and stop pretending you just watched a show that justified your jackassery biases."
Spectros,"She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood, went to Sarah Lawrence, and stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show."
Spectros,My conclusion is the show had an underlying disdain for the community that was hard to watch.... to which people defended it by expressing their disdain for the community. Just stop.
Spectros,"**It becomes sex slavery, and a human rights violation, when you do not give a woman the means to support herself outside of her reproductive capabilities, and only give the path of being a wife. Which is what is depicted. Raising a child from birth for the sole purpose of them becoming a wife and mother. The women are not even allowed to play musical instruments for fun in the strict rules of the community.**

The avenues allowed to them are to be a wife, or as in the show, run away and be ostracized from their community. Which leads to the ‚Äúleaving/fleeing/whatever‚Äù people being homeless, since they have no real world skills or means outside of their insular community, also depicted in the show. 

**That‚Äôs different than an arranged marriage, which i never said was a bad thing or a human rights violation**

Not giving women the option to choose their path in life, and raising them from birth with one end-goal (wife/mother) is a human rights violation, and raising them with the purpose of them being a reproductive servant. I.e. sex slave. So no, it‚Äôs not a reach.

**And it‚Äôs not ‚Äújackassery bias‚Äù. If a new cult was raising girls for the sole purpose of becoming a bride, raising them from birth, and forbidding them to learn skill or a trade that would be bona fide sex slavery. Just because this is a sect of Orthodox Judaism doesn‚Äôt change that. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying contemporary society will not tolerate ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs our tradition‚Äù, if it‚Äôs not ethical in the modern world it is not ethical in your old-fashioned society.**"
Spectros,An arranged marriage can be a form of sex slavery for someone who is pressured into it and someone who doesn't want it. I'm not saying that all arranged marriages are like that.
Spectros,">She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood... stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

This is something you used as an example of liberalism üò¨

>The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show.

I think Hasidic Judaism is a fairly problematic worldview, yes. I am aware some sects are more or less problematic than others, but they're all problematic to some degree. Note I didn't say all Judaism is problematic, I said **Hasidic** Judaism is problematic, in the way I believe all fundamentalist religion (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) is problematic. 

Are you saying no Hasidic Jewish sects whatsoever reflect the depiction? None at all? Because that's really the only way your argument has validity. Otherwise, it's actually showing what some Hasidic women live through, and that's a story worth telling even if it isn't Deborah Feldman specific story."
Spectros,"Criticism isn't disdain and you've clearly got some personal issues regarding the ability to rationalize differing opinions. I know exactly what happened, I just read through it all. You're wrong."
Spectros,"You told me you think I didn't respond well to the show because it involved Jews.... which is unintentionally your admission you liked it because it's critical of devout Jews. Too late.

You're not describing ""slavery"" or describing what goes on in Orthodox communities in New York.

It's fine that some of you liked this show, but not fine that in defending it,  you reveal really bigoted presumptions that this show just validated for you."
Spectros,"She agrees to the marriage and thinks it's what she wants.  Sure arranged marriage can be forced, but that's not what is depicted. She lived in New York, she always had the choice to lead her own life, which is what she did."
Spectros,"No, it's something this dumb ass series used as an example of her shedding her traditions for a liberal secular life. 

I doubt you know much about Hasidim and that's the problem here. What's really being depicted there that's so outrageous or unique to any Hasidic sect?  I hate all the Jewish characters in the show, including her. You don't have the first clue what they live through, because you projected it, nothing horrible happens in that film that's real or is commonplace. You can't possible think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction or have a brother in law pull out a gun. 

You can't defend this show by saying there are Hasidic stories worth telling...sure, but I'm criticizing this one."
Spectros,"Disdain is disdain. The series is presenting harmless everyday observances as if they're oppression. The Redditor I was conversing with took it farther. There's a point where criticism isn't an opinion and treads into bigotry.
You jumped into this because you sympathize with hating Hasidim apparently, and that's wrong. You're a clown."
Spectros,"Lol... I said that because when i compared it to other fundamentalist religious representations (big love) you acted like Orthodox Jews were supposed to be exempt. 

So girls in orthodox communities aren‚Äôt raised to be brides and mothers? Oh my mistake then. I live in Brooklyn, i don‚Äôt see any orthodox women having a job or running a trade. 

But I guess that‚Äôs just not ‚Äúbased in reality‚Äù and it‚Äôs all ‚Äúmy bias‚Äù 

**i‚Äôm against any fundamentalist community; Amish, Mormon, Jewish, that raises girls to be mothers with no other avenues. Or raises men to be fathers and tells them being gay is god‚Äôs mistake**

This is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about, you cannot claim people are being ‚Äúbiased against a culture‚Äù when they point out human rights violations within that culture. Something which is unethical is unethical even when cloaked in religion. 

Maybe the VAST majority of orthodox communities empower their young women, but you cannot negate the small percentage of those who are suffering.

And just to say it louder 

In case you didn‚Äôt hear 

**raising girls explicitly to be wives and mothers is a form of sex and reproductive slavery. If a community is guilty of that, i don‚Äôt give a fuck what religion they practice.**"
Spectros,"Just flipped through your recent comments, all you‚Äôre doing is calling people biased against Jews for watching this show on a bunch of different threads, weirdo - when you didn‚Äôt even watch it yourself ? Wtf is your problem the character are less ‚Äúone dimensional‚Äù if you watch more than 10 minutes"
Spectros,"I don't think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction, neither do I think many of them pull out guns. I never thought this and no one here believe the show is making these insane blanket statements except you.

It's clear you are projecting because you are making blanket statements about all viewers based on what you're worried they think.

You like blanket statements so you think everyone else does as well.

Projection."
Spectros,I'm jumped in because you're psycho
Spectros,"None of your rant is in the show. None of it.

No small portion of the show featured the Hasidic sects rituals...criticism of their beliefs to the point of ridicule beyond what the show is depicting is pretty blatant of you. 

Who the hell thinks Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust? Piss off."
Spectros,"I've since watched the series. The fact that it set people full of vitriol like yourself off on hate rants speaks volumes. 

The Jewish characters are all unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated.....and it's supposed to be representative of a Jewish community? If that's normal to you its because ...well, you already went on a bigoted rant."
Spectros,"Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

You forget what you already admitted earlier in this thread."
Spectros,"What's psycho is getting upset that some Jews grow their sideburns out. Which is really what that person used as an example of xenophobia.

You jumped in because you dislike some Jews."
Spectros,"**how can you say that none of my rant is in the show when the central problem in the show is hte main character was raised to be a wife and mother, and doesn‚Äôt know how to support herself outside of her community? That‚Äôs the whole show. Her trying to get a scholarship because she has no real-world skills and no money. That‚Äôs the WHOLE plot**

No one said ‚Äúall‚Äù ultra-orthodox have this experience, but if this is this person‚Äôs story who are you to tell them it‚Äôs problematic/false? 

Many fundy communities fall into the same trap of womb worship. If that‚Äôs not YOUR experience in them, then good for you, but you cannot say others share your experience.  

And i think it‚Äôs you who can ‚Äúpiss off‚Äù. Have fun setting women back 200 years with your pathetic blindness

If you‚Äôre fundy and you like it then good for fucking you, but maybe it hasn‚Äôt been so kind to others."
Spectros,"The main character is jewish and she doesn‚Äôt seem unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated."
Spectros,People disagreeing with your faulty assessment isn't a hate rant. Stop.
Spectros,">Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

I never said any of this. You must have me confused with someone else."
Spectros,"That doesn't equate ""reproductive slavery"". 

They're a strict religious community so there's lots to be critical of, especially if you dislike religious practices, but the darker more horrific story you describe isn't in the show. You projected your hate on to this community.

Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

Putting pressure on someone to consummate a marriage after a year, or to have a family with kids?.....It's obnoxious but it's not slavery. 

It's also fraud. The real girl went to Sarah Lawrence while observant, and became a writer. 

Hasidim exist in New York outside of their communities, and they work, drive, and have independence, and they can do that within their communities or out. The disadvantages of joining secular culture are not unique, and can't be equated to brutality. 

Nothing happened to this girl that girls haven't felt in the secular world either. Again, the sway the show depicts these people just validated hatred you already had."
Spectros,"There's nothing sympathetic about a girl who shows up to a top music program and insults them like she can just audition for piano. 

Or invites herself places.

Or who doesn't know what ham looks like, and eats anything put in front of her then panics....or educated about someone who hasn't seen Google (the entire purpose of that scene).

It goes on and on. That character couldn't be more ridiculous."
Spectros,"People outraged that some Jews don't cut their sideburns, and observe Passover by wrapping food in tinfoils isn't a hate rant.  Then you share their hate."
Spectros,Then why defend the show? Why are you elsewhere in the thread challenging a self defined Orthodox Jew to tell you what was inaccurate about the show?
Spectros,"
>Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

The fact you think any criticism of Hasidic Jews equates to what you stated above  is tiresome and unfortunately not at all shocking not shocking."
Spectros,God you sound like such an insufferable cunt.
Spectros,I'm Jewish jackass. Lmfao
Spectros,"The only other person I've discussed the topic with on reddit is not a ""self defined Orthodox Jew"", they said they're ""familiar with the Hasidic world"". All I did was tell him something to the effect of ""saying it's inaccurate is useless unless you give us examples of WHY you think it's inaccurate"". And I'll take this opportunity to say the same to you. What specifically is factually inaccurate?"
Spectros,"What's tiresome is that you think this series depicts every Ultra Orthodox Jew, because what else did it show? Don't invent shit that's not in the show itself to justify your thirst. 

I don't think any criticism of Hasidim is a problem, there's a lot to criticize, it's unfortunately YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, as depicted with this one dysfunctional family.  You decided its representative... because you have a disdain for those Jews."
Spectros,You sound insecure on the internet.
Spectros,Thank you.
Spectros,"Are you saying there aren't Jews who hate other Jews or Jews that are different than them, or more observant and it make it okay to express hate?  Take a hike."
Spectros,"You don't even know what you're reading. They literally said ""I grew up ultra-Orthodox"".

I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced your antisemitic ass that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  The fact is the author the story is based on was able to get an education and stopped wearing her wig while still living in Brooklyn.  You're clueless."
Spectros,"For someone who looks down your nose at others for allegedly making assumptions, you sure make a lot of your own.

>YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, 

When the fuck did I say that? That's not what I think. You have a chip on your shoulder."
Spectros,"Yikes, if you find yourself wondering why you can't maintain a healthy relationship, I have identified some factors"
Spectros,"You can't even detail what you think you saw that was oppressive and represents the community as a whole, because you know it would paint you as bigoted.

Yet you're in this thread chastising anyone that doesn't think this is an accurate depiction at all. Take a hike. The reason you're passionate about this at all is because you have the chip you didn't even realize you had until now, and you got called out for it. Feels bad for you I'm sure."
Spectros,"If you find yourself trying to psychoanalyze strangers on Reddit when they point out the shortcomings of your bigoted posts...you might just get a mirror and write ""sociopath"" and ""hateful"" on it."
Spectros,"No, pretty much only you and probably not much longer. 

Hasidic Judaism is fundamentalist religion. Sexist roles, xenophobia, ""my-group-is-better-than-everyone-else"" mentality backed by the word of God, virtue signaling taking precedence over actual virtue (not cutting your hair = virtue signal. Covering kitchen surfaces in foil to prevent yeast from contaminating Passover seder = virtue signal), insular bubble...

I'm not saying every single Hasidic Jew is like this, but some/many are."
Spectros,"You clearly know zero about Hasidim and couldn't site examples shown in the show.

You just rattled off a lot of assumptions that aren't in this series. 

And no, claiming you're an equal opportunist hater doesn't help.

I take it back saying you're a bigot was putting it nicely. You're worse."
Spectros,"Is [the official web site of a Hasidic sect](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/374918/jewish/Aluminum-Foil.htm) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? The same site also talks about [men not cutting the corners of their hair](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2963669/jewish/Why-Do-Some-Chassidic-Jews-Have-Long-Sidelocks-Peyot.htm). 

Is [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5212069) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? 

Virtue signals are negative things because they tend to serve as a substitute for virtue.

If I'm factually wrong, tell me what I'm missing rather than namecalling me."
Spectros,"Holy crap, you're a Grade A bigot. You just used examples religious Jews observing their holiday by avoiding bread or hiding it under tin foil as an example of oppression and justifying your hate mongering. Those are harmless customs you are depicting as proof they're bad people.
Men choosing not to cut the corners of their hair is an example of oppression to you?  

You're an idiot, I'm not going to bother pretending you're coming to this from a reasonable place and neither should you. 

It's not ""virtue signaling"" you just used Passover against Jews."
Spectros,"You're still just namecalling and getting angry at me for saying things you don't agree with, you're not giving me an example of what I'm saying that's incorrect you're kind of just angrily saying ""nuh-uh"". 

You're also not talking about the same thing I am, and you are putting words in my mouth.

**Religious groups, especially fundamentalist ones, have virtue signals. Displaying the virtue signals does not make anyone a bad person. I never said that because I don't believe that. I think virtue signals are problematic, that does not mean I think people who use them are bad.**

I'm not talking about hiding bread under foil or avoiding bread. I'm talking about [this](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1745/jewish/Preparing-the-Kitchen.htm). It's not hurting anyone per se, but thinking God cares about such minutiae is genuinely sad to me and seems pretty unhealthy.

The whole point of the first Passover meal is that the Jews in Egypt had no time to prepare. They were in such a hurry they ate unleavened bread and drank unfermented wine.

This level of intricate, time-consuming preparation performed by many Hasidic Jews is quite the opposite of the original Passover described in the Torah. Passover was a hastily prepared meal in advance of an impending visit from an angel of death. The Jews in Egypt weren't covering kitchen surfaces and heavily scrubbing pots and ovens, they were throwing together a meal as quickly as humanly possible."
Spectros,"That's a lot of minutia for clueless bigot. Now you're gatekeeping and saying one group of Jews in their diaspora don't practice correctly? You're a fricken Rabbi now? Get a life. It took me two seconds on google to see that preparing for Passover by removing, burning or temporarily hiding leavened bread is part of their custom. You hate some Jews, you're not smart, and you're actually critical of their religious observance as Jews, which makes you antisemitic."
Spectros,">I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced [you] that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  

Remember how I never said that and don't believe that? The show never said that either. 

>clueless

>bigot. 

>Get a life. 

>not smart, 

>antisemitic

That's a strong argument you've got there. Have a good one. Sorry you're so angry."
Spectros,"The problem is you're making bigoted lifeless, idiotic, clueless and antisemitic ""arguments"" and you're upset at the response you're getting.

Really...what kind of person gets upset that Jews hide their bread for a week in the privacy of their own homes and uses that as an example of xenophobia, or oppression?"
Spectros,"Nitpick, but Israel isn't in africa.."
Spectros,Is that really a nitpick? It seems like a pretty weird mistake rather than just a detail
Spectros,"That's not nitpicking, its called an expectation, that people know basic geography"
Spectros,"Its not nitpicking. Of all the countries in the world, its the one that owes the most of it fame to where it happens to be situated."
Spectros,just checked the map n ur right it's just outside africa. im a dumbass my bad.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,What's next? A video game?
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Don't forget about their ""kids and family"" show. No, that's not a joke."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Strongly feel they‚Äôre moving way too fast with this. I‚Äôm a moderately big fan - having read all 8 books and played the games - but the first season was too lacklustre and uneven to already be the basis for this huge property.

Obviously room to grow and I hope it does, but it should find some definite footing before it overexerts itself. Haven‚Äôt even checked out the Vesemir anime because the style of the show left me with zero interest to delve deeper into its interpretation of the Witcher world."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I fgeel like the quality opf season 2 will basically make or break this. The first wasn't terrible, but it had a fair bit of writing and pacing issues. They also blew their load waaaay too hard by having the actress who played Renfri play Renfri, instead of Triss. Having never read the books, I 100% thought that was how the two first met.

Also, after the first episode, the few action scenes were rather weak. Allegedly the crew behind the first episode fight are doing the whole season, but we'll see. I genuinly hope the show jumps hard in quality, since I thought they gave it a solid shot at the beginning, it just needs to be...better. If this were on any other network, I doubt it would have got a second season to begin with (Also, that whole timeline thing needs to fuck right off please)."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"You should all check out The Witcher 3, it's pretty underrated...."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Oversaturation is tight
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,They need to get all the merch and money now before they cancel it after the second season.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,The cartoon was awesome. Hope they do another one soon.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,The first season was wildly uneven. But I guess it was a hit on Netflix and they think they are at a point where they can brute force a hit out anything. ü§∑
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Witcher was unwatchable.  Plot was without momentum and convoluted lacking necessary exposition so shotgunned it everywhere, exploitation of women via nudity for eyeballs, action the typical above the waist heavy cutting style."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Netflix said that they were looking for their own harry potter and start wars, i think this is it"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,They oughtta write a book about this.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,You just had to go and remind me.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Netflix have to strike while the iron is hot. They tend to like to wrap up their shows at the 3-5 season mark so there is no time to waste if they want to get spin-off prequel miniseries and anime companion movies launched while the show is still running.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"The acting was so bad in the first season. Also, Henry Cavill is too stiff as Geralt. Gerald isnt just some brooding person, he actually has nuance too him and humour."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"The anime was way too happy to revel in violence, it‚Äôs pretty gross."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Well, how you feel doesn't matter. Presumably you are not going to cancel your Netflix subscription because they make something you don't intend to watch (and you will probably watch anyway).

The Witcher was a big succes for Netflix and the show was a hit with women, which is good for retaining subscribers.

They took a gamble with the first season because there wasn't enough production time, but despite the fact that the end-result was rough around the edges, it paid off for them."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Nightmare of the wolf was bad.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Never heard of it, clearly didn't make much of a big name in the RPG genre."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Its not underrated lol, it's one of biggest single player games ever and won multiple awards

Edit: I was hoodwinked!"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Nah, second season will be good but not great. Season 3 is where they'll hit their stride. And then cancel it."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I found the cartoon to be funny because of the disparity between the more grounded style of the live action show and the over-the-top, anime-style presentation of the animated feature.

In the main show, Geralt's fighting style looks smooth as shit but is not acrobatic. In the animated movie, Vesemir continually flies through the air, defying gravity like a Jedi. In the main show, Geralt's telekinetic blast might stagger some dudes, and I don't think he used the fire sign even once. In the animated movie, Vesemir uses Igni to engulf dozens of monsters in instant infernos and melt all the ice of a frozen lake in a matter of seconds.

Cartoon Vesemir can take on an army of monsters single-handedly, whereas live action Geralt has trouble with a single striga. I thought that shit was funny."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I REALLY hope they make animes with the short stories they missed. Like "" A little Sacrifice "" or "" Shard of Ice """
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Yeah, Netflix put a gun to the head of everyone and forced them to watch. The show was a massive hit. 

Cope."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"A very boring ""Harry Potter or Star Wars"". Even LotR seems like a balls to the walls action movie compared to this abomination. The actors are great tho, but that's not nearly enough."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Henry Cavill is just too stiff an actor. He doesn't play differently in any film - always just dull. 

Crazy people think he's good as Superman, when he's even too stiff for Geralt."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,".. it‚Äôs the bloody Witcher world. There‚Äôs many things to criticize about that movie (hello, a peasants revolt + some mages took Kaer Morhen, not some weird beasts), its not the amount of violence you should complain about."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"They control the production time. If there wasn't enough, that's their fault.

We don't know yet if it paid off for them. They're still gambling on it."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"You sound like you would watch and hype every stupid show Netflix puts out.

Try HBO for once, you might step up a bit."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,I suspect he's joking.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,OP has your number son
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Honestly, he kind of is a perfect Superman since Superman is supposed to be very stoic and a Boy Scout type."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"We know it paid off for them. Because of this thing called numbers. Like viewing numbers.

High viewing numbers + high social media engagement = good = gamble paid off.

You understand?"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Thank you for your valuable input :-)

It's clear that you have a lot of interesting things to say. It's a shame that society doesn't appreciate you."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,But Christopher Reeves and even Brandon Routh played Superman very well. Cavill very much looks the part but he was far from embodying Superman.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,">since Superman is supposed to be very stoic

NOPE, absolutely NOT. And I say this as someone whose exposure to Superman isn't limited to the movies.

Also, I say this as someone who watched various Superman cartoons/animations and read a good number of Superman comics, and also watches the current ""Superman & Lois"" TV show.

And personality wise, Clark Kent is a mixture of Peter Parker and Steve Rogers. So he's certainly not the stoic figure you think he is."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Success means viewers come back for season 2, and 3, and beyond, plus the spinoffs. It can't have paid off yet, since the products have yet to release.

Understand?"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Also, Tyler Hoechlin from the 'Superman & Lois"" TV show. He perfectly captured what Superman/Clark Kent is supposed to be like.

Superman/Clark Kent is not a stoic figure. Clark Kent/Superman has a real personality, a love for home, friends and family, and hope and enthusiasm that‚Äôs infectious. Clark Kent is meant to be a good person who does what he believes is right and loves to help people. And he also has very friendly interactions with civilians, especially children. All of those traits are perfectly captured by Tyler Hoechlin in ""Superman & Lois""."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Clark Kent is definitely not a mix of Peter Parker. He is not a comedian type of character. I would say Superman is a mix of Reed Richards and Steve Rogers.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I understand that you don't know how to read. I wrote:

""They took a gamble with the **first season** because there wasn't enough production time, but despite the fact that the end-result was rough around the edges, it paid off for them.""

The **first season** was a success.

Even if the second season is less successful, the first season will still be a succes.

And of course, I know this will confuse you, but the likelihood that the second season of a show is going to be successful is greater if the first season is successful."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Haven't yet watched Superman and Lois but Tyler Hoechlin was great on Supergirl and exactly what I imagined Clark Kent and Superman to be.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"When I compared Clark Kent  to Peter Parker, I absolutely didn't mean the ""comedian"" part. There is a LOT MORE to Peter Parker's personality than his quips.  I was actually referring to the other important aspects of Peter Parker's personality, like his optimism, idealism, enthusiasm, moral values, huge respect for his parental figures, friendliness and the way Peter interacts with others, especially children.

Like Peter Parker and Steve Rogers, Clark Kent is a very hopeful and optimistic character. Like Peter Parker and Steve Rogers, Clark Kent at his core is a good person. Just like them, Clark Kent is  an optimist who tries to make a cynical world better. Stories of Clark Kent/Superman are about him making a city that thinks being cynical is being smart or adult and making them believe in good and literally ‚Äúlook, up in the sky‚Äù again. Also, Superman/Clark Kent isn‚Äôt meant to be perfect. He‚Äôs meant to be a good person who does what he believes is right and loves to help people.

Also, like Peter Parker, Clark Kent has a real personality, a love for home, friends and family, and hope and enthusiasm that‚Äôs infectious. That's what I meant when I compared Clark Kent to Peter Parker. Clark Kent/Superman may not be a quipster, but he is not the stoic and super serious figure that you said. And just like Peter Parker, Clark Kent has very friendly interactions with civilians and especially children. The extremely friendly way Superman and Spider-Man interact with others are also very similar.

Peter Parker and Clark Kent both have pretty much similar personality traits regarding their optimism, idealism, enthusiasm, moral values, huge respect for their parental figures, friendliness and the way they interact with others, especially children."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I highly recommend the ""Superman & Lois"" TV show then. This show is much better than all the other Arrowverse  shows, both in terms on writing and in terms special effects."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,">	‚ÄúSuperman doesn‚Äôt save people because he thinks they‚Äôre weak or frail. He saves them because he has the power to, because he ***wants*** to.‚Äù"

Yes, I agree with that."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,The [six-year deal](https://twitter.com/Lucas_Shaw/status/1423255883501473805) includes [6 more seasons of South Park as well as 14 SP movies for Paramount+](https://twitter.com/Lucas_Shaw/status/1423256423308439555)
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Damn, you would think they would be burned out by now. That money is great motivation though."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"But what about a new game?

The writing for SoT was the best thing to come out of South Park in recent years."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,They should give some of that cash to casa bonita
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Paramount: please include uncensored, m'kay?"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,This is great news for the ten people subscribed to Paramount+
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Finally we'll get Basketball 2, with Lamar Odom i hope."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,I'd like a 3rd game. Star Trek vs Star Wars?
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Really this is how they're going to get around their deal with HBO Max after they probably had an ""oh shit, we probably should've saved this one for our platform"" moment and realized that if they can produce longer episodes and call them movies they can put them on their own platform.

&#x200B;

You want the South Park episodes? Comedy Central and HBO Max

You want the South Park episodes that are longer? Paramount+"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Six Seasons and ~~a~~ FOURTEEN movies!
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,So South Park is going to be the Spongebob for adult audiences for Paramount pretty much.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Hot damn! I was just listening to a directors commentary for Bigger, Longer and Uncut from Matt and Trey that they recorded years after the flick where they were saying they could make that movie in a month or less with the new technology they have available. I hope this isn't just a cash grab and they really let it tip because when they're on and inspired they're literal masters of satire."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are already worth $800mil and $900mil. This will make them the wealthiest comedians in the world, beating our Jerry Seinfeld's $950mil."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Aren‚Äôt all the episodes of the show on hbo max tho? So confusing!
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"The *real* story here is that we're witnessing the collapse of the television industry and the major players are *scrambling* to salvage their business by trying to cobble together streaming services.  Paramount+ is *desperate* for content.  It's not enough to just throw your back catalog of content on there--these channels need *exclusive new content* that can bring in new subscribers.  That's what this is about, pure and simple.  

Last week the Fox network averaged **below 1 million viewers in prime time**--the first time that‚Äôs ever happened to one of the top four broadcast networks.  Viewership on *all* networks has plummeted over recent years.  Paramount+ originally launched as CBS All Access with Star Trek Discovery as an exclusive.  Nearly everything else was back catalog.  How many millennials are going to subscribe/be retained by 9 seasons of black & white Perry Mason?  *That's why a deal like this gets made.*  Paramount+ desperately needs new, exclusive content to fill out its menu.  It's the same reason why Netflix paid Dave Chappelle $60 million for 3 standup specials. Neither Chappelle nor South Park has been super relevant for nearly 15 years prior--but both are well known and beloved by key demographics.  You're going to see more deals like this made over the next 12 months as the broadcast/cable industry further collapses."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Team america 2??
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Niice. Really hope for a third game too, the 2 on ps4 are fantastic"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I think they owe us nothing and even if this is a cash grab, I wouldnt be disappointed.  South Park has given so much and has been reinventing itself over and over.  

That being said, they are passionate and creative.  I look forward to what they do here."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Well this is awesome. It's nice knowing a show you love will be locked in for years to come. No worrying about cancellation or the network not renewing it.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,That's a lot of Casa Bonita money.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,I still remember getting my grandpa to take 12 year old me to the first South Park movie‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶the look of what the fuck to laughing hysterically on his face was simply amazing! He was a South Park fan until his passing after that movie!
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,The South Park movie was one of my favorite's growing up. Let's hope they can maintain that level of quality for future productions.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,This overall deal has to be one  of the biggest of all time right? Game of Thrones guys got 100 million each. Ryan Murphy is the biggest I can find. Netflix gave him 300 million.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,#CancelSouthPark worked out well lol
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Casa Bonita just increased their price 850 million
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Viacom really striking while the iron‚Äôs hot, huh?"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I'm old enough to remember when headlines like this called them the ""controversial creators of South Park"""
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Yeah but could they actually just finish the fucking season I paid $30 **last September** for?
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,What about HBOMAX?  I just switched from HULU and I don't want to buy P+
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,That is a lot of money.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Never would have thought South Park would last so long and still be good, unlike The Simpsons."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"So, does that mean I‚Äôll only get South Park on Paramount Plus then? Someone explain this to me cuz these streaming subscriptions are messing me up on which ones I should have."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"Wow, I figured I'd seen the last of South Park a few months ago. I'm glad it's still around. *Someone* has to crap all over the world."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I love the South Park guys above pretty much any other American comedy creators.  
But. Getting older and richer does not improve your observational comedy."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"They‚Äôre getting their bag, good for them. They deserve it"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I love South Park, was a fan from back when ""The Spirit of Christmas"" was just a viral video (one of the first of those).

but damn...14 movies sounds like a lot."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,A new film would be great but I'd prefer a new game.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"They have been at this shit for almost 30 years and still going, good on them but what does a post South Park world look like? Does it keep going like the Simpsons?"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"The best part is all the younger people I know call this the non-PC show. It's funny because they know going in that it's not PC and that's OK. It's from 'another generation' they say. 

I am just surprised they can still get away with it all these years later. Love South Park!"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,[removed]
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"As much as I‚Äôd like South Park to end at some point, it‚Äôs the only show to either get better or remain of a consistent super high quality for the amount of time it‚Äôs been on air. It‚Äôs unarguably the greatest American cartoon (adult too) made and I‚Äôm not even worried about the quality by the end of this 30 season renewal or it‚Äôs films."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,well looks like i am pirating it. zero chance i sign up for paramount. what happened to hboMAX?
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Does this mean new stuff soon? üò¨
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,We need bigger longer and uncut 2 and team america 2 please.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"""Everyone is too PC, it's like you're not even allowed to make offensive jokes anymore!""

*Receives almost a billion dollars for making offensive jokes*"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"TIL South Park is still going... and apparently bigger than ever. Damn, well done!"
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,HELL YEA south park is amazing so happy to hear this I was worried after they said they liked making the games more cause personally I much enjoy the show
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,I wish South Park would go to Netflix or a more consumer-friendly streaming platform.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,That‚Äôs a ludicrous amount of money. Remember when R.E.M. broke records with a 40 million dollar contract in the early 90‚Äôs? This is almost a billion dollars! That‚Äôs crazy.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"I remember seeing the first episodes of this when I was in 5th grade at a friends sleepover. Can‚Äôt believe this is still running 24yrs later goddamn, good on them."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Wow. I almost thought they were getting close to retire. Guess it's not over yet.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,I‚Äôd like to see a deeper Goths/Vampires storyline.
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,"So fucking good at parody. 
They‚Äôre amazing creators."
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,Anyone else think that was Joe Gatto from Impractical Jokers at first glance?
The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,This is the best news I‚Äôve heard‚Ä¶
Love Is Blind,I don‚Äôt know what this means; but I‚Äôm pretty sure I hate it.
Love Is Blind,‚ÄúStars‚Äù
Love Is Blind,I‚Äôll give it a chance‚Ä¶seems like a rip off of Are You The One
Love Is Blind,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
Love Is Blind,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
Love Is Blind,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
Love Is Blind,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
Love Is Blind,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
Love Is Blind,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
Love Is Blind,Didn't see that coming
Love Is Blind,I thought all these reality ‚Äústars‚Äù humiliated themselves for free and internet points.
Love Is Blind,‚Ä¶And not enough screen time‚Ä¶
Love Is Blind,"What season was he on? Don‚Äôt remember the guy.

Edit; season 2, and he wasn‚Äôt even one of the people who picked a partner iirc"
Love Is Blind,"As God is my witness, I did not think these people got paid"
Love Is Blind,Corporations underpaying employees? It‚Äôs sad that‚Äôs now a reality. üò£
Love Is Blind,Their contacts are iron clad
Love Is Blind,Courts set aside contracts literally all the time.
Love Is Blind,Show me when it has done so for a reality tv show? I'm sure the contract calls for arbitration as well. It's very unlikely this will ever see court.
Love Is Blind,If only because they will settle first.
Love Is Blind,"The secret to this show is just being like ""hey, let's just keep dating and not get married in a month"""
Love Is Blind,"If anyone is wondering, here is where Nick bought his wedding pants. 

https://getcalicocutpants.com

They actually sell them like that, it wasn‚Äôt sweat.  They are sold out now, but you can see on that website that they actually come like that with that mark."
Love Is Blind,"The entire show is awkward cringe , and honestly I like that kinda stuff so it drew me in."
Love Is Blind,"I've been tempted to check out the new season just because someone I went to school with and was in my graduating class, Deepti, is in the new season."
Love Is Blind,Great show if you love trash TV!!! I‚Äôm addicted
Love Is Blind,Netflix will be the service that finally greenlights *Ouch My Balls*.
Love Is Blind,"I have never been one for Reality TV, and this might be the scum on the bottom of the worst one. But I love it. My wife and I and another couple and our kids get together have a few glasses of wine in golden wine glasses and take bets on these stupid ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù."
Love Is Blind,"I would recommend watching a few eps of the US version then a few eps of the Japanese version that was just released. It feels like getting whiplash they are so different. The basic premise and even the sets are the same, but the way they talk in the pods, talk to each other and just generally conduct themselves is completely different. It‚Äôs a pretty interesting insight into the 2 cultures honestly."
Love Is Blind,Choosing that photo as representative of the show is hilarious hahah
Love Is Blind,I know the basic premise of the show and that was enough. I'm not much of a reality show fan but kudos to you who are.
Love Is Blind,"This show is amazing.  Moves fast enough to keep you engaged and it's such trashy trash.

There are two other versions from other countries and it's fascinating to watch those and see the differences in the culture in other countries."
Love Is Blind,"I thought that was the point of trash reality tv

Just how cringe it is"
Love Is Blind,This is me and my wife's biggest trash TV gem lol. We binged the season in like 2 days. It's a cringeworthy and extremely entertaining train wreck.
Love Is Blind,"My wife and I watched it, not sober, but it really felt like some of them were either reading directly from a script or had trouble articulating whatever the producers asked lol"
Love Is Blind,"Okay so here is my theory: I think this show is entirely scripted‚Ä¶ by AI. I think someone has fed data from reality shows, dating shows etc through an program that then spit out random phrases and cliches, and then just divvied them out among the ‚Äústars‚Äù.

And to take it one step further, because why not, I‚Äôm anonymous on the internet: I think at least some of this ‚Äúacting‚Äù is actually a test of CGI/deep fake technology. It‚Äôs the only reasonable explanation for wild characterizations, over-emoted lines and responses, and completely unbelievable decisions and plots. 

You heard it here first, folks!"
Love Is Blind,Dumb article
Love Is Blind,ITT: white women who love tacky reality tv shows.
Love Is Blind,Whoever wrote this probably never heard or watch Sexy Beast
Love Is Blind,"You will never, ever know who a person is until you live with them. The 'dating' version of them is not the same."
Love Is Blind,"Yah, the entire premise of the show breaks down at the end when they are forced to decide whether or not to marry someone they've only known for a month. A lot of these couples might be able to make things works if they were able to take time to grow their relationship like a normal couple. There isn't really any coming back from someone saying no to marrying you at the altar. That has to create some truly traumatic memories for these people."
Love Is Blind,"I really don't understand why the couples don't do this. Unless they get a huge cash bonus for going through with it....even if so divorce is expensive. 

They must think their 15 minutes of fame will be extended if they stick with it."
Love Is Blind,She left him at the altar because‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt give. You gotta give.
Love Is Blind,I'm so confused... why do men want pants where it looks like a little pee dribbled out??
Love Is Blind,"It‚Äôs my biggest guilty pleasure, and I love every bit of it honestly. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of editing and manipulating that occurs (it feels like this show has an endless budget. Also really hope Sal doesn‚Äôt actually play the ukelele with every girl he meets)... but those weddings, and the reactions, are just way too genuine to think they‚Äôre scripted too. It‚Äôs very hard to fake the amount of sweat Nick was producing"
Love Is Blind,[deleted]
Love Is Blind,Check it out.  She's the hero of the series.
Love Is Blind,"Yoooooooo, you know Deeps? She comes off very well on the show. I just hope she‚Äôs doing ok, cause the Buzzfeed interview gives a vibe that this was a stressful experience for her."
Love Is Blind,Is she as kind and sweet as she comes off in the show? I just love her. üò≠
Love Is Blind,She is the shining light what was a dumpster fire of a season.
Love Is Blind,The scene in the photo where he goes to her apartment for the first time and see she‚Äôs still a child whose friends break furniture while in a corn outfit had me laughing so hard. I watched that scene 3 times and it keeps getting better. It‚Äôs like a scene from the office- so bad it‚Äôs good. And he still married her!!!!
Love Is Blind,"If you actually wanna watch a dating show with normal people, watch Love Is Blind: Japan. 

It‚Äôs actually insane how different the shows are. All the contestants on the Japanese version have actual personalities and most of them were actually smart people.  

I hate that all American dating shows are just filled with the trashiest, dumbest, shallow people. Why can‚Äôt they get normal, likable people? Love is Blind: Japan was a breath of fresh air."
Love Is Blind,90 day fianc√©e is the scum left over after you scrape the barrel.
Love Is Blind,"The US is also full of normal people with actual intelligence, but for some reason, all of our dating shows only show the stupid, ugly Americans stereotype people. It‚Äôs honestly embarrassing. 

Why can‚Äôt we just have 1 dating show in this country with above average intelligence contestants like the Japanese one had?"
Love Is Blind,The US version feels tame compared to Brazil version where every couple was fucking on the first night.
Love Is Blind,You kinda had me in the first half
Love Is Blind,At least sexy beats had funny moments...
Love Is Blind,There's a good dating show in that idea
Love Is Blind,"Divorce isn‚Äôt expensive if you‚Äôre not trying to fuck the other person over. (And vise versa) 

My divorce was like $400, we actually worked together like civilized humans on how to divvy things up *including* custody/child support.  It didn‚Äôt have to amicable, I could have put her through the wringer if I wanted to - but why? What‚Äôs the point?

Children is generally where things get dicey and the lawyers start getting involved, but obviously other factors like uneven ‚Äòworth‚Äô can come into play as well."
Love Is Blind,"There are 3 reasons I can think of . . . 

1. ""Fame"" that leads to social media followers and possible revenue from that.
2. The show provides them a budget for most of the wedding expenses so this can be a much less expensive path to the altar.
3. Some folks genuinely think they can't find someone any other way. 

And bonus . . . some of the first season cast have gone on to other shows. One of the upcoming The Challenge spinoffs will have a Love is Blind cast member."
Love Is Blind,With social media their 15 minutes of fame can be extremely lucrative through sponsored posts.
Love Is Blind,"Couples might do that.  It probably just gets edited out, and the people give some answer for the show."
Love Is Blind,"My divorce costed at most, 70 bucks. It was civil, so we didn't need a lawyer for splitting belongings, we just worked it out. It takes forever though."
Love Is Blind,"That‚Äôs how they sell them. It‚Äôs not pee. That website sells them so now you know that it‚Äôs not actually dribble. 


‚Ä¶..

It‚Äôs actually a skit from I think you should leave (Netflix) . More info here: https://www.avclub.com/benevolent-genius-creates-calico-cut-pants-site-for-cha-1847354422/amp"
Love Is Blind,I love it too! I do think it was hot AF the day they filmed because the officiant was equally sweaty. I haven't watched the final ep yet though! Can't wait to see who gets married.
Love Is Blind,TV is actually pretty great now. Just because a niche show exists doesn't mean other shows don't.
Love Is Blind,"Oh tell me enlightened random Redditor what do you do with your spare time for enjoyment?

You're a fucking tool dude, I hope you're some edgy 15 year old that talks shit about the Kardashians because that's all you have going for your personality."
Love Is Blind,"I never used to watch reality tv stuff, but lately real life has been a little too intense, and I‚Äôve noticed my habits of watching intense dramatic television has waned and now I enjoy to binge stand up specials , British baking shows, and unfortunately awful reality television. I‚Äôm not proud, but we all cope with life in different ways."
Love Is Blind,Congrats on getting back to in school teaching
Love Is Blind,"Her wedding moment was great, very happy for her"
Love Is Blind,"I honestly can't recall very well lol. We were class of 09 so this was over a decade ago, and I was never really friends with her, and I was rather shy and introverted in school. I didn't break out of my shell so to speak until my early 20s.

 I recall her being a really good student, and generally friendly. She was overweight back then as well. So it's great to see the glowup she's had and I'm super happy for her and her apparent success in life."
Love Is Blind,She is a bit nutty tho. She should be in a peanut costume.
Love Is Blind,"I have only seen the first episode of the Japan show but many of the people are clearly and admitted shallow (some of the things the women say in particular made my wife and I just shake our heads) but I still enjoyed it and will finish the season out. I haven't seen the American version but can imagine the difference. Interesting concept for a show, that's for sure!"
Love Is Blind,Just can‚Äôt do subtitles‚Ä¶. Or I would.
Love Is Blind,If only all divorcees could be so sensible
Love Is Blind,"Exact same. I went to the library and found a book with the legal paperwork for divorce, photo copied it, typed it up on my work computer because in the early 90‚Äôs, I didn‚Äôt have a personal computer, edited for our specific situation, giving it to soon-to-be-ex, and we talked through the specifics of things we each wanted, including custody, edited again with everything we discussed, signed, and filed. The judge asked me if I was a lawyer. üòÇ I was early 20‚Äôs.   When neither of you barely have enough money to live, much less for a lawyer, but you both really want to be divorced you ‚Ä¶*Jeff Goldblum voice* ‚Ä¶find a way. 

I will say, we were separated for a couple years before we finally divorced. I had family medical insurance through work and he didn‚Äôt, and there weren‚Äôt significant others for either of us, so there was no rush."
Love Is Blind,"This is the only reason people go on The Bachelor anymore. Go on there, be memorable (whether that means be an asshole or endearing depends on the person), never work again now that you‚Äôre an influencer."
Love Is Blind,"Wowa, raw nerve right here"
Love Is Blind,If you don't read subs I feel bad for you son
Love Is Blind,Just another scourge on society.
Love Is Blind,"If they're asking the photographers to do it free, they're like also asking the caterer, the florist, the DJ, the officiant, the bartender...

That's ridiculous.

And as the story says, Netflix probably doesn't even know (well, they do now). Kinetic Content is who asked, not Netflix."
Love Is Blind,"I'm sorry Mr Landlord, I don't have any cash to pay my rent this month, do you take exposure?"
Love Is Blind,"In the words of Harlan Ellison: ‚ÄúFuck you, pay me. Do you go into work for free? Do your bosses? You all wouldn‚Äôt get off the fucking couch if you weren‚Äôt getting paid and you want me to do it for free? Fuck you. Cross my palm with silver and work I shall provide.‚Äù

Edit: This thread has revealed I've been misquoting Harlan for years. A friend of mine sent me this quote on Facebook years ago and I just picked it up and ran with it since it sounded like something he would say. I even printed it out on a little card and put it on my computer...damn.

Here's a link to the actual quote / story: [Pay the Writer - Harlan Ellison](https://youtu.be/mj5IV23g-fE?t=13)"
Love Is Blind,"If you don't want to pay for photos, take them yourself on an iPhone or something."
Love Is Blind,"This seems to be the norm now for any professional ‚Äòtalent‚Äô work. The one I hear the most is ‚Äúour budget can‚Äôt stretch to provide any financial benefit for you however this opportunity will provide you with incredible exposure‚Äù

So wait, you‚Äôre a YouTube star worth multiple millions and you can‚Äôt afford a couple of hundred I ask for a bespoke track?"
Love Is Blind,I find it hard to believe this is prompted by Netflix and not by whatever shithead exec at whatever production company it is that is producing the show.
Love Is Blind,"If I was a photographer, I'd see how far I could go with taking the gig only to leave them high and dry while telling the producers to go fuck themselves. Or maybe find some loophole in the contract that allowed me to deliver really low-res photos that were practically useless. Some means of sending a message."
Love Is Blind,Maybe the producers might like to work for exposure to help the photographers pay their bills?
Love Is Blind,"‚ÄúUnpaid, but your photos will be used for promos‚Äù they say ‚Äúbut‚Äù as if that‚Äôs a justification for being unpaid. If anything, them using it for widely viewed promos should mean they pay MORE."
Love Is Blind,"‚ÄúBut, think of all the exposure you‚Äôll be getting!‚Äù 

Yeah, because exposure pays my bills during a pandemic. Fuck off with your ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù"
Love Is Blind,r/choosingbeggars
Love Is Blind,When is the last time anyone hired a photographer just because they daw his name on a social media pictures for a Netflix show? When is the last time social media posts had the photographer name? That's why these gigs need to pay.
Love Is Blind,"As an artist, fuck these people."
Love Is Blind,[Fuck You. Pay Me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZGra65Nob4)
Love Is Blind,Of course they want an unpaid photographer. I also want an unpaid plumber and an unpaid dentist and an unpaid accountant.
Love Is Blind,"I just shot my first feature length film. Very low budget but everyone got paid, down to the extras. Even a few people out of film school got paid by the school as interns. Either pay everyone or everyone works for free out of love. The only one who didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúpaid‚Äù was our producer, but he‚Äôll get the distribution rights (also, he came in at the very end to take over from a previous producer that we had to kick out, long story). To cover a hole in the budget left by the previous producer, I declined the screenwriting fee, but still got paid for directing. 

So yeah, fuck these guys for trying to use some poor photographer. This isn‚Äôt Netflix doing it btw, but the production company that is hired to do produce the show."
Love Is Blind,"Wow, saw a thread on choosingbeggars. Didn't think it'd blow up this quick."
Love Is Blind,"Paid in exposure, as in that thing people in the desert die from."
Love Is Blind,"Love is Blind was great because it started as a dumb, fun, sweet premise and then immediately devolved into two charismatic sociopaths emotionally torturing a group of strangers."
Love Is Blind,‚ÄúDo it for the exposure.‚Äù Musician here. That‚Äôs the oldest bullshit scam for artists of all kinds. Nope!
Love Is Blind,"Title: Love is Blind

Subtitle: And Our Producers are Dumb"
Love Is Blind,Yea for a company that‚Äôs worth 30 billion paying a photographer would be too much ...

El final del para√≠so,"Dude, this was the thing to watch in Brazil during the afternoons. They aired it every day for years, to the point it was impossible to find a kid that didn't know ""Chaves"" and their quotes. Great humor and wholesome moments, truly a program for the whole family."
El final del para√≠so,Fantastic claymation opening credits
El final del para√≠so,mane i love this show

El final del para√≠so,"However, the sketch comedy show Chesperito, ended up having much more seasons. And that would feature sketches involving El Chavo.

That's why there are two or three characters that I never knew on the original full-length program, because they didn't continue in the smaller sketches that aired on Chesperito."
El final del para√≠so,that episode where everybody is going to the beach except him because he is dirt poor. I'm still traumatized 40 years later

As a sketch, El Chavo lasted until 1992 when Chespirito decided he was too old play an 8yo, plus the age meant they couldn't do El Chavo's slapstick humor as they used to be."

The merch market is big for this. Plushies and shirts and stuff 

It‚Äôs still big in Los Angeles so it might be a location thing since we have many Latinos. Households where grandmother or grandfather are still in the picture. The kids like the slapstick.

My Holo Love,Looks like Justin better go check out that rental property he owns in Detroit.
My Holo Love,Justin Roiland impersonators are about to get a lot of work lol.
My Holo Love,"""Did you get any of that?"""
My Holo Love,Need an up-and-coming voice actor to make a House of Roilands show now.
My Holo Love,"They have a solid cast for the rest of the characters that replacing Roiland as Korvo won't be bad.

Now give me more of the Wall!"
My Holo Love,"Solar Opposites should hold up better than Rick and Morty without Roiland. He only really contributed Korvo and very few small characters, unlike Rick and Morty where a large number of background characters relied on his voice in addition to both Rick and Morty‚Äôs voice."
My Holo Love,"A two week gap to investigate and all 3 made the same decision? He admitted to something, likely that the DMs were all real."
My Holo Love,Chris Pratt is about to have a very busy year
My Holo Love,Soon he'll join the production of Horny Unicorn.
My Holo Love,"Yeah I'm not holding out any hope for some exoneration miracle here anymore. It's Chinatown. 

Sucks that he's a dickbag but I've always thought that there had to be a good reason, a *very* good reason why he was only a guest on Dan Harmon's podcast (Harmontown) once ever, and it was basically a promotional thing with the rest of the cast back in season 1 of R&M. 

I can't remember where he said it, but Dan said something to the effect of 'Justin is what happens when a spoiled rich kid with ADD is given everything he wants in life and manages to succeed' and how his comedy is like being rewarded for being the annoying kid in a car trip. 

The malfunctioning human is starting to become a clearer picture to everyone now."
My Holo Love,"Both shows will continue without him. Solar Opposites has 2 more seasons and Koala Man just started it's first.

Hulu:

>‚ÄúWe have ended our association with Justin Roiland‚Äù"
My Holo Love,Starting to think he wrote that scene with the math teacher‚Äôs repressed feelings for Summer
My Holo Love,">	Roiland faces one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit against an unnamed woman he was dating in 2020, according to Orange County Superior Court records. The charges were earlier reported by NBC News, which said most of the California court records are sealed under a protective order.

Not to be a messy bitch, but I really want to know the details about what exactly is being kept under protective order. And what alleged injury this man could have inflicted on someone he was dating?? Certainly does not sound good, potentially vile."
My Holo Love,"Look kids, a falling star. Make a wish :P"

My Holo Love,"So Adult Swim, and its parent company, have Private Investigators.  This is like Jared the subway guy all over again.  Subway knew before everyone else how that was going to turn out.  So given that Netflix and Adult Swim just dropped him like he's radioactive, I suspect they were able to indecently confirm whatever it is they wanted to know that lead to his firing."
My Holo Love,It kind of boggles me that famous people do such stupid shit. Like you already have it all! You're talented! You're funny! You're now rich! Why are you fucking it up?
My Holo Love,They will use some alien tech that changes his voice and move on as usual.

My Holo Love,As he should
My Holo Love,Good. Fuck abusers.
My Holo Love,I don't think I've ever seen someone be less defended by the people that know and work with him. It just seems like the general consensus was that he was a huge asshole and people were just waiting him to get caught doing something like this to drop him?
My Holo Love,"This is for the best even if it costs them viewership

Edit: 

Folks, you don't need to respond to a one month old account who thinks Domestic violence isn't that big of a deal.   Whether their post was genuine or bad faith is irrelevant.

The ignore/block button is far more useful than responding to a bad troll or someone you would never acknowledge IRL."
My Holo Love,I can‚Äôt wait for him to resurface in a few years on Joe Rogan to talk about how cancel culture ruined his life (his crimes have nothing to do with it surely.)
My Holo Love,"with inside job cancelled, these shows should look there for new writers"
My Holo Love,This man destroyed his career overnight.  damn.
My Holo Love,Good. Dudes a douche. He deserves everything that is happening.
My Holo Love,In b4 he starts podcasts about cancel culture
My Holo Love,So the domestic abuse is what gets him. And not the DM-ing underage girls to hang out with him?
My Holo Love,Being a well gigged voice actor in LA is one of the easiest jobs on the fucking planet yet somehow this guy couldn‚Äôt help himself but be a pedo
My Holo Love,Good riddance
My Holo Love,Aww jeeze.
My Holo Love,I don‚Äôt know about you guys but I only watch that show for the Wall. What a fun concept
My Holo Love,Before the trial? Johnny depp all over again
My Holo Love,"Justin's always been a pretty fucked individual. Considering his original cartoons included [an early version of Mr. Jellybean who kidnaps children and creates skin masks from their faces](https://vimeo.com/48645513), [a deranged Cat in the Hat](https://vimeo.com/62232896), and the [original Rick and Morty](https://vimeo.com/channels/1015634/97680161), he's had his schtick for years of completely deranged cartoons. 

If all this is coming out at the same time, it's definitely Roiland owning up to his career going in the toilet. He's a funny guy yeah, but like lots of people in the creative field, he has a scummy streak that's been made worse by being thrust into the spotlight and into a position of power. All honesty? Maybe Roiland was better off being that guy who did niche cartoons with Channel 101, instead of being the guy whose creation turns into a generational phenomenon."
My Holo Love,"Clearly guy is a piece of shit but jfc, the level of coping I‚Äôm seeing on reddit is insane. ‚ÄúOh the show doesn‚Äôt need him. He only created it, voiced most characters and wrote the first four (best) seasons!‚Äù This is hilarious"
My Holo Love,ITT: Domestic abuse and pedo apologists not understanding the difference between a court room and a private company.
My Holo Love,Sounds like this time for Vanbo!
My Holo Love,Terrible year for animation
My Holo Love,FUUUUUUUUUCK
My Holo Love,He did one voice for Koala man why does everything seem to think he made the show
My Holo Love,Give Natalie tran a bigger role in koala man
My Holo Love,There has to be a lot more we don‚Äôt know. Everyone is tossing him out. Which sucks for Squanch Games.
My Holo Love,At this point in surprised that actors don't put in their contracts a no fire clause in case they get caught being pieces of shit
My Holo Love,What character was he
My Holo Love,People only watch Solar Opposites for the wall episodes anyways.
My Holo Love,Did Justin Roiland just have a cosby moment?
My Holo Love,"God dammit, why are there so many super talented shit bags? Rick and Morty has been an amazing show, one of my absolute favorites, and now it's going to go down in flames."
My Holo Love,"Stopped watching rick and morty last season, now may continue. Always hated Roilands annoying ""improv"""
My Holo Love,"What happened to innocent until proven guilty. What happens now if he goes to court and gets found innocent? Are they going to reimburse him lost wages. If, and I admit it a big if, he is innocent he should sue them over this."
My Holo Love,Wouldn‚Äôt it be crazy if the case is dismissed or if he‚Äôs found not-guilty? I wonder what these production companies know since they‚Äôre going scorched earth before the justice system has worked its way through the situation.
My Holo Love,"I don‚Äôt watch anything he is in, but has there be a trial or anything?  Nobody has learned a damn thing from the fucking mess of Depp/Herd lies/career destroying on both sides."
My Holo Love,"I loved Justin Roiland and was looking forward to ‚ÄúHigh On Life‚Äù dlc or a sequel. I‚Äôd also love to give someone the benefit of the doubt, but he fucked up. It‚Äôd have to be one hell of an apology and a lot wounds to heal before anyone can give him a second chance."
My Holo Love,"Honestly I wouldn't doubt if he's done these things he's accused of.  But I'm never going to be onboard with this mentality that because an allegation or charge is brought against you, that you're automatically a piece of shit and should instantly have your job taken from you.  Let's see what the court of the law has to say before we grab our pitchforks, that's my opinion.

Of course that's not meant to be a blanket statement either, there are clear exceptions: say if there is public video footage of the crime in question for us all to see, don't need a court to prove your guilt in that case.  Or, if the number of claims against you is so substantial that it's impossible to ignore, like when 40 or so people all had stories about Bill Cosby.  That's probably a pretty safe situation to say, yeah he certainly did those terrible things.

Would I put money on Justin being innocent here?  No.  But I also am not in favor of immediately cancelling him in every feasible way without due process or at least damning evidence readily available to us all right now to look at."
My Holo Love,Now he‚Äôll have time to make ‚ÄúHouse Of Cosby‚Äù a thing now. Maybe make more Doc and Marty‚Äôs.
My Holo Love,Maaaan I freaking love solar opposites :/
My Holo Love,"They should wait at least until after his trial is over to fire him. This is why the justice system destroys lives. Imagine you are some lowly nobody and you get a arrested for something you didn‚Äôt do. 
You lose your job and spend money on lawyers"
My Holo Love,Edit: I guess i'm out of the loop. The first i heard was accused of fellony abuse followed by his shows cutting ties. It turns out there's a whole lot of in between involving abuse in previous relationships and underaged girls. Shit's fucked up.
My Holo Love,This is the time to voice your concerns about cancel culture and how you don't mind the actions of this dirtbag and think floating his fucking career and buying him another mansion is an appropriate response.
My Holo Love,I'm just here to watch people get their boxers in a knot over what pedophilia is.
My Holo Love,"All these complaints about ""cancel culture"" usually come from conservatives or right wing pundits. And they will never see the irony when they praise Joseph McCarthy with his own ""cancel culture"" crusade in the 50's trying to root out communists in Hollywood. Lots of false accusations ruined a lot of careers back then but I guess it's only a problem today because liberals.

Edit: And to be clear I am not defending Roiland I am aiming this at all those comments with the downvotes."
My Holo Love,"Has there been any more released on the whole alleged predator/grooming stuff?

The only thing I've seen so far was the DM snippet where he called the 16yr old jailbait.

Which is pretty slimy or whatever, just to be interacting with fans of that age via DM at all really, but has there been something directly criminal that has been revealed in that aspect?"
My Holo Love,Did the dude get convicted yet? Or is everyone just dropping him because it‚Äôs inevitable that he will be in legal trouble? Last I heard nobody from the public knew and his lawyer said he did nothing and was going to clean his name..
My Holo Love,"Trial by media.

Some nameless woman accuses him of something.. back in 2020.

He denies all accusations, gets fired anyway before he has even seen a judge about the matter."
My Holo Love,How come he's getting dropped so fast when so so so many (proven) abusers don't catch much if any flak?
My Holo Love,Yet they keep Thomas Middleditch in Solar Opposites.
My Holo Love,"Sixteen, Dude."
My Holo Love,"Man, first it's House of Cards, now Solar Opposites AND R&M... Can these assholes just finish their shows before the public catches up with their horrific behavior like once?"
My Holo Love,"So I guess nobody is willing to be the least bit skeptical?

I want to first say, this kind of behavior is deplorable and indefensible. That being said... What *is* this behavior? What *happened*?

We don't even have the allegations. Literally all we know is that charges were pressed. For all we know about the abusive nature of our criminal justice system, I think it's really weird. 

When people get the faintest whiff of stuff like this, there's no hesitation at all. People just snapped their fingers and called Aziz Ansari a straight up rapist for what was basically just being a shitty date. The allegations around Andrew Callaghan sound really similar to his.

I don't know, man. People are probably going to say horrible things about me just for saying, ""Um."" I guess I'm less trusting of allegations I'm not even allowed to *read*."
My Holo Love,"Damn,  it's over for him"
My Holo Love,Is this worth watching?
My Holo Love,Aw man. So I won‚Äôt hear morty in those two cartoons anymore? What a major loss
My Holo Love,With that he's been kicked out of every project he's on. Not that I feel bad for him but I wonder what his plan is now. He's definitely rich enough to not need to work again for the rest of his life but that's rarely enough for people like him.
My Holo Love,I‚Äôm more concerned about what this means for High on Life 2
My Holo Love,"How the fuck are you going to continue both shows without him? Good for the networks for removing him but those shows are each going to make it one season before dying.

I'll make a bet that he does some rehab or something and is back in two years after all these shows flop hard without him and the networks get desperate."
My Holo Love,"I love how his lawyer is like ""THis isn't what it looks like"" yet the guy has admitted to basically being a pedo while also clear as day beat his partner. 

I would love to know what it really is that his lawyer is trying to go for here."
My Holo Love,Why is he getting dropped from all of the voicing roles? I'm out if the loop and cba reading the article.
My Holo Love,I hope they just end Rick and Morty. It's already taken a dive in quality and it's going to get worse without Roiland
My Holo Love,Nobody likes this situation. Terrible for his shows since he‚Äôs undoubtedly a creative genius. But also undoubtedly a weirdo and possibly soon to be a convicted felon. Everyone loses here.
My Holo Love,"We cancel, then we find out if they're guilty."
My Holo Love,"So did these producers not know about the allegations and court cases? Or are they just reacting to this all going public? 

I‚Äôm leaning towards the latter. If this ended with a bush money settlement, he would likely still be employed, imo."
My Holo Love,"Just imagine if he turns out to have been innocent this whole time. His career will never recover, regardless."
My Holo Love,Does anyone else not care that this guy does in his personal life?  I‚Äôm over all the canceling stuff.  How many shitbag musicians are there that still get plays
My Holo Love,"hopefully, he comes out on the other side of this as a better person.

lol why the hell would you downvote this? Do you not want him to become a better person?"
My Holo Love,"So... this happened in 2020, but now that it's public, he has to be punished.. they didn't seem to give af before the media got ahold of it. Way to virtue signal ya worthless pieces of shit!"
My Holo Love,"Wait so charges are from 2020, becomes public so then he‚Äôs dropped?

So everyone who dropped him were totally cool until everyone found out about the charges 2 years later. 

This world‚Ä¶"
My Holo Love,"Yeah I'm taking this as an off-ramp to Rick and Morty, who I treasured for years. Season 6 is just a slog to get through with the occasional gem but it's safe to say this goose has laid it's final egg. We'll always have the perfect first two seasons."
My Holo Love,Anyone else think that this is a little premature before he's had a chance to legally defend himself?
Who Killed Malcolm X?,[deleted]
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Damn I just started the pharmacist on Netflix now I know what I'm watching next.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Lol , so prosecutors consider doing their job better after watching a documentary"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Except it isn't a Netflix documentary....it aired on Fusion.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Justice delayed is justice denied. Just forget it
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I didn't know about it until right now but the article says it just came out yesterday. So I imagine if there's something compelling enough to get the Manhattan DA's office to consider reviewing the case then a lot of people will start talking about it in the coming days and weeks. 

But they also might just be trying to get ahead of the story because these documentaries tend to attract a lot of attention whether there's something new and substantive or not. I'm going to have to sit down and watch it."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"It's OK. I thought it was going to be better, more investigative - some of the cop.. secret squad stories are great, the fallout parts with Muhammad Ali are really good and all the petty, jealous politics between Elijah and Malcolm are good too... in fact, more focus on that and the internal workings would've been better (imo) But, by the end, it's so miserable and depressing because it's like, no one gives a shit - it happened and whats done is done, is the general vibe - I feel like in the doc, once William X's last name is revealed, I wanted a deep dive in that, his movements before, during, and after, but it kind of fizzled out for me.   


To sum it up... instead of Who Killed Malcolm X, it's more like A Man's Quest for Some Understanding and Peace of Mind.   


It's not bad... it's just not great (If that makes sense.)"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"It's good, but it's not at all what I expected - or even wanted upon initially starting to watch. The man does a good job in documenting the existence of withheld information, such as there being 9 informants present at Malcolm's assassination and the identification of suspected assassins. But the disheartening reality is that it seems most involved already were aware of the identity of at least one of the alleged assassins. 

If you know about the life of Malcolm, then you'll know the story they weave already. There are some good anecdotes from first hand sources that add details and brevity to the history. But the real core of the show is following a man who is robbed of closure for his life work in uncovering the truth behind Malcolm's murder.

There is no happy ending. For some, time and faith seem to have forgiven the actions of the accused. For others, Newark is more important than the legacy of Malcolm and closure for his family. Anyone alive and accountable either dies or is hidden behind the veil of government redaction. The closest to positivity the show achieves is submitting a request to reconsider the conviction of an innocent man charged for Malcolm's death, but without anything coming of it yet... it's not closure for his family either.

Personally, if you have an interest in Malcolm, I would just recommend reading his Autobiography and Blood Brothers, which is about his relationship with Muhammed Ali."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,watching it atm on last epp its good deffo worth a watch
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"The Pharmacist on Wikipedia: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pharmacist_(TV_series)

‚ÄúThe Pharmacist is an American true crime documentary series produced by The Cinemart. The series relates the efforts of Dan Schneider, a small town pharmacist in Poydras, Louisiana, to identify his son's killer and how this led to his gathering evidence against a prolific ""pill mill"" doctor in New Orleans.‚Äù"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,The Pharmacist is so good and so terrible. I just want to give that whole family a hug.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"More like prosecutors consider reviewing convictions made by their predecessors 54 years ago due to renewed public interest. It's not like anyone considering this review prosecuted the case, and like it or not, public pressure as the result of documentaries is a pretty damn good way of forcing the issue."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,You think it‚Äôs the same prosecutors as 50 years ago...?
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I don't think it's the same prosecutors bud

Who Killed Malcolm X?,"> The decision comes as Netflix begins airing a six-part documentary on Friday

I assume it's not a Netflix original, but it was *on* Netflix..."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"i don't get the downvotes , it's kind of bittersweet, things surfacing at last is a little closure. but if you ask me , it's a big joke , adding asterisks to dead people's records oh that guy served 20 years for nothing , but he is dead now , and this guy should've been jailed , but he is also dead. too little too late"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah, I was hoping it was more in line with making a murderer. Finding out the timelines of those involved, including the cops/investigators. 

Although, I can't imagine it would take long to prove cops either covering up something or mishandling the case of Malcolm X's killer. So maybe thats why they don't spend much time on it."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,What if Elijah told Louis Farrakhan to kill Malcolm.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"That reminds of a doctor that just got put away for a looong time here in Birmingham, AL. 

The dude was a doctor for like 30 years and a well recognized one at that. By the end of it all, he was running his doctors office in one of the sketchiest parts of town. His office hours were 1am-6am. He was also pimping out prostitutes.

Opioids have such a fucking devastating effect on people... Ive even seen one of my cousins go absolutely down the gutter. 

One of my good friends' sister got addicted after just getting her wisdom teeth out. 3 years later, she's running out of money since she isn't working anymore. She trades her whole fucking car for pills. 

She got clean for 6 months thanks to an addiction rehab that was also a church. They give people jobs, a place to sleep, place to talk to therapists, or find religion(not req.). She was healthy, sober, lost weight, was exercising, had an apt, had over 2k in savings.

1 day she didn't show up for work, they found her dead from overdose. She relapsed and took the amount she was taking on the daily before she got clean. So her body was not capable of handling that without building up to it again. 

All it took, was her getting her fucking wisdom teeth taken out. So many people should have to pay, so many people. It's fucking horrific."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,It's kinda hard to though since Danny Jr. And millions of other lives are purposefully endangered so people can make money.

Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Wiping down six ""special officers"". On some G shit. They thought I didn't know jiujitsu. They were wrong. They were disbanded."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,wat
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"A team of special police came to capture me for not knowing jiujitsu. I know jiujitsu. They held no guns (#plot armor). I beat the fuck out of them with my jiujitsu. They pressed charges. The department caught another case, the deparment was disbanded. I was freed."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Tell your Canadian girlfriend I said hello.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"https://youtu.be/3wd-YsBIK7U

I don't see how this situation could've gotten out of control."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Wait this story is legit?
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah. I do jiujitsu for a living. Trained since HS wrestling. I run across a guy and he offers me a career if I just drop a decade or so. I do. Now they want two stacks to graduate in addition to the assloads I already paid. So then they start stalking me calling me a fraud. So I say something to a psych to I can relax. They figure I'm lying about the messages, which you heard, and attack before clarifying. 

I get trial with witnesses. I get out of jail ok with no conviction."

Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Whatever it‚Äôs flaws, it was all worth it when Maya screamed, ‚ÄúHow the fuck was I supposed to know that?‚Äù"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Jason Bateman being a cat and telling that his revenge would be sweet was fantastic.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah totally agree. Pete was an unnecessary addition at the end. He didn't even have time to get up to speed on the premise and he did not gel with the rest of the episode. Really enjoyed Jason and Maya and the rest of the episode until then. When Jason realized Santa was Sean and said ""aw you roped Sean into this?"" I laughed out loud."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Master Bateman and Maya Rudolph were great. Marshawn Lynch was a nice surprise (‚ÄúOh shit, it‚Äôs the dude from Ozark!‚Äù).

Pete Davidson was kind of ‚Äúeh‚Äù, but the joke was that a celebrity would be brought in last minute with the expectation that they solve the mystery while knowing absolutely nothing. 

Apparently he was sequestered in his trailer for 4 hours, according to Krister Johnson, writer for Murderville, in the /r/murderville subreddit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/murderville/comments/zm8rz7/_/j0e4mai/"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah, but that's the joke, right? The murderer was someone Maya hadn't even met, and Pete was asked to choose the killer with no information at all. There's no way he could have added anything to the investigation, so he was just having fun with it. 

I liked the interplay between the different guests better than the first series where it's just the guest with Terry, but it would probably be better to have them all there from the start. It would be less confusing for the viewer, and hopefully they would actually choose one of the suspects in the end."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Jasons bird dance was incredible
Who Killed Malcolm X?,It was almost worth it though for Bateman's deadpan scolding of Pete for mocking Donna Foccacias name
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I absolutely loved the episode and agree that Pete didn‚Äôt add anything. I feel I could‚Äôve done what he did, being I have zero acting talent and what not."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,It was almost like Pete was walking by the studio while they were filming the ending and just dragged him in for no reason.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,We said the same thing! It was SO funny but how none of them chose one of the three suspects kinda killed it. I will say I cracked up that Jason picked Santa because it was absolutely absurd. I think the idea of having someone come in at the very end was great but anyone but Pete. His hype needs to be done. If they got Molly Shannon or something that would‚Äôve been awesome.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Wasn‚Äôt the joke that because he was brought in last minute there‚Äôs no way he could of known what was going on? I thought it was funny anyway‚Ä¶
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"The thing about him pulling the wires though is that they were about to get him to disarm the bomb anyway so why didn‚Äôt they just roll with it and be like ‚Äúoh, good job Pete. That did it I guess‚Äù"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Agreed. I loved the special and hope they do more Murderville. But Pete Davidson is just not funny, and this was made more apparent sharing the stage with actors who can actually do improv well."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I think Santa was my favorite thing in the episode. From him dying like 3 separate times, to the mannequin bit with the Orphans... i just lost my shit."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"My wife and I were blitzed when  we watched this on Friday and I cannot remember a time we have laughed more post COVID.  We were extremely happy to see Marshawn make a cameo and we loved him pointing out, ""That's the guy from OZARK!""

Might be the alcohol talking but it was by far our favorite thus far!"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I kinda like how it feels like improv between friends and a chaotic mess. Also makes it feel more real, less set up and less rehearsed or prepped for as some shows that fake realism can be. Tho it is better when will arnett is trying not to laugh and the comedian digs in to make him laugh. There‚Äôs few times where arnett or the other actor is trying to drag some improv out of the guest whose stuck but you can‚Äôt win them all in improv.

Throwing Pete last minute was some wild farcical comedy. If you don‚Äôt care if he solves it or not it is funny how lost he is"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I think he would have chosen the mint girl if he didn‚Äôt see both Maya and Jason picking outside the box. The bomb thing was absolutely dumb. But it was an enjoyable episode nonetheless.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"The ending did piss me off a bit, and I was surprised that having three professional comedians resulted in them all going against the basic fundamentals of improv comedy.

Definitely would have been better without Pete, but I wouldn't have minded them bringing in a third person at the end.  I liked the underlying premise of ""This guy has no knowledge of anything that has transpired yet.""  Marshawn Lynch would have been good."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,That was literally the entire joke but alright lol
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Agreed completely.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I like Pete more than the average redditor but he straight up sucked. He didn‚Äôt even try to play along at all, didn‚Äôt say a single useful or funny thing, and then pulled all the wires on the bomb at the end which is just textbook terrible improv."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Still can‚Äôt believe no one made a joke at the end about it being an arresting development
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I never knew in wanted a Jason Bateman Maya Rudolph team up and now I want a whole movie
Who Killed Malcolm X?,It‚Äôs crazy to think an actor with no range or ability to maintain character spent so many years on a live variety sketch show.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,He was fine. Is he as good as the others? No but he absolutely didn‚Äôt ‚Äúruin‚Äù anything and imo played off decently with the other cast. It ain‚Äôt perfect but I think it‚Äôs obnoxious to write a whole post about it.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I wonder what the back story to it was in real life. Like was he just chilling near the studio and someone was like ‚Äúhey were filming this come join! It‚Äôs not like you need a script‚Äù or something similar. 

It didn‚Äôt seem planned (not that much is) but in some ways that‚Äôs the charm of it. 

Or maybe it was just horribly planned out. I‚Äôm going to hope there is an amusing backstory."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I did love the idea of bringing in a 3rd person with absolutely no understanding of what has already happened, right at the very end... but agree.  I wish Davidson had taken it a little more seriously, even if I did laugh at most of what he did.  Including pulling all the wires.

That said, though.  We went back and rewatched the others after the special and I do like the way the Christmas special flowed, and felt like it was more of a murder mystery party of friends, than the others did, because of the character breaks and things."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Agreed, I just don't understand how he keeps getting work. I used to think it was a conspiracy that the entertainment industry force feed you certain people, but I 100% believe it with him. He's smarmy and not funny, who are his fans? What does he actually bring to the table? I'll never understand it."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I agree. The episode was great, but Pete Davidson almost ruined it. 

I really tried to give him a chance, but Pete was laughing the whole time and pointed the finger at Will just to seem funny. He wasn‚Äôt even playing the game. When he pulled all the wires, I just gave up. He was an awful addition to the story. 

Referencing the Smartless podcast, what if they got Justin Theroux instead of Pete Davidson? That would have been gold."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I don't like Pete Davidson. Don't get what his appeal his. He's not talented in my eyes. Just a run of the mill chum.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I groaned when >!Pete Davidson!< lumbered onto the scene. Didn't add anything of value. I wish it had been someone like Michael Cera as a sort of wink and a nod to Arrested Development, like how they had >!Sean Hayes!< on there as a reference to >!the Smartless podcast!<."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"If you've not seen it you should check out Murder in Successville, which is the original version of the show."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Pete Davidson ruined it to be honest.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I guess I was the opposite. Pete is pretty well known for breaking at the drop of a hat so you just have to have that expectation and enjoy it when it happens. Especially since Bateman had made several fourth wall breaking comments and Maya broke when she heard Santa was dead. It's one of those shows where breaking can add to the show, rather than detract."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I died when they asked Jason Bateman to dance and he pulled the ‚Äúca-caw ca-caw‚Äù chicken dance from arrested development
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"By the end my impression of things was that:

Maya was all in and enjoying the hell out of it

Bateman was over it and contemplating who he was going to kill first, Will Arnett for getting him involved (since I imagine that is how it happened) or his agent because agents.

And that Davidson had been walking by while they were filming and some producer yanked him in off the street for the hell of it."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I loved it when Maya accused the mayor who immediately said, ""the fuck?"""
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I‚Äôm not the biggest Pete Davidson fan but I really enjoyed the unnecessary addition. It was more so a joke to add someone at the last second who missed the entire case and then have them pick who they think the killer is. Also how could you not break if you‚Äôre coming into the end of the episode?
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"The kind of ‚Äúcardinal rule‚Äù for improv is the ‚Äúyes, and‚Äù approach. Pete didn‚Äôt say yes to any set ups; he didn‚Äôt play along with the bomb wire. He gave his present to someone who wasn‚Äôt a suspect. He just sat and smiled and didn‚Äôt attempt any effort to get into any sort of character. 
I think a lot of us had bigger expectations because he was on a comedy sketch show, but he either doesn‚Äôt have the chops or he prefers to bring chaos and watch everyone shift to his style. 
It‚Äôs way more fun to watch improv when everyone tries to gel; he gave no gifts/easy lifts to the other teammates and he heightened zero scenes. The ability to keep the bit going is all on Will, Jason, Maya and the supporting cast."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"It had its moments, but the whole thing didn‚Äôt feel well put together.  It‚Äôs like they started filming and decided to call Maya and Pete to see if they were free to swing by. 

They should have all been in a group from the start."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Completely agree. I was so disappointed bc Pete seemed to not play the ‚Äúgame‚Äù and instead seemed to want to just f up the story line. 
It made no sense adding him. 
Also they should have brought in Maya earlier in the show."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Me and my girlfriend thought him showing up out of the blue was one of the best parts of the episode.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I don‚Äôt blame Pete because they brought him on right at the end and he didn‚Äôt have any context. I wish instead of staggering the guests they were all present at the beginning. Or they did separate episodes. Overall thought it was great. Loved Jason‚Äôs nod to Arrested Development with the chicken dance
Who Killed Malcolm X?,It's the American remake of Murder in Successville in case anyone else was confused.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I feel almost completely the opposite about the episode. I thought everything until Pete showed up was weaker than most of the regular episodes, but when he showed up the chaos it brought was hilarious. I don't think without him there Jason and Maya would have picked the killers they did, and it just raised everything up. There's no way it would work as a normal thing, but for a special episode it was a great ending."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah I wish the celebrities played along, that's supposed to be part of the fun of this kind of show"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Everything was perfectly imperfect and the entire special was wonderful.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I didn‚Äôt mind Pete Davidson. He didn‚Äôt add anything spectacular but his laugh was contagious as a viewer
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"That's why it was funny.

No matter who you bring in, if they're only there for the last 5min, they'd act the same way bc they have no sense of the pacing or what the other 2 ppl have gone through the entire time. 

I found that hilarious."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I think that was the point a bit. To bring some doofus looking guy in who was clueless and had 30 seconds to make a decision and wouldn‚Äôt take it seriously.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Honestly, just having Pete Davidson in a cast is an immediate ""no thanks"" from me, no matter how amazing it might be. Kermit-looking motherfucker is just awful with stupid tattoos."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Before he came in I was sure I'd rewatch it in a year's time. His appearance made it much much worse.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Yeah, WTF why was Pete Davidson even there. He had no context, no frame of reference, he didn't seem like he wanted to play along."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Agreed!
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I agree about Pete Davidson but I was laughing so hard even that couldn‚Äôt ruin it for me. I think Bateman is the perfect type of entertainer to do these things because he is so ridiculously deadpan with his comedy and he didn‚Äôt break no matter what absurd things they made him do. Leslie Nielsen would be proud.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"honestly this episode was hilarious - the end was a bit annoying, but everything else was **great**"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,Who is Johnny blaze based on?? I know that is ghost rider but why put him in this skit/movie?? Am I missing something
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Or when Maya said, ‚Äú50 Seconds, MacGruber!‚Äù"
Who Killed Malcolm X?,I love Jason but Maya was SO fucking funny
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"I laughed the most when that other officer came in when they're interviewing the assistant and Maya goes, ""now who the fuck is that?!"" This show is lots of fun, and I loved seeing Jason Bateman in it as well! Dug the little AD callback with his quick chicken impersonation. If you can even call it that...I'm not convinced he's ever seen one."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"""I never met him!"""
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Or when the lady cop showed up and Maya said ""who the fuck was that?"""
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"Oh god that was hilarious. I laughed a lot this episode - watching Jason having to go through all of the debasing stuff set up and talking about having time to plot his revenge.. Sean laughing, the naked guy."
Who Killed Malcolm X?,He was such a good sport not hesitating to go full in on playing a cat. But casually vocalizing that he would get Arnete back for it was gold.
Who Killed Malcolm X?,"When he tried to do mouth to mouth, I almost died"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"It looks bad. And I say this as someone who has watch both 2D and 3D animation since childhood. I also watched Polygon Studios past works like Ajin, Blame! and Knights of Sidonia. The english dub sounds bad too. No good voice acting direction like Netflix's Castlevania."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,It started off pretty okay and the rest of episode 1 was just dialogue. Not the best starting episode...
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I think nobody is talking about Joel and Tess being together for at least 13 years. That was huge revelation for me. Makes Joel‚Äôs loss that much bigger.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,The most important part of the episode is Joel understanding the message Bill left for him. Joel is now on board with getting Ellie to this lab to find a cure. It‚Äôs why he asked her to show him her arm again.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,From the tension in the piano scene I thought someone was going to die.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"The way the episode was directed was fantastic in my opinion. I like that they don't need to show the couple's corpse at all, it was done really well. In the end of the episode when they were zooming out the window I'm going ""pleeease don't show them, we don't need to"" and sure enough they didn't! Great episode."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Once that Max Richter song came on to start off that montage, I was like ""guess this is my cue to cry happy sad tears now"""
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Nick Offerman should win an Emmy for his performance
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"This was one of the most moving, but yet not overly dramatic portrayals of love I‚Äôve seen in a long time. It‚Äôs inspiring, relatable and just very well done."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"While everyone is rightfully praising the actors, I want to shout out to the writer Craig Mazin for fleshing out a side character and gave us this beautiful story. 

Mazin was also responsible for writing Chernobyl, which also had some beautiful writing with amazing character relationships."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I wasn't expecting the direction this episode took at all.

Nick Offerman made me cry.

Everyone can have their own opinion but to me this was art, not filler."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Joel explained how the fungus rapidly spread through tainted food. This shined light on how the elderly neighbor was infected in Episode 1.

Edit: Plus Joel forgot to get a cake from the store, which presumably would have infected his family too."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I'm hearing either, ""Best episode ever made!"" or ""What the hell was that, pointless!""

It wouldn't be interesting if everyone agreed I guess."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This episode was perfectly produced. My only complaint was when bill just shooting from the middle of the street with no cover.. bill seem way more intelligent than that from everything else we saw in the episode.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"It was well made, told a kind of slice-of-life story about living in the post apocalypse. Well written, well shot, well acted.

I can't rightly think of another episode like it that isn't filled to the brim with various genre tropes like one of them getting inevitably infected."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"It was incredible to see Bill‚Äôs growth as a person once Frank came into his life. From an angry, closed-off, highly introverted man to someone who became happy, open and loving. His vulnerability in the very beginning of their relationship and Frank‚Äôs patience and calming presence was one of the most moving things I have ever witnessed in a television show. The scene where he and Frank giggled over strawberries was truly heartwarming. I genuinely started crying when they revealed that Frank was terminally ill and love that their journey ended together. Nick Offerman should absolutely win an award for his role in this episode. It is some of the best television that has ever been made."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I loved this episode. I can forgive a deviation from the source material if the new material is written well and executed well. And this episode did exactly that. Nick Offerman killed it
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Nick Offerman laughing at the strawberries was the moment that got me. That laugh of pure, unburdened joy. It was perfectly used."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Honestly didn't expect to cry so hard to an episode of The Last of Us about a gay romance of two one shot side characters
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,As a massive fan of the game since day 1 & never usually like something deviating TOO far from an original story... I thought that episode was fucking incredible
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,All this from a video game adaptation. We've come so fucking far.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This episode slayed me. Was totally unprepared. Beautiful.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"People asked what more a show could do to expand on TLOU and this is exactly it. It‚Äôs expanding on the heart of characters trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world.

I genuinely cried, it was amazing"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I've been very happy theyre sticking to the OG story so closely. This is the first major change theyve made and its great. These are side characters I barely even remember existing, so they play a minimal role in the story. Fleshing out their backstory doesnt detract at all. The addition of a well written, well acted side story like this adds immensely though"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"No episode of tv has made me cry like that since Not Penny‚Äôs Boat, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I appreciated the nods to Ron Swanson's birthday dinner.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SHrmGdIzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SHrmGdIzo)"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I don‚Äôt feel anything very easily. Nick Offerman is one of those actors that I have had this idea of in my head as being a one-trick pony. Boy, was I wrong. This episode had me weeping. I walked away feeling all kinds of stuff I can‚Äôt even explain."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Ugly crying!
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Just finished the episode. As a long time proponent of please stick to the source material I can safely say that this episode was just absolutely fantastic.

Performances are tremendous, it fleshes out the world the characters inhabit, how they‚Äôve changed over the course of time in a world that‚Äôs hopeless. 

If you want a 1 for 1 retelling of exactly how the game is, go play it but for me this  is a video game adaptation (key word is adaptation) done exactly right 

I hope both guys get nominated for many awards for their performance."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I haven‚Äôt been broken like this from a TV episode in a looooong time
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"> The Last of Us' just made an early claim to ~~one of~~ the best TV episode~~s~~ of 2023

Only been a month, and maybe Succession will give it a run for its money, but so far it's way out in front. One of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.

This show was just like, ""by the way, here's the most beautiful and devastating love story ever squeezed into an hour"" while helping establish a totally authentic post-apocalyptic setting and give leagues of depth and subtext to the stories of Joel and Tess, all in passing."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,[removed]
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,[removed]
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Much preferred their story here than the game‚Äôs version and glad some story beats are changing.

My biggest complaint before was that it I personally was finding a 1 for 1 recreation slightly uninteresting (feels like a harsh word as I‚Äôm still think this is a fantastic tv show), part of me was wishing I was just playing the game instead.

This episode was a brilliant change of pace, a perfect filler episode."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,It was a good episode for sure.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Love the ending shot is through the bedroom window. However it bugs me that it looks like it is a second floor window but their bedroom is on the ground floor for easy access.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I think this was the first time I actually cried while watching something incredible performance
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I think a lot of the criticism of it being a filler episode is from people who lack media literacy. It is really not difficult to see how the story told in the ep fleshes out and contextualises some of the wider themes of the game/show
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"At the end of that episode I crawled into my boyfriends lap and cried for ages. Best bit of telly I‚Äôve seen in a long time, absolutely amazing writing and performances."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"""I like you older. Older means we're still here."""
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Well, this is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.  
  
My *emotions*."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I do like that they used a mortal kombat 2 machine instead of the fictional arcade cabinet
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,‚ÄúI never liked you‚Ä¶but I do respect you.‚Äù Straight up Ron Swanson.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I totally recognize that the episode was sad because of the ending, but I couldn‚Äôt help but feel happy for Bill & Frank. In all that chaos, they built a great life together. Frank had all those amazing paintings, Bill overcame his grudge against humanity, they grew strawberries!!

How many people get undisturbed time (work, school,  obligations) for over a decade with the person they love?  I was really happy and proud of them for that.

Also, very classy of TV Ellie not to raid Bill‚Äôs magazine collection, üòÇ"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"When bill was shooting in the street, it was so dumb tho."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I adored it. Felt like one of those classic artsy post-apocalyptic short stories you might have read in high school. But gay as hell.

I also thought the bedroom scene hit exactly the right notes. Not too schmaltzy, not too lurid, but not shying away from it either. It was sweet. Loved seeing this uber macho prepper guy suddenly trembling like a leaf with how nervous and self-conscious he was."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Early yes, but hard to disagree. As someone that loved the games, the whiplash of expectation to such a radically different approach to show determination and tenderness in this world was exceptionally effective. For those that have experienced the game and are even remotely media literate, it was phenomenal. I cried, I laughed, I cried a whole lot more. I told my wife that ""that episode was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time,"" and she agreed. 

For those coming in fresh, it was a remarkable way to show depth and complexity and motivation. Taking an episode to do this in an emotional and beautiful way is no waste. It does the functional story moving that the game did in a completely different way. 

I get people having their own tastes and their own opinions, but it's hard to think about people upset for deviating from this show being a play through. I did that. I experienced it. I let it take me along for the story and experience once, why wouldn't I allow this different medium to do the same?"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This is when The Last of Us did World War Z better than World War Z.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Man, this was the episode I was most looking forward to/most worried about. I had conflicting feelings on the Bill/Frank stuff in the game. But holy shit was this just one of the most touching, heartbreaking and beautiful queer love stories I‚Äôve seen.

The game was super progressive for even including an overtly gay character but the game kind of makes Bill‚Äôs homosexuality into a joke with the discovery of the gay magazine. Hence my complicated feelings on it. This episode knocked it out of the park. It‚Äôs so rare to see gay romance depicted in this way, as an aging couple. I think this has a lot to do with the AIDS pandemic and how we lost a massive percentage of a whole generation but seeing a gay couple be able to grow old together was far more moving than I expected it to be. Phenomenal episode imo."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Last time Ive cried this much from a show/movie was Titanic.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This episode made me weep like a child
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"So I can‚Äôt find any comments addressing it and I kinda wanna see what you guys think. What exactly is Bills profession before this??? That house is expensive. You can see the Boston skyline in the distance. He has an arsenal that seems like it would cost nearly $50,000 not including ammunition or any of the other doomsday supplies. Maybe his mother left him the house, who knows. My guess is a degree in Engineering. That‚Äôs the only way I see someone putting together some town like that. Sure someone could slap some stuff together but realistically would probably end up hurting themselves trying to set all that up."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Everyone go watch Devs, it's the best Nick Offerman role IMO."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"This episode actually gave me a stomach ache‚Äî I mean besides the blatant sobbing it just made me ache. I also laughed out loud more than once (all Nick Offerman).
That scene with Bill and Frank when they are sitting in their suits quietly exchanging rings BROKE ME."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Holy sweet goddamn that show rocked me.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been moved that much by tv or a movie.

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett were unbelievable."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Best thing I‚Äôve watched this year. Loved it.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Throughout the episode I couldn‚Äôt place where i had seen the actor who played Frank before. When I found out he was from White Lotus I couldn‚Äôt believe it was the same guy. Great actor.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"One of the most intense and surprising things I noticed was how Bill and Frank are likely the only couple on earth to have such a picturesque, ‚Äòromantic‚Äô ending. They lived and experienced the joys of the old, pre-infection world like maybe only a handful left on earth could experience.

Everything outside their utopia is an apocalyptic dystopia. Most people die in horrible ways, or in substandard, poverty-like conditions in the QZs. It would likely be hundreds or thousands of years before what they had would once again become at least somewhat common."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,It made the notebook look like the emoji movie
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I ugly cried with this episode
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,One of the best Episodes I‚Äôve throughly enjoyed because the World building occurred during this time. I do hope if other seasons are commissioned from this franchise‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen lots of negativity about this and it‚Äôs not been enjoyable to read.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Never played the game. Coming in cold. This is one of the greatest (IMHO) episodes of TV that I‚Äôve ever watched. The writing, the acting, the directing. All perfect. So much tension at he start, then the twist, then the gut wrenching ugly man crying at the end. I need to watch it again but I‚Äôm not sure that I can take it right now."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Fuck this episode, I watched it for shroom zombies and instead got my 46 year old straight male heart ripped out from under my guts while cried like I haven‚Äôt since I was at least 5, not cool with your fancy writing and excellent acting and directing catching me so hard over what was probably less than 30 minutes. Now we never talk about this ever again"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This episode was incredible
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,That damn shutter island/arrival song üò¢
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Watching it! That wink when he‚Äôs painting ü•≤
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Did anybody else think Bill would be alive when Joel arrived? I thought it possible that he would fake dying to relieve frank of the guilt of leaving him alone
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I played the game in 2020 but forgot who Bill and Frank were lol, so I wasn't expecting the episode to go in that direction. I cried like a baby during their last meal. The score was fantastic as well and probably triggered more emotions. Such a beautiful episode all around."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This episode was like a long version of UP's love story. loved it.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"This particular episode had it all: acting, writing, story, pathos. It‚Äôs one of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in a long time. If the quality stays this high it might be the best series ever."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"This episode was so fucking touching I almost cried in front of my folks. I don't like crying in front of people (which is normal), but this brought tears to my eyes."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,[removed]
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,One of the best shows I‚Äôve seen in a long time.  I suspect the right wingers are going to loose their minds.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"What a masterpiece. 

And on episode 3. Going to be hard to compete with that one. Man this is a great show."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"All I can say as a straight white cis guy watching a show about zombies, I never expected to be in literal tears at the end of a gay love story. I pretty much just consume TV for entertainment and while I really enjoy some shows I don't really get to emotionally invested. This episode gave me so many of the feels."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,IMHO the greatest queer love story in television history. I'd totally watch a spin off show of Bill and Frank's domestic adventures in post apocalyptia.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"It was definitely the best episode of tv of 2023 so far. A touching tale, both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I hope that the guest stars get remembered come awards season."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This show is incredibly good. My family was spellbound and quite pleasantly surprised.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This is how you tell good stories. I wonder if the writers of rings of power watched it.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,That really was so good. I was fucking bawling.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I knew Nick Offeman was a great actor but gat dam!
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This show is HBO caliber in the best possible way.  I don‚Äôt even like the genre per se and know nothing of the game but when acting and writing is this good I just pop some popcorn and wait until next week impatiently.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,They introduced a gay Ron Swanson and then killed him in one episode.  :-(
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"This was a good ep ill admit. Def carried by the actors. But what bothered me about it, and its been done so many times in other shows is.....Bill, standing there....standing straight up, poppin shots with a BOLT ACTION RIFLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Why...just...why do so many shows do this shit. Im to believe this (probably vet), mega prepper gun ""enthusiast"" has no tactical training at all?! That mf'r would be behind cover, dick in the dirt poppin shots from a comfortable distance at his leisure. Not standing straight up in the middle of the fucking road....god i hate that shit, takes me right out. Murray bartlett was incredible tho so...i guess theres that"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Beaujolais Villages.  My family‚Äôs go to wine. Never heard anyone ever mention it. I was hooked from then on.  What an awesome episode!  Incredible all around. Well done!
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Incredible episode. The Bill story in the game was good, but they really took it to another level here. I'm happy they're sticking to the game in certain areas, but this was an inspired change. We got a fantastic, emotional story that still imparts the same lesson to Joel and let's us feel his pain over Tess through Bill's experience."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Just watched the episode tonight. Brilliant first few minutes when he meets frank. My wife and I were just WAITING for frank to kill him. Especially when he sat down at the piano... 50m later were both crying at the love story. 

Brilliant story telling. Absolutely loving the series so far. LOF is a top 10 game for me so it's especially awesome to see the carry over. My wife whos never had interest can't stop watching either!"
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,This was a powerful episode. It‚Äôs the kind of rare and unexpected storytelling that I‚Äôll remember for a long time.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Ron would be disappointed.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Every now and then, you are watching TV, and you become aware that what you are seeing is far above the level of quality of most TV. This episode was o e of those times. As it ended, I just sat there, stunned. It has been a LONG time since I've seen anything as good as this episode on TV."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Idk I thought it kinda dragged.. I enjoyed the 1st and 2nd episode a lot more
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,Waterworks non stop. Finally a gay love story I can rewatch.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,I cried. That's it.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I'm sad that they cut Elllies and Joel's scenes with Bill, those are some of the best scenes in the game (including the ""sticky pages"" in the car afterwards.."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,It was good. I was just disappointed that we didn't get the great back and forth exchanges with Bill and Ellie like in the game.
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Maybe an unpopular opinion. First off, I loved the episode. Not saying it wasn‚Äôt great. But in the entirety of an hour long episode, in the end Joel and Ellie just get Bill and Frank‚Äôs stuff and leave. What‚Äôs the point of having that entire backstory and flashback for that?  I‚Äôm not criticizing it at all, just a genuine wonder about the screen time spent just to show a small connection to Joel in the past and then him and Ellie just move on."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"I get that anyone who criticises the episode will be labelled as homophobic but seriously though, they decided to waste one of only 9 episodes on that? What the fuck."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"There was such an absurd amount of hype around this episode...

... and, yea, it lived up to it."
Cagaster of an Insect Cage,"Man the one thing that really pissed me off about this episode was the raid attack. Why the fuck is Bill standing out in the middle of the street with no cover?

So far the series has been good about these sorts of decision making on the characters parts but Bill is made out to be a survivor yet he makes such a stupid mistake.

Also seems odd to me that they would have had in all that time just one raid? It's clear to see that the town has supplies, it is fortified so there definitely would have been other groups who invade. Especially considering it's close proximity to Boston.

Excellent episode otherwise but yea that just didn't sit well with me. Not sure why Joel and Tess would continue going back to the QZ instead of stake out with Bill and Frank and live a comfortable life when it's clearly less stressful and more ideal.

Felt like a place totally disconnected from the horrors of the world. Needed more emphasis on the constant fight for survival like the games really try to hammer into you.

Still, excellent episode that didn't follow the tropes of most media."
The Pharmacist,"Damn it, why isn't this extraordinary show getting more acclaim?"
The Pharmacist,Watching it right now. Shit‚Äôs crazy.
The Pharmacist,Hes the best there is üòÇ
The Pharmacist,"He's such a smug asshole. So fun. Missing the scene after he has sex with Amy and calls himself a [human vibrator] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib6mIFYwQBo), though."

The Pharmacist,I'm almost glad he got replaced in that CBD sitcom so we will get more of him here.
The Pharmacist,"I don't understand this show, Who would you want to watch a show about people working in a store like Walmart ?"
The Pharmacist,The Chattertons Cigarettes gag in one of the live shows is probally my favorite thing from his character. 
The Pharmacist,"I love that episode in season 3 where hes got that bucket of pills. ""Is this Oxy or a tic tac?"" and then he just swallows it. "
The Pharmacist,[Because it's a big target for comedy.](https://youtu.be/2jW9jcLF7QM)
The Pharmacist,Making humor out of a job that many do not have a choice in are you playing an elitist online?
The Pharmacist,"and at the end of the scene ""Yeah, that's oxy"""
The Pharmacist,"Not being elitist, just don't understand who the show is for. If you worked in that kinda store ( like I once did). Would you rather not watch a show about literally anything else in the world ? In my time off I would rather watch paint dry then be reminded of work. Is not the whole point of TV escapism? "
The Pharmacist,[also...](https://youtu.be/spoE1jq3lec)
The Pharmacist,"You could say the same thing about The Office, yet that's one of the best comedies of all time. Same deal."
The Pharmacist,Has this dude really never heard of a workplace comedy before?
The Pharmacist,Was the Sigur Ros right before the ending?
The Pharmacist,"Can I get opinions without spoilers? Afraid to look around the thread

Worth watching?"
The Pharmacist,"So when they wrote this do you think they intended to have the crazy editing mixing scenes.  cause I can't think of any show that combines the mood/emotions of multiple ""scenes"" to create a uber scene.  I like that aspect."
The Pharmacist,"Wet rainbow dildo strap on.

Because... WACHOWSKIS."
The Pharmacist,"Episode 1: This show is terrible. 

Episode 2: Jesus, why am I still watching this...

Episode 3: Whoa, that ending was rad. 

Episode 4: Ok, this is starting to get good.

I haven't watched episode 5 yet, but I think this show will pick up -- despite the clunky exposition and pseudo-scientific shit. 
"
The Pharmacist,"I'm 6 episodes in an I gotta say I am loving it. I like the characters, the production value is high.I have a feeling I'll regret marathoning this cause with each episode I like it more, and I can imagine the wait for season 2 if it happens being long and hard.
"
The Pharmacist,Just finished watching all of season 1. Damn great show.
The Pharmacist,"Honestly, after finishing the whole season, despite the hate I actually like it. The music is good, the cultural perspectives in the other characters is refreshing as well as the interactions between them. Like, imagine an Indian with strong religious beliefs interacting with a very gritty and cynical German. Incredible interactions with these characters.

Only criticism is that some of the lines become cheesy and predictable, like Will the cop as everyone has mentioned. Also the pacing for the mystery of what's going on with the mental connection and such is rather poor, as you only getting a small piece each episode, while the rest is focused on normal drama in their lives that is aided by the others in their cluster thing.

8/10 tbh. Definitely check it out, but don't be too critical and enjoy the good parts."
The Pharmacist,Accidentally watched the second episode first. Ah ... you don't want to do that lol. It's confusing enough as it is.
The Pharmacist,If nothing else it will be interesting to see what critics who have seen more than 3 episodes say about it compared to the early critics. 
The Pharmacist,"Only seen the first episode, but it seems like the Wachowski's forgot the ""show - don't tell"" rule. Almost every character is spouting off exposition like there's no tomorrow, and pretty corny exposition at that: ""That's the day I knew I loved you"" - ""You certainly have a reason to hate them after what they did to your father"" - The entire Indian-girl-to-Ganesh monologue. 

And some of the storylines are not just a little far-fetched. A hospital that won't treat a kid dying from a gunshot wound brought in by cops? An 'uncrackable' safe? 

On the plus side, the first episode has a strong opener and a good cliffhanger. And the music's pretty good.

"
The Pharmacist,The show reminds me of cloud atlas. I just watched the fourth episode and each episode has been getting better than the last.
The Pharmacist,"I'm not a big fan of the Wachowski's and the only movie of theirs I really liked was Bound, so after seeing all of the negative feedback it has been receiving I didn't expect to make it past the pilot. I'm three episodes in and I'm really digging it so far, I don't mind the multiple storylines (although I understand the complaints) and I'm liking the way everything is starting to slowly connect. I still have 9 episodes to go, so there's still plenty of time for the series to lose me, but so far it really isn't all that bad."
The Pharmacist,"It says Naveen Andrews is only in 3 episodes, i really was hoping he'd play a bigger role. Gonna start it tonight. "
The Pharmacist,"To tell the story of 8 very different lives in 12 episodes is very difficult and has been the root concern of most critics. Now that we understand the characters I am looking forward to what can be done with the series. 

Season 2 or we riot. "
The Pharmacist,"I have to say after the fifth episode, I'm starting to really  dig this craziness. Stick with it. It gets better."
The Pharmacist,20 minutes into the second episode and this indian storyline is literally the worst thing i've ever seen on TV
The Pharmacist,[deleted]
The Pharmacist,"I just finished watching episode 12 and I thought the show was okay. The best moments were when the characters worked together to solve a problem with their unique abilities but it took way too long for that to start happening. I would definitely watch a second season for more of those great moments. However, some threads could get boring fast such as [Spoiler](/s ""Will having to be unconscious or the whispers guy will interact with him and find everyone. And the marriage arc is still a thing after 12 episodes of her obviously not wanting to marry him. ugh!!!"")"
The Pharmacist,After 3 episodes I wouldn't call it bad at all.  And I want to continue watching.  
The Pharmacist,"Can we finally dispell the notion that JMS is a genius writer? He's a genius plotter, but he has always been a terrible writer. And he is perhaps the worst writer of dialogue in all of television. He has amazing ideas, really cool concepts. But he is seriously flawed when it comes to execution."
The Pharmacist,"As an Indian, I found the dance scene in episode 2 to be extremely cringey. For fucks sake, I see enough of that in Indian movies, why is this shit in a Netflix TV series? The show is interesting but the melodramatic dialogues are making it hard for me to watch it. "
The Pharmacist,"FYI: the first 4 episodes are basically the pilot. After that, the premise is fully set up "
The Pharmacist,">Simple philosophical wonderings about the nature of choice?
    
>Examinations of sexual, gender, and philosophical identity?

>Multiple scenes of half-naked people dancing/raving/fucking in slow-mo to pulse pounding music?

>Evil shadow authority types who are hiding secret knowledge from the world?

Yup, the Wachowskis were involved in this. 

>Simple philosophical questions about religion and evolution? 

>A view of the world that (for better or worse) is filtered through the lens of a liberal baby boomer? 

>Evil shadowy authority types who are (probably) exploiting gifted people for their own sinister agenda?

>Cringe inducing scenes of ""urban youths"" trying to speak ""street""? 

Yup, J. Michael Straczynski was involved in this.

I'm not saying each of these things are necessarily bad or or good (most of them, anyway), just that this show is *very* much a product of its creators. Sometimes with the Wachowskis you get the Matrix, other times you get the Matrix Reloaded. Sometimes with JMS you get Babylon 5, other times you get Superman: Grounded.

I'm about halfway through and I'd say it's pretty good, but not really amazing. It feels like it's spinning its wheels a lot and refusing to actually explore the interesting sci-fi premise it's based on. I could do with a little less melodrama about certain character's personal lives and a little more with people actually reacting to what should be a deeply life-altering series of events.

Half of the characters seem to take visions and hallucinations that may or may not be psychic phenomena very much in stride. You'd think they would find these experiences a little more important.

Basically for those who've read JMS stuff before this seems like equal parts Rising Stars, the telepaths from Babylon 5, and a little Matrix men-in-black thrown in, which incidentally makes it feel just a little bit like Grant Morrison's The Invisibles too (which it's often said the Wachowskis were ~~ripped off~~ were inspired by in order to make the Matrix).

Anyway, I say it's maybe worth getting to episode 4-5 before you decide if you want to keep going or not. I found the first episode very slow and not too interesting, but it's sort of gradually picked up some steam since then. It's not blowing me out of the water, but it's good enough, I guess.

I'd give it maybe a B-, I think.

**Edit to add because I just got to it:** Oh, and yet another sci-fi show where the scientist character basically says ""Because quantum physics makes no sense (to me), that means anything is possible!""

In 50 years people are going to look back at sci-fi from now and laugh at our use of quantum physics as a catch-all excuse for impossible stuff the same way we look back at stuff from the 1950s using the prefix ""atomic"" as the catch-all excuse.

**Edit #2 after some more binging**: Slow. Slow, melodramatic, and then slow some more. That's this show. There are a few brief moments of interest here and there. Any time that one of the characters has to get out of a jam and does so by [spoiler](#s ""by using the skills of the other characters, mostly the kickboxing lady and the cop"") the show suddenly seems exciting. If the show was just about that sort of thing, it could be really fun. But instead we get back to melodrama that simply does not work because all the characters are so flat and one dimensional.

For instance, I just finished the ninth episode (I'm sick and there's nothing else for me to do today, shut up!) and the entire end of the episode is just one character [cut for spoiler I guess](#s ""whimpering, crying, and drunk-dialing his ex over and over again while a super miserable version of ""knocking on heaven's door"" plays over it."") Then the episode just abruptly ends after he spouts the kind of dialogue that could only happen in a tv show: [Bad dialogue spoilers](#s ""He finds a gun, tries to shoot himself with it, but then it turns out that the gun is actually just a lighter and not a real gun. He laments, 'It's a fake! A lie! Just like my entire life is a lie!' Get it? Cause he's an actor *and* he's in the closet!"") So deep.

At this point I'm not so sure I want to keep going. That scene was just really, really bad.

But I'm committed to finishing it at this point, I suppose. Probably edit again once I'm done, if I still care by then.

**Final Edit and semi-review**: 

This show should have been six episodes. Cut every scene in half and you would miss basically nothing. Cut out all the slow-mo montages and you can probably make it five episodes. There's establishing a mood and then there's holding a shot as it pans slowly over the landscape of a person looking sad while a neon sign says THIS CHARACTER IS SAD and the music sings ""Sad sad sad, I feel bad bad bad."" There's really no such thing as subtlety on this show, it seems.

There are a few brief moments of interest throughout the entire thing, and it's the same as before. Any time [](#s ""someone needs to use the skills of the other characters to fight/escape some problem it becomes fairly enjoyable to watch."") Action tends to be filmed with some actual skill and energy, although even then it's pretty short and not comparable to something like Daredevil.

The characters remain almost completely flat and lifeless throughout. By the end of the show I found myself wishing the show was more about just Sun and Capheus. He could help her learn to have a little more joy in life and she could help him by being [](#s ""a badass martial artist who can kill eight people by herself""). If the show was just about the two of them, it probably would have been much more interesting. Reducing the number of main characters would probably have helped a lot.

Sun seemed to be the only character with any real depth -- Capheus is okay by the end of episode eleven, but before that almost ever encounter he has with another character is to grin happily and stare in awe at their surroundings. Don't get me wrong though. Sun isn't some incredibly complex character or anything. She's just slightly more developed than most of the others. Even now I don't think I can even remember the Indian woman's name or any character traits she had other than [stuff you know about her if you watched the first episode](#s ""she is religious and doesn't want to marry her fiance""). 

As I mentioned in another comment, you can basically describe most of the characters exactly as you would in the first episode and the last. It's not so much that they don't change (although really, they don't even do that much) but it's that we learn hardly anything more about them than what we learn in the first few episodes. What we do learn tends to be very cliched and formulaic, and those little morsels of information are spread out amongst the aforementioned SLOOOOWness.

Unlike other commenters I have no issue with the diversity and think it's pretty nice to see, although you'd think with a 1-in-8 chance one of these characters would be Chinese. The one or two overlong sex scenes I do have a problem with not so much because they were over the line but because (say it with me now) they were SLOOOW. 

On the other hand, the white cop who has to convince the black nurse and his hispanic partner to save a young black kid who's dying of a gunshot wound is, uh... 

Yeah. One step forward, two steps back. JMS probably shouldn't try to write stories about inner-city characters. It never goes well. (If you don't believe me, google Superman:Grounded.)

Also, was I supposed to take it as ironic that Jonas (Sayid from Lost) gives this big speech about how humans are so good at killing people [Wachowski/JMS megaspeech spoiler](#s ""because unlike a Sensate, they can't feel what it means to kill, even though Sun, Will, Wolfgang, and Capheus wind up killing probably twenty people between the three of them?"")

And a note to the Wachowskis: this is not actually a movie. This is a television show. The old trick of having two characters simply spend ten minutes together doesn't mean I actually buy that they are in love, and showing me a montage of all the times they looked at each other doesn't change that.

In the end I downgrade my rating to a D+, maybe a C-. A few bright spots, an interesting premise, commendable diversity with some weirdly racist undertones here and there, lackluster characters, oodles of psuedoscience and psuedophilosophy, and an equal mix of straw-religious people and straw-atheists.

And let us not forget: IT IS SLOOOOOOW. Even the [finale spoiler](#s ""car chase versus the helicopter"") in the finale is slow and boring. It's almost impressive how boring it is.

A good premise wasted.

(apologies if this came across as unreadable ramblings. Obviously I wrote it as I went along, and you might imagine I'm a little sleepy by now.)"
The Pharmacist,"I enjoyed this show.  As I got further into the episodes I realized that this season is supposed to an origin story that introduces the characters and sets up the worlds mythology.  Character development of a few characters are little dry, but there are 8 characters to go through and at least they made sense.  I also like how they didn't tie each characters arc in a nice bow and left questions for a season 2."
The Pharmacist,"After seeing the trailer, I was really hoping the Wachowskis would come through on this one.  But I have to say, so far it's really slow, boring and uninteresting.

Gonna give it a few more episodes. "
The Pharmacist,"I really really wanted to like it but my god it's just so dull, the characters have zero depth and at some points in a scene I'm half expecting them to face the camera because all they're doing is spouting exposition.

Cinematography and soundtrack is great and I really like some of the actors, however I couldn't name some of the characters if my life depended on it.

Action scenes are great with multiple characters getting involved, very well done, it's a shame there's only been like 3 in the 10 episodes I've watched.

Apparently it doesn't get any better but I'll keep going since I'm almost done but it's mostly been a waste of time, wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless they have a hard-on for forced diversity."
The Pharmacist,"Guys I'm at episode 11 and this show is awesome. It may be a bit weird and slow at the beginning, but when you get to grasp the idea, it is very good. Give it a try."
The Pharmacist,"I just finished it.

If I don't get another season I will riot in the streets. "
The Pharmacist,"The concept of the show is interesting and had potential but it dragged and even after watching many episodes, it still dragged. Too bad really. I like that Korean bad ass lady."
The Pharmacist,"Just curious, is anyone watching this in 4K?"
The Pharmacist,"Hey guys...do any of you know the song that is in E01 ...its around the 57:00 min mark. Where the girl takes a hit on the pipe.

thanks"
The Pharmacist,The nurse refusing to treat the gunshot wound at first completely killed it for me. The other storylines aren't to bad but holy shit that cop storyline is awful. 
The Pharmacist,The music selections make me happy. I love me some Sigur Ros and The Antlers.
The Pharmacist,"The show is on Netflix. They have the liberty to make you wait, something a regular TV show would never get free lit doing because ratings. 

I do implore people to watch the entire season, it's clearly written as a whole instead of episode by episode with artificial highs and lows. "
The Pharmacist,"Just got done with the first episode.  I'm definitely going to keep going.

I won't give anything away but that was a pretty awesome ending scene!   I'm sure most of us are familiar with that particular trope, but that's the most perfectly executed I've seen it done before."
The Pharmacist,After Jupiter Ascending its amazing these guys get any work 
The Pharmacist,Soo-Jin is a bad ass. I am really liking this series. 
The Pharmacist,It has easily one of the worst openings I've ever seen. 
The Pharmacist,I have no idea where to watch this from in Spain.
The Pharmacist,Very confusing to see 8 different situations of 8 different people in one episode. I didn't really get what the story is here. Probably have to watch a few episodes to really understand what this is about.
The Pharmacist,"I'm about three episodes in, came to this post to see if it was worth continuing. As others have said, the show is way too slow and scattered... but I've heard about that scene from episode 6. Might just be worth it?"
The Pharmacist,"So far is the new series of Sense 8 looking promising. Although, i must say that the first episode was quite slow. But i am sure that is only for getting to know all the main charachters properly. 

it will be really interesting to follow Sense 8. "
The Pharmacist,"It seems that the consensus is the first 2 episodes are god awful.

The next 2 are better. And the rest of the season is pretty good.

I don't know what to think because I stopped at the 2nd..."
The Pharmacist,"I just finished the season over 3 days and I'm left in a funny but optimistic place about it all. This may be a sloppy review as its late here but I really felt like writing about it. Which in itself says something about the show. 

Yes, there are inexcusable fuck ups for my liking, with a great deal of gender/identity discourse (kudos), orgies, great action, pointless fillers, 'whoa that was cool's, mini philosophical insights, drama, anti-establishment sentiment (surprise!), pseudo-science, but worst of all; some clever dialog with more cringeworthy dialog served in a much less sci-fi centric approach than I expected from the Wachowski's. You guys made the Matrix!?! 

There were episodes I thoroughly enjoyed ""That was dope! Next episode will play NOW."" then there were episodes that were just ""meh"" or ""seriously wtf!?"" which killed the flow for me. 

But!... I think this may all be due to the production/viewing strategy. It felt experimental, much like Cloud Atlas in its narrative and with alternating directors weaving in and out of Sensates. I mean, surely, the Wachowski's are aware of how media is consumed on Netflix - either cookie monstered in one go, or at least treated as what I like to call 'On Demand Background Media' so they probably tried to leverage the Netflix platform to their advantage in that sense for slow but real character development in a variety of locations (this thing takes place all over the globe) with good cinematography and time spans. Hence the ""show, don't tell"" was inevitably mostly sacrificed.

I think the coming seasons will pick up in both pace/action as well as science-fiction. There's still a lot of potential and season one seems to be sacrificed as bait for as much viewership as possible for the latter sci-fi orgy that might be a tad too much for most. Or so I hope. "
The Pharmacist,"There are brief moments so far when the show is very interesting, and they have everything to do with the overarching plot/concept. The trouble is that there are long sections between those moments that are very boring. I'm wondering if it has more to do with these characters being boring or just their backstories being boring. All I know is that I've skipped through whole scenes to get to the interesting bits and I haven't missed any of it.

Edit: typo"
The Pharmacist,"I just started watching, now I'm hooked. I can't stop watching it now, just started on the 5^th episode!"
The Pharmacist,"Actually, I am enjoying it. Very interesting. But You do need to see the trailers first to understand what is happening. "
The Pharmacist,"Some of the shots with the characters esp Riley and Sun were absolutely breathtaking. Cinematography A+ but like mentioned, there is no subtlety in the story telling. The show doesn't really let you think much for yourself or ask questions really, we know everything and/or it's very predictable when things happen. Also, I wish the people in foreign countries would just speak their native language and we could read what they're saying in English. I thought the Korean actors speaking English was kind of cringey."
The Pharmacist,"The Warchowski's are trapped in their own 'Matrix' which is a cultural snapshot of the late 90s.
"
The Pharmacist,"First thought, ""Oh, Daryl Hannah...""

Second thought, ""What the fuck are they talking about?""

Third thought, ""That's a really unnecessary scene involving lesbian/trans sex with a very juicy dildo.""

Fourth thought, ""So. much. exposition.""

All of this in the first episode. I will give it a few more, because fuck it, I'm drunk...but this is hardly groundbreaking scifi or or philosophical media. Very plain, boring and slow.

Extra, additional thought, ""Lana Wachioski really wants us to know she is trans."""
The Pharmacist,There seems to be a rather out of left field pro-drugs thing going on in this show.
The Pharmacist,"on episode 11. It's damn intriguing. Takes a minute to understand what's going on, but when you finally get what's happening, it's beautiful

when they sing 'hey (what's goin on)' together. That's when the show really clicked for me."
The Pharmacist,Just watched the first two episodes. Absolutely great so far. I might binge it.
The Pharmacist,"My god if I see another baby flying out of a woman I am going to puke -- literally timed both gratuitous vag WW3 episodes really badly to coincide with eating.  Not something I want to really see happen even to my wife, would it have been to hard to do a side shot on that crap? "
The Pharmacist,"This show had 4 sex scenes in 2 episodes with almost every iteration imaginable of partners. MtoF trans having lesbo sex with a woman, interracial hetero sex, interracial homo sex...and i forget...it's like they're hammering us over the head with diversity."
The Pharmacist,"I don't know, I'm into the third episode now and starting to really lose interest. The acting seems pretty weak in parts and the individual storylines are getting a bit ridiculous. The faint hope that it might get better is the only thing keeping me going, but I'm really not even slightly invested in any of the characters. "
The Pharmacist,I hope this is the last job the Wachovskis get. Too much style and not enough substance.
The Pharmacist,"Finished it. Its a mess to say the least. Like the concept, hated the execution. Had to force myself to finish it regardless. I felt angry at the end of it. Felt like a waste of my time. That just my opinion anyway."
The Pharmacist,People are judging this off the first 2 episodes. Do yourself a favor and watch this show. Mind fuck. Amazing plot. Fuck the reviews that say it's boring. 
The Pharmacist,"I'm about 7 episodes in, and the story is getting into the whole full swing part. 

It's slow paced, and I've enjoyed it for the most part. 

My only gripes with this show have been the horrendous exposition of the first two episodes, and the gratuitous sex scenes, from the wet dildo, to the orgy. 

I'm not one to really get offended, and I'm not. It's just so forced and done without tact. And the worst ones seem to be the episodes directed by the Wachowskis specifically. 

Other than that. I've found some of the character studies to be quite beautiful at times, giving a completely opposite perspective to a situation where one character isn't understanding or is having a hard time, and another one comes in with their perspective and wisdom on it all. The scenery is nice, I like being able to see the characters interact around the world with eachother. But each time I see it, I can't help but think, ""Man, this is ambitious. Hope that they didn't spend too much money on this, because I don't think it's going to do as well as they hoped.""

Hope the season's second half is great, I'll definitely be on for a second season if that's what they're leading to. I really like the plot, and ideas it brings. I just sort of wish that it didn't feel like it's trying to be Game of Thrones by having all these locations AND adding all the sex. One thing, I've never had a ton of issues with the sex in Game of Thrones, but it's not why I'm watching the show, and this show seems to put a lot of time into it's sex scenes, like it's a major part of the spectacle. "
The Pharmacist,"I just watched the first episode and what the hell, is this shit nothing but some big liberal PSA? I hope not, for the sake of art. Still going to watch, but it's corny as fuck so far."

The Pharmacist,I finally finished it this evening. it's meant to be watched all at once or in it's separate parts.  One of my new favorite shows on netflix after the disappointment and dullness of Marco Polo.
The Pharmacist,"I had high hopes but I found it formulaic. Lots of b.s. scenes like the nurse turning away the kid with the gunshot wound. 

And did we really have to see the vajaja juice and lube fly into the air when the strap-on dildo slapped on the floor???

Maybe episode two is better?

Only thing I loved were the scenes with DARYL HANNAH!!"
The Pharmacist,"I'm not going to finish this show and if I do it is going to be just to see if it gets better.  I'm on episode two and I am not feeling it and there is so much sex and I hate shows that have sex that does not improve the plot at all and the two sex scenes I have seen did not do anything for the plot.  Well...A lot of scenes do nothing for the plot they are just there.   This show is...disappointing.

Finished three episodes and the story really is not interesting.  "
The Pharmacist,Im half way through the the first episode and Im having a hard time willing myself to finish. This feels like work watching this show.
The Pharmacist,"Finished it yesterday.

There are some characters and relationships is simply did not like so skipped most of their scenes. The indian women, the lesbian couple and the mexican gay couple.

They're not bad actors or anything. I just don't care for their relationship drama.

The others...Van Damme! Sun, Will and Wolfgang are great. I would watch a show with just Sun or Wolfgang. They carry the show imo."
The Pharmacist,"Say what you will about the slow build up.  It more than makes up for it.  Episode 11 is one of the greatest episodes of television I've seen in a long time.  It's dramatic, exhilarating, fun, and fucking hysterical"
The Pharmacist,"Literally just quit during episode 7.  It was too bad.  Music and lighting can't possibly be important enough to make up for the absurd reaches in reality, the horrible dialogue, and the needless sex scenes.  Seriously, not good at all.  "
The Pharmacist,How the fuck did they get people to actually create this abomination of television?
The Pharmacist,"I snoozed though the first episode and the second episode I jumped through in 10 minutes. I don't find any interest.

The producers really want me to keep track of 8 different characters lives in a show and what their doing? Whats the point of the show? There was no plot except for watching some heroin addict have hallucinations from DTs and then blow her brains out. And then we have 7 other characters  that all have some kind of head problem/ dilemma. Jesus Christ I get tired of listening to my own head sometimes.  So far I think it's shiate.

I'll try and watch the 3rd episode but if the story line doesn't captivate me, it's a shit tv show."
The Pharmacist,"Huge sci fic junkie and I love Cloud Atlas. 

Only watched two episode cause of upcoming exam this Monday..

I love it so much.

I saw the reviews and I have to say people have short attention span. Seems like people didn't like this cause of the slowness. 

I fucking love that they are taking their time to build a story."
The Pharmacist,"watched 65% of the first episode and had to shut it off. All the characters were so boring and theres no story. Their lives are boring. I'm not homophobic but there is alot of gay stuff going on in the show. I mean, I love GOT and idc they show a gay couple going at it but after seeing the wet dildo and the ""pride scenes"" i said fuck no. Its like watching a bad french kiss or seeing fat people fuck. Just not my thing."
The Pharmacist,"WAT???!!

That is basically what I thought at the end of the show. Just so things are crystal clear, it's ""WAT??!!"" in a bad way, not good way.

I dont get it. Someone is gonna have to break this down for me. I am so confuse I only finished to see if the end would justify my time. It did not.

Maybe the whole point is to desensitize us to lesbian, gay and transgender sex? Kind of like a weird way of making a social commentary? Because they show them A LOT.

Man I was hoping Mr Robot level awesome..."
The Pharmacist,"Looks like based on a novel ""DEVTA"" [Mohiuddin Nawab].....Disappointed really."
The Pharmacist,"I dug it. I admit there were some over the top ""Hey, look how daring we are showing TG sex and stuff"" moments, but overall I found it an interesting concept that was pulled off quite well. A lot of people can't stand when answers aren't spoonfed to them in the first episode, and those people will hate this."
The Pharmacist,I feel the need to check my privilege now
The Pharmacist,"Watched the first episode and half the second but have now bailed - so far, none of the characters have used the talents of the others and I'm bored. I'm not a homophobe, but I thought the gay sex scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary. 
Very disappointed. "
The Pharmacist,"I can't believe this show went out of its way to shit on feminist characters by making them intolerant of Nomi, a female transexual who is in an interracial, lesbian relationship--going so far as to accuse her of being a male colonizing the female gender. 

Gee, Thanks Lana. üòï
"
The Pharmacist,That beach was fucking beautiful. I'm assuming it was Iceland?
The Pharmacist,"People who hate Cloud Atlas will hate this. People who enjoyed Cloud Atlas and were interested it what it was trying to portrait, will like Sense8. "
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Holy shit. Just binged this and had to see if there was a thread. Fucking awesome.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I don‚Äôt really care either way, but it‚Äôs really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Theyve Gotta Have Us,[removed]
Theyve Gotta Have Us,[removed]
Theyve Gotta Have Us," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to ‚Äúpartner‚Äù with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn‚Äôt need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn‚Äôt at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that‚Äôs all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here‚Äôs hoping at least."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Rat King is coming
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don‚Äôt think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Translation: ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn‚Äôt mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there‚Äôll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,[removed]
Theyve Gotta Have Us,The lack of action started in episode 3
Theyve Gotta Have Us,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. ü§£"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn‚Äôt feel like there was any‚Ä¶"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clich√©d and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clich√©s. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clich√©s, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"It‚Äôs not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don‚Äôt care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would‚Äôve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
Theyve Gotta Have Us,I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs because I  didn‚Äôt play the video games but I didn‚Äôt have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I‚Äôve watched. I don‚Äôt think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that‚Äôs a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it‚Äôs pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<‚Ä¶Hitchcock would‚Äôve been proud."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,[deleted]
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,The real monsters were the uninfected.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I‚Äôm assuming most people who liked it didn‚Äôt play the game."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"That‚Äôs super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it‚Äôll ruin why the show is so great"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Who‚Äôs complaining about the lovely personal stories?
Theyve Gotta Have Us,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that‚Äôs it.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I don‚Äôt want ‚Äúa lot more infected‚Äù I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat‚Ä¶weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn‚Äôt to say I didn‚Äôt love the show, it‚Äôs an amazing adaptation, but it‚Äôs fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I‚Äôm happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
Theyve Gotta Have Us,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead‚Äôs bit after the show.  

There‚Äôs plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,I look forward to the complaints that there‚Äôs too much action
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Why does this sound like it‚Äôs gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,We gonna get the rat king.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn‚Äôt just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we‚Äôll probably see some in the next season."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.

Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,A lot more‚Ä¶ considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don‚Äôt exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn‚Äôt everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded ‚Äúoh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies‚Äù is what made it work in my opinion.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn‚Äôt mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can‚Äôt wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
Theyve Gotta Have Us, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don‚Äôt care.
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"Lol‚Ä¶ I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and‚Ä¶ they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don‚Äôt care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another ‚Äúpeople are the real monsters‚Äù story trying to pretend it‚Äôs deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
Theyve Gotta Have Us,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."

On the Real,RIP Bob and Norm... I didn't even know they were sick
On the Real,"Thanks for this! It's the first thing I thought of when I heard Bob Dole died, although I thought he was already dead. SNL really captured the Real World too."
On the Real,76 actually. That‚Äôs pretty amazing. So he was alMost 50 when I remember him on MTV during the grunge years.
On the Real,Get a Loder of this fact
On the Real,Aka before Reddit.
On the Real,It really is. That's the first thing I thought when I heard today's news.
On the Real,"Hey, they both outlived Kobe..."
On the Real,"Kurt Loder was a staple of MTV during the 90s and early 2000s, the MTV News jingle stuck still pops in my head every now and then."
On the Real,"There were plenty of redditors before the digg exodus. There used to even be a rivalry, digg users would always use to say Reddit was shitty due to the simple ui. Little did they know digg would just implode."
On the Real,It's the reason a sizeable chunk of us just hit their 11-year cakedays!

On the Real,"""YOU DON'T NEED GLASSES, YOU'RE JUST WEAK. YOU'RE WEAK!"""
On the Real,"I got a lot of problems with you people, and now, you‚Äôre gonna hear about it!!!"
On the Real,"What always amazes me is how late in the series this episode was. It was only a few months before the show ended! Crazy they were still making iconic episodes that late in the game, just shows how brilliant Seinfeld was."
On the Real,"‚ÄúThey both shouted a lot, though Frank (Costanza) was a lot less toxic, I guess,‚Äù O‚ÄôKeefe said.‚Äù

Holy hell, how is a father more toxic than Frank Costanza??? When you read the article it makes sense, but watching Seinfeld George‚Äôs parents seemed like Looney Tunes."
On the Real,"As I rained blows upon him, I realized there had to be another way!"
On the Real,"I've only ever participated in one Festivus ever and it's the last one I'll ever be in. 

A a group of friends threw one together as a joke and I went along cause why not. 

Friendships were actually damaged that day and I and one other person just sat in a corner watching the carnage before leaving awkwardly."
On the Real,I really enjoyed reading about this man's childhood trauma. Glad he shared it with the world.
On the Real,I can‚Äôt believe that Festivus is this big cultural phenomenon when in reality there‚Äôs only like 3 minutes of festivus related plot in the Seinfeld episode
On the Real,"Whoa, that kinda blows my mind! Just seems so fantastical, I thought it never could be real."
On the Real,[deleted]
On the Real,"Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the rooster. The rooster goes with the chicken. So, who's having sex with the hen?"
On the Real,">O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs father also coined the term, ‚ÄúA Festivus for the rest of us,‚Äù which ended up in the show. But it had nothing to do with class consciousness or the fight against Christmas commercialism ‚Äî it was about the sudden death of O‚ÄôKeefe‚Äôs grandmother in 1976.

I never imagined that this term have a sad meaning."
On the Real,"‚ÄúYou, Kruger.  My son says your company *stinks*!‚Äù"
On the Real,"When my in laws were planning on moving to a gated FloRida community I joked that they were going to be living the Del Boca Vista retirement life.  

When my father in law put that together with living a petty life they opted for a non community average home."
On the Real,I'm pretty sure all the stories in Seinfeld happened irl
On the Real,this episode is one of the funniest. anything related to george and his parents is always a golden episode
On the Real,Festivus is your heritage George. It's part of who you are...
On the Real,One if my favorite things in life are when people place Festivus Poles in holiday displays
On the Real,"‚ÄúCougar, my son tells me your company stinks!‚Äù

*‚Äù‚Ä¶Oh God.‚Äù*

‚ÄúQuiet, you‚Äôll get yours in a minute!‚Äù"
On the Real,"So, similar to fetivus my grandfather (also a new york jew) had made up the ""scumbag of the year awards) aka the STY awards, where you would state your case why this person or that person who did you wrong diserived the ultimate award, on occasion, my father would write songs about them, being the musician that he was. I still remeber some lines to ""crazy Steve's lament"" and ""All Frank's Suck"". The award ceremony would take place on New Years eye (or some point between Christmas and NYE) when we would all get together...when I first saw the festival episode I was a child still and I was like oh. They do their version of the STY awards....."
On the Real,"The local bar used to let us bring an aluminum pole in every 23rd haha

So obviously I watched the episode and something struck me, if frank says he hasn‚Äôt celebrated festivus in years, why did he send George the card?"
On the Real,this needs to get to the top of everything
On the Real,"Hello, woman."
On the Real,I would like to have been in the writers room when he told that story.
On the Real,"Spike Feresten (writer on Seinfeld. Wrote the soup nazi episode) just had Dan O‚Äôkeefe on the latest episode of his podcast (Spike‚Äôs Car Radio). He revealed that his father had created other fake holidays, besides Festivus."
On the Real,But did he air his grievances?
On the Real,This is amazing. 25 years later and the show still continues to surprise and amuse us. Legendary!
On the Real,"After that Jets game last night, Festivus couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time"
On the Real,That was a fun read. Thanks for sharing it!
On the Real,"I assure you, Festivus is a tradition that is *all too real*. I could prove it, if you like."
On the Real,We will be watching tonight in homage to Mr Daniel O‚ÄôKeefe.

‚ÄúNo, please! Denim vest! He‚Äôs smoothing it!‚Äù"
On the Real,"Dammit! Even Festivus was spawned from a bed of lies!!

On the Real,Get this racist out of here
On the Real,Yea right
On the Real,Probably my favorite episode.
On the Real,"This is funnier to me because a U.S. Army Colonel who was also an optometrist examining my eyes told me the same thing. She scolded me for being lazy and not trying hard enough. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even squinting, you already gave up.‚Äù"
On the Real,It‚Äôs till a holiday.
On the Real,A festivus for the rest of us!
On the Real,"I remember reading an article about a defense attorney who was registering his client for incarceration‚Ä¶ Forgive me of the details because I‚Äôm not an attorney and I don‚Äôt recall the specifics or how the court system works or whatever but‚Ä¶ where the form asked for the defendants religion, the attorney, obviously a smart ass, wrote down ‚ÄúFestivus‚Äù. And the clerk registered it. And on that day, Festivus became an actual legally recognized religion.

Note: i‚Äôm lazy so if there are any other Redditor‚Äôs that want to do the research or have specific knowledge of this, please chime in and comment!"
On the Real,He sounded pretty gruff about it in the interview on Spike‚Äôs Car Radio podcast.

On the Real,"Have you seen the pole, Krueger?"
On the Real,Best line on the show even better with the full context of him leading up to that line.
On the Real,Early Seinfeld episodes are a bit more grounded than later ones; the early episodes mainly rely on poking fun at real social situations while they go a bit zany in Season 8-9 after Larry David left the show. But both are great and hilarious
On the Real,My all time favorite Seinfeld line came from this episode. ‚ÄúHey how did my horse do?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe had to be shot‚Äù
On the Real,"I think the show sort of made a deliberate effort later on to create these sort of iconic, ‚Äúviral‚Äù moments that it had become known for. The show always seemed to have a lot of catch phrases or outrageous moments that just stuck in popular culture, but I feel like in those last couple of seasons they just reeeally leaned into the quotable nature of the show.

The Elaine Dance, Yada Yada Yada, Man Hands, Festivus, etc. are all from those last couple of seasons and are some of the most repeated/iconic parts of the show. The last couple of seasons might feel slightly different, but like you said, it‚Äôs crazy how successful they were even at the end of the show‚Äôs run!"
On the Real,"I noticed this too when I was perusing the Netflix catalog.

Season 9 absolutely fucking *slapped*.  So many iconic episodes right at the end. They went out on a high note for sure."
On the Real,wasn't a big part of the show ending because Jerry and others wanted to end it while it was still great? i mean how often does that happen.
On the Real,"After David left they went balls to the wall and after finding their feet it's pretty much hit after hit. I personally think Seinfeld is the greatest comedy through it's entire runtime, but those last two seasons hit such a perfectly absurd vibe that I don't think any show has replicated"
On the Real,"The soup nazi, the bottle deposits, the rye, the chicken roster, the summer of George, the yada yada, the sponge, the bizarro jerry, the little kicks, the serenity now, the merv griffin show.

Some fans didn‚Äôt like the late seasons but  they were good in my opinion."
On the Real,"I can‚Äôt believe the writer didn‚Äôt want Festivus for the rest of us, though."
On the Real,"Also amazes me how the festivus scene is just a couple minutes long at the very end. And the episode isn‚Äôt called festivus it‚Äôs The Strike

Heyyyyyy no bagel no bagel no bagel no bagel"
On the Real,Yeah people rag on season 9 but it has some of my favorites
On the Real,Really good point!
On the Real,The last season still had so many gems! Obviously the finale was lackluster but overall it definitely ended before it declined
On the Real,It didn't really get popular until 3rd or 4th season. So prob most people who remember the peak didn't even watch a good chunk of the episodes that exist.
On the Real,"It was more because they decided to cancel it *before* they ran out of good material. They quit while they were ahead, instead of when everybody got sick of it."
On the Real,"Jerry, Mr. Steinbrenner is here, George is dead, call me back."
On the Real,"I know his brother Dan (also a TV writer) and the stories of their Dad are wild. 

Lots of episodes from shows they have written on like The League, Drew Carey, and I believe even Silicon Valley contain references to their family"
On the Real,He was apparently a pretty bad alcoholic so while the story is funny in the context of the show I think that man's childhood was sort of a living hell. I can't remember his name but I've heard him do an interview and was obviously going to be asked about this.
On the Real,"One of my favorite facts about seinfeld's development is that George's father was supposed to be a wimp like george also cowed by george's mother - his wife - and it really wasn't working so the actor improvised a bunch of lines firing back at her ""you're the one who breast-fed him till he was twelve!"" and similar, and it worked so well they changed the character."
On the Real,That must have been some doll.
On the Real,Jerry Stillers delivery of that line is amazing
On the Real,Damn. Another redditor in a similar thread said that had to add reconciliation or something. So they got to air grievances BUT for every grievance they had to add a thing they did to help or be awesome during the year. That sounds more reasonable to me.
On the Real,Can you elaborate? what exactly went down?
On the Real,My friend group has had a pretty fun time with it thankfully. Almost like the purge keeps us from exploding on each other.
On the Real,Sounds like the correct way to celebrate festivus to me
The Emigrants,Sounds good and has Sofia Helin (Bron/Broen) in it? Sign me up
The Emigrants,"I remember listening to Jimmy Carr on a podcast, and he talked about pitching panel shows in the US, he said the execs kept asking about how the points are won and things like that, looking at it more like a gameshow rather than a vehicle for comedians to be funny. Wish I could remember the podcast it was, sadly I can't."
The Emigrants,"It doesn't hurt that the UK basically has a panel show/standup/etc circuit so a lot of the comedians are friends from way back, work together, etc- so they often come in with a kind of premade camaraderie. If you watch enough different panel shows, you see the same names popping up again and again, and half the time banter on the shows involves panelists referencing these kinds of past relationships. Not saying that US comedians aren't necessarily friends with each other- I have no idea- but they'd have to start that whole rapport from scratch, essentially, if they just made one panel show and got random people to appear on it each week. 

I do think that there could be some success if they took a Whose Line-esque approach and transplanted a whole British panel-type show (or close to it) to the US and then continued from there- but that's still different because improv isn't standup and also because by the time Whose Line came to the US most of the recurring cast was American/Canadian anyway. Even so, though, I could see them transplanting, say, Would I Lie To You by bringing Rob Brydon, Lee Mack, and David Mitchell over for a season- let's say, Rob as the host but Lee and David as occasional guests rather than team leaders, with US-based people brought in for those roles- and then cycling in both UK-based panel show stalwarts and US-based panel show newbies so that the show can get on its feet."
The Emigrants,"There's just not really a market for it. There's a lot of *similar* stuff, most of Earwolf's output has largely the same appeal, but a panel show has relatively high overhead. Comedy Bang Bang and Threedom have or have had game segments with points, or you could maybe compare it to the rise of comedy tabletop roleplaying podcasts like Harmontown."
The Emigrants,"Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! has been going strong since 1998 as a radio show, so I think its more doable than people are giving the idea credit in America.  That said I think TV execs in our country really latched onto reality TV for their ""cheap"" television programming where you don't even have to pay to have decent personalities on.  I bet one breaks through at some point on a major network though."
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,"The reason they fail is because there's no market for it, not because of any difference between comedy styles. Panel shows originated in the US with the show 'Information Please' on the radio and then 'Play the Game' on tv, they had their heyday in the 50s and 60s, then petered out in the 70s (though shows like Hollywood Squares and The Gong Show were still pretty popular after this era), to be replaced by the rise of sketch shows like Saturday Night Live. Shows like 'Wait Wait don't tell me' occupy a niche market, but for the most part Panel Shows are still seen as old-fashioned style of comedy in North America.

Attempts to psychoanalyze the differences between US and UK comedy styles here is needless masturbation.

EDIT: to go further, I also think it has to do with how the entertainment industries of both countries are structured as well. British entertainment is smaller, more tight-knit, dominated by Oxbridge alums, and based almost exclusively in London.  Many of the panelists on these shows will have a history of collaboration and prior relationships, which is conducive to the rapport that is required for a panel show. The American entertainment industry is more diffuse, spread out between LA, NYC, and to a lesser extent Chicago, and orders of magnitude bigger. You'll get these pockets of collaborative relationships at the city level, such as those in Boston and Chicago (the aforementioned Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me is based in Chicago and most of it's panelists live in or near the city), but they don't have that much appeal outside of those cities."
The Emigrants,"I think what would help a US panel show is if the comedians understood that it's not really a competition, points are basically a meaningless formality and it's suppose to be more like improv where you build off others instead of trying to outshine each other. Nothing ruins a panel show more than someone taking it too seriously and being too competitive"
The Emigrants,Same reason the US Taskmaster show failed. American comedians are more competitive and just want to win
The Emigrants,I'm unfamiliar with panel shows.  Is that like Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn?  I used to love that show.
The Emigrants,"God, I miss @ Midnight."
The Emigrants,"@midnight was probably the closest thing we ever got to an American panel show, and I miss it terribly."
The Emigrants,"It's similar to the idea behind game shows in the US - cheap TV that can easily produced without much trouble. It's basically there to fill the schedule.

However, unlike game shows, the panel show can be downright excellent comedic entertainment. And it's less for competition and just for comedians to come on and have some fun."
The Emigrants,"I think it has to do with that the uk scene is one big club where most people know each other and the banter as a result feels more natural.

In the US, it's more island like, I think there are islands, like groups from different eras of shows like snl, the daily show, Conan etc. with only some people genuinely part of multiple groups, the only ones who really cross over are talk show hosts.  Inside the groups the banter will be natural and easy, which imo is required for a panel show, but it gets a bit awkward when there is a crossover.

Also there is a fairly different attitude in America for game shows I don't think there are any ""bragging rights"" shows in America without any substantial prizes like University challenge, only connect, house of games, heck even pointless and other shows with a low average prize pot. In america it seems like there needs to be something absurdly high value on the line. Maybe that also explains why the points need to matter in the US...."
The Emigrants,"I think for panel shows to work, you need to be the butt of the joke sometimes. You need to let a comment land and sell it for the entertainment of the show, you can't always 'get your line in' and be 'the funny one'

You're not really competing the beat the other comedians, you're supposed to be working together to entertain and be funny"
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,"Panel shows like What's My Line and To Tell The Truth? I don't know the british ones, mostly because I hate British humor (even British Whose Line is horrible). I'd be cool if we had more shows like I've Got A Secret and What's My Line. The current To Tell The Truth is decent, but ehhhh"
The Emigrants,Because panel shows are corny and lame.
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,Nerdist? I think it's ID10T now though.
The Emigrants,">Not saying that US comedians aren't necessarily friends with each other- I have no idea- but they'd have to start that whole rapport from scratch, essentially, if they just made one panel show and got random people to appear on it each week. 

I got to this point and immediately said ""oh yeah, they're all on the podcast circuit with each other"". And then that answered the question I was wondering too- why don't we do panel shows? The answer, at least now, is that they're all doing podcasts and pretty much every single one of them - even the ones you've never heard of - can make more money doing that than they would just showing up on TV from time to time. Between BlueChew ads and Patreon subscriptions, that's where comedians are at right now.

I think it could work if there was enough appetite to do it among enough big names, but they probably prefer the money, the working conditions and lack of censorship by just doing podcasts."
The Emigrants,"That's funny, Whose Line started in England first."
The Emigrants,"This was what I was going to say! If you listen to how did this get made? Paul Scheer June Diane and Jason Mantzoukas have now worked together for years not just on this podcast but on other TV shows. When they invite their comedy buddies to guest host and pick a part of dumb movie, it's usually people they know."
The Emigrants,Please don't talk during the Would You Rather intro.
The Emigrants,"I also feel like the few american panel shows i've seen tend to feel more like super prepared/written bits and less of like a free flowing conversation and quick, witty responses.  It sometimes sounds like when comedians go on a talk show and sort of adapt parts of their routine in the form of a conversation."
The Emigrants,"Stephen fry has talked about the uk vs usa style of comedy and it‚Äôs a very similar conclusion. Very fascinating discussion too, it‚Äôs on YouTube"
The Emigrants,Maybe you‚Äôre thinking stand up vs improv?  There are a shit ton of American improv comics that would kill at panel shows if given the chance.
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,US comedians try to use their comedy to be dominant and the Alpha in every situation.
The Emigrants,"Agree completely. I don't agree at all with the point the top commenter is making, saying that US humor isn't self depricating and relies on solo style selfishness. For the first point, self depricating humor has been huge in the US for decades now, running the gamut from people like Rodney Dangerfield to Mitch Hedberg to John Mulaney who all make jokes about how much they suck. Even a super mainstream comedian, Kevin Hart, constantly pokes fun of how short he is and how much ""of a bitch"" he can be. For the second, most big times comedians started in improv groups which absolutely do not work in a ""selfish"" style"
The Emigrants,Always amazes the lengths people go to to generalize like this based on nationality.
The Emigrants,Have you watched British panel shows? They are fundamentally different from anything the US does or has done. And you can see American comedian struggle with the format when they participate.
The Emigrants,"I also think the internet is a better medium for panel shows because of the reasons mentioned in your edit, allowing for both close-knit performers and the ability for an audience to self-select for a style and substance of humor that speaks to them.

Shows like [The Panalysts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz8JeFz7e5w&list=PLV_qemO0oatgrLyY6mvPSlxx3SZdrhfQC) (technically Canadian, but that's still North American) and College Humor's [Game Changer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88et7YlmzTs) (there's probably a better example of a panel show from them, but I'll never not share that clip) are pretty good."
The Emigrants,"Looking at the UK version people like Rhod don't give a shit about winning and are just doing it because it's fun for them. 

Also which American comedian would plot with another comedian to steal the hosts trousers?"
The Emigrants,POINTS!
The Emigrants,"You mention three shows that have all batted around huge talents like nothing. Michael Che was a correspondent on The Daily Show literally weeks before becoming the Update host. Steve Carrell and Stephen Colbert *both* owe their careers to The Daily Show, and they both got their start on Dana Carvey‚Äôs sketch show. Another SNL alum. Additionally, Conan owes his show and career to SNL."
The Emigrants,Nothing about the panel show format lends itself to that as an issue and you would have realized that immediately had you thought for two seconds before you started typing.
The Emigrants,You hate British humour...do you think it's all the same? That's a fucking dumb take.
The Emigrants,Talking about comedians not actors.
The Emigrants,"Yet these shows have *never* existed in the US.

Take your misguided nonsense elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Louis CK is out touring, doing sold out shows and Dave Chappelle is the highest paid comedian in the world."
The Emigrants,Wow. I don't think you know what ghetto means tbh
The Emigrants,"That isn't uncommon with British shows, particularly ones like Mock The Week and 8 Out Of 10 Cats"
The Emigrants,[deleted]
The Emigrants,"I agree with this, some of them are more about making a political point than being funny."
The Emigrants,">I don't agree at all with the point the top commenter is making, saying that US humor isn't self depricating and relies on solo style selfishness. 

People constantly parrot this on Reddit because Stephen Fry said it and they take his word as gospel.

Yeah, I don‚Äôt know where they get this notion that US comedians aren‚Äôt self-deprecating. Bill Burr‚Äôs entire schtick is that he‚Äôs a loud idiot who‚Äôs probably wrong most of the time. Louis CK‚Äôs act is that he‚Äôs a fat, gross guy.  Conan O‚ÄôBrien, Pete Holmes, Tom Segura, Sarah Silverman, Jim Gaffigan and Patton  Oswalt constantly make fun of themselves."
The Emigrants,The difference is that British comedians are better team players. Kevin Hart is a perfect example of a US comedian whose instinct is to push himself to the foreground. His style of comedy would not work on a panel show.
The Emigrants,"Sure, but that doesn't refute any of my points."
The Emigrants,"Yes, but my point is that che probably doesn't doesn't have as good a reltionship with anyone at the daily show as compared to the current snl crew.  

The people like Conan, carvey who have been around long enough and on enough shows that they could be the hosts of the panel show so that both ""teams"" can rib them in their own way. But I don't think the teams themselves would be able to banter as effectively if they weren't from the same place. That would take quite some time  to develop, and I don't think the networks / streamers will let the show run that long."
The Emigrants,"Every time I have watched something british it was never funny. Monty Python, original whose line, anything with ricky gervais"
The Emigrants,"A League of Their Own is quite clearly scripted as well, esp the pre-filmed bits and specials like their US roadtrip episodes."
The Emigrants,Jerry Seinfeld.
The Emigrants,"Where are you getting that from? At best it's a correlation vs causation issue. You can't say that panel shows don't exist in the US because US comedians aren't ""team players"" as there's zero evidence to prove that. Kevin Hart is a strong personality but I used him as a self deprocating example. 

Have you never heard of UCB? SNL? Those are just two examples of ""troupes"" that require teamwork. Sketch comedy in general is a very team oriented deal and it's big in the US. It seems like you're unfairly comparing panel shows to straight up stand-up while of course the later is more of a solo thing. 

Even with panel shows there are ""show stealers"". A lot of the recent Big Fat Quiz shows have strong personalities like Noel Fielding or Richard Ayoade dominating most of the laughs"
The Emigrants,"I'm not trying to debate you so I'm not looking to refute specific points. But I disagree that there is no market for panel shows in the US. The US market is heavily segmented, but the networks have always aimed for the broadest market possible.

With drama and comedy, HBO, AMC, Starz, et cetera have shown that there is room in the market for 'different' content."
The Emigrants,">You can't say that panel shows don't exist in the US because US comedians aren't ""team players"" as there's zero evidence to prove that.

The US has a very strong stand up comedy culture, stand up by nature isn't a team effort.

The UK has many stand up comedians, but they are not always the funniest people in panel shows.

For a panel show to work, you need people who have learned to play off each other.

As for sketch comedy, US sketch comedy is very different from UK sketch comedy with far more signaling of jokes. Which is awful in a panel show,

I live in a country where signaling is big and every panel show (mostly based on UKJ shows) is awful as a result."
The Emigrants,"She was great! She had such a chilling energy when she had that lunch with Sara, especially once she started talking about her Father‚Äôs ‚Äúaccident with a bridge.‚Äù

Her and the guy who played Goo Goo Knox had great, gross chemistry, as well haha"
The Emigrants,"I just finished season 2, and I totally agree! She is awesome! She shows the whole range of emotions in several scenes. Can't wait to see more from her!"
The Emigrants,"Many Amish communities still speak Pennsylvania Dutch and so that affects their English accents.

America is currently just under foreign control. You'd need substantial immigration from German speakers and time before the accent of Americans would be affected. Americans would certainly end up with a great deal of new loan words, but you wouldn't have an entire country changing the way they speak in 15 years unless either most of the natives died or there was a huge totalitarian effort to change the way people speak. In which case, they would be forcing people to speak German, not an accented English.

I think if you gave it another 15 years, you'd start to see a lot of German accents as children are born to German/American couples and German media affects children. Currently there would be no adults affected that way in this universe.

You'd need a massive amount of Germans immigrating before the speech pattern of people changed, more people than Germany would have had at the time. The post war baby boom would still be too young."
The Emigrants,"IIRC,  in the show's timeline the invasion of North America completed in 1947-48. The series takes place in early 1962-3 ¬ø Basically fifteen years, not really enough time for Americana to fade away."
The Emigrants,"I haven't read the book but I imagine it wouldn't change much if the US was placed directly under Nazi control, but still had Americans in charge. It'll be like how Texans don't get Obamas accent even though he is in charge. "
Wisting,I really just want her to join John Wick 3. 
Wisting,[deleted]
Wisting,"And most importantly:

Omega has only one rule. Don't. Fuck. With Aria."
Wisting,[deleted]
Wisting,I just can't get enough Nordic Noir tv. 
Wisting,Just a friendly reminder that The Matrix was filmed 20 god damn year ago. 
Wisting,Like she hasn't worked in 15 years.
Wisting,"How does she still look so amazing? Witchcraft?  

And wafch Memento, it's amazing"
Wisting,The question we should be asking is why every major actor from the Matrix series haven't aged a god damn day.
Wisting,She‚Äôs so badass as Hogarth in the Netflix MCU. One of the first women I had a crush on growing up and as far as I‚Äôm concerned she‚Äôs still a stunner. 
Wisting,Anyone know if this series will be in English?
Wisting,She was also a frequent guest star in the police drama Crossing Lines.
Wisting,I really liked her in Disturbia
Wisting,She is still looking great and looks just a day older than the final shots of the first matrix. She is immortal folks
Wisting,"She also starred in Unthinkable with Samuel L.Jackson, good flick"
Wisting,why can't they age ...?
Wisting,Title is a mouthful.
Wisting,"I think everyone knows who she is, she's a really popular actress that has been in the industry for decades."
Wisting,No one can straddle the line between hot or not like Carrie-Anne Moss
Wisting,That‚Äôs a name I haven‚Äôt heard in some time
Wisting,"LMAO. the matrix's 

are we just gonna keep naming movies from decades ago? 

people know who fucking carrie-anne moss is. 

nobody says ""Iron man's Robert Downey Jr"" 

...."
Wisting,Whoa... how did I not realize Carrie-Anne Moss was the woman from The Matrix when I was watching Jessica Jones... 
Wisting,Just say Carrie-Anne Moss. 
Wisting,Isn't she like 50 now?
Wisting,"If she acted in a porno, it would be called 'fisting'. "
Wisting,I think you mean Iron Fist's Carrie-Anne Moss!
Wisting,Just realized that Trinity is Jeri Hogarth...
Wisting,"I wonder if it bothers her to be known as ""The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss.""

She was also good in Momento."
Wisting,I really liked her in 'Fido' with Billy Connolly --it's my favorite zombie movie and it's hilarious 
Wisting,Haven't seen her in a while. Hope she reunites with keanu reeves down the track.
Wisting,She looks so much like my ex's mum. It's awful. 
Wisting,"Hey Carrie-Anne, whats your game now can anybody play?"
Wisting,"Poor Carrie, like she hasn't done anything since 1999."
Wisting,She‚Äôs also in Jessica Jones.
Wisting,She was awesome as the hard ass lawyer in Jessica Jones. 
Wisting,"Somehow I first read that with a F, and it became a *whole* other show."
Wisting,I read the title wrong and went into this with wrong expectations.
Wisting,She‚Äôs a stuck up bitch in real life .  Wonder if she‚Äôd made it if she didn‚Äôt have that nose job . 
Wisting,I like how she is referred to as a matrix actor not house of cards lol
Wisting,Where's my pussay!!!????
Wisting,She speaks Norwegian?  Or is the show shot in English?
Wisting,She must be wisting she still had matrix fame and money
Wisting,I like.good detective mydtery shows like the Killing...haven't been able to find a good one since 
Wisting,#Trinity.
Wisting,This sounds fun.
Wisting,The matrix? No no no that's Peters mom.
Wisting,I feel sorry for actors that have been out of the limelight for so long that they have to have the name of their most recognisable film before their name in a headline.
Wisting,You know I poked through this thread and am sad no one mentioned Mass Effect 2 and 3.  She was good there.    
Wisting,you mean Iron Fist's Carrie Anne Moss???
Wisting,Carrie Anne Moss was also in a TV show called The Matrix.
Wisting,"You don't need to say the Matrix's Carrie Ann Moss, it's redundant.

We're all owned by the matrix."
Wisting,"19 years later. Still ""The Matrix's"" Carrie-Anne Moss. FeelsBadMan

I'm sure she's done more. I'm not a movie guy, so I haven't seen any, but I'm sure there's more to credit her with."
Wisting,Nordic TV is just the best 
Wisting,Holy shit... Shes still alive?
Wisting,If she was blonde she‚Äôd look almost identical to Clare in House of Cards
Wisting,Just watched Memento again last night after seeing it years ago. Didn't realize she was in it. 
Wisting,Has anyone ever disliked a person because if how well he\she portrayed a character? I can't stand seeing her after watching Momento. Or the guy that plays Joffrey in GoT. 
Wisting,"I thought she was dead. ...huh
 "
Wisting,"I loved Carrie-Anne Moss in the Matrix just as much as any other nerd, but most of you are saying she still looks amazing? What the hell are you smoking? Come on, she's old. She looks okay *for her age*, but nothing like she did 20 years ago. This is why she's taking lesser roles. Hollywood generally rejects female actresses over 40. Do all of you have some kind of fetish for 50 year old women or something? What gives?"
Wisting,[deleted]
Wisting,I never knew I wanted this until now
Wisting,I feel stupid for not having thought of that ever. Especially after Morpheus in 2.
Wisting,Dude...
Wisting,"If she helps him everything will be too easy, if she is against him it would just be heartbreaking"
Wisting,Would we call it a Trilogy or a Trinity?
Wisting,Hugo Weaving also needs to be in John Wick 3.
Wisting,"Hardcore fan here, fucking love the franchise"
Wisting,Stop! I can only get so erect! 
Wisting,She was perfect in that role. I think she helped carry the show through the second season.
Wisting,And Marvel's Netflix shows (primarily Daredevil)
Wisting,"""I broke Omega's only rule, in more ways than one."" - Neo"
Wisting,"Holy shit, that is her voice, goddamn. Do you know how many times i've played mass effect? Do you know how many times i've watched Jessica Jones or The Matrix? You just blew my goddamn mind man."
Wisting,Sounds like neither of us likes being jerked around.
Wisting,"It seems the whole Matrix cast is good at not aging. Her, Keanu Reeves, even Laurence Fishburne looks good."
Wisting,For some reason I never found her all that attractive when she was in The Matrix. Her character on Daredevil is crazy hot though and it totally comes from her performance. That and the making out with women part. 
Wisting,She hasn't lost her charm as she's been aging.
Wisting,Idk why but her face just bothers me. I never understood why Neo didn‚Äôt dump that hoe and just digitally construct some bomb ass dime piece
Wisting,"Watching The Bridge right now, it's god damn incredible."
Wisting,Seriously. I wish we had a BBC like Norway channel in the US
Wisting,"I've seen The Bridge, Wallander, Dragon Tattoo, Fortitude...  Does Shetland count?"
Wisting,Does *Trollhunter* count?
Wisting,Can you please throw up some good recommendations? I need more Nordic Noire in my life. 
Wisting,"Any good ones on Netflix you could recommend? I watched ""Trapped"" and ""Fortitude""."
Wisting,"Also lots of good shows from Denmark: Borgen, Arvingern(The Legacy), Bedrag(Follow the Money), the Department Q series of movies. "
Wisting,What about UK misery porn detective shows? 
Wisting,johan falk
Wisting, what are you're top nordic tv shows? 
Wisting,"Check out Graven, which I describe [in my other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/813tbl/the_matrixs_carrieanne_moss_joins_norwegian/dv0ydi8/). "
Wisting,Any good Detective/Mystery series you can recommend?
Wisting,We old.
Wisting,Valid point. However if anyone anywhere will know her from somthing. It will be from the Matrix.
Wisting,She's been in TV shows in the last 15 years.
Wisting,I'm a big fan of hers and I think I've only seen her in 2 things since the Matrix so it makes sense. 
Wisting,We're in the Matrix?
Wisting,"If you can pull off short hair and cut, your beauty can be lasting. "
Wisting,Because they're all top of the line actors who get top of the line makeup artists because they work big budget stuff.
Wisting,That'd be disappointing for a Norwegian show.
Wisting,"Her part definitely will, but not the others."
Wisting,"Likely a bit of both, Carrie-Anne's character will definitely be speaking english, any norwegian characters will more than likely do the same whenever they interact with her.

If norwegian characters are interactng without any foreign characters present, then no, they'll almost definitely not be speaking english, because why would they?

So it depends on how involved the english speaking characters are in the story, which I know nothing about."
Wisting,I miss that show.
The New Land,"Kal Penn worked in the White House for the Obama administration for a couple of years, so he did have an ""in"" to help land this interview.

It's always been funny to me that we live in a timeline where someone could take a leave from a position in a sitting President's administration to go film *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas*."
The New Land,Would love to see Joe on Between two Ferns personally
The New Land,Kal penn is a safe host for biden. I dont imagine theyd want hasan minhaj there asking real questions or marlon wayans there just inevitably making biden say something weird about black people. Kal can just guide him into not saying anything too dumb
The New Land,I enjoyed Kal Penn on Designated Survivor.
The New Land,hope they announce a permanent host soon!
The New Land,And here comes the softball questions.
The New Land,Thank God it isn‚Äôt Korn Pop. That dudes bad
The New Land,It‚Äôs only comedy show when it is convenient. It‚Äôs easy to see the double standard here.
The New Land,Life imitating art
The New Land,Buncha softball BS PR stunt. Not worth watching.
The New Land,"curious to see how Penn does on the daily show...he def has the political knowledge, but his comedy output is def more on the cheesy/corny side (i might also be biased, the only thing ive seen him in recently is that santa clause disney plus show lol, where he is a complete ham)"
The New Land,"Voted for the guy, but I really hope this isn't just Kal sucking up to him. They should take him to task on screwing over the railroad union."
The New Land,Bunch of softball questions with a random impassioned and amazingly ignorant rant about taking away guns.
The New Land,Climate change the hot topic? Not out of control housing costs?  Food costs? CoL in general?
The New Land,Nothing but softball questions and compliments. Not even surprising. I guess you have to get a Republican on there for there to be a real interview.
The New Land,I‚Äôm sure some tough questions will be asked
The New Land,I‚Äôm sure that only the toughest questions will be asked!
The New Land,What a schmooze fest that‚Äôs going to be.
The New Land,I hope they go with Sarah Silverman. She‚Äôs already politically inclined. Tried to do a similar thing with that America series. And Fox already hates her.
The New Land,"I kind of like this rotating host system they have going on. That said, if they do make the change to 1 permanent host, it needs to be Hasan Minhaj."
The New Land,So it's more of a reelection campaign commercial with The Daily Show label.
The New Land,‚ÄúLands‚Äù. As though it wasn‚Äôt all strategically planned.
The New Land,pointless to interview any President when the interviewer is a puppet for the administration
The New Land,The one interview for the year. Won‚Äôt see him again after this.
The New Land,Great score. Really happy to see this.
The New Land,who wants to take bets on the youtube vote ratio
The New Land,Daily Show ain't what it used to be for sure
The New Land,"So wild to me how much of a big deal it is to get an interview with the President in the USA, in my country (Australia) the Prime Minister has to do an interview everyday, and generally does more than that, and pretty much every question why are you so shit, and they just have to laugh it off every single day"
The New Land,TIL Kal Penn is hosting The Daily Show
The New Land,Didn‚Äôt Kal Penn also serve under the Obama Administration?
The New Land,Don‚Äôt even need to watch this to know all the questions are going to be softballs.
The New Land,Oh the propaganda channel got the interview? How unexpected
The New Land,Absolutely riveting.  I‚Äôm sure it will smash records.
The New Land,I'm shocked a democrat would risk going on this show.
The New Land,"Well, don‚Äôt expect any harder hitting question than ‚Äúwhat is your morning routine?‚Äù"
The New Land,Kal Penn is such a hack. He hasn't been interesting since Harold and Kumar.
The New Land,"‚ÄúThis is a job I want, I want people to know I want this job‚Äù

I see you Kal. I was pulling for Hasan but his guest host week didn‚Äôt really blow me away. I think he‚Äôd need to switch the shows format up a bit more so he can be more dynamic like Patriot Act. Looking forward to what Kal has up his sleeve"
The New Land,He's a friendly.
The New Land,Imagine if we had Hasan Minhaj. He would have went straight for the jugular instead of h to see softball questions. Hope he gets the full time gig.
The New Land,"The whole interview is unwatchable, gladly I only saw a few clips to see how bad it was. Kal Penn sitting there like he's learning something new or amazed at his statements was laughable. 

Kal's job in Obama admin was a joke of a title, look it up."
The New Land,don‚Äôt forget he left House M.D. for the White House gig.
The New Land,I watched the first season of Designated Survivor. Pretty cool he actually had real world experience for that role.
The New Land,"> where someone could take a leave from a position in a sitting President's administration to go film *A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas*.

And bless them for letting him"
The New Land,"Guy took administrative leave from the white house to get filmed getting his dick stuck to an icy pole

Honestly I just respect the grind."
The New Land,"Wow I did not know he took a leave to go film that. More power to this guy, he‚Äôs always been a wholesome dude from what I can tell. Looking forward to the interview."
The New Land,Kumar cutting his pubes with Harold's scissors to making his way all the way to the white house. Kal has an interesting career.
The New Land,"Especially when the person is incredibly well rounded, intelligent, and charismatic, rather than a disgrace lol."
The New Land,A competitor between Zach and Joe to see who can invade the others' personal space the most
The New Land,Hasan really took the Shark Tank guy to task over FTX. I hope they go with him as the new host cause that's a tough act to beat.
The New Land,"Kal Penn worked in the Obama White House, he probably has a hand in setting it up. And how can you call him ‚Äòsafe‚Äô when we‚Äôve not even seen him host?"
The New Land,I love Biden and voted for him but he can be too candid at times. Personally I think it is part of his charm but people have used it against him in the past. I'm not sure Kal Penn will 100% prevent that but he couldn't hurt.
The New Land,They're planning on doing this until the fall so I wouldn't expect an announcement until the summer.
The New Land,It‚Äôll be Roy Wood Jr and Mayim Bialik splitting the hosting duties
The New Land,I‚Äôm fully expecting Roy Wood Jr. to be the permanent host.
The New Land,"Well, I believe Biden has until 2024 at least."
The New Land,Would want to see more Wanda Sykes tbh.
The New Land,It's the Daily Show are you expecting journalism?
The New Land,[deleted]
The New Land,And why are you expecting hard hitting questions from the Daily Show?!
The New Land,"Softball questions or not, focusing a portion of the interview on LGBT rights was good for the country, good for the program, good for Kal Penn, and good for Biden and Democrats."
The New Land,"Yeah, its only worth watch if they have a Republican on. That's the only time they ask the hard questions."
The New Land,"If it were Jon Stewart‚Äôs new show, he‚Äôd grill tf out of him. That show is excellent"
The New Land,I don't think Biden knows much about softball... but I wonder if he'd be able to make contact against someone like Jenny Finch.. I'm guessing no. But I guess that's why we ask these questions.
The New Land,they've been playing that game for a long time
The New Land,"Yeah I hope the actor who used to work for Biden when he was VP does a good job taking him to task on the Comedy Central TV show, too"
The New Land,You'll see harder pitches at tee-ball games.
The New Land,It‚Äôs the daily show dude. It‚Äôs a comedy show.
The New Land,"brave of you to admit that at this point.  most qualify it with an 'i really wanted ______'.  if you say Bernie, you'll get reddit karma btw."
The New Land,"Why lol, it‚Äôs basically a comedy show. It will be as tough as Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù questioning a republican.

Both are ‚Äûentertainment‚Äù channels."
The New Land,"I think the Hulu series ended after one season because she didn‚Äôt want to continue. I might be wrong. If I‚Äôm right, that indicates to me that she doesn‚Äôt want to spend most of her time on something like this. 

But I hope I‚Äôm wrong; she was great."
The New Land,"She has been my favorite so far. Leslie Jones was great, too. Did not like Marlon Wayans or DL Hughley. Any others would be good imo."
The New Land,"I liked that show, but it was around the time when there was like a dozen political comedy shows, they‚Äôre mostly all gone now though"
The New Land,I feel bad because Kal Penn is great and deserving of his own show--but not The Daily Show. I think Hasan comes the closest to Jon Stewart and his energy.
The New Land,People aren't puppets because they disagree with you.
The New Land,This show airs on Comedy Central. It‚Äôs not journalism.
The New Land,"Yep as Obama Administration's ""Principal Associate Editor for Public Engagement"" before going on to play a similar role in 2016 on the TV-Drama 'Designated Survivor'

 So really just a soft-ball interview by a familiar friend of the Administration handed to the Daily Show to be spoon fed *erm* I mean aired to their audience."
The New Land,"I think it was rather sudden departure too, was he the character that the writers Unalived himself?"
The New Land,He also helped Lex Luthor try to kill Superman.
The New Land,Holy shit it's thingy form House!!
The New Land,[removed]
The New Land,Same. Seeing him as a host made me remember how good he was on Patriot Act‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame that got canceled.
The New Land,"Agreed, thought it was awesome too. I actually thought the shark tank guy was pretty impressive too, he rolled with the interview and actually looked like he enjoyed the back and forth. Maybe an act but he did good getting his point across too."
The New Land,"Hasan is 100% John Stewart's spiritual successor. He's great and is only going to improve with age.

John Stewart was 33 when he took over The Daily Show and it took him a while to find his groove.

Hasan is 37 now and very much hitting his stride.

Hasan could bring back The Daily Show in a big way."
The New Land,They won't. The corporate overlords will want someone safe.
The New Land,Yea agreed he‚Äôs exactly what the show should be but also a liability to interview biden on a temporary contract
The New Land,"Because to reddit, anyone who isn't an angry, extreme liberal who's going to blatantly attack anything that isn't left enough for them is ""too safe"" while they reframe TDS as a hard hitting liberal circle jerk session instead of.. a comedy show.

Basically they want Hassan Minaj screaming about how Republicans are Nazis and anything less is ""too safe"""
The New Land,"Shot:

>Kal Penn worked in the Obama White House

Chaser:

>And how can you call him 'safe'"
The New Land,How often do you think they call Jon Stewart and offer him more money?
The New Land,Has Al Franken been on yet? He and Silverman were the only 2 I was interested in.
The New Land,"Not OP, but when I watched the daily show with John Stewart, whenever they interviewed politicians, local or otherwise, they usually either gave them awkward questions, or (more likely) edited the interview to make the politician look a little foolish or out of touch.

As you say, people watch the Daily show for entertainment, this feels like little more than pandering and trying to make Biden 'connect' with the younger voters. Not expecting much from the interview and I doubt they do anything that will make Biden look silly."
The New Land,"I wish I could expect it to be non partisan 

Think they would toss a republican softballs?"
The New Land,They seem interested in real journalism when it's something targeting conservatives.
The New Land,"Nahhhh, this sub can‚Äôt have it both ways. You all talk about Daily Show and John Oliver being team journalism but then, if any criticism comes up, you immediately revert back to ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a comedy show‚Äù.

Edit: downvotes prove I‚Äôve hit a sensitive spot"
The New Land,reddit moment
The New Land,"Before the 24 hour news cycle blew up, news became partisan, and networks needed to play ball to retain access to political figures, journalists would regularly challenge any and all political figures. 

So yeah, back to THOSE good old days when the FCC fairness doctrine was still in place.

EDIT - But to be fair, The Daily Show couldn't exist with the fairness doctrine in place. Or would have to be more directly a parody."
The New Land,When was the last time Biden did an interview with a non allied interviewer?
The New Land,If you‚Äôre talking about Trump then I would say that Biden isn‚Äôt that much better.
The New Land,"If Daily Show are going to invite politicians they should at least try to ask tough questions rather than kissing their asses.

If not then don‚Äôt invite them."

Vermin,"Life and times of Tim was awesome, you are probably a bad person"
Vermin,"What makes you say that? It's more than possible to make a quality adult cartoon (Archer, Bojack Horseman, etc)"
Vermin,"I think it is more the ""adult themed"" tag, because that hails memories of Ren & Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon, which I feel bad for even having to remind people exists. Profanity, nudity/sex, violence/gore, it is all great to an extent, but run it into the ground and it becomes trashy. "
Vermin,"Meh. Archer started good and just dropped off quality in it's recent seasons, Bojack was never too good.


Although Adult Swim has consistently created some of the best adult animated shows out there with stuff like Venture Bros. or Metalocalypse."
Vermin,"There's an apparent flood of cartoons, many 'adult themed', coming out all over the place, and HBO has limited slots available.  It's never been my cup of tea."
Vermin,"Bojack is horrible. I tried to give it another chance, the jokes just do nothing but fumble every time. "

Vermin,"The original kind of sucked and was annoying in general. But I'd be up for a darker version of Captain Planet though. Basically a punisher version; he kills people to protect the planet, the teenagers are now grown-up with mild drug and alcohol issues like normal people and fight with guns and explosives, and the show is R rated."
Vermin,"What was the bad guys' end game goal? If they destroyed the planet, they can't live there anymore"
Vermin,"And I want the people who did that 'Lost In Space' Netflix show to make it. High production value, family friendly entertainment."
Vermin,Captain Planet would kill himself the second he showed up.  Thats how fucked the planet is.
Vermin,"No, it's not.  Worst cartoon ever.  Every single Captain Planet episode was the same.  

1) The greedy villain is trying to make a shitload of money, and the only way he can do it is by polluting the planet

2) Teenagers: ""Hey, he can't do that!  We have to stop him!""

3) Villain proceeds to kick the teenagers asses for 20+ minutes

4) Teenagers call Captain Planet, who comes in and wipes the floor with said villain in 30 seconds

The End"
Vermin,It will be if they remake it....
Vermin,The problem is that we let those fringe groups matter instead of treating them as irrelevant.
Vermin,They were saying that when it aired.

Vermin,"Since no-one other than /u/GamersAreAlive /u/Jephtha86, & /u/ra9_ has really provided much, I thought I'd dig a bit more.

Dr. Nira Cain seems to be the character, based on the Augusta, GA radio show. The host mentioned a website hastily put together showing him as an author.

I couldn't find the website on a quick search on mobile, but did find a number of books ""written"" by Dr. Cain (all currently unavailable); here are two of the better titles:

Being Food: Living Life in the Food Chain - https://www.bookdepository.com/Being-Food-Dr-Nira-Cain/9781974020157

Description: We have lost touch with our food. So much of what we eat comes prepackaged and prepared in plastic, hardly any of us have any knowledge or understanding of where our food comes from or how it is produced. In a bold undertaking, the first of it's kind; Dr. Nira Cain places himself inside the food chain to experience the processes through which our food reaches the dinner table.

Immoral Toddlers - https://www.amazon.com/Immoral-Toddlers-Dr-Nira-Cain/dp/1974020436?ref=pf_vv_at_pdctrvw_dp

Description: Dr. Nira Cain has carried out extensive studies in child development and the chasm of difference between gender experience in the formative years. He reveals how society forms behaviors and expectations that carve a path for our children that few would recognize. This eye-opening book shows us the vast wealth of impression imposed upon children through societies norms. Thankfully it also offers solutions to inform every parent in how to change things for the better.

Also:

The Freedom Illusion - https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Illusion-Dr-Nira-Cain/dp/1974019535

Description: Dr. Nira Cain explores the notion of freedom and the application of this powerful word in contemporary discourse. Casually employed by patriots and politicians the word carries all manner of implications, but what freedoms do we actually enjoy and how free are we?

From the 'About the Author' for this book: Dr. Nira Cain is Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at Reed College, Portland OR. He is a keen cyclist and hiker enjoying the beautiful sights of Portland, Oregon in his spare time.

Note that Reed College (reed.edu) is a real college, but does not have a Dr. Cain listed in the directory, nor does it have a Gender and Women's Studies Department.

You don‚Äôt need to be offended this guy liked other shows more. *Your* favorite is still *your* favorite.

OP took the time to write some pretty decent reviews for the shows, and even brought a few to my attention I hadn‚Äôt heard of that sound great. The Newsreader in particular.  There is no need to downvote this post"

Crisis Jung,"surprised heike monogatari is only 13. feels like it should be much higher with the amazing work they did on humanizing the various characters. Especially the struggles and decisions made by tokuko and the motivations behind them.

the production also did a fantastic job accurately depicting the historical setting. the beautiful and ugly. the luxury of the elite and the devastation endured by regular people. The social obligations and expectations everyone has to navigate and deal with. especially women.

the show is also not just aesthetically japanese or historically japanese but extremely culturally japanese. Especially the ending.

---

i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

the intentionality changed and with it, i felt like it ruined the show. >!(people killing themselves from their own volition as opposed to due to the machinations of a spooky AI daughter ghost out for revenge)!<

will check out blindspotting tho! nice list"
Crisis Jung,"I'm so grateful for this list! I don't exactly know why, but I really growed bored of most american series I was watching. They have very good production values but I guess this list brings a very needed and refreshing cultural perspective. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this list of reviews!"
Crisis Jung,This is the most pretentious shit I‚Äôve ever seen.
Crisis Jung,"Made a decision to watch less American shows this year.

Loved the Newsreader, Thunder in my heart and Threesome.

I wish Succession was on the list thou"
Crisis Jung,"I‚Äôve watched four from this list: Cruel Summer, Blindspotting, Squid Game, and Invincible. I liked three of the four. The other was OK. 

I‚Äôve got Reservation Dogs, Maid, The Serpent, Anna, and Wonder Egg Priority on my watchlist already and have heard good things about all of them. 

I‚Äôm intrigued enough by the descriptions to add The Newsreader, Eden, Delete Me, and Sonny Boy to my watchlist. Hopefully they pop up,in my region at some point as I think of the bunch only Sonny Boy is available to me right now."
Crisis Jung,"Not only did you put *Wonder Egg Priority* above *Odd Taxi*, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime. Furthermore, *Ousama-ranking* is missing as well (and presumably below *Wonder Egg Priority* according to this list). I can't comment on most of the other shows, because I haven't seen them, but the anime ranked on this is extremely sus. Of course everyone can have their own opinions, but with *Wonder Egg Priority* having such an awful ending even ignoring ep 13 (imo), I cannot see how it deserves to be above literally every other anime this year, let alone 4th among *all* shows this year. Among anime, also strange is *Horimiya* that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above *Odd Taxi*.

Also I admit I'm a fanboy of the show, but *Arcane* missing from the list is extremely suspect. It is the most nominated show at the Annies for a reason, getting a nomination count equal to Disney productions even though it was almost completely unknown (outside the LoL fanbase) before its release. Even if the story and characters are deemed just par, the technical component of the show alone should push it to a spot in a top 25 show of the year list. Also suspect is *Succession* missing, but you did mention elsewhere that you have yet to see it.

I appreciate the well written out thoughts on your top 25, I just think it's a really bizarre ranking. I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that."
Crisis Jung,"Invincible only at 24?

No Arcane nor Ousama Ranking?

Attack on Titan S4P1 and Succession S3 also missed out."

What did you think of the list? Are there any shows you think that should be there that isn't (or vice-versa)? Any shows you think are ranked too high/too low?

**My overall thoughts on 2021 television**: Somehow I found more great shows this year than any other year... but none quite on the level of the top shows from 2020 or 2019 (*...does that make sense?*). There were a lot of bad endings, and quite a few shows on my list had inescapable downsides. But still I haven't seen everything I wanted to see this year as yet (Dopesick, My Name, Yellowjackets etc.), and maybe I'll update this list at the end of January if anything else stands out.

p.s. I'd like to give a shout out to @jramjee on twitter. Because of him I got access to a lot of inaccessible foreign TV shows. And also @L21sMa who took time out of his limited free time to do ~~some~~... in fact *a lot of* writing and editing for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Crisis Jung,Yellowjackets?
Crisis Jung,I need to see Dopesick. Mare of Easttown was never going to be on this list. lol.
Crisis Jung,"Okay firstly, sorry for the late reply to this. 

I had my issues with Heike. I don't think Heike laid out it's story (the genpai war) in a way that people not already familiar with it can fully understand. It's an anime for people already familiar with it (*which makes sense since the Japanese literally learn about the genpai wars in high school*). 

But don't misunderstand me now, even though I had my issues with it skipping pass (not animating) key moments the way it does, I still think it's a fantastic series and fully appreciate it. I mean... I watch over 60-70 new shows this year... so #13 is no small feat. 

> i really liked wonder egg priority and it was the perfect show for me up until episode 7. the beautiful art and amazing animation and fun characters along with tackling the difficult topic of suicide was really nice and meaningful.

> But then I felt like it dropped the ball and focused on things that were antithetical to the topic of suicide. a focus on sci-fi for the sake of sci-fi instead of the raw reality that modern life is fucked for a lot of people.

I agree... and disagree. I mean I don't want to go deep into Wonder Egg Priority post-episode 7 (which in true anime fashion introduced new ideas for the prospect of a big '*good vs evil*' final battle scene, that ultimately we didn't because of production issues), but as I said in another reply WEP accomplished what it needed to by said 7th episode... and it was incredibly impactful (*at least for me*), and nothing that came after (*as bad as it may or may not have been*) diminished that for me.

WEP was easily my #1 of 2021. And for all the reasons you meantion, ended up at #4 instead. But I'd also like to point out that I didn't just consider plot when making this list, so whatever shortcomings it may have developed in that department, to me it still had some of the best animation design, visuals, soundtrack and concept I've seen all of this year."
Crisis Jung,Why?
Crisis Jung,Stick to Vampire Diaries
Crisis Jung,"üòê .... but... why? 

I'm actually curious since for some reason you got unvoted. üòÖ"
Crisis Jung,Damn... I can't believe I found someone else besides me and Luis who watched Thunder in My Heart and Threesome. lol.
Crisis Jung,-*raises glass and nods in approval*-
Crisis Jung,"Okay, great reply! Answering this will be challenging but let's see if I can explain my decision making here. lol. 

First off, nothing is *suspect*, it's just my opinion, honestly. 

> Not only did you put Wonder Egg Priority above Odd Taxi, you also put it at number 4 and the highest ranked anime.

Wonder Egg Priority was actually my #1 show of 2021 before I watch that underproduced ending (*I actually saw it very late too, and read a few comments about the production issues they had*). But despite the unfortunate ending I didn't discard what came before. For me, it's still one of the most impactful and beautiful anime I've ever seen. And honestly, I feel like everything the anime needed to accomplished, it already did by the 7th episode. So it wasn't something that needed a great ending to be significant... it already was. The ending was really just to wrap-up the story. Some viewers put a lot of weight on ending, almost to the point where a great show is now a bad one if it doesn't have a satisfying one, but I don't.

> Among anime, also strange is Horimiya that high. It's actually one of my favorite manga because it's a nice wholesome read, but it quickly devolves into being quite generic after the strong start. I cannot see how it belongs at 19, let alone above Odd Taxi.

ODDTAXI is ranked below Horimiya because of visuals tbh. Plot-wise, Odd Taxi is far superior, but remember, I'm not just considering plot, I'm also considering production design, soundtrack, cinematography etc. (also why Wonder Egg Priority is ranked so high). 

> I will try to check out some of the shows you listed, some of them sound really interesting, so thanks for that.

Yea, you're welcome. Recommending shows is always my main reason for posting these listicles."
Crisis Jung,"I loved Invincible so much that even though it wasn't the more unique or creative thing... and even though I was very underwhelmed by the art-style, it still made the list. 

As for Arcane, [well............](https://c.tenor.com/9pxLR-8u5z4AAAAC/homer-simpson-hiding.gif)

I haven't seen Ranking of Kings. 

And I'm the biggest Attack on Titan fan but as you can see I'm not very open to adding returning shows to my end of year lists."
Crisis Jung,"Invincible was my nr 1 show this year. I had no expectations going in, I had not read the comics. And I was absolutely blown away."
Crisis Jung,I haven't seen the new season yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet! üò©
Crisis Jung,Ted Lasso anybody?
Crisis Jung,I have no interest in checking out the U.S. remake of Scenes from a Marriage tbh. But Yellowjackets is already on my list of course. I'll see with The Shrink Next Door too.
Crisis Jung,"> I heared none of these except maybe 2 titles.

That's suppose to be a good thing. Check them out. 

> Also, where's Succession?

I haven't seen the new season as yet."
Crisis Jung,No wonder I haven't seen any of the shows you consider top of 2021. Obviously we have vastly different tv preference.
Crisis Jung,"can not believe you got downvoted for not liking mare of red herrings. kate winslet must have had a sore back after carrying that piece of shit tv show. your list is very interesting btw, definitely gonna check some of these out"
Crisis Jung,"ended up watching blindspotting and it was everything you described and more. really really great show and solid recommendation.

it felt like an upgrade on hamilton which was already pretty ground breaking.

very deserving of the #1 spot on your list and also now #1 on my list"
Crisis Jung,"Have you seen ""Beforeigners""?"
Crisis Jung,Nordic shows are great
Crisis Jung,Uhhhhh... it doesn't have to be *that* vast. lol. I just found Mare of Easttown to be very unoriginal tbh. Great performances though.
Crisis Jung,"I did [a review of Mare](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/npc6zj/great_performances_and_characters_saves_mare_of/) basically saying the same thing. Kate carried that show, there was just... noting else to it besides the character work and acting."
Crisis Jung,"Awww.. THANK YOU! üòÑüíï 

It makes me happy that you watch it and even happier than you enjoyed it. 

It seems like you actually *got it*. And that's nice to see because not everyone does. I remember me and this other TV critic friend of mine agreeing that it was easily one of the best shows we'd seen for the year (and we rarely agree on anything), but the reaction from imdb and a lot of the comments here didn't think so. It's creativity, and I guess the point of it all, really just flew over their heads. 

You're the 2nd person who've watched it from my recommendation and loved it, so thank you. hehe. 

But anyways, you seem to be an anime fan, so if you could recommend me a few anime similar to Heike or Anohana: The Flower We Saw That Day I'd appreciate it."
Crisis Jung,"Uhh, no, not yet but plan to."
Crisis Jung,"Hmm, animes similar to Heike are probably 

- Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion

- Vinland Saga

for the historical perspective. But they're much more ""anime"". Other stuff by Science Saru is also usually just ""good"" though. Like 

- Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!

---

honorable mention goes to 

- Mars Red

for being different and interesting. The CGI is pretty rough though but it's also based on a Japanese historical period. (Taisho era). And focuses around the corruption of the japanese military, and vampires. lol. It's based on a stage play that's sort of an adaptation on Salom√© by Oscar Wilde."
Crisis Jung,"Plot can be mundane, but realistic world building is top, you know, like Scandi series often do, like ""Akta Manniskor""."
Crisis Jung,Thanks a lot. It's been so long since I asked I thought you forgot. üòÖüíï

- four year gap between season 1 and 2: ok, fine.
- breaking season 3 into 2 parts: I'll bregudgingly accept it

but release something called 'the final season' and it should **be the final season**.

Dividing it into *four* chunks over **three long years**... It feels like an intentional slight. 

I don't know if theres a good reason for the delay, if there is I would be less annoyed. I cant imagine what one would be as covid alone can't be it. But if theres not the fans should each be presented with the person responsible and be allowed to yell at them for a bit."

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
Tempted,It's about as final as Final Fantasy
Tempted,Attack\_on\_Titan\_Final\_(Final\_edit)\_2.avi
Tempted,Haha as a fellow editor this got me good
Tempted,"I don't even use the word anymore. ""Cut 8"" please."
Tempted,It's gonna be like witnessing a kid realizing there's no santa.
Tempted,They changed something from the manga in the episode that aired yesterday.
Tempted,"With how this episode came out, yeah they can take their time till Fall."
Tempted,Pandemic fucked everything up...
Tempted,The Penultimate Season doesn't sound very final
Tempted,"You forgot about Attack on Titan: Oh, wait, just one more delay before the end, see you next year (Final Final Pinky Swear)

I don't even care anymore after what they've pulled already."
Tempted,Attack on Titan: The Final Season: The Final Edition: THE FINAL PAM
Tempted,[from the vault]
Tempted,"I feel most people manga fans will agree with you there. I have a fairly negative opinion on the ending, but improving the dialogue and pacing will definitely make the experience much better. They did an amazing job with the first cour (especially with Hange) and I hope they continue to improve."
Tempted,Pretty good one but the sequels... You cannot watch... You have to wait... And my favorite... You thought this was it.
Tempted,Since 2020.
Tempted,Clearly because it‚Äôs a ridiculous title lol
Tempted,Why are you mad? It's just jokes.
Tempted,Because it's fucking ridiculous that they can't manage to just fucking make the ending and keep making these stupid ass titles because even they don't *know* if they've actually ended it or not *somehow*
Tempted,fr. hahah the final final final final final season part 78 part 5 part 7!
Tempted,"> It's been terribly managed not just with the release schedules but even changing the studio.

Agreed the committee did a pretty bad job with the naming convention of the seasons and the release schedules, but the change in animation studio wasn't really that bad. MAPPA has done a great job for the time they were given & the direction of the previous seasons."
Tempted,"> This is beyond silly. Like what? Just call the first part Season 4 and Part 2 Season 5.


""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"" is just the title now I guess. 

Didn't they change studios for this ""final season"" too? Maybe they can't use the title ""Attack on Titan"" anymore for copyright or whatever reason, so they had to change the title to ""Attack on Titan: The Final Season"", but really, it's 3 separate seasons."
Tempted,"They know the ending is bad so theyre milking the build up for as long as they can. Honestly, Todd Howard should hire them all. Impressive stuff."
Tempted,Yeah the ending is straight ass
Tempted,the show levels up massively with the second half of season 3 onwards. if you were even like 60% interested/invested in the story after finishing season 1 then its worth watching.
Tempted,"Yes. And don't listen to other people's opinions on this there's a lot of bitter manga readers out there who didn't like the ending and have since made it the mission of their pathetic lives to shit talk and hate on the entire franchise whenever possible.

While the very end is controversial, there's been near consensus among fans that the rest of it only gets better and better and is peak fiction. I don't think a bad ending changes that. Why should what would eventually be one bad episode dissuade you from consuming 63 incredible ones?"
Tempted,Season 2 is really good and the second half of season 3 is peak TV.
Tempted,The second half of season 3 and first half of season 4 is seriously 10/10 TV. The other stuff is still a solid 9/10 but those parts are just incredible.
Tempted,"As someone who took a while to get into it and then really fell in love with the series is it worth it?



No.



After a certain point the story becomes incredibly rushed and the ending is honestly dog water I reread the final chapter 3 times thinking this couldn't be it that it was just some joke but nope it's all legit and it ruined a really good series. You're better off watching the goofy spinoff series where there chibi's and in school cause at least that's more satisfying to watch (it's also pretty good)."
Tempted,"the content in the very last parts of the manga are pretty insane. basically the final battle has an absurd amount of shit going on. they probably were planning on releasing it all in march as a 2+ hour movie but it got too much. 

someone somewhere high up decided itd be better to still release something in march to keep discussion goinf"
Tempted,Says Paths.
Tempted,Says there only being 60 to 90 minutes of source material left to adapt.
Tempted,Only Ymir knows..
Tempted,That OST will live in my head rent free for the next decade.
Tempted,im sadly like 90% sure its just not gonna have a 2nd season
Tempted,First half was amazing but I felt like it really lost steam and they didn‚Äôt know where to go with the plot
Tempted,"The studio (MAPPA) already handles big names like Vinland Saga, God Of High-school, Chainsawman etc, and according to reports they picked up One Punch S3 as well, so i would keep my expectations low"
Tempted,"That's where I've been with this one. Too many episodes to make it through if there isn't a finale ready, because I have too much on my list to just re-watch it in years when the finale comes out."
Tempted,"Until the final segment of that trilogy gets split into two parts. 

Imo that is the worst thing that came out of the Harry Potter series. The 2 part finale film."
Tempted,"Yup, another long episode like the one we got today."
Tempted,"No, we haven't. And we've known where it's at in regards to the source material the entire time. This is the end"
Tempted,It is legitimately the end. There is no more material to adapt after this.
Tempted,"Probably would've been more appropriate to title ""the final season"" differently. There's a pretty big time jump between season 3 and ""season 4"". Basically like going from Naruto to Shippuden. Except it's about 1/10 as long"
Tempted,"doubt it's anything copyright specific, the studio wouldn't own the copyright for the show much less the title. They just love using dumb names"
Tempted,"Yes, the new studio is much worse than the old one in quality and animation"
Tempted,It's about as final as Terraria last update.
Tempted,[deleted]
Tempted,What did they change?
Tempted,">Pandemic fucked everything up...

lol what? There was a 4 years gap between Saison 1 and Season 2 with half the episodes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack\_on\_Titan\_(TV\_series)"
Tempted,"Sorry, I don't think that part was supposed to be said out loud.  My bad."
Tempted,"Attack on Titan - The Final Part of the Last Part of the First Part of the Final Arc.

Eh, why not."
Tempted,Disney interactive studios -- in association with square enix proudly present you kingdomhearts.exeXD.333 standard reverbed hd portable remixed ep. Which included one 30 minute movie and a signed picture of donald duck
Tempted,Attack on titan is so damn weird it premiered when I was in highschool and I thought it was cool and even got a movie with very little content out and then it took waaaaaaay too long for a second season and I lost interest even though looking back now there‚Äôs not that much content for it to take like 10+ years to cover in an anime
Tempted,We don't need 80% of the comments saying the exact same thing
Extraordinary You,"Might not really be opposed but

The therapist on Lucifer hated her character development, or lack of development.

Pretty sure she told the writers to stop making her character have sex with lucifer and actually give her something to do other than remove her clothes, they listened at least."
Extraordinary You,Barriston Selmy
Extraordinary You,"Do they need to be adaptations to qualify? Harrison Ford had multiple ICONIC ad libs for Han Solo that were opposed by Lucas at first. John Boyega was pretty critical of his character and the Star Wars trilogy sequels as a whole, even during press tours."
Extraordinary You,"The Breaking Bad writers wanted Skyler to be completely clueless about her husband for the entirety of the show. Anna Gunn pushed them to change it because it was ridiculous.

And for all the hate she got, imagine how much worse the show would be if the writers had gotten their way."
Extraordinary You,Chevy Chase hated how Pierce was portrayed and was apprently extremely difficult to work with.
Extraordinary You,Katherine Heigl basically got fired from Greys over it. Her statements about Knocked Up have aged pretty well too even though it looked bad for her at the time.
Extraordinary You,"A lot of the cast on GoT S8 seemingly disagreed with the way their characters were written. The most famous examples being Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, Conleth Hill, Lena Heady, Nikolaj Coster Waldau."
Extraordinary You,Denise Crosby as Tasha Yar in the first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation
Extraordinary You,Who gets to decide if the actor is in the right or not?
Extraordinary You,Roger Howarth on One Life to Live is a classic example: https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/06/one-life-to-live-todd-manning
Extraordinary You,Mark Hamil in The Last Jedi
Extraordinary You, Shailene Woodley and The Secret Life of the American Teenage.
Extraordinary You,Not in TV but Mark Hamill was really against Luke Skywalker's arc in The Last Jedi.
Extraordinary You,Dragon ball  evolution the main actor knew that goku in the movie was not accurate at all and wanted a change but they didn't listen
Extraordinary You,John Amos in **Good Times**
Extraordinary You,"I‚Äôm not sure who was right in this one but Julianna Marguiles was supposed to a featured guest on Good Fight but wanted the same pay scale as she had in Good Wife for her appearances.

Producers said no, but the end result was she was basically given a new personality in a scene where she just stopped talking to her friends, her best friend was a lead in Good Fight, and then eventually moved to New York.

The funny thing is it almost matches up with the changes she was going through in Good Wife‚Äôs final season. lol l"
Extraordinary You,When Maisie Williams laughed out loud over the Arya sex scene in the final season of GOT.
Extraordinary You,I think Henry's decision to leave The Witcher had much less to with creative differences than the dollar signs he saw from playing Superman again. He likes money more than he likes The Witcher.
Extraordinary You,The Witcher flopped and someone has to take the blame.
Extraordinary You,"but Cavill is a ***dork.*** he could be a purist LOL. fanboy ragequit :P

gives his own performance 2 stars because it's ""not faithful""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Henry Cavill has already shown love for WoW and Warhammer: Here are all his favorite games**  
[https://dotesports.com/general/news/here-are-all-henry-cavills-favorite-games](https://dotesports.com/general/news/here-are-all-henry-cavills-favorite-games)

Of course, the actor playing Geralt of Rivia must play the games. Cavill shared that he played the games and read the books as research for The Witcher series and thoroughly enjoyed them, how could he not?"
Extraordinary You,Linda was horny af earlier in the show.
Extraordinary You,"To be fair, the (d)evil protagonist going to a therapist is a trope from The Sopranos that was ran into the ground by The Sopranos. Having her just be a hook up is a good idea to be a subversion of it if the show isn't running longer than a season."
Extraordinary You,Doran Martell's actor (Alexander Siddig) as well IIRC. I believe he was pitched the book version of the character and was disappointed with what ended on the screen.
Extraordinary You,"If we are going GoT, Varys and Daenarys too"
Extraordinary You,One of the worst decision made by dumb and dumber (not counting the last season)
Extraordinary You,"How?

He was portrayed the same way throughout. 

He was opposed to being killed and who can blame him, but he could just as easily die in the books."
Extraordinary You,My first thought was Mark Hamill with the new trilogy.
Extraordinary You,"Boyega has a legitimate complaint... I've never seen a character start as a primary protagonist, and then slowly get sidelined into irrelevance"
Extraordinary You,"Great example, she became a much more interesting character once she found out and at some point not finding out would have made her really really stupid"
Extraordinary You,"Skyler got a bad hand from the start.

Like we see walter working too jobs
then coming home and getting a disinterested handjob on his birthday.

I am glad they improved as kim was great"
Extraordinary You,"I don‚Äôt know who was right on this one.  

On the one hand, the press making you out to be a racist diva that made the set toxic is pretty fucked up, especially when Harmon was drunk half the time and sexually harassing his writing staff the other half.  

On the other hand, I genuinely think that Pierce was the best written and most developed character on that show.  Which makes his complaints about the writing seem pretty hollow."
Extraordinary You,Yeah because you can tell when Joel McHale talks about it in interviews he‚Äôs very polite. I imagine a good day with Chevy is tolerable.
Extraordinary You,He's always hard to work with.
Extraordinary You,"Even if she was right it was not a smart move, career wise.

She must have known Shonda would get angry when a character from her show was up for an award and she just refused because the writing was bad.

Heigl was right tho, season 4 izzie was never winning an emmy, but she should have just taken the nomination.

Shonda was a spiteful fuck too, suddenly Heigl got ""reputation for being difficult"" afterwards."
Extraordinary You,"To be fair, a lot of other coworkers/crew have confirmed she's horrible on set for multiple projects - and her mother is even worse. But yes, those guys have also been just as toxic, and in other sets."
Extraordinary You,"They did right by her though.

Permission granted."
Extraordinary You,"Maybe not exactly in the right, but just on the same side as most of the show's audience. Seeing what the fans want. Acknowledging that the character isn't written well or needs more development."
Extraordinary You,That's a good one. At one point they were selling Todd Manning merchandise.
Extraordinary You,Yeah I think this is a prime example.
Extraordinary You,"Love Mark but thoroughly disagreed with him on this. But thats fine, I just don't think he is interested in taking his character through any new character development."
Extraordinary You,I think India Eisley as well.
Extraordinary You,"Curious, was it because they turned Amy into the villian and Ricky into the good guy?

Loved Ashley and George. They were hilarious."
Extraordinary You,I think he was specifically against Luke's starting point more than the arc.
Extraordinary You,This. Chow Yun-fat and Randall Duk Kim regret being in the movie when they realize Stephen Chow would be producer in name only.
Extraordinary You,[deleted]
Extraordinary You,"Are you sure? Going off memory, I think I remember reading an article, something like, she wanted a sex scene for Arya?"
Extraordinary You,Didn't she request that the scene be written?
Extraordinary You,Arya wouldn‚Äôt have sex?
Extraordinary You,"God that scene was so god damn unnecessary, It was so awkward. Between Gwen and Arya it felt like Dumb and Dumber realized we haven't had literally every single female character fucking on set and made sure to fix that in fell swoop."
Extraordinary You,Dumb & dumber üò≠üòÖ
Extraordinary You,"There's no character arc, It's a pointless death. It was D&D misunderstanding the ""whole anyone can die at any moment"" thing in GoT.

Robb and Ned Stark was shocking and did seem to come out of nowhere,  but when you look back it did make perfect sense for the characters. They really had nothing left to do other than some sort of revenge fantasy plot, which ASOIAF is better than. It's also why everyone saw the Jon Snow resurrection thing coming a mile away,  the character had too much left to explore to just end.

And it's why Barristen's death is so silly. The whole Barristan reuniting with a Targaryen only to see another one go crazy would've been super interesting to explore. Instead he just dies to a bunch of random goons for no reason"
Extraordinary You,One of the greatest and most skilled fighters to ever live and fight who served in the Kingsguard with numerous battle experience died in an alley to some amateur fighters. I'd be pissed too
Extraordinary You,"He's still alive in the books past where he died in the show and is Hand of the Queen, not Tyrion."
Extraordinary You,"Exactly, the character was written as unlikeable from the get go and the writers, for as much as they were highly skilled, want to push all the Skyler hate off onto their audience when they put that stuff on the page from the get go."
Extraordinary You,he disliked his character become more and more racist.
Extraordinary You,"That's pretty hard to determine.  You'll hear a lot in online gamer echo chambers that Cavill was in the right, but critical reception of season 2 was better than season 1.

Similar things with Wheel of Time and Rings of Power.  They were massive ratings hits despite the diehard fans of the source material having online conniptions."
Extraordinary You,Idk if I would call it character development. It‚Äôs definitely different that‚Äôs for sure.
Extraordinary You,No fans really were. Most were more interested in nostalgia trips like The Force awakens
Extraordinary You,"‚ÄúThere were a lot of things that were written into the scripts that not just me, but a lot of the cast, disagreed with,‚Äù said Woodley of the show‚Äôs anti-sex plotlines. ‚ÄúThere were belief systems that were pushed that were different than my own. Yet legally I was stuck there.‚Äù

https://decider.com/2020/04/22/shailene-woodley-secret-life-american-teenager-stuck/"
Extraordinary You,What what?
Extraordinary You,"Honestly; age issues aside, probably not. She's such a broken singleminded person by then, I don't think she's capable of that kind of intimacy. She's enormously traumatuzed, no one in her life since her mother died has shown her any sort of physical affection, even something as simple as a hug; and her training as a Faceless Assassin is designed to completely dehumanize her."
Extraordinary You,Once Arya returned to Winterfell all her scenes were awkward
Extraordinary You,"There is most certainly a character arc. 

There‚Äôs tons of pointless death in the show and it seems silly to pretend Selmy‚Äôs character held more weight than others.

Quite frankly he was always just a servant for the other main characters. 

There is nothing he provides except context for last actions which is important but never an ongoing necessity.

You can blame the writers all you want but you still haven‚Äôt given any evidence that his character has any chance if surviving much longer in the book narrative."
Extraordinary You,"I don't remember the scene, maybe it was shot in a stupid way. But I can say that the idea of an old, battle scarred knight being outnumbered and killed by some amateur butchers doesn't seem stupid to me. 

>!Wasn't that different with Geralt!<"
Extraordinary You,"He's a man in his 60s who hasn't seen real combat in more than a decade, and he took down 11 men before he was killed. 

People still whining about this are just desperate to find something to complain about in the show."
Extraordinary You,"Tyrion isn‚Äôt at that point in the book.

The storyline is different but the circumstances aren‚Äôt. He is literally heading out of the gate to face a mercenary army of thousands. 

Tyrion is still a slave."
Extraordinary You,"Also he's a straight asshole to everyone. In season 1 he was annoying but he had some good qualities, he was a straight villain in season 2/3 to the point you question why they all tolerate him"
Extraordinary You,Which he expressed by dropping the N word on Donald Glover?
Extraordinary You,"By what metric are we calling them ""ratings hits""?  Obviously the network was happy enough with them to continue but as far as I can tell Amazon, like most streaming networks, just keeps the complete picture to themselves, only cherry picking data to share for marketing purposes.

Like when Netflix will tell you that a show is incredibly successful when it premieres because there were so many streams, then a month later it's cancelled."
Extraordinary You,"Plenty were, and thats why its well reviewed and made a lot of money. But theres definitely fans who didn't want his character or story to progress."
Extraordinary You,"Yeah, broken people never have sex.  This feels like a weird take."
Extraordinary You,That's book Arya. Show Arya is much less psychotic.
Extraordinary You,"Arya is the most level headed Stark.

She hasn‚Äôt had a story that focused on intimacy before and Gendry was a connection strong enough for people discussing them throughout the entire run of the series.

People tend to say the same thing about Sansa and it comes across that people equate trauma with asexuality when plenty of people who have faced trauma also have sexual desire after the trauma."
Extraordinary You,"I don't know what you want from me? I don't have some sort of insight into GRRM's mind to know what he has in mind,  nor have i managed to reduce asoiaf into a formula to predict events happening. 

All i can say is that Barristan almost definitely has an arc. It's tied to dany of course,  but he basically legitimises Dany by comparing her to Rhaegar. If we accept the mad queen theory is canon, the way Barristans arc ends definitely impacts the build up of that narrative.  I'm not saying he'll survive much longer, but his death has to be better than dying to some random goons for no reason"
Extraordinary You,yeah
Extraordinary You,reread the context of that
Extraordinary You,"Enough people watched them to justify their 10-figure costs.

Amazon said that Wheel of Time was top 5 for viewership for Prime Video.  Rings of Power is #1.

Neither of those are really ambiguous statements."
Extraordinary You,"Box office for a franchise like this with a captive audience generally has nothing to do with the content of the movie, people who are invested in the story are going to check it out regardless of what word of mouth says.  I've always said that box office for a franchise like this is more of a reflection on whether people liked the last one.

Like, this happened a couple times in DC, where Batman vs Superman is successful because of the brand, the title, and the trailer, but if people didn't like the movie they're not going to turn up for Justice League.  Same deal with Suicide Squad, if they don't like the Ayer movie, they're less likely to check out the Gunn movie.  And then in Star Wars, surprise surprise, Episode IX's numbers were down 25-30% compared to VIII."
Extraordinary You,It's the desperate need by the GOT haters to oppose everything about the show.
Extraordinary You,It's almost like that was only one of many contributory factors.
Extraordinary You,"I didn‚Äôt want anything from you.

I made a true statement and people are acting like he‚Äôs supposed to be the hero of the show for some reason rather than what he very clearly was throughout- a side character.

Being upset about that is not something I have much control over, so until someone comes up with a storyline that indicates how crucial he continued to be in the story, I‚Äôll just accept the notion that many disagree with my sound assessment and move on."
Extraordinary You,IX had terrible word of mouth and reviews coming out the gate. It absolutely affected it.
Extraordinary You,"Perhaps, but I'd say that it would have only impacted people who were on the fence about seeing the movie.  The bigger problem Lucasfilm had was that so many more people were on the fence this time, because they didn't like the last movie.

Poor word of mouth is never going to talk you out of watching a movie you're genuinely excited for."
Extraordinary You,"Well I can only speak for myself as a huge star wars fan, but when I heard the word of mouth, it sounded like they butchered the story and it made me not see the movie for weeks. 

After the first two movies got in the sequels had great reviews from critics and fans, there seemed to be a consensus already forming before the third even released that they totally flopped on the ending. None of my friends were interested in going."
Extraordinary You,"And what I'm trying to say is that the ""consensus"" that was forming before the third even released was not just a reflection of the content of IX, but of the state of the franchise following the release of VIII.

A year before TFA released, people were excited for the return of the beloved franchise.  A year before TLJ released, people were excited for the story to continue.  A year before RoS released, people had a bad feeling about this.  And when reviews came out that agreed with their bad feeling, it impacts the movie."
Extraordinary You,Fantastic soundtrack.
Extraordinary You,This show is pure fucking gold. The mom‚Äôs power is my absolute favorite.
Extraordinary You,"It's a sign of good writing when a show about people with superpowers is interesting because of the character dynamics/relationships rather than their powers, which play a secondary role to their relationships more than anything else. Whilst the show does involve her searching for her power, it's very much used more as a vehicle for the narrative than the actual plot of the show."
Extraordinary You,"3 episodes in and damn this is really good. It's literally what I wished My hero Academia had more of

Quick binge"
Extraordinary You,"Really fun show. Highly enjoyed it. Just wondering though was I the only one frustrated by the money issues when the girl who could get possessed by ghosts exists? I know they addressed it in one episode but I‚Äôd spend every episode thinking of the dozens and dozens of ways she could use that power to be insanely wealthy.  

Having that power and not being a billionaire felt pretty inexcusable. Even a phone line where people could speak to their dead relatives is easy millions and that‚Äôs one of the least lucrative uses I thought of."
Extraordinary You,I'm loving it! I'm loving the girl playing Jen 's boss. She's doing a great job.
Extraordinary You,"Just binged this. Reminds me of the graphic novel Top Ten where the world is the same - everyone has a superpower.  

Does anyone think Jen's power is >!to nullify other people's power!< ?"
Extraordinary You,Just finished the whole show and i LOVE it! It was quite different than anything i have seen in a long time. Very funny but also very heartwarming. The characters are great!
Extraordinary You,"Really enjoyed the series just binged it. A bit predictable, but not enough to put me off it. One complaint though,  as much as I liked the soundtrack, I felt it was poorly balanced for volume. I'm a bit deaf so I had it turned up for the dialogue, but then the music would blast in. Anyone else feel that?"
Extraordinary You,Oh my god that was one of the best shows I‚Äôve watched in a while. I really hope they release a second season!!
Extraordinary You,"The show was brilliant. Quirky, different yet relatable. I think Jen's power is to influence other people's powers. That's my theory. Maybe Jizzlord's power acted up because of her, same with the girl who teleports and Lucas the flying guy?"
Extraordinary You,"Just watched the first episode and it's really promising so far, fun light hearted, without being for kids. They do some good jokes with extras and their powers"
Extraordinary You,I‚Äôm loving sister Michael as the mom. Glad to have her back after Derry Girls ended.
Extraordinary You,"As a newer parent, I won't be able to watch Encanto now that I've seen the adult version and it rules! Literally she doesn't have a power and her sister is super strong. I also took edibles before watching but I swear there were other similarities to Encanto."
Extraordinary You,I need season two IMMEDIATELY.
Itaewon Class,"We've gone mainstream, initiate protocol omega"
Itaewon Class,"Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
Itaewon Class,Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
Itaewon Class,Good for Community.
Itaewon Class,"""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
Itaewon Class,/u/wikirank please do this every month
Itaewon Class,Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
Itaewon Class,"Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens ‚Äî> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks ‚Äî> Professor says something ‚Äî> More talks about feelings ‚Äî> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are ‚Äî> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second ‚Äî> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show‚Äôs success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
Itaewon Class,"With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
Itaewon Class,Ozark is so damn good!
Itaewon Class,Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
Itaewon Class,You‚Äôd definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I‚Äôm surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
Itaewon Class,"Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
Itaewon Class,The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC‚Äôs Dr Foster
Itaewon Class,I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
Itaewon Class,So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
Itaewon Class,"The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
Itaewon Class,TIL there‚Äôs a Japanese version of *Suits*.
Itaewon Class,"Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
Itaewon Class,*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
Itaewon Class,Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
Itaewon Class,Damn
Itaewon Class,"i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
Itaewon Class,Prior?
Itaewon Class,First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
Itaewon Class,Good news for a potential movie too.
Itaewon Class,Is the show any good after S3?
Itaewon Class,[deleted]
Itaewon Class,I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
Itaewon Class,Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn‚Äôt realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
Itaewon Class,"It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Qu√©bec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
Itaewon Class,"I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
Itaewon Class,"in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
Itaewon Class,Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
Itaewon Class,It‚Äôs a dumb translation but doesn‚Äôt take anything away from the show itself
Itaewon Class,Maybe English copyright issues.
Itaewon Class,"""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
Itaewon Class,"If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
Itaewon Class,Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
Itaewon Class,they're in their own world over there
Itaewon Class,"I absolutely agree with you but it's interesting to see that it somehow has a very international appeal. I find their formula boring too, but I wonder if it's something else that is making it universally appealing."
Itaewon Class,I think it's just another case of reddit living in it's own reality
Itaewon Class,Sunk cost fallacy
Itaewon Class,The last season of prison break takes place in the middle east...I wonder if thats why?
Itaewon Class,"Prison Break just came onto Australian Netflix, was number 7 in Australia all last week. I imagine it's the same for a few other countries."
Itaewon Class,And it's a year old now!
Itaewon Class,Survivor is a TV series though
Itaewon Class,The first two seasons are good imo. Entertaining even if a lot of things don't make any sense at all. But I think is never boring.
Itaewon Class,"No, it's legit pretty good, not gonna win emmys, but its not trash"
Itaewon Class,Shit yourself.
Itaewon Class,Sim
Itaewon Class,Depends on what you know you're getting into. I found it slow but not glacial. It's one of the few shows where I just love people talking.
Itaewon Class,#sixseasonsandamovie
Itaewon Class,S4 is rough but I enjoy S5 and 6 quite a bit. And the finale is really great.
Itaewon Class,"Mindlessly browsing Netflix is a whole lot easier than Pirating. No ads, no risk of virus, just one click and you‚Äôre watching the show."
Itaewon Class,Forget pirating..it has been on Hulu for years!
Itaewon Class,"Pirating is when you have no money and a lot of time. When you have enough money and not enough time, you just subscribe to Netflix."
Itaewon Class,"I would think it's a rip-off probably, if I was just scrolling through"
Itaewon Class,"How about ""The Paper House""?

Or maybe even ""La Casa de Papel"", which I believe was actually its Netflix title for like the first week it was available."
Itaewon Class,"I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs not bad, it‚Äôs alright. But this is just measuring popularity, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs *uhmayzing*."
Itaewon Class,"First 2 seasons were good.3rd was average and the 4th was a dissaster.

You can watch the first 2 seasons and stop there since  the series was supposed to be only 2 seasons.Maybe thats the reason why the writing started to get bad."
Itaewon Class,"You won't get a good answer in /r/television

It is good/great TV, there's a reason its so popular. Its engaging and doesn't require much thinking on your part. Not every show needs to be a Westworld/Better Call Saul."
Itaewon Class,"Going against almost every comment here and say that I like this show a lot more than Reddit‚Äôs favorites such as Better Call Saul. Besides What We Do In The Shadows it‚Äôs probably the only thing I have genuinely enjoyed watching while in quarantine. Last season of West World was fairly disappointing. Granted I am biased, I have been to Spain a lot and am myself Spanish. Yeah it‚Äôs not The Wire (and neither is Better Call Saul/Breaking Bad) but it is very good."
Itaewon Class,"Season 4 was straight trash.Writing,acting,music everything.They should have stopped at 2 seasons."
Itaewon Class,Rude
Itaewon Class,Kkkkkkkkk percebi que ela ficou muito popular do nada aqui mas n√£o sabia que era por isso
Itaewon Class,"Fun fact: he said this in reference to the one-season The Cape.  I liked that show, but perhaps maybe not as much."
Itaewon Class,If you know what youre doing there are no ads and no risk of virus also but that said I still enjoy having netflix to find new stuff I wouldnt have sought out.
Itaewon Class,[deleted]
Itaewon Class,"I have a private site with none of those features and everything comes on there about half an hour after it airs.

I still barely pirate stuff.

Cable costs me a dollar, Netflix and Disney plus aren‚Äôt expensive."
Itaewon Class,In the US. Netflix added Community globally.
Itaewon Class,[deleted]
Itaewon Class,"I feel the same. Saw first season, and it was quite predictable. Didn't get why it was so overhyped."
Itaewon Class,[deleted]
Itaewon Class,Already the 2nd one was already disappointing
Itaewon Class,">You won't get a good answer in /r/television

Proceeds to give good enough answer"
Itaewon Class,But Westworld is garbage.
Itaewon Class,Apparently I'm the only one that liked season 4 of Money Heist.  AMA
Itaewon Class,#NeckbeardRage
Itaewon Class,"I think it's moreso that it would be easier for me to obtain the actual legal rights to something I want to watch, than it would be to teach somebody like my mother how to pirate a movie."
Itaewon Class,"Its not about being lazy, a lot of people  maybe have an interest in watching something but dont care enough to seek it out and are happy to just wait for it to come to a streaming service and just have a look at whats available at the present."
Itaewon Class,"Almost everything is easily available though (generally speaking, I don't know about your specific country). Anything not on Netflix will be on Prime Video, HBO or on any other streaming platforms, or on iTunes, Google Play, Amazon Prime Store, Youtube movies, you name it.  So we're back to the money question.

Except in rare cases, it's not about availability, not anymore. That was true 10 years ago."
Itaewon Class,Being predictable isn't a bad thing
Itaewon Class,I could go into specifics but i dont wanna give spoilers.
Itaewon Class,"To each his own,but if you already dislike 2nd season you should definitely not waste your time on the 3rd and 4th."
Itaewon Class,Why is it garbage? I completely disagree
Itaewon Class,"SPOILERS! DONT GO AHEAD IF YOU DIDNT WATCH SEASON 4.



1.How could Tokyo(not a surgeon) save Nairobi from a sniper shot even with an surgeon guiding her? beside the fact that the they lost the connection with the surgeon and Tokyo had to do it alone.No matter how much the proffesor trained her 6ou do not go from a normal person to a surgeon that does high risk surgeries.

2.Why go thru all this fuss to save Nairobi for in the end to kill her? If you let her die when she was shot the first time,she died with a purpose,Nairobi wanting to see how her child looks but instead she died cowardly getting shot by that special agent.

3.All those scenes with the special agents were like an action movie in which the main character will not die no matter what.And yeah i understand that he was a renown agent but if they wanted to make him powerful they could have done it by making him take smart decisions(tactics)instead of him surving 500 shots.How did that dude not get shot in that scene when he was in the middle and was shot at by both sides,one from the elevator one from the other side? and it wasnt just 3 bullets or 10,it was like 300.Yeah he had a bulletprof vest and helmet but still.

Another Rambo scene is with Nairobi when she died.The special agent tells her that she gonna get shot and the crew just stand by and watches him shot here.After that the crew shot at him but it appears out of 7 people with assault rifles nobody could shot him.

4.Music and sound effects were trash.

5.They could have ended the show in this season but they decided to do another for $$$ and because of this the season felt so slow that i was doing something else while watching it.

6.The development in relationships sucked too.

7.I get it that Berlin was one of the best character in the first 2 seasons,but they have to let him go.Its cool to get 1 or 2 scenes with him after he died but having 35% flashes of the past just straight sucks.

8.There was so more things to talk about but i forget about them since i watched the season a month and a half ago.This season felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie.The only ones who will like this type of season are the ones who are under 15 and like watching series like Riverdale,Arrow, etc.If you are 18+ and watched lots of series like The wire,The Sopranos,Dark,Mr.Robot etc that actually has good writing you will find this series garbage."
Itaewon Class,What you described is a lazy attitude.
Itaewon Class,It kills suspense and feels pointless to watch if it's not done right imo
Itaewon Class,Completely agree. S2 was so bad that I didn't keep watching and wish I hadn't even begun watching
Itaewon Class,"> felt like a combination of soap opera and a blockbuster action movie

I think you've figured out why Money Heist is so popular"
Itaewon Class,"No its not. Not everyone cares about tv shows that much. Saying ""I'm interested in watching community so I'll wait for it to come to netflix"" doesnt mean someone is lazy, it means they're not desperate to watch it right now. Believe it or not, people can enjoy tv shows but also its not something they spend a ton of their time doing, so watching if its there vs actively spending time seeking it out on a feasible viewing platform is a decisions based on interests and not laziness. Im an example of that, I love iasip but I spend my time doing other things generally and watch tv shows during dinner etc... so it works better for me to wait for it because I'm not in any rush to see new episodes when they're released."
Itaewon Class,"That is *so* fucking weird man. You can download new episodes an hour after they air in like 5m max depending on internet speed, then stream them to your smart TV and watch them. It's the definition of lazy, especially on good shows like IASIP."
Itaewon Class,How is it hard to understand that tv shows aren't a priority to everyone? Like how is it not clear that I don't care about watching new episodes of a tv show an hour after they air? I enjoy tv shows but they're not at the top of my list of activities. The definition of lazy would be if I was absolutely desperate watch new episodes but couldn't be bothered to look for them. Thats completely different to where tv fits into my life.
Itaewon Class,"Agree to disagree. I only want to watch (what I consider) the best of the best. And I do that searching online, reading certain critics lists, etc. Then I actively seek it out. If I'm just browsing Netflix I would settle for mediocrity most of the time. Which doesn't seem to be a problem for many people, but it is to me. Like Tiger King, basically a documentary, but lots of people gushing about this great new show that was out on Netflix. It's not. It's a mediocre documentary from mediocre filmmakers that, while probably slightly entertaining, is not worth 8 hours of my life. But hey, it's convenient, and it's on Netflix! So that's an easy watch for all the sheep."
Itaewon Class,"We're not agreeing to disagree here though, you're literally not understanding that 1) not everyone cares about tv shows as much as you and 2) ""the best of the best"" is entirely subjective. I love iasip but if someone else thinks its trash then they're entitled to their opinion. They might love tiger king and not iasip but it doesn't mean they've ""settled for mediocrity"" it just means they have different tastes.

Im normally all for agreeing to disagree but you're trying to call people lazy and your definition of lazy is wrong."
Itaewon Class,"A lot of people also think 5G causes coronavirus or Trump is a good president. They're also wrong. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that doesn't make them less wrong in certain cases. There are shows just objectively better than others. If someone tells me they like Friends better than The Leftovers, or The Vampire Diaries over Better Call Saul, they invalidate their entire vision on the medium."
Itaewon Class,"What a ridiculous comment mate. There's objective facts to discredit the first two ""opinions"". What someone enjoys watching on tv is completely subjective. You could write a thesis on why one show is objectively ""better"" than another. But it makes zero difference if someone simply doesn't enjoy watching it. It doesn't make them lazy. 

Again, its all down to why you watch tv, different tv shows exist for different reasons and to be watched in different ways. Your view is just so elitist. Your opinion is worth as much or as little as anyone else's."
Itaewon Class,"Sure, man. A guitar player that has experience playing for 10 years knows way more about the instrument than a beginner that played a week. Just like someone that has watched way more TV and seeks out the best knows way more about TV than a casual ""I'll watch whatever's on"" type character. Characters and their development, cinematography, acting, dialogue, pacing, symbolism; all kinds of objective standards you can measure. Most casual watchers don't even think about dialogue and character development, they just take it at face value. Which is fine, some people want to just be entertained. But it is an actual art form, and people with background in film that have more of a grasp on how to grade TV shows definitely know more than casual watchers. Why do you think the job of TV critic exists? Stop blurting nonsense and accept that how good a show is is not the same as people's enjoyment of it. Lots of people enjoy watching Friends, but is it a great show? Definitely not."
Itaewon Class,"Stop blurting out completely unrelated and nonsensical comparisons that don't work. The point is on taste, it doesn't matter how much tv you've watched, or how ""educated"" you think your taste is, your initial point was that people settle for mediocrity and are lazy because they don't seek out ""better"" shows. In entertainment, it doesn't matter how much ""better"" a tv show is, if someone simply doesn't enjoy it then they're not ""settling for mediocrity"" or ""lazy"" by watching something that you wouldn't perceive as being on the same level. 

An example for me would be Hannibal, I can tell its an amazingly well written, acted, shot show. Everything about it is fantastic, but it was only okay in my personal viewing experience. I enjoyed it but despite how technically impressive it is, I only enjoyed it and that's it. I'm probably more likely to watch friends over Hannibal. That doesn't invalidate my opinion and it lends credence to the fact that shows serve different purposes.

To your pointless guitar playing point, I've played guitar for over 10 years and I'm objectively better techincally than someone thats played for 6 months. But if someone enjoys listening to the other person play more than me then it's nothing to do with them being lazy or whatever, its just naturally what they enjoy hearing."
Luna Nera,"Just finished binging it, wow I loved this series. The acting was superb, the making of mini-doc revealed how carefully they constructed the details and considered the themes, and I am always excited about seeing women centered media (director, writer, costuming, story, actor, etc).

I disagree about the flashbacks being distracting. Often they connected to memories that Esty experienced while navigating new directions in her life. As the film approaches a climax (what will happen with her life) more is revealed about exactly how her past was so traumatic. It shows us what is at stake, why she is fighting for a future.

For the criticism from Orthodox community and reported inconsistencies, remember this is the story of just one specific community/sect of Orthodox Jews, and this can be used as an allegory for many different people's struggles."
Luna Nera,"This story of a young Hasidic woman who wants to leave her cloistered way of life is both heartbreaking and uplifting as it pits her courage and determination against the cruelty and arrogance of the insular and ignorant Hasidic community. If you thought the Hasidim were repugnant and obnoxious after watching the Netflix documentary ""One of Us,"" the dramatization of the true story in ""Unorthodox"" will not change your mind.  


One important correction: The subtitles repeatedly read that the Hasidim are praying in Yiddish. They do converse in Yiddish, but for Jews, including most definitely the ultra-orthodox Hasidim, the language of prayer is Hebrew. For those of us who know the difference, in ""Unorthodox"" the Hasidim are indeed praying in Hebrew. The film is correct but the subtitles are wrong."
Luna Nera,Just finished. This blew my mind. Sooo moving.
Luna Nera,does anyone know the name of the DJ group in episode 3?
Luna Nera,"Just a heads up. A lot of Orthodox Jews are a little annoyed at the series for exaggerating Orthodox, and specifically Hassidic, life. The allegedly non-fiction book that the series is based on was also found to have some problematic inconsistencies.

On an unrelated note, Shira Haas's Ruchama was my favorite character in ~~*Schlissel*~~*Shtisel* (up until her weird boyfriend storyline)."
Luna Nera,Can anyone tell me about what was happening in the kitchen in the scene where she suspects she is pregnant? It looks like lots of surfaces are covered in aluminium foil.
Luna Nera,"Last write-up in this series for a while. Will probably still be posting random stuff on here just won't be watching any new shows for the next 3-4 weeks. Hopefully within a month I'll still have my life and health to continue doing these. 

Next shows I'll be doing when I'm back at this should be Little Fries Everywhere. Also I'm making a 'Top Teen-Dramas of All Time' listicle for some reason idk. üò™

Anyways, stay safe guys!"
Luna Nera,Thanks for the list and the review of this series.  Now I have something to watch since I finished Tiger King.  BTW is that one not in the list because it is to new?
Luna Nera,Catnapp. The soundtrack for the show is on Spotify
Luna Nera,"I haven‚Äôt seen the show (only the trailer) but OF COURSE Orthodox Jews don‚Äôt like it. The Hasidic community is extraordinarily inclusive and they don‚Äôt want people knowing how dated their beliefs are, especially when it comes to women."
Luna Nera,"I tried to watch this show, and I'm not even up to anything controversial and can still see why. There's just an underlying disdain for them that makes the show really hard to watch."
Luna Nera,"Wow, I went down a rabbit hole of the debunking articles....

Reading that she wasn't really educated in that community, her family apparently supported her going to Sarah Lawrence, and she lived a more liberal Orthodox lifestyle than she claims, changes things. She actually had the kid while she was still married, and didn't leave until he was 7.   The real story sounds far more interesting!!

Shame she felt she had to craft a cookie cutter story to make her story more compelling to outsiders."
Luna Nera,"The show is called Shtisel, btw"
Luna Nera,I mean...they would say that...the point wasn‚Äôt to portray them in a good light...
Luna Nera,"Ruchami‚Äôs boyfriend was everything her father wasn‚Äôt, and she craved the sense of domestic normalcy missing from her home life."
Luna Nera,"That scene takes place during the holiday Passover (which lasts for eight days). Part of Jewish practice in general is maintaining a kosher (""clean"") kitchen. During most of the year this includes separating the meat and dairy etc. During Passover, however, this includes getting rid of all of the chametz (leavened bread). The aluminum foil is to ensure that no chametz from the rest of the year gets on their food/their food during Passover is clean. Some people will do a full spring cleaning for Passover but foil works too."
Luna Nera,"I believe they were fasting and she was feeling extra hungry because she was pregnant and the food was tempting her,  but she had to wait until the grandfather finished praying to eat."
Luna Nera,Have you seen Skam because if not your list won't be accurate.
Luna Nera,"I know I'm responding 3 months later but if you want something even more crazy than Tiger King, try Wild Wild Country."
Luna Nera,Insular*
Luna Nera,"Well sure, there's no shortage of scandals involving that community....but apparently the book is fiction. 

I think she feeds off really dated and unexposed beliefs about Hasidim too, and they're rightfully sensitive to that."
Luna Nera,"I mean, there‚Äôs that in Christian fundamentalist (big love) shows as well. Fundamental religious communities do not treat women well, and the protagonist in the show is a young woman. If the main character was an elderly patriarch in the society the tone likely would read different."
Luna Nera,"They talked a little about this in the ""how it's made"" portion after. They said that since the author was so well-known in communities surrounding this subject, she wanted to give Etsy a different life than her own. They wanted the discussion to be about the character, her story, and the Satmar community, not about the author. 

Because of this I get the sense that she weaved together a narrative from a lot of different experiences of people who left."
Luna Nera,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I was actually wondering about the aluminium foil. I read somewhere else that is to do with keeping the kitchen kosher."
Luna Nera,Of course I have lol. Top 3 teen drama!
Luna Nera,"Yeah, inclusive is literally the opposite haha"
Luna Nera,"Big Love went out of it's way to show them as real people, not caricatures to scorn. That's a great example of a show giving humanity to it's characters. You could argue too much.

I mean, if it's from the perspective of someone who is young and doesn't offer that, and the writers wanted to stay true to that, then it's not great source material."
Luna Nera,Would like to point out that Big Love was not based on Christian fundamentalists... it was based on Mormon fundamentalism.
Luna Nera,"I think it's also because the real person is problematic, and her stories didn't check out. Why else would they downplay the unique parts of her story and go with some generic cardboard cut out version of a person leaving a traditional community? 

I mean, what really happens here? She isn't happy, she has a mother that's left, she goes to find her, she makes some friends and finds herself drawn to an artistic outlet and gets an opportunity most do not, and during it all, her naive possibly autistic husband chases after her, finds her and gets rejected. In the big scheme of diabolical ""leaving the religion"" stories, nothing happens. The bit with the brother abducting her and the gun, is insane, and if it happened no doubt that was scarring, but then he ultimately walks away, he doesn't actually try to bring her back to NY."
Luna Nera,"I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äúfundamentalist community‚Äù in Big Love which is out in the desert, which were basically the villains of the show, that the main characters escaped from. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community depicted in this show is an insular fundamentalist community the main character escape from."
Luna Nera,"No kidding, but aside from generically assuming all fundamentalists are the same, your comment has little value. Even among Hasidim there are different sects and traditions, and they feud. Some are more liberal while some oppose rock n' roll.  If there's no awareness or depth, then it's just saying ""boo religion"" or ""boo ultra orthodox Jews"", and that's boring unless you're predisposed to hating entire communities and want to feel validated in your hate."
Luna Nera,"Okay lol but the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal, they‚Äôre depicting a young girl being forced into marriage and forced into sex. 

So what are you trying to say in context of this argument. I‚Äôm not saying all religious communities are like this, but the specific story being told is of a community that is. So why should they treat that community with any reverence? If the acts they‚Äôre depicting in the show are brutal

And it‚Äôs not Jewish specific. A lot of fundamental communities of every religion, even the Amish, have groups that mistreat women and chalk it up to ‚Äúreligion‚Äù and it‚Äôs no excuse

I would harken back to ‚Äúbig love‚Äù - the community out in the desert in big love is not progressive, they force teen girls to marry the prophet, and are not treated kindly by the show at all. At the same time the main family in Big Love is shown empathy, even though they‚Äôre still a fundamentalist bigamist family, because they‚Äôre not doing inhumane things like the community out in the desert is. 

If this show was about a progressive Hasidic community that was treating young women kindly, why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

Should we just not tell the stories of women mistreated in fundamentalist communities for fear of sounding ‚Äúboo religion‚Äù? This goes for Amish, catholic, Mormon, Scientologist, Islam, Jewish, whatever."
Luna Nera,">the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,

Right, does the show bother to explain that?

Also, I'm not claiming to be familiar with her story, I'm reacting to just attempting to watch the show.. but she apparently really went to liberal Orthodox schools earlier in her life, so the depiction of the family isn't entirely accurate.

I see dramas about terrorists that deal with Islamic fundamentalism with more respect and depth.  I see more care with depictions of the Amish community (though improvements could be made for sure). The idea isn't to give reverence but to give characters depth, and that's what makes people interesting, and can influence societal change when it's eye opening.

As opposed to just gawking and demonizing. The fact that you're comparing this story to ""marrying the prophet"" cult like behavior from a group that splintered from the mainstream, is a problem. Big Love carefully explains who the group are and their stature with the more mainstream LDS church. It's a major plotline. 

\>why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

That's ridiculous. People leave religious families they're born into all the time.  I'm on her side with that (unless it's fiction, and a couple seconds on google suggests some of it was). And it's a common narrative in tv and film and theater. It's told all the time. But if you just have one dimensional stereotypical characters, you're not learning anything from that, it's not really exploring the predicament, it's just trying to expose bad people with an agenda against devout religiousness. In this case people think because they got a glimpse into homes they've never seen before, that's sufficient to make up for the lack of depth and humanity in the community it portrays. You can do that and still ultimately show people are wrong."
Luna Nera,"**People leave religious families all the time but they don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúescape‚Äù them as is shown in the show. Notice I said ‚Äúflee‚Äù not ‚Äúleave‚Äù. The story depicts an ‚Äúescape‚Äù not just someone turning their back on religion** 

And in regards to the memoir the show was based off of, if you asked me and my mom to recount an argument we had when I was a teen we would both give wildly conflicting stories. That doesn‚Äôt mean either of them are ‚Äúfiction‚Äù, it just means the people involved had different justifications and motivations to act the way they did. 

I believe the author that this is her side of the story, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs portrayed in the show. Her side, her perspective, her interpretation of how she felt. No one can spin that and say it‚Äôs ‚Äúfiction‚Äù unless you‚Äôre her.

It sounds like you just can‚Äôt handle any attack on a segment of Judaism, because my interpretation of it is that this community depicted in the show is very much a fragment of the larger Jewish community in Brooklyn, and they do not all engage in abhorrent behavior like forcing a young girl into sex slavery (aka, ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù), but for the people who are, their story is worthy of being told. 

It might not be ‚Äúmarrying the prophet‚Äù but it‚Äôs forcing young girls into reproductive slavery all the same through societal and financial pressure. These things are happening, in our country, and we have no obligation to give the people perpetrating them ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of character. 

**People using religion to keep women (and LGBT) down are the villains in today‚Äôs stories. So, it‚Äôs not an attack on religion, it‚Äôs an attack on the excuse and bastardization of religion.** 

In our post-post modern society religion has been torn down and disproven as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Catholic priests molest children. Female genital mutilation. Honor killings. Etc etc etc etc. But we‚Äôre still holding reverence for ‚Äúculture‚Äù. 

‚ÄúWomen in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for having pre-marital sex‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs their culture‚Äù

Or 

‚ÄúI had to have sex with the producer for this role‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just how Hollywood is‚Äù 

**is no longer an excuse the public will permit**

Now, we‚Äôre dismantling tradition as a source of absolute ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. Just because your religion/community/ has customs and traditions to uphold, does not mean they will be permitted in the modern world. **Shame, and telling the story in a negative light, is one way of expressing the contempt for ‚Äútraditions‚Äù that do not fit into contemporary human rights and ethics, rather than glossing over violations because we feel it‚Äôs not our place to critique**

Side note: the show does not hold the orthodox community in distain for their differences; the way they dress, language spoken, or traditions. The elements of the show that put a negative light on the community are strictly the scenes that portray human rights violations."
Luna Nera,">>the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,
>
>Right, does the show bother to explain that?

You're right, the way they wrote the show I totally thought Esty was fleeing a liberal Hasidic sect üôÑ"
Luna Nera,"The movie literally has Yael explain the unique nature of the community. I know this was 12 days ago, but coming into this discussion from the outside, it seems like you are gathering evidence to support your conclusions."
Luna Nera,One of the most beautiful posts I've read in a long time. Spot on.
Luna Nera,Well said!!
Luna Nera,"You don't have to flee an orthodox Jewish family. 

Leaving any family, for any reason involving lack of acceptance, is difficult.  It's a story. If you can't handle a real life complicated depiction of these communities because you just want to bash people, then that's boring.

There is no perspective that can account for a fictional story. 

Her mom was easy to locate and didn't leave when she was a toddler, for example. 

Calling aranged marriage ""sex slavery"" is an extremist viewpoint, in my opinion. Totally dogmatic. Arranged marriages are still fairly accepted in some communities. I've known Indians, and Arabs who accepted their parents arrangements and as horrifying as it sounds at face value, they're happy. Sex slavery is a real thing, please dont' make light of it to feel better about the Netflix show you liked.

Look, some Satmars are nuts, but this isn't a story about one of those victims of nuttery. It's not sexual reproductive slavery or whatever dogmatic bullshit opinion you came to the show pre-formed. And cut the crap, you do care about their traditions which you just called human rights violations. You are Othering these people. It's a step away from claiming they fuck through a hole in a sheet. There are plenty of bad things you can say about Satmars, or any fundamental religious folks of any stripe, but again, in 2020, show they're humanity and stop the caricatures that re-affirm horrible stereotypes, and stop pretending you just watched a show that justified your jackassery biases."
Luna Nera,"She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood, went to Sarah Lawrence, and stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show."
Luna Nera,My conclusion is the show had an underlying disdain for the community that was hard to watch.... to which people defended it by expressing their disdain for the community. Just stop.
Luna Nera,"**It becomes sex slavery, and a human rights violation, when you do not give a woman the means to support herself outside of her reproductive capabilities, and only give the path of being a wife. Which is what is depicted. Raising a child from birth for the sole purpose of them becoming a wife and mother. The women are not even allowed to play musical instruments for fun in the strict rules of the community.**

The avenues allowed to them are to be a wife, or as in the show, run away and be ostracized from their community. Which leads to the ‚Äúleaving/fleeing/whatever‚Äù people being homeless, since they have no real world skills or means outside of their insular community, also depicted in the show. 

**That‚Äôs different than an arranged marriage, which i never said was a bad thing or a human rights violation**

Not giving women the option to choose their path in life, and raising them from birth with one end-goal (wife/mother) is a human rights violation, and raising them with the purpose of them being a reproductive servant. I.e. sex slave. So no, it‚Äôs not a reach.

**And it‚Äôs not ‚Äújackassery bias‚Äù. If a new cult was raising girls for the sole purpose of becoming a bride, raising them from birth, and forbidding them to learn skill or a trade that would be bona fide sex slavery. Just because this is a sect of Orthodox Judaism doesn‚Äôt change that. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying contemporary society will not tolerate ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs our tradition‚Äù, if it‚Äôs not ethical in the modern world it is not ethical in your old-fashioned society.**"
Luna Nera,An arranged marriage can be a form of sex slavery for someone who is pressured into it and someone who doesn't want it. I'm not saying that all arranged marriages are like that.
Luna Nera,">She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood... stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

This is something you used as an example of liberalism üò¨

>The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show.

I think Hasidic Judaism is a fairly problematic worldview, yes. I am aware some sects are more or less problematic than others, but they're all problematic to some degree. Note I didn't say all Judaism is problematic, I said **Hasidic** Judaism is problematic, in the way I believe all fundamentalist religion (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) is problematic. 

Are you saying no Hasidic Jewish sects whatsoever reflect the depiction? None at all? Because that's really the only way your argument has validity. Otherwise, it's actually showing what some Hasidic women live through, and that's a story worth telling even if it isn't Deborah Feldman specific story."
Luna Nera,"Criticism isn't disdain and you've clearly got some personal issues regarding the ability to rationalize differing opinions. I know exactly what happened, I just read through it all. You're wrong."
Luna Nera,"You told me you think I didn't respond well to the show because it involved Jews.... which is unintentionally your admission you liked it because it's critical of devout Jews. Too late.

You're not describing ""slavery"" or describing what goes on in Orthodox communities in New York.

It's fine that some of you liked this show, but not fine that in defending it,  you reveal really bigoted presumptions that this show just validated for you."
Luna Nera,"She agrees to the marriage and thinks it's what she wants.  Sure arranged marriage can be forced, but that's not what is depicted. She lived in New York, she always had the choice to lead her own life, which is what she did."
Luna Nera,"No, it's something this dumb ass series used as an example of her shedding her traditions for a liberal secular life. 

I doubt you know much about Hasidim and that's the problem here. What's really being depicted there that's so outrageous or unique to any Hasidic sect?  I hate all the Jewish characters in the show, including her. You don't have the first clue what they live through, because you projected it, nothing horrible happens in that film that's real or is commonplace. You can't possible think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction or have a brother in law pull out a gun. 

You can't defend this show by saying there are Hasidic stories worth telling...sure, but I'm criticizing this one."
Luna Nera,"Disdain is disdain. The series is presenting harmless everyday observances as if they're oppression. The Redditor I was conversing with took it farther. There's a point where criticism isn't an opinion and treads into bigotry.
You jumped into this because you sympathize with hating Hasidim apparently, and that's wrong. You're a clown."
Luna Nera,"Lol... I said that because when i compared it to other fundamentalist religious representations (big love) you acted like Orthodox Jews were supposed to be exempt. 

So girls in orthodox communities aren‚Äôt raised to be brides and mothers? Oh my mistake then. I live in Brooklyn, i don‚Äôt see any orthodox women having a job or running a trade. 

But I guess that‚Äôs just not ‚Äúbased in reality‚Äù and it‚Äôs all ‚Äúmy bias‚Äù 

**i‚Äôm against any fundamentalist community; Amish, Mormon, Jewish, that raises girls to be mothers with no other avenues. Or raises men to be fathers and tells them being gay is god‚Äôs mistake**

This is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about, you cannot claim people are being ‚Äúbiased against a culture‚Äù when they point out human rights violations within that culture. Something which is unethical is unethical even when cloaked in religion. 

Maybe the VAST majority of orthodox communities empower their young women, but you cannot negate the small percentage of those who are suffering.

And just to say it louder 

In case you didn‚Äôt hear 

**raising girls explicitly to be wives and mothers is a form of sex and reproductive slavery. If a community is guilty of that, i don‚Äôt give a fuck what religion they practice.**"
Luna Nera,"Just flipped through your recent comments, all you‚Äôre doing is calling people biased against Jews for watching this show on a bunch of different threads, weirdo - when you didn‚Äôt even watch it yourself ? Wtf is your problem the character are less ‚Äúone dimensional‚Äù if you watch more than 10 minutes"
Luna Nera,"I don't think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction, neither do I think many of them pull out guns. I never thought this and no one here believe the show is making these insane blanket statements except you.

It's clear you are projecting because you are making blanket statements about all viewers based on what you're worried they think.

You like blanket statements so you think everyone else does as well.

Projection."
Luna Nera,I'm jumped in because you're psycho
Luna Nera,"None of your rant is in the show. None of it.

No small portion of the show featured the Hasidic sects rituals...criticism of their beliefs to the point of ridicule beyond what the show is depicting is pretty blatant of you. 

Who the hell thinks Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust? Piss off."
Luna Nera,"I've since watched the series. The fact that it set people full of vitriol like yourself off on hate rants speaks volumes. 

The Jewish characters are all unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated.....and it's supposed to be representative of a Jewish community? If that's normal to you its because ...well, you already went on a bigoted rant."
Luna Nera,"Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

You forget what you already admitted earlier in this thread."
Luna Nera,"What's psycho is getting upset that some Jews grow their sideburns out. Which is really what that person used as an example of xenophobia.

You jumped in because you dislike some Jews."
Luna Nera,"**how can you say that none of my rant is in the show when the central problem in the show is hte main character was raised to be a wife and mother, and doesn‚Äôt know how to support herself outside of her community? That‚Äôs the whole show. Her trying to get a scholarship because she has no real-world skills and no money. That‚Äôs the WHOLE plot**

No one said ‚Äúall‚Äù ultra-orthodox have this experience, but if this is this person‚Äôs story who are you to tell them it‚Äôs problematic/false? 

Many fundy communities fall into the same trap of womb worship. If that‚Äôs not YOUR experience in them, then good for you, but you cannot say others share your experience.  

And i think it‚Äôs you who can ‚Äúpiss off‚Äù. Have fun setting women back 200 years with your pathetic blindness

If you‚Äôre fundy and you like it then good for fucking you, but maybe it hasn‚Äôt been so kind to others."
Luna Nera,"The main character is jewish and she doesn‚Äôt seem unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated."
Luna Nera,People disagreeing with your faulty assessment isn't a hate rant. Stop.
Luna Nera,">Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

I never said any of this. You must have me confused with someone else."
Luna Nera,"That doesn't equate ""reproductive slavery"". 

They're a strict religious community so there's lots to be critical of, especially if you dislike religious practices, but the darker more horrific story you describe isn't in the show. You projected your hate on to this community.

Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

Putting pressure on someone to consummate a marriage after a year, or to have a family with kids?.....It's obnoxious but it's not slavery. 

It's also fraud. The real girl went to Sarah Lawrence while observant, and became a writer. 

Hasidim exist in New York outside of their communities, and they work, drive, and have independence, and they can do that within their communities or out. The disadvantages of joining secular culture are not unique, and can't be equated to brutality. 

Nothing happened to this girl that girls haven't felt in the secular world either. Again, the sway the show depicts these people just validated hatred you already had."
Luna Nera,"There's nothing sympathetic about a girl who shows up to a top music program and insults them like she can just audition for piano. 

Or invites herself places.

Or who doesn't know what ham looks like, and eats anything put in front of her then panics....or educated about someone who hasn't seen Google (the entire purpose of that scene).

It goes on and on. That character couldn't be more ridiculous."
Luna Nera,"People outraged that some Jews don't cut their sideburns, and observe Passover by wrapping food in tinfoils isn't a hate rant.  Then you share their hate."
Luna Nera,Then why defend the show? Why are you elsewhere in the thread challenging a self defined Orthodox Jew to tell you what was inaccurate about the show?
Luna Nera,"
>Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

The fact you think any criticism of Hasidic Jews equates to what you stated above  is tiresome and unfortunately not at all shocking not shocking."
Luna Nera,God you sound like such an insufferable cunt.
Luna Nera,I'm Jewish jackass. Lmfao
Luna Nera,"The only other person I've discussed the topic with on reddit is not a ""self defined Orthodox Jew"", they said they're ""familiar with the Hasidic world"". All I did was tell him something to the effect of ""saying it's inaccurate is useless unless you give us examples of WHY you think it's inaccurate"". And I'll take this opportunity to say the same to you. What specifically is factually inaccurate?"
Luna Nera,"What's tiresome is that you think this series depicts every Ultra Orthodox Jew, because what else did it show? Don't invent shit that's not in the show itself to justify your thirst. 

I don't think any criticism of Hasidim is a problem, there's a lot to criticize, it's unfortunately YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, as depicted with this one dysfunctional family.  You decided its representative... because you have a disdain for those Jews."
Luna Nera,You sound insecure on the internet.
Luna Nera,Thank you.
Luna Nera,"Are you saying there aren't Jews who hate other Jews or Jews that are different than them, or more observant and it make it okay to express hate?  Take a hike."
Luna Nera,"You don't even know what you're reading. They literally said ""I grew up ultra-Orthodox"".

I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced your antisemitic ass that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  The fact is the author the story is based on was able to get an education and stopped wearing her wig while still living in Brooklyn.  You're clueless."
Luna Nera,"For someone who looks down your nose at others for allegedly making assumptions, you sure make a lot of your own.

>YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, 

When the fuck did I say that? That's not what I think. You have a chip on your shoulder."
Luna Nera,"Yikes, if you find yourself wondering why you can't maintain a healthy relationship, I have identified some factors"
Luna Nera,"You can't even detail what you think you saw that was oppressive and represents the community as a whole, because you know it would paint you as bigoted.

Yet you're in this thread chastising anyone that doesn't think this is an accurate depiction at all. Take a hike. The reason you're passionate about this at all is because you have the chip you didn't even realize you had until now, and you got called out for it. Feels bad for you I'm sure."
Luna Nera,"If you find yourself trying to psychoanalyze strangers on Reddit when they point out the shortcomings of your bigoted posts...you might just get a mirror and write ""sociopath"" and ""hateful"" on it."
Luna Nera,"No, pretty much only you and probably not much longer. 

Hasidic Judaism is fundamentalist religion. Sexist roles, xenophobia, ""my-group-is-better-than-everyone-else"" mentality backed by the word of God, virtue signaling taking precedence over actual virtue (not cutting your hair = virtue signal. Covering kitchen surfaces in foil to prevent yeast from contaminating Passover seder = virtue signal), insular bubble...

I'm not saying every single Hasidic Jew is like this, but some/many are."
Luna Nera,"You clearly know zero about Hasidim and couldn't site examples shown in the show.

You just rattled off a lot of assumptions that aren't in this series. 

And no, claiming you're an equal opportunist hater doesn't help.

I take it back saying you're a bigot was putting it nicely. You're worse."
Luna Nera,"Is [the official web site of a Hasidic sect](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/374918/jewish/Aluminum-Foil.htm) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? The same site also talks about [men not cutting the corners of their hair](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2963669/jewish/Why-Do-Some-Chassidic-Jews-Have-Long-Sidelocks-Peyot.htm). 

Is [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5212069) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? 

Virtue signals are negative things because they tend to serve as a substitute for virtue.

If I'm factually wrong, tell me what I'm missing rather than namecalling me."
Luna Nera,"Holy crap, you're a Grade A bigot. You just used examples religious Jews observing their holiday by avoiding bread or hiding it under tin foil as an example of oppression and justifying your hate mongering. Those are harmless customs you are depicting as proof they're bad people.
Men choosing not to cut the corners of their hair is an example of oppression to you?  

You're an idiot, I'm not going to bother pretending you're coming to this from a reasonable place and neither should you. 

It's not ""virtue signaling"" you just used Passover against Jews."
Luna Nera,"You're still just namecalling and getting angry at me for saying things you don't agree with, you're not giving me an example of what I'm saying that's incorrect you're kind of just angrily saying ""nuh-uh"". 

You're also not talking about the same thing I am, and you are putting words in my mouth.

**Religious groups, especially fundamentalist ones, have virtue signals. Displaying the virtue signals does not make anyone a bad person. I never said that because I don't believe that. I think virtue signals are problematic, that does not mean I think people who use them are bad.**

I'm not talking about hiding bread under foil or avoiding bread. I'm talking about [this](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1745/jewish/Preparing-the-Kitchen.htm). It's not hurting anyone per se, but thinking God cares about such minutiae is genuinely sad to me and seems pretty unhealthy.

The whole point of the first Passover meal is that the Jews in Egypt had no time to prepare. They were in such a hurry they ate unleavened bread and drank unfermented wine.

This level of intricate, time-consuming preparation performed by many Hasidic Jews is quite the opposite of the original Passover described in the Torah. Passover was a hastily prepared meal in advance of an impending visit from an angel of death. The Jews in Egypt weren't covering kitchen surfaces and heavily scrubbing pots and ovens, they were throwing together a meal as quickly as humanly possible."
Luna Nera,"That's a lot of minutia for clueless bigot. Now you're gatekeeping and saying one group of Jews in their diaspora don't practice correctly? You're a fricken Rabbi now? Get a life. It took me two seconds on google to see that preparing for Passover by removing, burning or temporarily hiding leavened bread is part of their custom. You hate some Jews, you're not smart, and you're actually critical of their religious observance as Jews, which makes you antisemitic."
Luna Nera,">I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced [you] that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  

Remember how I never said that and don't believe that? The show never said that either. 

>clueless

>bigot. 

>Get a life. 

>not smart, 

>antisemitic

That's a strong argument you've got there. Have a good one. Sorry you're so angry."
Luna Nera,"The problem is you're making bigoted lifeless, idiotic, clueless and antisemitic ""arguments"" and you're upset at the response you're getting.

Really...what kind of person gets upset that Jews hide their bread for a week in the privacy of their own homes and uses that as an example of xenophobia, or oppression?"
Luna Nera,Episode 5 was pretty refreshing. It helped me want to finish the season. Glad to see Rickety Cricket in more roles.
Luna Nera,"I finished the first season the other day, I really enjoyed it, and as an Aussy loved seeing one on the show."
Luna Nera,"It wasn't great, but I found it entertaining enough to finish the series.  Episode 5 was fantastic of course.  Cristin Milioti and Jake Johnson pull at the heartstrings.  Surprisingly, the show managed to gather an all-star cast.  It was neat to see Ashly Burch, sort of a game industry OG.  The comedy was more ""sitcom funny"" than actually funny.  There are lots of silly moments, like when the aging story writer (F. Murray Abraham) mistakens an air conditioner unit for the AI robot taking over his job.  It's on the Apple streaming platform so I don't expect the content to get too mature.  It is light-hearted and chill, which is nice."
Luna Nera,"I thought Rob‚Äôs character not flat out being an asshole was refreshing/interesting and I enjoyed watching the show, but it‚Äôs not really that funny. Feel like that‚Äôs a problem for a comedy show."
Luna Nera,I agree that it gets better with each episode. Episode 5 was obviously the highlight but every episode after that was much better as well. Really excited to see more of this show.
Luna Nera,F. Murray Abraham is a treasure.
Luna Nera,It's not perfect but for a first season it's pretty good.  It's just a lot of fun overall.
Luna Nera,I continue to be impressed with what I've seen from Apple TV+. Everything I've watched has been great so far.
Luna Nera,cool i just heard about this and was wondering if it was worth watching
Luna Nera,"> the 'will-they-wont-they' intimacy between Rachel and Dana is also quite adorable and the most intriguing one I've seen from the trope in quite a while.

Really? I thought the subplot was the worst from the show.  It just felt kinda out of place, having a semi serious romantic subplot in the middle of a comedy show, with very little to no crossover.  It was also extremely blatant, in an almost cringy way.  I don't understand how Dana couldn't tell Rachel was into her after like the first 5 seconds of them being on screen.  

Overall I liked the show a lot, though.  I'm glad it already got renewed for S2, cause I think some slight fine tuning after S1 is what would push it from a decent/goodish comedy to a great one."
Luna Nera,"I honestly can't agree. To be completely honest, I found pretty much every episode just okay. I like the ides in it, and the ideas for the characters, but they just fall so flat, and in the end there were only three characters I liked: Jo, Cricket (forgot his name), and Mack (forgot his name also). Pretty much every other character I just do not find funny and/or interesting. On top of that, almost every epiosde was just uninteresting. The only episode I was at least somewhat interested by was the nazi episode."
Luna Nera,Great show!
Luna Nera,It‚Äôs awesome.
Luna Nera,This was a lot of fun and very bingable.
Ragnarok,"Lazy writing, which is ironic considering Joe's ""thing"" is judging lazy writers. It seems the writers this season deliberately decided to give wealthy characters every negative trait possible that exists in humanity. The result is more parody than intrigue."
Ragnarok,"Every season was a fun ride except 4. Everything that made You interesting (the commentary on childhood trauma manifesting into adulthood, the false images people portray of themselves in our modern social media obsessed society, the way ppl of similar traumas are drawn to each other) was all gone. This season felt totally random and unrelated. What are the odds that the place Joe ends up hiding puts him in the path of a political serial killer? üßçüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è they also started to try and portray Joe as a hero. Before it was clear he was demented, but season 4 felt like it was attempting to redeem him (by him not killing Marianne, and not letting Roald burn when he could‚Äôve, and telling his new love interest he couldnt be w her). Feels like theyre setting up season 4 pt.2 to make him into a hero. When what was special about the show was how the viewer would find themselves unconsciously rooting for him when he was a bad guy in reality. Real bummer of a season. Show writers have been flopping left and right lately."
Ragnarok,"How can they say it's awul and hugely entertaining? I don't think it fits into the category lf 'so bad it's good'.

It just feels like these reviewers are ashamed to like a show like this so they have to preface it with 'I know it's bad' to save face."
Ragnarok,"Such a bad season. Not to mention the awful, over the top British stereotypes. It felt so out of touch haha"
Ragnarok,It was the worst season by far..
Ragnarok,">It‚Äôs no longer worth asking if it‚Äôs good or bad ‚Äì just enjoy the rollercoaster

If only there were people who it was worth their time because it's literally their job."
Ragnarok,"I was surprised how bad this season is. I actually liked Season 3. But everything about Season 4 is terrible: the plot, the dialogues, the characters‚Ä¶"
Ragnarok,"This season is truly just awful though. They really just gave up writing it seems, Joe is just placed in a new world and instead of showing any of the relationship building we are just supposed to assume that the awkward guy who doesn't respond to anyone talking to him became best friends with people in the 0.1% all in a single night. His inclusion in everything they do is so strange and every scene he's in with them he just narrates and stays silent even in one on one conversations."
Ragnarok,The first season was the best because it actually had something meaningful to say about the type man Joe is and the type of women who are into (or not) that kind of thing.
Ragnarok,"I don't know what people want.

I love You as a dumb dark comedy with a super charismatic lead killing dumbasses"
Ragnarok,"Season 4 is the perfect example of writers trying to give us ""more of what we like"" with out giving us what we actually like.

1. Joe went from working at a Bookstore and now he is a PHD professor?

2. He easily infiltrates a circle of rich spoiled people with zero clout, not that much money, drugs or charisma.  And he's probably what they would consider ""Dad"" age ... Why would they want to hang out with him?

3. Joe is now Sherlock Holmes?

I actually switched off after the middle of episode 2 and came to reddit for the comments.  When reading comments becomes more interesting than watching the show you know its not good üòÇ"
Ragnarok,"Wow i guess unpopular opinion, but i think this season is entertaining. Just a murder mystery not bad not over analyzing."
Ragnarok,"Season 2 & 3 were amazing, but this new season ruined it by coming to my country. 

I hope the next season goes back to the USA"
Ragnarok,"Season 1 will always be the GOAT , this one is an easy skip."
Ragnarok,"I actually enjoyed it but it‚Äôs definitely in the ‚Äúsee how weird/bad rich people are‚Äù trope that‚Äôs so hot right now (I.e. triangle of sadness, the menu, white lotus, infinity pool, etc) and is going to be overdone fairly soon. As of now I‚Äôm still enjoying it and will watch the hell out of part 2. I like this season way more than Love and the baby season which was a total snooze fest."
Ragnarok,It's a fucking bore. Season 3 was dogshit. And this season is worse somehow. The European setting is bad. I don't give a shit about anyone in the show at this point. Just end the shitfest
Ragnarok,Found this season really hard to get into ! A little boring.  These random friend groups just like inviting this weirdo stranger in ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so goofy and hard to believe. It‚Äôs more glaring this time because they are so ‚Äúelitist‚Äù ‚Ä¶ yet none of the characters are interesting in anyway.  His like ‚Äúlove interest‚Äù neighbor is so mean and also so harsh looking - like she‚Äôs not attractive by any stretch.
Ragnarok,"Nope, this season is not it... honestly I was done in season three. I watched season 4 episode 1 and had enough really, wth did they do to the character and what's with all the rich people clich√©s."
Ragnarok,I am on episode 1 but it feels like the writers feel like their audience aren‚Äôt as smart as they are. It comes across as super pretentious and I don‚Äôt really feel like continuing the series.
Ragnarok,It's fucking boring because it seems like its some 1940 film.
Ragnarok,It's so boring
Ragnarok,"It‚Äôs meeting my expectations unfortunately. Since season 3 the show has been moving at a ridiculously rapid pace and making for sloppy, inconsistent decisions on behalf of all of the main characters, including Joe. I had a feeling they didn‚Äôt have much left to tell since the books that birthed the show don‚Äôt go this far - but they could have made the explosion of Love and fallout of season 3 two seasons long - that would have made for a better season 4 than this so far."
Ragnarok,"Why are they turning him into Dexter? I can barely believe he isn't stalking someone yet, I have doubts."
Ragnarok,I still can‚Äôt fathom why the private  detective just let him go? Just because?
Ragnarok,It completely lost the feel of what the show actually started out as. Doesn‚Äôt even feel like this season is the same show as season 1. Turned into a stalker romance theme to just a who done it show. Not a fan
Ragnarok,"I still have 3 episodes to go so I‚Äôm trying to avoid spoilers but I also want to voice my opinion on the ‚Äútwist‚Äù. First off, for the first half of the season it was way too obvious that Rhys was going to be the source of Joe‚Äôs conflict. It was way too easy to figure out. Secondly, I was getting Fight Club, Tyler Durden vibes the entire time and kept wondering if this wad going to turn out to be a multiple personality story. I thought that it would be too clich√© and that hopefully the writers had something different up their sleeve. Whelp I should have trusted my instincts. Its just been done way too many times at this point. The thing is that yes, Joe is a psycho. There‚Äôs never been any doubt on that. However, since he is the protagonist of this series we should expect to see a bit of a character arc. He‚Äôs still a killer but thanks to Love being a homicidal maniac, he has more perspective on it and ambitions to better deal with it. Joe should never be forgiven but there was something interesting in seeing him trying to hold his demons at bay and even use his sickness to track down someone even more sick. Having him just turn out to be crazier than ever and even more so of a killer just makes me feel like he hasn‚Äôt really gone anywhere. Again, I am in no way advocating for Joe to have redemption or a happy ending. He deserves to be locked away for the rest of his life but seeing some growth was appealing from a character and psychological stand point. I guess I can‚Äôt fairly review it until I‚Äôve finished but that‚Äôs my feeling after the reveal."
Ragnarok,This season sucks!!! Every season got worse and worse... season 1 was sooo good it‚Äôs kept me still watching. Season 4 is like gossip girl turned psychotic
Ragnarok,The recent series is just pointless. Why didn't he just leave town the minute the murders started? Why stay? The main problem with the series is it's just BORING. Having listened to all the audiobooks I'm really disappointed! I don't get why they didn't just follow the story in the books
Ragnarok,"This season is a bit of a mess really. Joe is fixated on Marianne to such an extent he follows her to London but lets her leave so we can have a serial killer series instead. This Friend group he is part of is clearly written for a US audience and for the stereotype of Brits being stuck up elites who are one step removed from being part of the Royal family. Joe is on the run but when his identity might be revealed, he turns into Sherlock Holmes instead of going on the run again."
Ragnarok,"The first season was unique and  brilliant because it was a sardonic take on modern culture. It should have stopped there. Since then it's been the same repetitive storyline with the same annoyingly arch  Penn Badgely voiceover. We're supposed to believe that this moderately, attractive, ordinary guy ends up in all these glam locations and women can't resist him? Are we seriously to believe a teacher can afford to live in that incredible London apartment, when apartments in London are more than New York? I'm willing to suspend disbelief if the show is rivetiing and well-written, but I'm bored and I can't stand the lazy over-reliance on his voiceover"
Ragnarok,"Why would Joe try to solve the case instead of just running away again? Why would the private eye just let him go? Lazy writing, show has jumped the shark."
Ragnarok,Boring season. Boring plot and tbh I just don‚Äôt care for this entire new ensemble of characters. It feels like we‚Äôre watching a fan fiction of what could‚Äôve potentially happened. Like some fake haha story. What if Joe went to England? Just lazy writing. The writers had no idea what to do with this season and it shows.
Ragnarok,"Man. I really really liked YOU, but this first part of this season is absolutely awful."
Ragnarok,What the hell happened I'm watching season 4 I have had to go back several times to watch parts again its completely disconnected from the first 3 seasons Joe isn't even coming off the same its weird and I feel like this is a whole different show ugh so disappointing
Ragnarok,Yeah gotta say they changed the whole premise and it sucks now
Ragnarok,"i knew who the killer was in the first episode. when he showed up, i just let out a really long sigh. it‚Äôs really weird how joe went from being a predatory murderer, to a detective savior? i just feel like the writers had NO idea what to do after he killed love. i feel like it probably should have ended after he killed his literal wife and abandoned his son. it would have been a perfect ending that explained everything. he did exactly what his mom did to him. he left his son behind so that he could start over, and then completely forgot about him. and then he killed his own wife, because she was too similar to him and he couldn‚Äôt handle it. it was such a good ending. it‚Äôs too bad that they decided to keep dragging it on. netflix has gotten so damn lazy with their story writing. all they care about is money, so they definitely didn‚Äôt take their time with this one. it feels so rushed, like they couldn‚Äôt WAIT to get their next paycheck. not only that, but Penn asked for no sex scenes, and he‚Äôs had more sex scenes that he has in any other season. it‚Äôs like they did it to mock him. i‚Äôm honestly really grossed out by this season, and i feel no connection to it anymore."
Ragnarok,"My God I agree. The tone is completely different and does NOT work. I signed up as a fan of the deluded, antihero with a penchant for romance (albeit creepy). Not Sherlock Holmes in London."
Ragnarok,"Season 4 should have started with him getting caught and arrested, then unfolding with him trying to lie to get out of it, the court case unfolding, etc and then the season/finale ending with his sentencing...."
Ragnarok,"Literally this is an entirely different show with the same actor. Totally different character, style, storylines, plots‚Ä¶ everythinggggg. Cancel You"
Ragnarok,Nothing will ever compare to Love. Her character was amazing. That twist in season 2 still gets me everyday. Killing her off was the worst thing this show ever did. I haven't watched season 4 but after Love i don't know if i can.
Ragnarok,Am I the only one who liked it lol
Ragnarok,"It's the Twilight of serial killer shows/movies/books. It's bad and cringe. It makes Dexter, another corny serial killer show, look good in comparison."
Ragnarok,"My problem with the entire show is that it tries so hard to romanticize and get you to root for Joe that any attempt at a commentary on mental illness completely falls flat. Who cares that Joe spends most of the show doing horrible things to objectively good people? He‚Äôs smart, vaguely liberal, and occasionally kills absurdly bad people, so you should be cool with the fact that he always ends up on top, right? A good anti-hero story should at least try to leave the audience feeling a little bit conflicted. This show doesn‚Äôt do that at all"
Ragnarok,"I agree with Vincent and what others have said. Understandably, there are some discrepancies but it is a work of fiction and it‚Äôs not supposed to hyper focus on accuracy. It‚Äôs not a documentary. And I get it, It doesn‚Äôt follow the same plot as previous seasons, which we all loved. But sometimes it‚Äôs good to add something a little different. I get the whole academia/geography complaints, but as storytellers of fiction, the goal is to entertain and to keep the story moving along. Too many specifications may leave viewers bored as it would take too long to for the actual narrative to play. Small details as in how long a walk is from this location to the next isn‚Äôt something they would highlight unless it played some kind of significance in the plot."
Ragnarok,[deleted]
Ragnarok, 7
Ragnarok,I just don't like seeing Joe as the good guy. And now he's on track to becoming a hero? What?
Ragnarok,It‚Äôs a trying to be Dexter knock off
Ragnarok,"I loved You seasons 1-3 season 4 is absolute DOGSHIT!!! I barely made through the 1st episode, 5 minutes into s4 episode 2 I turned it off I'm not going to watch the rest of season 4. To describe it in one word horrible. Was it written buy a room full of special needs children?"
Ragnarok,"Exactly! Some.complete eejit is arguing with me on another thread that the investigator set him up as a professor ... like multiple paragraphs and comments. There is just no way lol. And I'd bet your professor friend isn't just given a 3 million pound flat rent free to run about in, despite excelling in their field. Nor can they bend space and time to walk from one end of London to another twice daily! 

But this other redditor vehemently disagrees, ah well.

And you've come up with a way better plot too and with such ease. Would be so much better in Thailand and your plot makes more sense. Ut would require the writers to at least know where Thailand is on a map, however, and since they can't even Google the basics on London, it would definitely be beyond them. Send me your script!"
Ragnarok,I liked it because it is different. If they just re-did season 1 but in London we would be complaining that they just re-did season 1 but in London.
Ragnarok,"I swear, this season was so ridiculous and out-of-left-field that I had half a mind they were about to reveal Joe as a lesser-known Marvel character or introduce him with some special supernatural power. 

My partner had never heard of ‚ÄòYou‚Äô before, so he started watching this season with me. What an awful and disappointing introduction that was."
Ragnarok,"Horrible. I went back to rewatch season 3 b/c I was so disappointed at season 4. Ugh. I waited so long. I‚Äôm trying to find a dislike button for season 4 on Netflix. Not a thing, so vending w/Reddit is my only option lol. Worst part is that I replayed every single episode of season 4 an insane amount of times b/c it was soooo bad that I would loose interest and then had to replay it thinking that maybe it was bad b/c I wasn‚Äôt engaged. But we know the truth. It‚Äôs bad. Had force myself to keep engaged. Now I‚Äôve contributed to the streaming reports Netflix probably pulls to determine ‚Äúit‚Äôs good‚Äù due to watch time data. Ugh."
Ragnarok,"I rarely ""saw"" (becaus probably was more scrolling on the phone during the whole thing) something that boring on screen as this season of you"
Ragnarok,"I didn't like season 4 either. He went from being obsessed with women to obsessed with a man? It's just sucked all over. I didn't  feel like binge watching Season 4 like the other seasons. I was quite bored during some scenes. I didn't  like Kate, Kathy, or whatever her name is as a lover for Joe. Beck and Love were more his style."
Ragnarok,If Joe doesn't kill someone soon imma lose it
Ragnarok,"I feel like they‚Äôre milking the show too much, and part two was just bad."
Ragnarok,"I left another comment on here that the Fight Club twist was too cliche and easy to figure out. Now I‚Äôm barely passed that and already have another complaint. I‚Äôm sorry but Marienne saying that they can‚Äôt go to the police is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve seen recently lol. Of course you go to the police! The guy has a traceable history of dead bodies in his wake. Even Joe himself has been worried about talking to police because it wouldn‚Äôt take a lot of digging to find out who really is. Both Marienne and Nadia are eye witnesses and even him just being brought in for kidnapping would be enough to unravel the rest of his BS. I‚Äôm sorry but there‚Äôs no where left for Joe to run in a scenario where the police suddenly show up while he‚Äôs in the middle of class to arrest him. I still have two more episodes to go but for me, this season is getting a bit silly. The police are clearly a better option then leaving Marienne caged while they concoct some convoluted plan that probably has a less likely hood of success than just simply going to the police. Lol like when Marriene cautions Nadia about not letting Joe find out that she knows because he may hurt her? Hey do you know a scenario where there wouldn‚Äôt be any risk of that happening? IF YOU GO TO THE POLICE lol."
Ragnarok,"Reading the comments here, it's pretty funny after watching part 2. Great show IMO, lol"
Ragnarok,"I don't know why but I've kind of lost interest now that Joe is just a crazy split personality type. I was more interested when it seemed like bad stuff just kept happening to him and he kept getting away with things. For some reason, it just felt typical at that point."
Ragnarok,YOU season 4 feels like it was written by ChatGPT üòÇ
Ragnarok,Season 4 is BAD and not in a good way
Ragnarok,the whole joe is suddenly a detective vibe feels so wierd too. i dont like it
Ragnarok,The show has always has every wealthy character be unbearable
Ragnarok,[deleted]
Ragnarok,"Season 1 and this latest season feel like two completely different shows. I was really looking forward to the European aesthetic because I thought we would at least be going back to season 1's urban vibes. Instead, we got a rehash of Peach Salinger's estate in the coutnryside. 

&#x200B;

I'm really shocked by how bad this season was."
Ragnarok,Agree. I almost felt like it was more of a grown up Dan Humphrey in a British Gossip Girl show then Joe Goldberg in You.
Ragnarok,i dont get it. Why don't writers just keep the same elements of previous seasons that made their writing and story so good? How do they stray off the path so easily?? Do they just not try anymore?
Ragnarok,"IMO, it's good to change it up a bit, like the character was developed in the past seasons and 1. It'll get dull if the childhood thing get brought up over and over again, 2. He tried to move up with his pattern.

It's quite refreshing to see how his past caught up with him>!, and now the ""You"" is a man!!< even though the writing is not the most creative."
Ragnarok,Totally agree with you. This season doesn‚Äôt even seem like the same show. The plot line is completely unaligned with the past 3 season.
Ragnarok,Part 2 dropped did you change your mind?
Ragnarok,they need to wrap it up. It felt like joe was placed squarely in a different story altogether.
Ragnarok,You is in the ‚Äúthis shit is so ridiculous and I can‚Äôt stop watching‚Äù territory of films. You have to turn your brain off and just enjoy the crazy white people ride
Ragnarok,"If you are taking You seriously, it's an awful and ridiculous show.

I always say that You is the best bad show."
Ragnarok,"IT‚Äôs especially annoying that they are ‚Äúprofessional critics‚Äù it‚Äôs one thing if your friend is saying this, but the whole point of reviews is to critique it and tell you If it‚Äôs worth a watch. Instead a lot of these reviews just walk around the actual critiquing."
Ragnarok,">'so bad it's good'.

this isn't the only way bad shows can be fun to watch.

there's a massive sea of media that my kids would call ""mid"" and a lot of these ""mid"" shows are really fun to watch, and some of them are awful

i guess a pretty recent example (at least in my house) is Thor Love and Thunder. it was awful. but it was fun. but it wasn't ""so bad it's good"" either."
Ragnarok,"The writer has slated the show every season and does not understand the shows appeal. They have given in and just praise it now because its so popular  tbh I am not a fan of season 4 where I feel it has lost what made it special, but the guardian writer wouldnt know since they didn't *get it* in the first place"
Ragnarok,"What they mean is ""it's not good enough for me because I'm smart but it should be good enough for you, since you don't realize all the things I realize"". It's some low-self esteem journo bullshit."
Ragnarok,What stereotypes?
Ragnarok,The fact they split it into two parts is just embarrassing üòÇ because I have no interest in watching part 2
Ragnarok,Took the words right out my mouth.
Ragnarok,Right this season sucked! So boring
Ragnarok,"How did he fake a PhD and proof of published papers to get a lecturer position? Let alone a PROFESSOR which in Europe is INCREDIBLY hard to get and you don't get without have taught for years and excelled. Most departments in most universities don't even have one.

How is he staying in a 3 million dollar flat in London (or Oxford since they actually show Oxford). It's so dumb. Let alone the twist which is so obvious it's embarrassing"
Ragnarok,"No really though, so embarrassing how they split into two parts‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just wondering whose actually watching the 2nd part because I‚Äôve been bored üòëI only finished part 1 because I thought there would be an exciting turn but yeah I was giving too much credit."
Ragnarok,"I was tired of hearing these people talk/couldnt care for these characters. I tried fast-forwarding and ironically enough, you can totally skip all the scenes with these new people interacting between each other/skip all the scenes between Joe and Kate, and it absolutely doesn't impact the show in any way. It's still understandable. So these characters aren't just annoying, they're useless to the plot."
Ragnarok,"To preface, I like all the seasons, but you make a great point regarding season one. In season one, the portrayal of Joe's compulsions was punchier because it was surprising and spiraling.

In the other seasons, Joe's behavior starts to be treated like hijinks. There's less surprise surrounding it (obviously), and as such it becomes a part of the scenery. It does undermine the moral of the story in that sense."
Ragnarok,I started with the second season and went back and watched the first and enjoyed them both. The third season I had trouble getting through and still haven‚Äôt finished it.
Ragnarok,He's shown himself to be a dumbass time and time again so I really don't get the weird ass hero worship some people give him..
Ragnarok,Exactly!
Ragnarok,I agree. It doesn‚Äôt even make sense he would put himself in an occupation where he would be exposed to so many people who could easily identify him. You‚Äôd think he‚Äôd take a very low key job like maybe work at a small local bookstore.
Ragnarok,"Wow, you lasted until Episode 2? I googled that shit about 10 minutes into the first episode. This season is looking like absurd bullshit"
Ragnarok,"Same. I stopped it 11 minutes into episode 2 and I won't be going back. Man, it got so bad."
Ragnarok,"It‚Äôs a good season in its own but next to the previous seasons, it‚Äôs basically a new show and completely washes out the complexity of his character by trying to turn him into some hero."
Ragnarok,"I think its pretty entertaining too, what most people are forgetting is that it hasnt ended yet, joe might not be the ""hero"", maybe he's still psychotic and rhys is his split personality he created to justify his ""i'm good from now"" side. but in reality, he is still that cold blooded murderer"
Ragnarok,"Yeah, but they did it while not even having googled London, saying he can walk from one end to the other?  JFC. They don't know their arse from their elbow, and it shows.. lazy writing."
Ragnarok,"I honestly despise each and EVERY character this season! They're all equally awful,I don't care if they live or die so I don't care who the murderer is atpüò©"
Ragnarok,There was zero character development so you are not rooting for anyone. It's all him talking and sneaking. At least the past few seasons had fun characters.
Ragnarok,"i'm just curious, why?"
Ragnarok,"Yeah that was so weird and he had a new incredibly expensive fake passport with joes photos set up with a new identity for him, that's quite the effort he went to."
Ragnarok,If I remember correctly wasn‚Äôt the incentive so the detective could take all of Love‚Äôs money in her bank account of some sort? I could be wrong. The season was so boring I did a lot of fast forwarding.

What the Love! with Karan Johar,"I agree.

I mentioned this on here a few months ago how we need more pure and impeccably virtuous characters in major shows where you don‚Äôt rely on major flaws to make a character ‚Äúinteresting.‚Äù

What the Love! with Karan Johar,Ehhh. I don‚Äôt think it is
What the Love! with Karan Johar,Season 1 sure. Season 2 took Brene Brown's podcasts and dialled it up to 12 until they all disappeared up their own asses.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,If you think about the core premise too much he is the opposite of Mr. Rogers. He took a job he is unqualified for and would ultimately fail at just because he was dealing with depression and a sad divorce.  IRL the consequences of him getting the team relegated would have destroyed the livelihoods of not just all his players but the entire neighborhood where AFC Richmond was located. But because the show is Produced by Americans who have done a poor job of researching their subject(Premiere League Football) none of these consequences are thoroughly examined in this show.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,I don‚Äôt see it. The show‚Äôs also about toxic positivity. Mr. Rogers was not toxically positive.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,Breaking Bad did this. Sorta.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,I watched a season and a half of Ted Lasso and I just don‚Äôt get it. I never once laughed out loud. It‚Äôs a lifetime movie with a bigger budget stretched into a show.

What the Love! with Karan Johar,"I only watched a few episodes before I got bored so I'm sure he doesn't stay nice because it's a soap, but there's a character on the original Dynasty that kinda works for"
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"> I mentioned this on here a few months ago how we need more pure and impeccably virtuous characters in major shows where you don‚Äôt rely on major flaws to make a character ‚Äúinteresting.‚Äù

So, not Ted Lasso.

The guy is so broken and avoidant that he hides behind a harmful positivity and flees to another country rather than face up to what is going on in his marriage and there proceeds to gamble with the livelihoods of dozens of people despite having precisely zero qualifications.

I love the show, but if you think the major characters are impeccably virtuous, I posit that you've barely given it the most cursory of glances and don't really understand it."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,ted lasso is leslie knope coded
What the Love! with Karan Johar,what if mr rogers sold meth? ‚Äî breaking bad
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"It‚Äôs not going to be for everyone but I think it was also the perfect show at the perfect time. The world is/was depressing, hateful, divisive, etc. Ted Lasso has a bunch of flawed people who ultimately want to help each other and be happy but without tearing each other down."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,I see it as a live action slice-of-life anime. It's wholesome and that's it
What the Love! with Karan Johar,You get it
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"The OP asked for ‚Äúmore genuine/caring characters in media‚Äù and I shared my interest in seeing more characters who don‚Äôt ‚Äúrely‚Äù on major flaws. That last part of what I said is key as season 1 of Ted Lasso shows his marriage issues in a more repressed subjacent/subtextual sort of way where we as the audience have to put the pieces together; it is more implicit.

Therefore, I felt I could enjoy season 1 even more because I could just pretend he had no major flaws and he was just this perfect gentleman whose wife was probably the one in the marriage who couldn‚Äôt handle his perfectly pleasant demeanor because she was always wrongly suspicious, kind of like how you sound in a way, that there was some flaw deep inside him that he‚Äôs suppressing to put on this super jolly and positive fa√ßade. 

I know there is more below the surface and season 2 explored his darker side, but I‚Äôm talking specifically about season 1 where he did some across mostly on the surface the way OP describes him. That is more the kind of character I would like to see more of where even if they do have **some** flaws they aren‚Äôt particularly explicit and you can watch the show and ignore any possible flaws and perhaps rationalize in a weird way any possible flaws they may have in a sort of ‚Äúwell, it must have been the wife/husband/uncle/brother who are the problem, not the central character.‚Äù

I still view pretty much the entirety of season 1 Ted Lasso (the character) in this sort of way even though I know there‚Äôs more than meets the eye, but it‚Äôs easier to suspend disbelief for a lack of a better term to believe he‚Äôs this perfectly nice, jolly, positive gentleman by nature and it isn‚Äôt a front to cover up major flaws. I still do honestly believe even after season 2 though that his niceness isn‚Äôt entirely an act, even if he has some demons he‚Äôs faced in his life and some mistakes he‚Äôs made that prompted him to run away to the UK from his wife and son."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,It was [Mr. Chips](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/may/19/vince-gilligan-breaking-bad) actually. I had it wrong.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,I would argue the good place accomplished that while actually being funny and having real conflicts and stakes.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"No his niceness is not an act, but it's a shield.

It broke his marriage and it almost breaks himself.

Ted lacks balance and presumably throughout series 3 he will get closer to that balance, now that he's able to actually process his feelings and confront them with the help of the therapist.

As for his wife, it's not that Michelle is suspicious (interesting way to lay it at her door) but that she's become isolated in her own marriage due to her husbands relentless toxic positivity because she feels she's letting him down while at the same time not getting much actual support from him. Just look at his reaction when she asks for space: he fucking runs off to Europe. 

Again, Ted is not a bad person, by any yardstick, but he's a broken person that for the longest time ignored that to the detriment of his relationships and the people he loved. That's the start of his arc and I'd be very surprised if that's where he ends it."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"My personal favourite is The Detectorists.  Real working class people with real problems and all dealt with humour, honesty and love.  Ted Lasso feels like just another show about rich people being unhappy despite having literally *everything* handed to them on a silver platter."

FanDuel, a sports gambling app, ran a promotion where he'd try to kick a field goal live during a Super Bowl commercial and if he makes it customers get a promotion for some kind of free incentive. He missed but they're still doing the promotion."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"Those aren't ""fans."" That's his family, as it says in the commercial. Pretty sure the woman who runs closest to him before he falls down disappointed is his girlfriend, Camille Kostek. While they do all run in his direction and crowd him, if you actually look at what individuals are doing, they're not celebrating."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,You‚Äôre asking why people wrongly thought he made it when you‚Äôre in that boat? Really?
What the Love! with Karan Johar,He didn't make it though. The commercial is that he misses but they're still giving the same deal they said they would if he made it.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,They gave out $5 anyway because it‚Äôs just a promo to get people gambling like you say.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,His USAA commercials are borderline making fun of mentally disabled people. It's fuckin gross.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,Its bendier than Beckham
What the Love! with Karan Johar,The kick flies likes its a 50 yard field goal.  The whole thing looks wrong.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,This is the issue. They shrunk the ball so small that it looks like it‚Äôs way past the goal posts already before it hooks.
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"Yeah, if you slow it down you can watch the ball pass in front of the upright. They were always gonna do the deal lol"
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"Yup, and they were always going to give people the money regardless of whether or not he made the kick. That‚Äôs how these promos go."
What the Love! with Karan Johar,"True, but with him missing it was a lame consolation prize. If you‚Äôre going to script it anyways I would think you‚Äôd want him to make it"
What the Love! with Karan Johar,Plus only military associated people can bank with them which is a tiny part of the population so where's the money going?
THE STRANGER,5 years between season 2 and 4 will do that.
THE STRANGER,"They should have just lengthened the timeline of the show, make the time in between seasons be a couple years instead."
THE STRANGER,Reminds me how the Lost writers shelved their plans for Walt because they hadn't anticipated that 12 year old *Malcom David Kelley would outgrow the show's timeframe of like 100 days for the first four seasons. It's not as if he became a giant either. Even in adulthood he's like five and a half feet tall.
THE STRANGER,"As punishment for the puberty, he got to keep that same goofy bowl cut hahahaha"
THE STRANGER,"I mean, who could have known that taking a decade to make five seasons of a show starring 12 year olds could present such logistical problems?"
THE STRANGER,"The whole puberty thing is why Sadie Sink moved from Broadway to television; in an interview she said that once you turn 13 you get told to come back when you're 18. Too old for the ""child parts"" (she did *Annie*) and too young for the adult ones.

She was 18-19 when filming Season 4 as the 14-year-old Max. She's fortunate/unfortunate that she looks younger than she is. Considering the state her character ended up in, they could easily make her look a bit older."
THE STRANGER,"Keep talkin, Noah. We‚Äôre never gonna let you fix that haircut.

‚Äîthe Duffers, probably"
THE STRANGER,They coulda changed his god awful haircut.
THE STRANGER,"Yeah, no shit.

An 18yr old pretending to look 12 will typically wind up looking 30."
THE STRANGER,So they hit him back with that haircut??
THE STRANGER,Neither did Drake
THE STRANGER,"Either work faster or move the show timeline with the actors ages.

It took the Harry Potter series 10 years to cover 7 school years."
THE STRANGER,"When you cast people that young, you have to plan your timeline with the fact that they will age. If the show has to take an extended break, you need a matching timeline gap."
THE STRANGER,That boys haircut bothered me.
THE STRANGER,"To be honest, even though shows are getting shorter, it feels like they take even longer to produce now than they used to back in the day, when they were much bigger. It‚Äôs an annoying trend."
THE STRANGER,I remember when the series first premiered and the Duffers played with the idea to have a supernatural/horror anthology with new setting/characters every season but with an overarching theme of ‚ÄúThe 80s‚Äù. I wish they did this
THE STRANGER,"Obviously they were not committed to their roles. Should‚Äôve hired Christian Bale, he goes to crazy lengths for a role. He would‚Äôve stopped going through puberty in a heartbeat."
THE STRANGER,They all look fine except Noah looks looks Lloyd from dumb and dumber
THE STRANGER,"tough shit, that's the gamble you take when you hire child actors."
THE STRANGER,"It‚Äôs weird because Noah was actually younger than his character to begin with and even in season 4 would have been 15/16 during filming - when his character was 14/15. I‚Äôd imagine the older actors would have had some issues, but it seems odd that he was being asked to slouch etc when he was the accurate one."
THE STRANGER,"The good news everyone who has a kid, deals with kids or works with kids ""just not loving it"" when the kids hit puberty."
THE STRANGER,They could have went The Simpsons route and use anti growth hormones.
THE STRANGER,"I didn‚Äôt really love it either, it became a little awkward. That being said it‚Äôs not the actors fault  that this show took so long to produce. The writers should have had a time jump, or the Netflix should have pressured them to produce the show faster. That being said I think a little awkwardness aside it hasn‚Äôt really been a big deal."
THE STRANGER,"Noah Schnapp was born in 2004 and would have been 11 when they first started filming season 1 of Stranger Things (November, 2015).  He was pretty much guaranteed to hit puberty while filming unless they were only planning on doing a single season..."
THE STRANGER,Maybe they shouldn‚Äôt have took 10 years to make the third and fourth seasons
THE STRANGER,"They know how time works, right?"
THE STRANGER,They never watched Harry Potter ?
THE STRANGER,"Still just not loving that haircut. 

Love the show , holy cow what a great show."
THE STRANGER,Probably shouldn‚Äôt have waited ten years between the 3rd and 4th seasons. /s
THE STRANGER,"Uhhhhh that's not really something they can control, duffs"
THE STRANGER,What the fuck do you expect it takes 3 years for a new season of this show to air.
THE STRANGER,Drake wasn't too much of a fan either.
THE STRANGER,"To be fair, have you been in a room with a teenager hitting puberty? Yeah, it stinks real bad."
THE STRANGER,Noah Schnapp looked rough in this latest season. They did him up like he was 13 and the dude looked like a creepy 28.
THE STRANGER,It is Evan Hansen weird how they keep trying to make them look younger
THE STRANGER,"It was a great gig for the bowl they used to cut his hair, though."
THE STRANGER,"In Riverdale years, they're still 10 years too young to even go to highschool yet."
THE STRANGER,Would anyone really care if the characters ages weren't synced with real-time? Like they could have progressed time 1 year per season but presented the characters as 2 or 3 years older.
THE STRANGER,Well if they didn‚Äôt  take 3 years to put out each season ..there kids ..it happens o swear Hollywood is the weirdest fucking place on the planet way too obsessed with children
THE STRANGER,Then don‚Äôt take years to make 1 season?
THE STRANGER,Maybe if they didn‚Äôt take ten damn years between seasons this wouldn‚Äôt have happened
THE STRANGER,"He was such a bad, useless, and creepy character that last season"
THE STRANGER,I still dont get why it was an issue. Would the story not work if you just had a bigger time jump that fits with the time of the real world. Theyd just be juniors or seniors instead of freshman. Eddie could still be a multi year senior to give off that mentor vibe to the kids.
THE STRANGER,He is a grown-ass man with a 1970‚Äôs little kid haircut and it‚Äôs the most disconcerting thing I‚Äôve seen on television in a long time.
THE STRANGER,"As a fan I never harbor any sort of 'sucks that the little kid grew up' feelings. 

Shit happened to me, too. Just stick with your craft and before you know it you won't be 13 anymore."
THE STRANGER,I feel like the time between the seasons didn't matter. They easily could have had the characters grow with the actors and it wouldn't have changed anything. Them being freshman or seniors in high-school wouldn't have changed much other than writing a way to bring the older kids back in to the plot from college.
THE STRANGER,"Oh man, what a concept, people age‚Ä¶ I wonder if they could have accounted for that in the story?"
THE STRANGER,"The story is in no way tied to a specific year, just make the gaps longer and have the characters the same age...

I get that people love the 80s again and you want to stick with that, but it's the show that made that happen, not the other way around.

Tell a good story in the 90s and people will watch and love the 90s too."
THE STRANGER,Am I mistaken or was there a similar discussion about the Harry Potter cast and how they were starting to look way older than they should have?
THE STRANGER,I guess that's why other shows keep casting young looking 22yo actors as high schoolers.
THE STRANGER,The teen characters are hitting their midlife more like it.
THE STRANGER,They should have produced faster then
THE STRANGER,That‚Äôs what happens when you work with child stars and pandemic happens.
THE STRANGER,"Will‚Äôs haircut made me cringe EVERY TIME I saw it.  It‚Äôs like they were lampshading his age.

Hmmmm, maybe it‚Äôs symbolic that his haircut looked like a lampshade?"
THE STRANGER,"Maybe the writers should have planned for that possibility‚Ä¶ 

But what do I know"
THE STRANGER,All I can imagine now is they are going to be pumping child actors with drugs that halt or delay puberty
THE STRANGER,It‚Äôs like the Harry Potter movies. For a while I thought Daniel Radcliffe might be around 37 by the time the last one of those came out.
THE STRANGER,When I hit puberty it hit back twice as hard
THE STRANGER,I just want more 90s shows and movies.
THE STRANGER,No one to blame but them for taking so long between seasons.
THE STRANGER,Don't cast prepubescent kids if you're not going to be happy about puberty happening
THE STRANGER,then write faster bitches.
THE STRANGER,"How do you not plan for this when casting 12 year olds in a show that‚Äôs going to run for multiple seasons? I get not being able to account for Covid but write around it. 

‚ÄúOh no! Who could have foreseen these teenagers growing rapidly around the ages of 13-19!‚Äù

I remember watching an interview with Joe Keery (Steve) where he was saying that the kids are just his regular coworkers now, Gaten (Dustin) drives him to work sometimes."
THE STRANGER,So they punished them with those haircuts?  I was alive then. No one looked like that!
THE STRANGER,What an idiot. Just add a cut scene that says three years later and no one will know the differences
THE STRANGER,"The fault here is with Netflix and the writers, not with something natural that has been happening since humans existed and therefor something they should have planned for better since it was going to happen lol If Netflix didn't take so long to renew it, and the writers take so long to write it (like, this has been going on for years, why haven't they wrote the whole show yet?) and took so long for production to actually start... if they'd have renewed it for 2-3 seasons at once then they could have written and filmed it closer together to avoid the drastic maturing of the actors. COVID was something they couldn't help, but if they had done everything faster, Hopper probably would've been kidnapped by then and the age could've been explained with a time jump, or if they'd have gotten to the story now, they could have used a time jump to explain the change in between the opening of the gates and all their battling and season 5 is the culmination."
THE STRANGER,"The show isn't based on any book, and I don't get the obsession with the 80s and how they can't leave it.

Just seems like Netflix saw [Children + 80s nostalgia = Profit] and never want to change it."
THE STRANGER,The showrunners fuck up big time by no allowing the characters have the same age of their actors.
THE STRANGER,That haircut is ridiculous
THE STRANGER,Know what I was ‚Äújust not loving?‚Äù Then getting rid of Eddie after we all became huge fans of his while keeping Johnathan who hasn‚Äôt done anything for 2 seasons.
THE STRANGER,This kid really likes talking.
THE STRANGER,Teenagers have aged over the past 6 years: more at 11.
THE STRANGER,Maybe do a time-jump to the actors‚Äô IRL ages instead of committing to the unconvincing assertion that these people are in their early teens for nostalgia points?
THE STRANGER,stupid fucking teenagers getting older. Can nobody act anymore‚Ä¶
THE STRANGER,*directors were 'just not loving it' when he and his costars hit puberty AND LOOKED INCREDIBLY WEIRD. lol You know if they got lucky and the cast still looked right for the roles after aging a little they would have no issue.
THE STRANGER,Should've thought about shooting it back to back
THE STRANGER,An absolutely rational gripe to have with child actors! /s
THE STRANGER,That‚Äôs the thing about kids.   They grow up.
THE STRANGER,What did they expect though? Can they math? Parently not.
THE STRANGER,Saw an interview with the main cast and Duffer Brothers around season 1. The Duffer Brothers spoke to the actors (kids at the time) like shit. Can imagine they gave them a hard time for this too.
THE STRANGER,I mean. Seasons 2 and 4 were 5 years apart. What did they think would happen?
THE STRANGER,"Director: ‚Äúcould you like, just not please?‚Äù"
THE STRANGER,"So glad you hit puberty, you‚Äôre getting the mushroom head haircut. You‚Äôre the awkward one now."
THE STRANGER,"While interesting, so what? They are actors and actresses. So act."
THE STRANGER,That is something pretty noticeable in the new season. The kids are nearly fully physically mature and being asked to play 2-3 years younger than they are
THE STRANGER,We‚Äôll some kids do hit puberty much early than others. I was shaving before I got to the 8th grade.
THE STRANGER,oh Schnapp
THE STRANGER,"Seriously how old are they even suppose to be by now?

Cause whatever age it is, the actors are not believable as being that young"
THE STRANGER,What the fuck kind of title is this?
THE STRANGER,Shouldn't have taken a filming break then. It seems pretty obvious to me that if you're making multiple seasons of a show  with kids and they need to remain certain ages then you film consecutively.
THE STRANGER,"It always seems to come as a surprise to filmmakers that kids grow up. They literally knew this would happen, but still took _years_ to film season four. I know the pandemic happened, but plenty of things were still filmed during it. It only caused a few months of complete stand-still.

Same thing happened to His Dark Materials. They filmed the first two books back to back, but took _years_ to get to the third book. Especially Dafne Keen is suddenly going to look _way_ too old, for a story that is supposed to be just an immediate continuation. And that is worse, because the entire point of that story is growing up and coming of age.

But still the producers will apparently be surprisedpikachuface.gif when Dafne Keen suddenly looks like an adult woman playing a thirteen year-old."
THE STRANGER,Shouldve pulled a LOTR after how successful the first season was ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
THE STRANGER,GET THIS CHILD A NEW HAIRCUT
THE STRANGER,They were 12 in the first episode. That‚Äôs when puberty happens for most kids.
THE STRANGER,Then they should have filmed and released a new season every 8-10months instead.  Not 2-3 years like they are doing now
THE STRANGER,Gotta hate when  time itself doesn't adhere to your plans.
THE STRANGER,Well‚Ä¶ what the hell did they expect half a decade to do to the cast?
THE STRANGER,Mike‚Äôs gonna have a beard by the time Season 5 comes out.
THE STRANGER,Especially when Max is at least 20 lol
THE STRANGER,Why is his hair cut like that?
Night on Earth,"I‚Äôm glad to see Netflix carrying on the torch of  producing BBC like nature documentaries. 

It‚Äôs weird hearing an American narrate such a documentary though (as a Brit, it‚Äôs always been Attenborough or the likes of David Tennant), but no issues from me after watching this trailer."
Night on Earth,"For anyone wondering, the narrator is Samira Wiley from Orange is the New Black and Handmaid's Tale."
Night on Earth,"I highly recommend getting high and watching this on a 65‚Äù OLED, like I‚Äôm doing right now."
Night on Earth,I thought i was going to hear  David Attenborough‚Äôs voice!
Night on Earth,POG
Night on Earth,This makes me really want an oled tv
Night on Earth,Any one know how they filmed this or what camera they used ?
Night on Earth,That looks very good!
Night on Earth,Anyone else just imagining how great this is going to look in HDR on their OLED??
Night on Earth,"> I‚Äôm glad to see Netflix carrying on the torch of producing BBC like nature documentaries. 

You say that as if the BBC has stopped.

>It‚Äôs weird hearing an American narrate such a documentary though (as a Brit, it‚Äôs always been Attenborough or the likes of David Tennant)

And you say that as if no one has ever made a nature documentary series before the BBC. :)"
Night on Earth,Don't forget Paul Mcgann.
Night on Earth,poussey?
Night on Earth,yep
Night on Earth,">	You say that as if the BBC has stopped.

No, I never said that, you just assumed it. Moreover, the future of the BBC is more uncertain now, so I do wonder if they will continue to produce as many nature documentaries, if for example they loose licence fee funding.

>	And you say that as if no one has ever made a nature documentary series before the BBC. :)

Again, I never said that, you just assumed it. 

Personally, I‚Äôve rarely ever seen consistent high quality nature documentaries outside of the BBC on television. We have the Discovery Channel here in the UK, but the nature documentaries there are not as well produced/shot.

The closest thing I remember to BBC nature documentaries was Sky doing a collaboration with David Attenborough a few years ago. Hence why I‚Äôm glad to see Netflix going in this direction."
Night on Earth,">No, I never said that, you just assumed it.

Which is a perfectly fair, completely justified assumption given your use of the idiom  'carrying on the torch'. 

Why do you suppose it's a singular torch? Why do you suppose it's carrying *on*?"
Night on Earth,"Except that carrying on the torch does not signify something has ‚Äústopped‚Äù or implies the present, but rather that something may stop or reduce in the future, which perhaps may be the case for the BBC should its funding be radically changed."
Night on Earth,"What you have sought to imply does not match the choice of idiom; this is usually used when someone has died. 

Please give me a semantic explanation for how the phrase relates to 'something that may stop or reduce in the future'? 

'Carrying on' = 'carrying on /from/' = implies a finite work or action on the part of the BBC. 
'The torch' = singular, implies a body of work. 

The imagery is fairly simple - a relay race, with one runner passing the torch to another. There's no ""hey Bob, get another torch lest the Tories snuff mine out."""
Night on Earth,"You really are being unnecessarily nit picky for the sake of just arguing, the guy didn't mean anything bad or sinister nor was he wrong. Way to go to derail ones excitement."

Night on Earth,Colin looked legitimately heartbroken. :(
Night on Earth,"Her sketch with Bill Hader as her old boyfriend ""Boris"" is probably one of my favorite sketches they've done."
Night on Earth,Anyone noticed she finally got that damn cigarette lit on Weekend Update?!
Night on Earth,"Strong:

>Ten and a half years ago I got my dream job. The first actual work day I tried to be very cool and make it look like I knew what I was doing and I was supposed to be there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI left that night around 11 after saying goodbye to everyone. I got stuck wandering around the building because none of the elevators went to the first floor and I was trying so hard to avoid having to go back upstairs to ask for help because I‚Äôd already said goodbye!!!‚Äù

>I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been a little quiet about it publicly. I didn‚Äôt want the extra pressure on something already so emotional for me, and I‚Äôm so grateful I got to have these wonderful past six shows to help me ease into it and get to meet and laugh and probably overly hug Molly, Marcello, Devon, and Michael who I think are not only brilliantly funny but really great humans. I am ready to go, but I‚Äôll always know home is here. I‚Äôve had the time of my life working with the greatest people on earth."

Night on Earth,"So bummed to see her go, I‚Äôve got such a crush on Cecily. She‚Äôs immensely talented and I love her confidence. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll land some quality roles outside of SNL."
Night on Earth,"sucks to see her go - especially with all the other departures, it was like ""well at least they still have Kenan and Cecily""

oops."
Night on Earth,"My wife and I quote the original Blue River Dog Food sketch daily. 
It‚Äôs perfect and she‚Äôs perfect in it."
Night on Earth,"Cecily Strong and Kate McKinnon are two of SNL's greatest performers. Both could do practically any character in any sketch.

Next in Fashion,"I am by no means the fashion reality tv show demographic. But this show was really good. I liked that it didn't have much of the normal competition reality show BS like ""And now you'll have to make lace by hand but only using materials found in this garbage can.""  
I like Tan from Queer Eye. I thought the talent of the competitors was pretty good. And while I didn't care for Alexa Chung, apparently she's knowledgeable, at least according to what I read about her.  
I really hope this gets picked up somewhere else."
Next in Fashion,"I'm kinda surprised. It was well received, had big name fashion guest judges and the hosts were good.


It's possible it was a bit pricey though."
Next in Fashion,"Hunh. It was a really good watch., and surprisingly wholesome. Maybe too pricey? It was received well too I think"
Next in Fashion,boo :/ I really enjoyed this
Next in Fashion,"It was a nice show, but I absolutely hated the teams idea. They said in the beginning that it wouldn't be this way forever, so I kept waiting for then to drop it and for us to see their works individually, and it just didn't happen until it was way too late."
Next in Fashion,"Damn, this was actually a really good competition show. That talent was really impressive."
Next in Fashion,"I felt like it was trying to be a modern Project Runway, yet failed. Came off too cheesy."
Next in Fashion,[deleted]
Next in Fashion,Damn. This one was the best out of the three available. Really bummed to hear this.
Next in Fashion,"I hated the teams. Way too unfair. I also thought they were bias. The 2 LA guys were told they needed to stop making everythig LA fashion style when there was a Brooklyn guy doing that and  Minju and Angel had the same look every challenge. Minjus and Angel could not get away from oversized clothing, boxy dresses, big pants thats are too long to walk in. They all had that asian feel and never changed. All the other contestants had to switch up their style but Angel and Minju did the same stuff and were praised for it. I think they were great designers but they both struggled with making designs that were outside of their usual aesthetic. 

&#x200B;

Daniel carried"
Next in Fashion,"I‚Äôm not surprised, the clothes of who won were absolutely ridiculous, but it was entertaining"
Next in Fashion,Bummer. I enjoyed this one.
Next in Fashion,"That guy in the pic supposed to be a KKK member?

...oh its a ghost?"
Next in Fashion,Since I have been tracking Netflix shows I predicted this would be cancelled. Well this one was successful but gentefied prediction was wrong
Next in Fashion,"Yeah, it was good. Closer in feeling to the Bake-off format than to the Project Runway/ANTM format."
Next in Fashion,"agreed. there was also the perfect amount of backstory for the contestants. they would have like 1 minutes of ""here is where they're from and what they've done"" and then immediately go back to the actual competition. i was almost blown away by how little backstory there was, and it was so refreshing."
Next in Fashion,"It's possible that there are some behind-the-scenes issues that couldn't be resolved.   I haven't heard anything but if it was relatively well received and there were no budgeting issues, behind-the-scenes drama would be my next guess."
Next in Fashion,"not their show, they are on Amazon prime"
Next in Fashion,Wrong show I think. Tim and Heidi are on an Amazon show with a different name.
Next in Fashion,Minju? Her work was incredible! Like walking abstract paintings.
Next in Fashion,DON'T YOU DARE DISRESPECT MINJU!
Next in Fashion,I think they really went too far trying to be inclusive by having a klansman as a judge.
Next in Fashion,I think in this Covid world it would be difficult to produce a show like this with international designers
Next in Fashion,"My wife was watching it so I caught a few episodes here and there, but the criteria for judging were really flip-floppy.

One time before a decision, the judges were debating and someone said that X's outfits were just not sellable and wouldn't make people want to actually wear them IRL. 

And then the very next episode, with the underwear challenge, the Minju and Angel team pulls out [this fucking thing](https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/next-in-fashion-underwear-angel-minju.jpg?quality=80&). *Toootally* what people think of when wanting to buy **UNDERWEAR**.

I agreed with my wife that this was the moment they should've left the competition."
Next in Fashion,this dude did such a good job in Rush that whenever I see his pic I start hearing his Lauda quotes in my head.
Next in Fashion,He is an amazing actor.
Next in Fashion,What a strange property for Disney. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd put it under a different brand.  Maybe Disney needs to resurrect the Touchstone label as a subchannel.
Next in Fashion,This sounds extremely weird. Especially with how horrible of a person Lagerfeld was.
Next in Fashion,"Cool, he's a great actor, and these famous fashion weirdos make for excellent biopic material. For example the mini serie Halston with Ewan McGregor is excellent."
Next in Fashion,This does not sound like a D+ series at all lmao
Next in Fashion,Daniel is like the go to guy for any german character in Hollywood movies.
Next in Fashion,"Man, these Star Wars shows get weirder and weirder."
Next in Fashion,"If choupette isn‚Äôt featured in this heavily, it‚Äôs a failure."
Next in Fashion,I want more Alienist!!!
Next in Fashion,"Calling it now: At the end of the first episode he ties his hair back und puts on the glasses while dramatic music is playing. Black out, credits roll."
Next in Fashion,"Americans idea of Disney+ is so weird, think they need to fix their marketing over there or something."
Next in Fashion,"He‚Äôs a great actor, I hope it ends up being a great roll for him"
Next in Fashion,"I hope it covers his award deserving performance as Fabu, the villain in [Totally Spies!: The Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totally_Spies!_The_Movie)."
Next in Fashion,It‚Äôs amazing that his father is Dr Steve Bruhl (Brule) and they‚Äôre both so talented.
Next in Fashion,"Daniel Bruhl is an amazing actor.
No american actor could become Karl Lagerfeld imho."
Next in Fashion,who?
Next in Fashion,I have no idea who either of those people are
Next in Fashion,Rush was such a good movie thanks to this guy.
Next in Fashion,I feel better about my eyes now
Next in Fashion,I saw him in the alienist. great actor!
Next in Fashion,"He was incredible in goodbye, Lenin. Still my favorite movie after all these years."
Next in Fashion,He was good in‚Äù All Quiet On the Western Front‚Äùtoo.
Next in Fashion,dude will have to speak really fast
Next in Fashion,"Ah yes, the designer who said he would die if he ever saw a fat person wearing his fashions. Fuck him, rot in hell."
Next in Fashion,it's a shitbox!
Next in Fashion,"That was one of those movies I was expecting basically nothing from as I'm not much into racing, ended up catching on cable at some point, and absolutely loved.  Such fantastic performances, especially from Bruhl."
Next in Fashion,"If you want more of that, watch Burnt"
Next in Fashion,The dude spent time with Nikki to get the accent right. He said it is the most difficult for a german to get a good Austrian dialect right. Daniel is one of the greatest actors right now but isn't prominent in Hollywood.
Next in Fashion,That‚Äôs funny. I only hear the quiet ones.
Next in Fashion,‚ÄúA wise man learns more from his enemies than a fool from his friends‚Ä¶‚Äù  one of my favorite quotes ever
Next in Fashion,I didn‚Äôt appreciate how great his performance was until I watched interviews with Lauda afterwards. He absolutely nailed it.
Next in Fashion,‚ÄúShake and Bake‚Äù
Next in Fashion,[deleted]
Next in Fashion,It's commissioned by Disney+ France so it's probably a Hulu show in the US
Next in Fashion,"Disney++? Agreed though. Disney should absorb Hulu, like it apparently does outside the US, and create a sub-channel for grownup content, old and new."
Next in Fashion,"While it was filmed prior to Fox's acquisition by Disney, Disney distributed JoJo Rabbit."
Next in Fashion,Why is Disney not allowed to do prestige shows?
Next in Fashion,I can't wait for Disney to inevitably fold Hulu into D+ when Comcast is bought out so Americans can finally experience the magic that is international Disney+ with Star.
Next in Fashion,well so was Tony Soprano and the Sopranos is considered one the best if not thee best tv show ever
Next in Fashion,"Halston was ok, McGregor is great, but when Ryan Murphy is involved it feels like a paint by numbers drama."
Next in Fashion,"So I read the article, it‚Äôs being made for Disney+France. They don‚Äôt have Hulu there so it‚Äôs probably an adult series that will premiere on the adult version of Disney+ in Europe and people in the United States will get it on Hulu"
Next in Fashion,"Well he an waltz, depending if you need an old or young german guy."
Next in Fashion,"Why is it weird? The content that the rest of the world sees on Disney+ is not on Disney+ in America, it's on Hulu. It would be weird to market it for things that aren't on there. The idea and marketing are fully accurate to what Disney+ is in America. Hulu cannot be merged as of yet as they won't be able to buy out the whole thing until next year at the earliest.


We see it differently because it is completely different in America."
Next in Fashion,*whomst'd've'ly'yaint'nt'ed'ies's'y'es
Next in Fashion,One is among Germany‚Äôs most famous actors and the other was one of the most well known fashion designers in human history.
Next in Fashion,"You can't say that, it's a Ferrari"
Next in Fashion,Totally agree.
Next in Fashion,I understand that reference.
Next in Fashion,"This exactly. Pam & Tommy was advertised in Australia as a Disney+ Star show, on the posters, online, everything, even though it's a Hulu show. Something like The Bear is still advertised as FX even though it's on Disney+"
Next in Fashion,"Let‚Äôs see what happens after Comcast sells their share of Hulu next year (if they do). If that happens, Disney 100% owns Hulu then, and we can only hope the two services will merge together."
Next in Fashion,Soprano is a fictional character. Lagerfeld is not.
Next in Fashion,Sopranos wasn‚Äôt on Disney+
Next in Fashion,Waltz is Austrian though
Next in Fashion,Fashion and Germany are things I know least about lol
Next in Fashion,"That would be great, but Bob Iger seems open to selling Hulu. Probably to stanch the bleeding on Disney+, which is still wildly unprofitable, like all the other streamers that aren‚Äôt Netflix"
Next in Fashion,so youve seen the scripts and know tone of show.
Next in Fashion,"if it's always sunny in philadelphia ,  pam and tommy and The Hills Have Eyes can be on disney+, so could something like Sopranos."
Next in Fashion,"True, but close enough."
Next in Fashion,"and German. Although he was born in Austria, he grew up an lives in Germany and he has only had Austrian citizenship since 2011
Edit: and his father is German"
Next in Fashion,Ugh. My hope for even minimal consolidation of the streamers continues to be dashed.
Next in Fashion,"If they do sell Hulu, I imagine it'll primarily come down to the brand.  I'd be surprised if they continued to develop a lot of content for a platform they have no ownership stake in when they have a perfectly good service with over 100 million subscribers to use.  Not sure what they'll do with Disney+ as they still seem hesitant to develop adult-oriented content on the service in America though."
Next in Fashion,Not the point. A show about a fictional mobster who never actually caused harm is whatever. Karl Lagerfeld was legitimately a terrible person who did lasting damage to other very real people. He should not be celebrated and his life story can fade into obscurity.
Next in Fashion,"> The Hills Have Eyes can be on disney+

Is that some kind of pixar animated short with cutesy personified hills?"
Next in Fashion,"So annoying, right? Like, how are Paramount Network, Paramount+, and Showtime all separate? I get Pluto TV being its own thing, but the other 3 should be merged"
Next in Fashion,I‚Äôve never even heard of Paramount Network!
Next in Fashion,"Pretty surreal we have 2 60ep series and a 2 hour movie that all take place in the same universe and it turned out as incredible as it did. Vince, Peter & Co deserve all the praise"
Next in Fashion,That scene with Walter talking about time travel ‚ÄúSTAY IN YOUR FUCKING LANE‚Äù lol
Next in Fashion,"I like Mike‚Äôs answer he gave about the time machine. 
Instead of saying the day his son died, he said the day he took his first bribe.  Indicating he wanted to fix the root of the problem instead of just saving his son.
Great writing"
Next in Fashion,Kim and Jimmy's relationship was what made the show so great for me. Such a sad ending but a fitting one as well.
Next in Fashion,*finger guns*
Next in Fashion,"Beautiful finale. Loved it‚Äôs message

You can never go back, but you can always change the path you‚Äôre on. 

It‚Äôs never too late to change. It can be the most difficult thing one can do, but also just as rewarding. It‚Äôs always worth it. To the people you care about and to yourself"
Next in Fashion,Now who are we gonna call? ‚úäüòî
Next in Fashion,Walt telling Saul ‚Äúso you‚Äôve always been this way‚Äù was such a perfect and heartbreaking summation of Jimmy‚Äôs story.
Next in Fashion,"I wasn't expecting the theme of the show to hit me that hard, but what Better Call Saul (and it's predecessor) really came down to was how one navigates regret. The recurring motif of the time machine, and the last lone bit of color in the show's bleak black and white world fundamentally shook me in a way I wasn't anticipating.  

Both of these shows have been genius in different ways, but in the end, it wasn't about the cartel or the explosions or any of that. It was about the million little decisions that lead us to becoming who we become. Thank you so much to the crew of both of these shows. You've given me a lot to think about for a long time."
Next in Fashion,"I was hoping it would end with the shot of them smoking the cigarette, because that was almost perfect. Then Kim walked out of prison. 

I wonder if Marie still wears purple‚Ä¶"
Find Yourself,If the show is engaging I'll watch til the end. Usually abandon it towards the beginning if I don't find it engaging. But rarely flip between shows.
Find Yourself,I pretty much finish everything I watch unless it's just bad
Find Yourself,"All the time. In the past week alone i started and stopped Colony, The OA, Woman of the Dead and shockingly, Peaky Blinders. :( I ‚Äúfinished‚Äù Ozark in about 30m, flipping through.

After long hours at work I just can't summon the energy to work through 10 20 30 episodes if the experience is not excellent throughout (which is unreasonable to expect from a long series). So i watch mainly films instead, with the occasional limited series.

this is why i created a post just now about Breaking Bad/Saul. Don't wanna ruin a masterpiece."
Find Yourself,"I have dozens of shows I started then stopped because it wasn‚Äôt interesting to me anymore. I can be 8 seasons deep and just give up, even if I only have 1 more season to go. My mum is the complete opposite where she has to know what happens and will finish a show she now hates just for the ending"
Find Yourself,I stop when a show becomes boring or (I have a rule about this) if they bring a character back to life after killing them off.
Find Yourself,"I try to finish stuff so rarely. From what I observe from friends, coworkers and family, they do it a lot. When I talk about shows I‚Äôm watching with friends and coworkers it‚Äôs usually ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only on season X‚Äù, you might even get a ‚ÄúI should catch up‚Äù. My families on deck or continue watching is full of incomplete shows. They like the shows but because more shows come out or even other entrainment is available it becomes competition for time. They prioritize what really interests them which can be even YouTube.

It‚Äôs likely why Netflix will cancel a show for lack of completion after 28 days. It‚Äôs the peak viewership window and if it‚Äôs declining severely already it probably doesn‚Äôt bode well. I‚Äôm sure there are people that do take their time or do come back and finish later but it‚Äôs likely in the minority. If it‚Äôs not entraining enough for people to prioritize when they are in the middle of it, most probably won‚Äôt come back to it later. They will probably forget and even if they remember probably prioritize something that interests them more."
Find Yourself,"I do it probably half the time with Netflix shows.

Other services I tend to plow through them."
Find Yourself,"Sometimes I stopped when a scene is too cringey to watch, then I move on to another show."
Find Yourself,"I just stopped House of Cards at the end of S3 (0 interest in the plot at this point, hate Frank and everyone around him). I didn't used to drop shows as much but recently I've been more ruthless and if a show doesn't grab me quickly it's up for the chop. No point watching something that's boring or annoying me.

Sometimes I'll give a show another chance because I just wasn't in the right mood when I first watched it (Station Eleven for example)"
Find Yourself,I stopped and started Bojack Horseman 3 times before it stuck and maaaaaan am I glad I did. I had been starting it when I was tired or phone distracted and needed to pay a little more attention to understand the tone and then I was hooked.
Find Yourself,Bojack. I consider it one of the absolute best shows of all time but I was in a rougher/darker place in my life when I finished the show. Life is better now and I‚Äôm worried if I watch it again it just won‚Äôt resonate with me in the same way and it‚Äôll change how I feel about the show.
Find Yourself,"Stargate SG-1. Such great memories of it as a kid, and I did rewatch it all about 12 years ago, but there are lots of shows I‚Äôve never seen that still want to watch so I prioritise those."
Find Yourself,"A lot of older shows such as Smallville, Lost, Bleach etc. because there just too many episodes."
Find Yourself,"I watched breaking bad again and it's still as good but at the end i hated walter more as the first watch. i also watched lost again with the extented ending and still loved it. Shows i want to re watch but not anytime soon: the leftovers, the americans, battlestar galactica, 24."
Find Yourself,Sopranos. We're Italians from North Jersey and knew most of the locations. I loved watching it each week. I'd call my grandmother and we'd discuss the episode immediately after. Now Grandma is gone and my wife hasn't shown any interest. It's not as fun watching alone.
Find Yourself,"If it helps, I've seen Breaking Bad twice. On the first viewing, I **hated** Skylar and I thought she was just completely unreasonable, unlikeable, annoying and the worst part of the show.

On the second viewing, not only could I tolerate Skylar but I was actually on her side - you realise that she's a victim and by the end of the series, Walt is basically a domestic abuser and gaslighter.

Growing up is realising that Skylar was right."
Find Yourself,"Rectify - such a great and underrated show, that takes it's time and doesn't rush anything, it's slow but in a good way. But the whole story of, is the main character guilty of the crimes he was in prison for? Doesn't make it the easiest watch."
Find Yourself,I am always on the edge of rewatching all of Doctor Who. I used to constantly rewatch but it‚Äôs been a long time. I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the Chibnall run and it kind of killed the excitement for me. I do however listen to the music or watch clips whenever I get the itch and have a little weep during the work day. Tentatively excited about the future of the show
Find Yourself,"The West Wing. Absolutely amazing show, amazing actors - but politics have changed so much that its too much of a suspension of disbelief now. Everyone in it wants to at least try to compromise."
Find Yourself,Dark. It takes a lot of concentration to follow and a second watch won't have any of the mystery of watching it the first time.
Find Yourself,"The Wire. Haven't seen it in widescreen, much less hi def. It's been my favourite show since first viewing. I've tried to rewatch it a few times, but I just can't. Not that it really matters, the only thing that's changed is that now everybody uses mobile phones. Among other reasons, that's one that make it too depressing after all these years. None of the underlying social issues have changed. Well at least for the better. We Own This City Was apt belated sequel to The Wire."
Find Yourself,"Lost I've been meaning to rewatch for the last couple of years. Lost was the first television show as a teenager that truly grabbed me like no other television show or fictional media did up to that point. I would flick through channels and watch a random episode of whatever held my interest as a child. But then I rarely thought about it after. But with Lost I became engrossed and couldn't wait until the next episode. I am obviously older and have seen arguably better shows that were arguably more consistent and maybe arguably had better endings, and I acknowledge Lost isn't a perfect show, but I still remember that feeling at the time I was watching something special that changed how I viewed television or fiction in general. There is an overwhelmingly amount of great TV, old and new, that sucks me in, and I guess whenever I say I want to rewatch a show I always have the urge to start a new show, especially a six season 20+ episode show like Lost. Sometimes there is exceptions, as I'm currently rewatching Star Trek: The Original Series (although I'm mostly rewatching the best and most fun episodes since it is episodic and there is inconsequential/bad episodes you could skip, but I of course recommend watching them on first watch) and plan to rewatch Star Trek: The Next Generation next (again rewatching the best and most fun episodes). Maybe I'll finally get that urge to rewatch Lost soon."
Find Yourself,I‚Äôd love to rewatch lost but it‚Äôs like 122 hours or something. It‚Äôs just too many episodes.
Find Yourself,Well I just binged BCS and am about to start my BB rewatch!   For me though it‚Äôs the wire
Find Yourself,[deleted]
Find Yourself,"Person of Interest. It's such a great show (possibly my favorite show, and I'm still surprised that something that inventive and well-written was on CBS), but I don't have time to rewatch 103 episodes when my to-watch list is full of stuff I haven't seen."
Find Yourself,Game of Thrones. I want so bad to go back and rewatch up to season 6 and then forget the rest exists!
Find Yourself,Boardwalk Empire. I keep saying I‚Äôm going to go back and rewatch it but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been saying that for about five years now.
Find Yourself,The breaks between Ozark seasons were so long. I know I enjoyed the first season but I forgot everything andI'm somehow never in the mood or have the time to finish episode 1.
Find Yourself,NYPD Blue. I'm satisfied just watching the clips that some person puts up on YouTube.
Find Yourself,"The Shield, Criminal Minds, American Gods first two seasons."
Find Yourself,"""I despise Skylar, Walt Jnr and Marie""

Mmm hmm."
Find Yourself,The Knick.
Find Yourself,There‚Äôs no reason to despise Skyler.
Find Yourself,Three's Company. I don't because it is not on any of the 5/6 prominent streamers.
Find Yourself,"the only show i ever wanted to rewatch and actually did a few times is battlestar galactica.

i rewatched part of rome, but ended up giving up."
Find Yourself,"Prison Break, I was watching it on and off when I was a teen,, was very interesting, I remember really loving 1st 3 seasons, 4th felt a bit too much, double agent double crossing everything and everyone, this and that, I started suspecting my dog of being a government agent ffs

Then I remember watching reruns of s1 religiously every. Night on tv around 2016 or 2017 maybe, my god this amazing I thought, just a nicely done season

so I decided to watch it all again, binged it all in like 10 days, amazing show, season 1 is incredible, 10/10 for me, season 2 is great too but not a 10,season 3 was... alright but could've been handled better, season 4 i couldn't finish normally, I had to put it either on 1.25 or 1.5 speed tbh, come on, it's over the top with what I mentioned above

I wanted to rewatch it again for the 3rd time idk why, maybe after seeing season 5 but I thought better not, season 5 wasn't bad it just was written a little eh in most episodes plus I realised that Lincoln, while yes being framed sucks, but if he just died instead Michael breaking him out, so many fucking lives wouldn't be ruined, from Robin to his son and ex wife and so many other people, 1 innocent life was saved by the price of so many"
Find Yourself,"Battlestar Galactica. I loved that show so much when it was on, and I have been meaning to go back and watch it again for years but never have. I have no real reason, just always ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get to it soon.‚Äù"
Find Yourself,As annoying as Skylar is I found myself sympathizing with her much more the second time through. Walt is a total scumbag throughout. Great show.
Find Yourself,"To be fair, I don‚Äôt think breaking bad has as much rewatch value as the other premier tv shows of it‚Äôs time. It is really plot focused and relies a lot on suspense and action, and once you know what‚Äôs going to happen it‚Äôs not as compelling. I loved it the first time I watched it, but when I rewatched it I just wasn‚Äôt as in to it."
Find Yourself,"ER. Great show and the first few seasons are some of the best cable tv shows of all time, but once I start to rewatch a show, I need to finish it and 300+ episodes seems to be a larger commitment than I'm willing to give again."
Find Yourself,"How to get away with murder 

I love the first two seasons but after the third season it got really incestuous and made me uncomfortable towards the end. 

I wouldn't say favorite but Pretty Little Liars. I've tried rewatching it but can never get past the second episode."
Find Yourself,"Rescue Me,
Tenchi Universe"
Find Yourself,I put off re-watching Black Sails because I loved it so much and didn't want to notice any flaws the second time. Recently started it and it's still fantastic thankfully
Find Yourself,The Wire. Problem is there is too much good television.
Find Yourself,"I cant rewatch DS9 as many times as I'd like, the time commitment is too big for my schedule"
Find Yourself,Breaking Bad because of the runtime.
Find Yourself,"Mr Robot, I was 20 when I started watching it in 2018, I thought it was cool at the time but I'm afraid it might come up as edgy now.

On the other side I've watched breaking bad 2 times in less than 1 year and I'm planning to watch it again soon."
Find Yourself,"It's Breaking Bad for me too. It's probably in my top 5 shows in terms of writing quality, but I just can't bring myself to rewatch it, even though it's been quite a while now"
Find Yourself,If the show has characters that you hate that much it's doing something right. They bother you so much it's in your head. Watch the damn show again already. You don't want Heisenberg thinking you're soft.
Find Yourself,The X Files and Lost....currently watching Young Indiana Jones and will continue ER and then will switch to X Files
Find Yourself,"Black Adder. Watched it endlessly as a kid, haven't seen it in a decade."
Find Yourself,Scrubs. The sad episodes are too much
Find Yourself,Lost
Find Yourself,"I got a few:

**True Detective, Season One** \- I think it's one of the best seasons of television ever made, EXCEPT for the ending - where this cartoonishly evil redneck/hillbilly villain comes out of nowhere and just ruins the whole thing."
Find Yourself,Daredevil. I don't like Foggy and Karen.
Find Yourself,"Same reasons as you for not rewatching BB: Skyler, Walt Jr and Marie. Ugh! I can‚Äôt rewatch Sopranos because of Tony‚Äôs wife and kids. Insufferable.

I‚Äôve only seen Lost once, and keep planning to go back and watch, but I still haven‚Äôt."
Find Yourself,"Game of thrones.

Doesn't matter how amazing the first four seasons are, I know the series goes to shit later on and the buildup is all for nothing."
Find Yourself,I dont think ill be able to watch Handmaids Tale again. Its just too depressing.
Find Yourself,"Some exceptions here, but anime with much more than 70-80ish episodes sadly."
Find Yourself,One piece. It's just so LONG
Find Yourself,Pretty much any network shows over 4 seasons. I don't have the stamina to binge 100+ episodes anymore. There's just too many choices and not enough time these days.
Find Yourself,"I think is The Office US, It has some very hilarious scenes, but I can't stand all that bullying and belittlement that happens quite often.

For the same reason ""How I Met Your Mother"", I despite Ted (too self centered) and Marshall (redneck) and all that bullying they do to Barney, which in my opinion, is the character that drives all this series"
Find Yourself,"I wanna rewatch Utopia UK because it is a short masterpiece that I watched almost ten years ago.

But I've never rewatched any show because there are too many interesting shows that I've never seen."
Find Yourself,"Honestly, it‚Äôs hard for me to rewatch any series at this stage in my life that‚Äôs not lighter in nature. It takes us a long time to get through more serious series and there‚Äôs just so much new stuff we have yet to watch, it‚Äôs hard to devote time to something we‚Äôve already seen. In a world with more time and less responsibilities, I‚Äôd love to rewatch Breaking Bad and Dexter."
Find Yourself,"I got through breaking bad a few times now - there‚Äôs always things I forgot about - probably since each watch there‚Äôs a phone in my hand 

But for me it has to be game of thrones - I can watch 1-4 easily some of 5 then never revisit 678 - it‚Äôs got to the point I don‚Äôt even want to watch any of it. And I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a fan of the new one"

Find Yourself,"Dark Matter, I'm still salty that it got cancelled."
Find Yourself,"Moonlighting, because I can't. It isn't streaming and Im not sure it got put onto dvds"
Find Yourself,"90210, I already for too many streaming channels, I‚Äôm not about to subscribe to Paramount Plus too"
Find Yourself,"Practically all of them lol because I've never rewatched a show before, including my most favorite ones.

But it's mainly because I don't have time to binge shows these days. I also have lots of shows on my backlog that I wanna start watching so I'd prioritize them first."
Find Yourself,Supernatural
Find Yourself,"The Bob Newhart Show, and a few others, because the sounds is so terrible and the laugh track so intrusive"
Find Yourself,"American Horror Story Season 2: Asylum.

30 Rock.

And The Leftovers Seasons 2-3.

Just never felt any immediate urge to rewatch those shows these days..."

Average breaking bad enjoyer"
Find Yourself,"Hmmm. There's probably several, but Justified comes to mind. I really enjoyed that show more than I had expected I would (binged it after it was released), and it's the show that got me back into drinking bourbon also, so the plan is to watch a few episodes while I am enjoying a glass of Four Roses or Old Forester. Oh , and Watchmen, Leftovers, and Tales From the Loop also."
Find Yourself,"The 100. I‚Äôve been meaning to restart it but just haven‚Äôt gotten around to it. I just finished Yellowjackets last week and that show kinda reminded me of The 100. 

I did recently rewatch the first 7 seasons of Charmed. Still have to finish the last season. It definitely reminded me of why I loved that show when I was younger."
Find Yourself,"A few years back I was going to do a blog review/recap thing while rewatching The Cosby Show for the first time in years. Never got around to it. Very glad I was too lazy to do that now. 

My FAVORITE tv show that I can't rewatch, though? Idk. Maybe Bojack Horseman? I want to rewatch it eventually but now I know what I'm in for and I'm just not ready for it. Also I don't have Netflix anymore and I'm gradually running out of free space on my computer for torrents."
Find Yourself,"The 100, because I didn't forget the story enough to make the rewatch enjoyable."
Find Yourself,Left overs
Find Yourself,I ripped through Fraiser in a few weeks and loved it. Haven't really watched any episodes since then
Find Yourself,Bb... The problem I don't have enough time to rewatch
Find Yourself,"Probably Game of Thrones. After reading Fire & Blood I'm super invested in that world again. 

I just haven't done it because getting through that many episodes is always a chore, no matter how you pace it and how good a show is."
Find Yourself,"Lost. I never finished it but have‚Äôt watched it for so long I‚Äôd need to start from the beginning.

It just seems a daunting task."
Find Yourself,"Yep, Breaking bad for me as well. There are too many slow episodes for me, and i know i'll eventually bail on it, so i just never start. But i know its a good one all the same."
Find Yourself,"One real sad part of the streaming wars is the overabundance of riches we as viewers have. I literally haven't been able to rewatch any of my favorite shows in the past 6-7 yrs. There's so much new and intriguing stuff on my watch list that I don't have time to go back. I haven't rewatched BrB since 2014. And I *loved* that show.

Same with Spartacus, Dark, GoT, Justice League Unlimited etc etc etc."
Find Yourself,The leftovers. I really want to rewatch it but I‚Äôm still procrastinating.
Find Yourself,"Oz. I've seen it several times and it was very fundamental prestige tv for me. I just can't sign up for the violence these days. There are many shows I loved at the time but I, or tv in general, or modern life in general, have moved on in some way."
Find Yourself,"Basically all of Star Trek.

I rewatched TNG earlier this year, and it took me like six months.

I just don't have that kind of time and energy to dedicate to DS9, Voyager, or the original series.  As much as I love them, if I watch them again, it'll be in 20-30 years when I retire."
Find Yourself,My favorite Sci fi IP. I'm still bummed universe was canceled.
Find Yourself,"kinda want to rewatch lost, but I'm never bored enough."
Find Yourself,"Every time I try to sit down and rewatch Lost, the mere thought of watching all of the flashbacks again tires me out."
Find Yourself,Have you seen better call Saul yet?
Find Yourself,I think a second watch of BB is necessary to make you realise that Walt was actually the bad guy since day one and he did it all for himself
Find Yourself,"It‚Äôs an awesome watch alone. And gets better with rewatch. 

I remember catching glimpses as a kid when my parents would watch and only waiting for the violence. 


Then I got older and watched and appreciated it so much more, for so much more."
Find Yourself,"I rewatch every year, so far I've seen the whole show 7 times and i love e every minute of it, back to back with the wire and Boardwalk Empire"
Find Yourself,"Sorry to hear you lost a cool G-ma. I feel like I had nothing of value in common with mine. I loved her by default, and she was an amazing woman. Wicked smart, and quick witted with her mostly rightfully spiteful tongue. Though i mostly found out about her acts of courage and advocacy after she died. 

But I won't doubt that she was a cold and abusive toward her children, and remained silent about her husband absolutely disgusting means of disciplining the four children they raised in a small three bedder in a judgmental shithole of a town back in the 60's. When 'interracial' marriage was heavily frowned upon and most people had nothing better to do that worry about whether their neighbours were conforming to the social standards of the day. 

My other G-ma, sadly lived under the thumb of a controlling narcissistic little man. Thou I recall her standing up to him on a few occasions. But she wasn't allowed to engage in any activities my G-hadn't approved. 

Sadly he lived too long, and she shortly lost her independence not too long after. But she really came alive once her controlling and low key abusive (toward everyone, children included) through and through racist-classist rural husband died, as sad as that is to say. 

At least his familial name will die with me."
Find Yourself,Yeah I was in my thirties when it aired and I didnt understand why everyone wasn't on Skylar's side at first.
